0,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"February 05, 2007","['Today, the Senate takes the first step in a bipartisan effort to prevent the escalation of the war in Iraq - and to adopt a new strategy for leaving Iraq without leaving chaos behind.', ""That first step is to debate and vote on the resolution offered by Senator Warner, and re-introduced by Senator Levin and me as a bill, that says that the Senate disagrees with the President's plan to send 17,500 more American troops into the middle of a civil war in Baghdad."", ""The question before us today is whether a minority of Senators will even allow the debate to start. That's what we are about to vote on."", 'To my colleagues who are thinking about trying to block debate, let me say this: Iraq dominates our national life. It is on the minds of tens of millions of Americans. It shapes the lives of hundreds of thousands of our men and women in uniform and their families.', ""That the Senate would not even debate, much less vote on, the single most urgent issue of our time, would be a total forfeiture of our responsibility. We have a duty to debate and vote on the President's plan. We have a duty to debate and vote on our overall strategy in Iraq. And we have the duty as United States Senators to demonstrate the courage of our convictions."", ""Three weeks ago, Secretary of State Rice presented the President's plan for Iraq to the Foreign Relations Committee. Its main feature is to send more American troops into Baghdad, in the middle of a sectarian war. The reaction on the Committee, from Republicans and Democrats alike, ranged from skepticism to profound skepticism to outright opposition. And that pretty much reflects the reaction all across the country."", 'Senator Hagel, Senator Levin, Senator Snowe and I wrote a resolution to give Senators a way to vote what their voices were saying. We believe that the quickest, most effective way to get the President to change course is to demonstrate to him that his policy has little or no support across the board.', ""After we introduced our resolution, Senator Warner came forward with his. The bottom line of our resolutions is the same: Mr. President, don't send more Americans into the middle of civil war."", ""There was one critical difference. As originally written, Senator Warner's resolution left open the possibility of increasing the overall number of American troops in Iraq. We believed that would send the wrong message."", ""We should be drawing down, not ramping up, and redeploying our forces that remain in Iraq. That's the best way to make it clear to the Iraqi leaders that they must begin to make the hard compromises necessary for the political solution virtually everyone agrees is necessary. We approached Senator Warner to work out the differences. I am very pleased to say that we succeeded in doing just that."", 'The language Senator Warner removed from his resolution removed the possibility that it could be read as calling for more U.S. troops in Iraq. With that change, we agreed to support his resolution.', ""When I first spoke out against the President's planned surge before the New Year, I made it clear that I hoped to build and demonstrate bi-partisan opposition to his plan because that was the fastest way to turn him around. And that is exactly what we have done."", ""Now, we have a real opportunity for the Senate to speak clearly. Every Senator should be given a chance to vote whether he or she approves or disapproves with the President's plan to send more troops into the middle of a civil war. The debate we will have is as important as the vote. I hope the American people listen carefully."", ""I predict they will hear very few of our colleagues stand up and support the President's plan to send more troops into the middle of a civil war. Listen to the voices - as well as the votes."", 'Just as important as what we are voting against, is what we are voting for.', 'This bill, like the Biden-Hagel-Levin-Snowe bill makes three things clear.', 'As I said at the outset, this is a first step. But it can set the foundation for everything that follows. If the President does not listen to the majority of Congress and the majority of the American people, we will look at other ways to turn the surge around.', ""Even if we succeed in that effort, we still need to turn our overall Iraq policy around. We need a strategy that can produce a political settlement in Iraq. That's the only way to stop Shiites and Sunnis from killing each other and to allow our troops to leave Iraq without trading a dictator for chaos."", ""I have proposed just such a strategy, and I'll have more to say about it in the days ahead."", 'But for today, my message is simple: the American people want us to debate Iraq, the most important issue of our day. They expect it. They demand it. If we try to hide behind procedure and delaying tactics, the American people will hold us accountable. They get it.', 'The question is: do we?', ""Are we for or against the President's plan to escalate the war in Iraq? I am against it and I believe the majority of my colleagues are as well.""]",1
1,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"February 15, 2007","['This is a time of tremendous challenge for America in the world.', 'We must contend with the on-going war in Afghanistan, the genocide in Darfur, nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, the rise of China and re-emergence Russia, the growing insecurity of our energy supply, the fragility of our climate, and the threat posed by radical fundamentalism.', 'But one issue dominates our national debate: Iraq.', 'If we deal with it successfully, we can recover the freedom, flexibility and credibility to meet these other challenges.', 'Thats what I want to talk about today.', '* * *', 'Listen to the debate about Iraq here in Washington. It centers on a false choice that is also a bad choice: Do we continue on President Bushs failing course and hand off Iraq to the next President? Or do we just leave and hope for the best?', 'I believe there is a better choice. It is still possible to bring our troops home without trading a dictator for chaos that engulfs Iraq and spreads to the Middle East.', 'That must be our goal.', '* * *', 'Leaving Iraq is necessary -- but it is not a plan. We also need a plan for what we leave behind.', 'Nine months ago, with Les Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations, I proposed just such a plan. Go to planforiraq.com. to read its details.', 'Our plan recognizes that there is no purely military exit strategy from Iraq. Instead, we set out a roadmap to a political settlement in Iraq -- one that gives its warring factions a way to share power peacefully and offers us a chance to leave with our interests intact.', 'The plan has five major pieces.', 'First, maintain a unified Iraq by decentralizing it and giving Kurds, Shiites and Sunnis breathing room in regions as the Iraqi constitution provides. The central government would be responsible for common concerns, like guarding Iraqs borders and distributing its oil revenues.', 'Second, secure support from the Sunnis who have no oil by guaranteeing them a fair share of oil revenues. Allow former Baath party members to go back to work and reintegrate Sunnis with no blood on their hands.', 'Third, increase economic assistance to Iraq and its regions. Insist that the oil-rich Gulf states put up most of the money, tie it to the protection of minority rights, and create a major jobs program to deny the militia new recruits.', 'Fourth, initiate a major diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of Iraqs neighbors. Create an oversight group of the U.N. and the major powers to enforce their commitments. These countries have a profound stake in preventing chaos in Iraq and the credibility we lack to press for compromise by all Iraqis. If a political settlement fails to take hold, these same countries are vital to any strategy to contain the fall out within Iraq.', 'Fifth, instruct the military to draw up plans for withdrawing U.S. combat forces from Iraq by 2008. Leave behind a small force to take on terrorists and train Iraqis. The best way to focus Iraqs leaders on the political compromises they must make is to make it clear to them that we are leaving.', '* * *', 'Many of you have heard me talk about this plan before.', 'Whats new is the growing support its receiving.', 'That support was evident during the four weeks of hearings we just held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.', 'It is evident in the new National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq a consensus report of all U.S. intelligence agencies.', 'The NIE and virtually all of our witnesses agreed that the fundamental problem in Iraq is self-sustaining sectarian violence.', 'Yes, jihadists, Baathists, criminal gangs and intra-sect violence all contribute to the growing chaos. But Sunnis killing Shiites and Shiites killing Sunnis is the heart of the matter. Thats what we have to stop if we want to leave Iraq with our interests intact.', 'How do we stop this sectarian cycle of revenge?', 'If history is any guide, we have to wait until one side wins or both sides exhaust themselves. That could take years of bloodletting... years that we do not have.', 'History also suggests it is possible to short circuit sectarian strife.', 'A decade ago, Bosnia was being torn apart by ethnic cleansing, which threatened to engulf the Balkans. The United States stepped in with Dayton Accords, which kept the country whole by, paradoxically, dividing it into ethnic federations. Muslims, Croats and Serbs retained separate armies and presidents. Since then, Bosnians have lived a decade in peace. Now, they are slowly coming back together.', 'Iraq presents a similar possibility. Heres what the National Intelligence Estimate says we need:', 'Broader Sunni acceptance of the current political structure and federalism [and] significant concessions by Shia and Kurds to create space for Sunni acceptance of federalism.', 'That is exactly the strategy behind the Biden-Gelb plan.', 'During our hearings, witness after witness including former secretaries of states, foreign policy experts, and elected officials -- came to a similar conclusion. So have a growing number of opinion makers.', 'What more and more people are beginning to recognize is that there are very few possible futures for Iraq in the near term and only one that protects Americas interests.', '* * *', 'Think for a minute about Iraqs possible futures.', 'The Bush administration has one vision: that Iraqis will rally behind a strong, democratic central government that keeps the country together and protects the rights of all citizens equally.', 'But since the Samarra Mosque bombing a year ago, that vision has been engulfed by the flames of sectarian hatred.', 'The hard truth in Iraq is that there is no trust within the central government no trust of the government by the people and no capacity by the government to deliver services and security. And there is no evidence none that we can build that trust and capacity any time soon.', 'There are two other ways to govern Iraq from the center:', 'A foreign occupation that the United States cannot long sustain. Or the return of a strongman, who is not on the horizon. Even if he were, replacing one dictator with another would require a savagery to rival Saddams worst excesses.', 'So where does that leave us?', 'It leaves us with an idea a large majority of Iraqis have already endorsed in their constitution and that our plan would help make a reality: federalism.', 'Federalism would keep Iraq together by vesting real power in the regions.', 'It would bring decisions and responsibility down to the local level and give Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds control over the fabric of their daily lives: security, education, marriage, jobs.', 'Very few have read Iraqs constitution. Fewer still understand that legislation to implement its articles on federalism takes effect in 15 months.', 'Federalism is Iraqs best possible future.', 'But unless we help make federalism work for all Iraqis, the violence will not stop.', 'We have to convince the major powers and Iraqs neighbors that a federal Iraq is the best possible outcome for them, too, and to put their weight and influence behind it. Then, together, we have to bring in the Sunnis and convince the Shiites and Kurds to make concessions.', 'That is what the Biden-Gelb plan proposes. It demands the kind of sustained, hard headed diplomacy for which this administration has shown little interest or aptitude. But it offers the possibility not the guarantee of producing a soft landing in Iraq.', 'If we fail to make federalism work, there will be no political accommodation at the center. Violent resistance will increase. The sectarian cycle of revenge will spiral out of control. At best, the result likely will be the violent break up of Iraq into multiple failed states. At worst, the result will be Iraqs total fragmentation into warring fiefdoms.', 'The neighbors will not sit on the sidelines. Already, Iraq has aggravated a deep Sunni-Shiite divide that runs from Lebanon through Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. This fault-line intersects with other cultural and political rifts between Arabs and Persians, Turks and Kurds, jihadis and the Muslim mainstream to create the conditions for a cataclysmic explosion.', 'Iran and the Arab states will back Shia and Sunni extremists as part of a proxy war. Eventually, they will intervene directly. Sunni Jihadis will flood Iraq to confront the Persian and Shia threat, creating a new haven for terrorists. Turkey will move into the North to crush Kurdish ambitions. Sunni-Shia tensions will rise from Beirut to Karachi.', 'Individually, these would be bad developments. Together, they would do terrible damage to American interests. We must lead a determined regional and international effort to end the Iraqi civil war, or contain it if we cant.', '* * *', 'The Bush administration is heading in exactly the wrong direction.', 'Instead of a diplomatic and political offensive to forge a political settlement, it proposes a military offensive that would send 17,500 Americans into the middle of a sectarian conflict in a city of 6.2 million people.', 'This military surge in Iraq is not a solution it is a tragic mistake.', 'If we should be surging forces anywhere, it is in Afghanistan.', 'Im glad the President has recognized what many of us have been saying for years: unless we surge troops, hardware, money, and high-level attention into Afghanistan, it will fall back into the hands of the Taliban, terrorists and drug traffickers. I support the steps he announced today but I hope they are the first steps not the last in a recommitment to Afghanistan.', '* * *', 'The House is about to pronounce itself on the Presidents surge plan for Iraq and the Senate will, too.', 'Some minimize the significance of a non-binding resolution. If it is so meaningless, why did the White House and the Presidents political supporters mobilize so much energy against it?', 'Opposing the surge is only a first step. We need a radical change in course in Iraq. If the President wont act, Congress will.', 'But Congress must act responsibly. We must resist the temptation to push for changes that sound good but produce bad results.', 'The best next step is to revisit the authorization Congress granted the President in 2002 to use force in Iraq. Thats exactly what Im doing.', 'We gave the President that power to destroy Iraqs weapons of mass destruction and, if necessary, to depose Saddam Hussein.', 'The WMD were not there. Saddam Hussein is no longer there. The 2002 authorization is no longer relevant to the situation in Iraq.', 'I am working on legislation to repeal that authorization and replace it with a much narrower mission statement for our troops in Iraq.', 'Congress should make clear what the mission of our troops is: to responsibly draw down, while continuing to combat terrorists, train Iraqis and respond to emergencies. We should make equally clear what their mission is not: to stay in Iraq indefinitely and get mired in a savage civil war.', 'Coupled with the Biden-Gelb plan, I believe this is the most effective way to start bringing our troops home without leaving a mess behind.', '* * *', 'I want to leave you with one thought.', 'For our sake and for the sake of the Iraqi people, we should be focused on how we get out of Iraq with our interests intact.', 'Everyone wants to bring our troops home as soon and as safely as possible. But tempting as it is, we cant just throw up our hands, blame the President for misusing the authority we gave him, and walk away without a plan for what we leave behind.', 'So Ill end where I began.', 'Leaving Iraq is a necessity, but it is not a plan. We need a plan for what we leave behind. That is what I have offered.', 'To those who disagree with my plan, I have one simple question: what is your alternative?']",1
2,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"March 08, 2007","['Success in Afghanistan is Still Possible if We Surge Forces Anywhere, it Should be in Afghanistan, not Iraq.', 'Today we face an issue at the very heart of our war on terror: the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. If current trends continue, we may soon find that our hard-won success on the battlefield has melted away.', 'I didnt write these words in preparation for this mornings hearing. I spoke them nearly five years ago, on the floor of the United States Senate. [May 17, 2002]', 'Im not bringing up old quotes to say, I told you so, but to make a simple point: the situation in Afghanistan is not an unforeseen circumstance. Plenty of military and civilian officials have been predicting exactly this outcome for years.', 'Whats the state of play? Osama bin Laden remains at large, right across the border in Pakistan in all probability. There are reports that hes reconstituted his terrorist training camps. Given the chance to kill him at Tora Bora, the administration instead pulled most of our Special Forces, our CIA teams and Predators and sent them to Iraq.', 'The Taliban is back -- and keeping much of Afghanistan ungovernable. Suicide bombings, IEDs and other techniques imported from Iraq made last year the bloodiest since their ouster.', 'The government of Pakistan turns a blind eye to the Taliban cross-border attacks, and to the high command based in Quetta. Just last year, the government signed a separate peace with pro-Taliban militias in Waziristan.', ""Afghan reconstruction is stuck in first gear. President Bush promised a Marshall Plan, but he's delivered less development aid in the past five years than we spend on the war in Iraq every three weeks."", 'Last year Afghanistan produced 92% of the worlds opium. The proceeds prop up the Taliban, warlords and corrupt officials. Theres no serious counter-narcotics program. If the Administration pursues a poorly-conceived aerial poppy eradication plan, the results could be even worse.', 'Dont get me wrongweve accomplished some great things. Because of our efforts, millions of Afghan children are in school today. Weve built roads and clinics. Weve got American troops in Provincial Reconstruction Teams showing that the US military can be a wonderful friend as well as a fearsome enemy.', 'President Bush last month made two encouraging statements. First, he announced the deployment of an additional combat brigade to Afghanistan. This is important, because our NATO commanders desperately need not only several thousand battle-ready troops, but the helicopters, transport aircraft, and other military hardware that go with them. Second, he pledged $11.8 billion in new funding over the next two years. If these figures represent new funding in addition to currently-budgeted numbers, and if we focus on projects which bring real improvement to the lives of ordinary Afghansthis may be the start of a more successful strategy.', 'I certainly hope so. Because in Afghanistan, success still is possible. Failure is not thinkable. How can we turn things around? Very briefly, we need to do three things:', 'First, establish security. If we should be surging forces anywhere, its in Afghanistan, not Iraq. NATO troops are necessary, but not sufficient. Weve also got to train the Afghan police and armywhich means, for starters, paying them decent salaries.', 'Second, we have get moving on reconstruction. We need more funds, and we need to use them better. The Afghans are patient, but theyre not seeing reconstruction worthy of a superpower. As Gen. Eikenberry has said, Where the road ends, the Taliban begins.', 'Third, do counter-narcotics right. We should target multimillion-dollar drug kingpins, not the dollar-a-day opium farmers. Someday aerial eradication may have a placebut not until weve got alternate livelihoods set up for those growing poppy, and a judicial system capable of taking down the drug barons. Until then, we should focus on the top of the food-chain, not the bottom.', 'We have three witnesses today who can explain these issues in detail, with authority and expertise. First, we have Richard Boucher the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia. We all know and respect him as a straight shooter.', 'Next we have Gen. James Jones who recently retired from the U.S. Marine Corps. Gen. Jones was the commander of NATO until early this year, and he supervised the Alliances expansion to include responsibility for all of Afghanistan. And then we have Ambassador James Dobbins, currently at the RAND Corporation, who has served as Special Envoy for Afghanistan. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, he served as liaison to the Afghan forces fighting alongside our troops to bring down the Taliban. Gentlemen welcome and Ill now turn it over to Sen. Lugar for his opening statement.']",1

Biden          ,"April 03, 2007","['Since before our founding, the United States has been set apart by its uncompromising commitment to the rule of law and individual rights and civil liberties.', 'The values embodied in our constitutional government have been the pole star by which the world has set its moral compass.', 'They have given us the moral authority to lead our allies, and to defeat fascism and communism.', 'In the aftermath of September 11, as the world mourned with us, we had an opportunity to lead again.', 'The world looked to us to form a new coalition to face the threat of international terrorism and defend the very values the terrorists had attacked.', 'Regrettably, the Bush Administration saw it differently.', 'The President accepted a Faustian bargain. He abandoned our uncompromising commitment to the rule of law and individual rights in the belief that it was the only way to secure the United States against the threat of terrorism.', 'My firm belief and absolute conviction is that this Faustian bargain has had the ironic effect of making us less safe, not more safe; emboldened terrorists, not dissuaded them, and diminished us in the eyes of our friends and allies.', 'As I said on September 11the terrorists win when we abandon our civil liberties.', 'We need not change our national character in order to defeat terrorism. As a matter of fact, we are already defeated by the terrorists if we change our character.', ""As a young Senator in 1977, I remember hearing Richard Nixon, who had resigned in disgrace less than three years earlier, comment on the President's duty to obey the law. He said: When the President does it that means that it is not illegal."", 'His statement was breathtaking in its disregard for the rule of law and our constitutional system of checks and balances, but I was convinced that this was the only time in my life I would hear a President defend his actions on the grounds that he was above the law.', '30 years later, here I am once again with a President claiming that because its a time of war our laws and traditions do not apply to him.', 'I will address today five aspects of his policy that subvert our constitutional principles and make us less safe at home and weaker abroad: the acceptance of what amounts to torture, the practice of extraordinary rendition, the operation of secret prisons, the unwarranted surveillance of Americans, and the revocation of habeas corpus.', 'I will argue that by redefining what constitutes torture, redefining international treaty obligations, and operating secret prisons, he has squandered the support of the world and the opportunity to lead it.', 'And here at home the overly broad definition of inherent Presidential power in the time of war has undermined the basic civil liberties of American citizens.', 'Torture', 'Historically, the United States has advocated outlawing torture. We played a central role in drafting the Geneva Conventions and negotiating the Convention Against Torture. And we have enacted domestic laws to severely punish those who torture.', 'And with good reason beyond the obvious morale imperative.', 'Our efforts to outlaw torture were designed to protect the hundreds of thousands of Americans soldiers overseas by giving us the moral authority to demand that those who are captured be treated humanely.', 'After September 11, the President, for all intent and purpose, abandoned our historical opposition to torture. The sophistry engaged in by the Justice Department allowed his Administration to establish two new pillars of a policy regarding torture.', 'The first narrowed the definition of torture to conduct that causes serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.', 'It created a wide class of permissible mistreatment that though [it] might constitute cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment . . . failed to rise to the level of torture.', 'The second exempted the President, as Commander-in-Chief, from these laws and allowed him to use torture, even though illegal, if he deems it necessary.', 'Emboldened by this analysis, the President allowed his Administration to engage in practices that the rest of the world regarded as torture but he had defined as permissible.', 'A solider who recently served in Afghanistan and Iraq sent the following statement to a Senator: Some argue that since our actions are not as horrifying as Al Qaedas, we should not be concerned. When did Al Qaeda become any type of standard by which we measure the morality of the United States?', 'We are America, and our actions should be held to a higher standard. . . . I would rather die fighting than give up even the smallest part of the idea that is America.', ""The President's policy has damaged Americas image, alienated some of our closest partners, and given significant ammunition to the most extreme terrorists to attract new recruits."", ""The President's policy has also led to inexcusable blunders."", 'The Administration used information obtained from detained Al Qaeda members, who under coercion, asserted that Iraq had trained Al Qaeda operatives to make and use weapons of mass destruction.', 'He cited this information repeatedly to justify taking us to war in Iraq. This information, like almost all information that was coerced, was false. The source told his interrogators what they wanted to hear to stop the coercion.', ""And as I said earlier, the President's policy has provided fodder to Al Qaedas propagandists and recruiters, who have broadcast images of the atrocities at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib around the world. Imagine if an American soldier were captured by Al Qaeda."", 'Now --- what moral authority do we have now to demand that they treat our soldiers humanely?', 'Its time for us to stop this behavior and comply with our international treaty obligations.', 'I call upon the President today to comply with our domestic law and our international treaty obligations. Mr. President, the American people and the world have had enough of the equivocations and loop holes on this subject. It is time for you to state clearly that we will abide by our international obligations and our policy will reflect our national values.', 'Extraordinary Rendition', 'A policy of kidnapping a suspect and transporting him to a country that we know to use torture or secret site for interrogation is a practice called extraordinary rendition and historically been an anathema to our national values.', 'And although there is a place in the war on terror for rendition to justice, where a suspect is sent to another country to face trial, the use of extraordinary rendition, or rendition to a country that we know uses torture, is out of bounds and counterproductive.', 'As one expert noted, [e]very country to which the United States has rendered a terrorism suspect since 9/11 has been [recognized by the State Department as] a persistent and egregious violator of human rights.', 'To add insult to injury, the President has claimed that his authority as Commander-in-Chief includes the power to order extraordinary rendition and that such an order is not subject to review by our courts or oversight by Congress.', ""The President's abuse of rendition has diminished our moral stature and sapped popular support for the United States around the world, making it difficult to get from foreign partners the cooperation and intelligence we need to effectively fight terrorism."", 'Shortly after Italy indicted 25 CIA agents for a 2003 rendition, Italian citizens took to the streets to protest the expansion of an American military base.', 'A Canadian Government commission censured the United States and Canada has been reticent to share intelligence with us ever since.

The President only disclosed the existence of the black site program after the press broke the story.', 'As the existence of these black sites, and the techniques used in them have become known, they have become one of Al Qaedas most effective recruiting tools.', 'According to unclassified reporting on last years National Intelligence Estimate, the abuses that occur at these secret prisons and at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay have stoked the jihad movement.', 'Mr. President, the American people are tired of half-truths. Close the black sites that are a black stain on the name of America, and close Guantanamo and bulldoze Abu Ghraib to the ground.', 'Warrantless Wiretapping & National Security Letters', ""The President's misguided policy of attempting to protect America by violating our fundamental notions of constitutional governance and individual rights and liberties has not been confined to actions abroad."", 'The President has also engaged in such practices here at home, including his notorious warrantless wiretapping program and his abuse of authority under the Patriot Act.', 'He has secretly eavesdropped on Americans without Congressional authorization or a judicial approval. We fought the American Revolution in part to free ourselves of intrusions on our privacy without probably cause.', 'The Fourth Amendment guarantees freedom from unreasonable government searches and seizures and permits a judge to issue a warrant only after finding probable cause.', 'It stands as a bulwark against arbitrary government invasions of our privacy, and the President is bound by it even as we fight terrorism.', 'President Bush appears to have no patience for the Fourth Amendment and a caviler of Americans rights and liberties.', 'We wont defeat terrorism by destroying the Bill of Rights.', 'In 1928 Justice Brandeis warned that other instruments of executive power were but puny instruments of tyranny and oppression when compared with wire tapping. Justice Holmes described wiretapping as a dirty business. They were prescient.', 'In 1976, a Senate Committee chaired by Frank Church uncovered shocking civil liberties abuses that had occurred during decades of extra-legal surveillance.', 'To ensure that this would never happen again, the Church Committee recommended reforms. In 1978, as a member of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, I helped fashion the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which enacted many of the Committees recommendations. Ninety-four colleagues from both sides of the aisle voted to pass FISA.', 'FISA ensured that the President retained the necessary tools to protect national security and collect foreign intelligence without violating Americans civil liberties. In other words, we created a framework for protecting national security and Americans privacy.', 'FISA established a court that could examine classified evidence and issue wiretap orders. We tailored the standard for FISA wiretaps to the national security threat. Instead of showing probable cause, FISA required the government to show that the subject of the warrant was a suspected terrorist or spy.', 'To ensure national security, we included exceptions: one allows the President to wiretap a terrorist suspect in an emergency prior to obtaining a warrant, as long as he obtains a warrant within', '72 hours, and a second suspends the warrant requirement for 15 days after a Congressional declaration of war.', 'We also took pains to make clear FISA was the exclusive means by which the President could conduct national security surveillance; FISA unambiguously prohibits all such surveillance not authorized by statute.', 'I have argued from the beginning that the President could conduct surveillance of suspected terrorists while complying with FISA.', 'He has chosen instead to ignore FISAs clear prohibition on warrantless surveillance, arguing that he has inherent constitutional authority to conduct surveillance for national security purposes.', 'By so doing, he has knowingly and willfully violated the law and Americans privacy, offering the same arrogant justification as President Nixon that he is above the law.', 'It was only after the Democratic Party regained control of Congress that the Administration reluctantly subjected its surveillance program to FISA court review.', ""Through strong congressional oversight, we need to ensure that the FISA court retains jurisdiction over all the President's surveillance programs. And folks, a clear lesson can be drawn from this elections matter!"", 'The President has also abused the authority Congress gave him under the PATRIOT Act to issue National Security Letters. FBI officials issue these letters without judicial review to demand sensitive financial, credit, phone, and Internet records. Last month, a Congressionally mandated audit revealed that the FBI has made frequent errors in its use of National Security Letters, sometimes getting information about the wrong people and sometimes getting information its not entitled to under the statute.', 'A Biden administration would fight terrorism without destroying the very values were fighting to preserve. I would require a United States Attorney to approve the use of National Security Letters, to ensure that the government gets the information it needs without sacrificing our privacy.', 'Depriving Terror Detainees of Habeas Corpus', 'Continuing with his assault on individual rights and liberties in the name of national security, the President has also deprived terrorism detainees of the most cherished right in our constitutional system habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is a Latin term, meaning to render the body.', 'It was conceived to prevent someone from being locked up erroneously or illegally, with no chance to contest his imprisonment. But lets be clear: It is not a get out of jail free card. And it will not result in the release of dangerous terrorists.', 'Habeas corpus is a judicial safeguard that predates our constitutional democracy.', 'It was among British subjects chief demands of King John on the field at Runnymede in 1215, as reflected in the Magna Carta. Alexander Hamilton described habeas corpus in the Federalist Papers as among the greatest securities to liberty and republicanism that the Constitution contains.', 'While the Framers relegated most individual rights to subsequent amendments in the Bill of Rights, they included habeas corpus in the body of the Constitution itself.', 'In a war where many of our detainees were not captured on a battlefield by U.S. forces and were not wearing military uniforms, habeas corpus is an indispensable safeguard against erroneous detention.', 'But perhaps most importantly, habeas corpus ensures that if the United States detains someone, it does so with full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.', 'The President has nonetheless stripped detainees of this fundamental safeguard.', 'His efforts to deprive detainees of habeas have been repudiated three times by a Supreme Court dominated by Republican nominees.

4,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"April 29, 2007","['RUSSERT: Welcome, Senator Biden, to our Meet the Candidates series.', 'BIDEN: Good to be back.', 'RUSSERT: Let me start with the vote in the Senate on Thursday. And here\'s how it was reported: ""The Senate approved $124 billion Iraq war spending bill that would force troop withdrawals to begin as early as July 1.', '""The 51-to-46 vote was a triumph for Democrats, who just weeks ago worried about the political wisdom of a veto showdown with the commander in chief as troops fight on the battlefield. But Democrats are hesitant no more.""', 'Why did you vote for a bill that had a timetable for withdrawal?', 'BIDEN: That language is actually the language that I–that Carl Levin and I drafted, which said that, ""Mr. President, you got to start moving combat troops out of harm\'s way now."" The whole function of this is to try to get this president to change his strategy. He operates on the premise that, if we put enough troops in the middle of a civil war, we can give breeding room to a group of people in Baghdad to get together and form a strong central government that\'s a democracy. That will not happen in your lifetime or mine. I said that four years ago; I say it now. The only rational purpose for troops in Iraq now: train Iraqis, prevent al-Qaeda from occupying large chunks of territory. and we should begin to decentralize the government. That\'s the underlying essence of what the language in this bill is about. It says, though, start now to redeploy and have as a target to get out by April 1st the bulk of the combat troops. I strongly subscribe to that view.', ""RUSSERT: When you were here in January, I asked you about some of these steps, and this is how you responded. Let's watch."", '(Videotape, January 7, 2007)', 'SEN. BIDEN: I think it is unconstitutional to say we\'re going to tell you, ""You can go, but we\'re going to micromanage the war."" When we wrote the Constitution, the intention was to give the commander in chief the authority how to use the forces when you authorize him to be able to use the forces.', '(End videotape)', ""RUSSERT: Aren't you now micromanaging?"", 'BIDEN: Not at all. Did you hear what I said? I said ""how to use the forces."" We have authority to tell him how to use the forces. If you get in there, though, and once you tell him–we have, we have a responsibility to tell him what the mission is. He does not have the authority to engage in a mission of the use of our force in a country or out of a country that we do not authorize. And that\'s the thrust of what we\'re trying to do here. We\'re trying to fundamentally change what this president is using our forces for. He\'s in the midst of a civil war with the objective of–a flawed objective of establishing a strong central government. That will not happen, and we have an obligation to push back as much and as often and as thoroughly as we can.', 'RUSSERT: But, senator, there has been an evolution in your thinking because this is what you said in–to the Brookings Institution in \'05. ""We can"" tell it–""We can call it quits and withdraw [from Iraq]. I think that would be a gigantic mistake. Or we can set a deadline for pulling out, which I fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out–equally a mistake."" You\'re now setting a deadline.', ""BIDEN: No, we're not setting a deadline. Read what it says. It says the target date, left up to the generals to determine whether or not it is appropriate to withdraw all forces."", 'RUSSERT: Well, a target date is setting a deadline.', ""BIDEN: No, no, but it leaves forces behind. We're trying to change the mission, Tim. The mission is all of us have been arguing one exception, in both parties, that you're going to have to leave forces behind in Iraq while this new government–if we actually get one up and running–is trying to function and trying to set up. The–look, the problem here is this is also a moving target. I also called for more troops in Iraq. I called for more troops on this program a couple years ago. That was in order to stop a civil war. Once the civil war began I was on the program after that saying all the troops in the world cannot settle a civil war. So what I'm having to respond to, like everyone else, is the president's initiatives and his failures that, that required difference circumstances and different answers at different times. But the fundamental principle's the same: We have an obligation to tell the president of the United States if we disagree with the mission for which he's using American forces. And the mission that he has us on is to settle a civil war through establishing a central democratic government in Baghdad. That mission is strategically flawed."", 'RUSSERT: But you no longer have a problem setting a date for withdrawal.', ""BIDEN: I no longer have a problem setting a target, a target that is flexible. There is no–there's nothing in it says that every troop has to be out on April the 1st."", 'RUSSERT: You said this back in October of \'02: ""We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after."" Do you believe we\'ll be in Iraq for a decade?', 'BIDEN: I said back then, before we went to war, I wrote a report saying the decade after, and everyone was talking about the day after. And the point I was making was, if you went in and used force, which he should not have done when he did it, that we were committing and signing on to a decade. That was the–that was the minimum requirement. I also pointed out we needed more troops. I also pointed out at that time we would not be greeted with open arms. I also pointed out at that time oil would not pay for this. It was a warning, a warning to the president. ""Mr. President, the objective of us giving you this authority is to get inspectors back in, bring the pressure of the world community–which remember, at the time, when we were sitting here talking about this, the–at that moment the issue was are we going to pull out of–are we going to lift sanctions on Iraq or are we going to put more sanctions on Iraq? That, that was the context in which that debate was taking place.', 'RUSSERT: So when some of your opponents in the Democratic primary say there will be no residual force left in Iraq?', ""BIDEN: They are mistaken. They are making a mistake that is not practical. I don't know how that can work."", 'RUSSERT: Senator Reid, the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Senator Feingold, the senator from Wisconsin, have joined together and introduced a bill, and here\'s the operative language: ""No funds appropriated or otherwise made available under any provision of law may be obligated or expended to continue the deployment in Iraq after March"" 31st, ""2008."" Do you support that?', 'BIDEN: No.', 'RUSSERT: Why?', ""BIDEN: For the reasons I just stated. I think it's–may–we may end–look, Tim, here's where we may end up. This president may so–make it so difficult to reach the objective, the only reasonable one I think's available, which is to leave Iraq, leaving behind a country secure within its own borders, not a threat to its neighbors, that is a loosely federated republic. It may get so bad that we do not have that option, and all of the option we have available to us is to withdraw and try to contain the civil war inside Iraq. We are not there yet. And until we reach that point, I am not prepared to say there are no circumstances under which, after a date certain, we would not have a single troop inside of Iraq."", 'RUSSERT: So you will not vote to cut off funding for the war, period.', ""BIDEN: No, that's not what I said. I just got finished telling you what I said, which was if, in fact, this president changes the circumstances again, where there lose all prospect of being able to achieve the goal that I've just set out, which I think could be achieved if we decentralize power in Iraq, if we have a limited federal government in Iraq, where we train the army, where they have control of the borders and their currency, where we give control over the fabric of the daily lives of the various warring factions–including their local police forces–their laws relating to marriage, divorce, the things they're killing each other over, if we get to the point where that is no longer an option and the place has totally disintegrated–which it may–that's a different circumstance. You can't–I don't know anyone who can say–I speak for myself. I cannot say for–with absolute certainty what I will do on every potential contingency because I have no control over this president's foreign policy and the direction he's taking us in Iraq."", 'RUSSERT: But as of today, you would not vote to cut off...', 'BIDEN: As of today, I would not vote to cut off all funding if the funding cutoff said there can be absolutely not a single solitary American force left anywhere within Iraq within a time certain.', 'RUSSERT: I want to go back to 2002, because it\'s important as to what people were saying then and what the American people were hearing. Here\'s Joe Biden about Saddam Hussein: ""He\'s a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security.""', '""We have no choice but to eliminate the threat. This is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world.""', '""He must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power."" You were emphatic about that.', ""BIDEN: That's right, and I was correct about that. He must be, in fact–and remember the weapons we were talking about. I also said on your show, that's part of what I said, but not all of what I meant. What I also said on your show at the time was that I did not think he had weaponized his material, but he did have. When, when the inspectors left after Saddam kicked them out, there was a cataloguing at the United Nations saying he had X tons of, X amount of, and they listed the various materials he had. The big issue, remember, on this show we talked about, was whether he had weaponized them. Remember you asked me about those flights that were taking place in southern Iraq, where–were they spraying anthrax? And, you know, what would happen? And, you know, so on and so forth. And I pointed out to you that they had not developed that capacity at all. But he did have these stockpiles everywhere."", 'RUSSERT: Where are they?', ""BIDEN: Well, the point is, it turned out they didn't, but everyone in the world thought he had them. The weapons inspectors said he had them. He catalogued–they catalogued them. This was not some, some Cheney, you know, pipe dream. This was, in fact, catalogued. They looked at them and catalogued. What he did with them, who knows? The real mystery is, if he, if he didn't have any of them left, why didn't he say so? Well, a lot of people say if he had said that, he would've, you know, emboldened Iran and so on and so forth."", 'But the point was, we were talking then about whether or not we could keep the pressure of the international community on Iraq to stay in the box we had them in. And remember, you had the French and others say the reason all those children were dying in Iraq, the reason why hospitals didn\'t have equipment is because of what we, the United States, were doing, imposing on Iraq these sanctions. And that was the battle. The battle was do we lift these sanctions or do we in fact increase the sanctions? And everyone at the time was talking about–from the secretary of state to even the president–that this was to demonstrate to the world the president of the United States had the full faith and credit of the United States Congress behind him to put pressure on the rest of the world to say, ""Hey, look, you lift the sanctions, you\'re–we\'re going to be on our own here. Don\'t lift the sanctions. Get the inspectors back in."" That was the context of the debate, to be fair about it.', ""RUSSERT: But when you read the national intelligence estimate, which has now been released, there're a lot of caveats put on the level of intelligence about the aluminum tubes and..."", 'BIDEN: Absolutely.', 'RUSSERT: General Zinni, who\'s been on this program a few weeks ago, said that when he heard the discussion about the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam had, he said, ""I\'ve never heard that"" in any of the briefings he had as head of the Central Command. How could you as a U.S. senator be so wrong?', ""BIDEN: I, I wasn't wrong. I was on your show when you asked me about aluminum tubes, and I said they're for artillery. I don't believe they're for cascading."", 'RUSSERT: But you said Saddam was a threat. He had to be...', 'BIDEN: He was a threat.', 'RUSSERT: In what way?', 'BIDEN: The threat he presented was that, if Saddam was left unfettered, which I said during that period, for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers, then I believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon–not by building it, by purchasing it. I also believed he was a threat in that he was–every single solitary U.N. resolution which he agreed to abide by, which was the equivalent of a peace agreement at the United Nations, after he got out of–after we kicked him out of Kuwait, he was violating. Now, the rules of the road either mean something or they don\'t. The international community says ""We\'re going to enforce the sanctions we placed"" or not. And what was the international community doing? The international community was weakening. They were pulling away. They were saying, ""Well, wait a minute. Maybe he\'s not so bad. Maybe we should lift the no-fly zone. Maybe we should lift the sanctions."" That was the context.', ""And on your show, you had that one Sunday the vice president of the United States saying he's reconstituted his nuclear weapons. I was on a simultaneous program, they asked me the question. I said either the president–either the vice president's not telling the truth or he did not get the same briefing I have or he fully misunderstands what he was told. So I did not believe he had weaponized his materials. But he did have material that, in fact, could theoretically be weaponized. And to let it sit there at the time, I wanted the inspectors back in to force him that position of having to give it up."", 'RUSSERT: You were asked on this program a few months after the invasion of May of \'03 about your vote. And you said, ""There was sufficient evidence to go into Iraq."" And then in \'04 you said–a year and a half ago–""I voted to give the president the authority to use force in Iraq. I still believe my vote was just."" Then you went to Iowa in \'07, running for president and said, ""It was a mistake. I regret my vote.""', ""BIDEN: That's unfair. I said that on your program it was a mistake between, and you make it sound like I went to Iowa and all of a sudden I had people out there saying Biden is..."", 'RUSSERT: Well, there was a change in your thinking from, from being...', 'BIDEN: No...', 'RUSSERT: ...a just vote to saying it was a mistake.', ""BIDEN: Yeah, because I learned more, like everybody else learned, about what, in fact, we were told. Even the stuff we were told, the parts that I believed about what was going on with Saddam. We were told at the time, remember, that all these Iraqi generals were ready to, you know, to step up and take on Saddam, that we had–it was implied that we had this ability to go–to do a lot of things we didn't do. We had commitments at the time from the president that he would not move without the international community with us. There were a whole lot of things that changed, a whole lot of things that changed."", ""The thing that I regret, and I'll say it again, and I said it way before '07 and going to Iowa, is that I regret having had the–believed that this administration had any competence. It is the most incompetent administration I've ever–if I'd known they were going to misuse the authority we gave them the way they did, if I'd known that they were going to, once they used it, be so incompetent in the using of it, I would have never ever, ever given them the authority. If I were president, would I have asked for the authority? I would have asked for the authority in order to demonstrate to the world that they better not be lifting sanctions, they better not be putting pressure on having no-fly zones, and they better join with us in putting the screws onto Saddam by screwing down the sanctions on Saddam as opposed to lifting the sanctions. That's what the debate was about at the time."", 'And the other thing people forget, Tim, is everybody said, ""Well, how could you not know that?"" Almost every major editorial board in the country reached the same conclusion that we reached about the value of keeping the sanctions on Saddam and the need to show the world this pressure was available. And why did they think it? They thought it because he had acted relatively reasonable with regard to Afghanistan. The president had acted rationally with regard to Afghanistan, and on your show–I remember being on your show at the end of that year–and the question was, ""Has the president become an internationalist?"" Remember that? Remember that whole–those, those discussions? So the idea that everybody should have known that they were going to be as irresponsible in the use of the authority, that they were going to overrule what, what Powell was getting done at the United Nations, that they had inspectors back in and then they were going to dis the inspectors like the vice president and president did, maybe I should have anticipated that. But most people didn\'t anticipate it, and I\'m–and that\'s my mistake.', 'RUSSERT: Should you have gone or sought out people who had a dissenting view on the level of weapons of mass destruction?', ""BIDEN: Oh, I did. I did. And when I was chairman of the committee–I, I can't tell you the details–but I called every intelligence agency before the Foreign Relations Committee, had them all sit there at once. And it was on the aluminium tubes. And I pointed out to all my colleagues who came that there was vast disagreement among the intelligence community. I also said, you remember after this period, that I believed that the one part of George Tenet that I've heard about his book that I believe is right is that the–it wasn't the administration got all bad intelligence; they misused, deliberately misused the intelligence they had. They only told you the down side. They did not tell you the doubt that existed within the intelligence community. I met with General Zinni, I met with all our major commanders at the time, and they were split about whether or not what he had. But by and large, I don't think any of them really believed that somehow he had a nuclear weapon in the waiting. Nobody believed that."", 'RUSSERT: But despite the doubts you heard, you voted for the war.', 'BIDEN: I–despite the doubts I heard, I voted to give the president the authority to avoid a war. Look, Tim, he also had–there was no question in the mind–remember we were, we were on this show, Dick Lugar and I. We had the Biden/Lugar authorization through–of the president, which was much more constrained–much more constrained than the authority he actually got. But–and what, what happened? What happened was, I didn\'t know Dick Gephardt and Joe Lieberman were separately negotiating with the president until I got a call on a Monday night from Dick Lugar saying, ""Look, we\'re going to lose our, our, our amendment, which is much more constrictive on the president because there\'s been a separate deal being cut."" He had 55 votes no matter what.', 'RUSSERT: But make no mistake about it, the bill that you voted for authorized the president to go to war.', 'BIDEN: It allowed the president to go to war. It did not authorize him to go to it. You make it sound like it said, ""Mr. President, go to war."" It said, ""Mr. President, don\'t go to war."" It said ""go to the United Nations. Mr. President, don\'t go to war, try to get a deal here. Mr. President, get the inspectors back in. Mr. President, tell us that that\'s what you\'re about to do. And, Mr. President, if all else fails, you have authority to use force."" That\'s what it said.', ""RUSSERT: Do you believe we're safer now that Saddam is gone?"", 'BIDEN: I believe we are less safe as a nation now because what has happened is the conduct of this war has so badly damaged our readiness; the conduct of this war, and the, and, and, and the blood and resources we\'ve had to expend, it has limited our credibility around the world and limited our flexibility in terms of the use of force. Here we are, we could end the carnage in Darfur tomorrow, but why aren\'t we doing it? In part we\'re not doing it because we are so tied down. We could fundamentally change the dynamic in Afghanistan. Why aren\'t we doing it? Because we are tied down. So in a broad, broad sense–so when I come back on my 41st, if you invite me back, or my 48th trip here, you don\'t say, ""Well Biden, you know, you, you really like Saddam,"" you know, that\'s not what this is about. What it\'s about is Saddam was a butcher, the world\'s happy, may he burn in hell. He deserves it. But in terms of our globally–global positioning, our geopolitical strategy, as the think-tank guys down here talk about it, we are worse off than we were when we had Saddam sitting there because of the impact on our military and the impact on our credibility.', 'RUSSERT: The leader of the Democrats, Harry Reid, two weeks ago offered some comments. Let me share them with you and our viewers and come back and talk about them.', '(Videotape, April 19, 2007)', 'SEN.

I said that a year ago."", 'RUSSERT: Do you believe the war is lost?', ""BIDEN: I–this is, this is not a game show, where you know, a,a, a football game. What this is about is we have lost 3300 dead, we have 24,000 wounded, and, and we still have an opportunity to deal with the possibility of not trading a dictator for chaos, and–but it will not happen unless we have a serious change in our operating strategic premise. And that is we have to decentralize, not centralize this government. We've got to get the world community in on owning part of this, by calling an international conference to put pressure on the regional powers. If we don't do those two things, I don't see a happy ending to this whole undertaking. We may be forced into a position where there's no option, at some point, to withdraw and try to contain the chaos. The fact of the matter is that there is–I am worried about–my son gets angry with this. My son's unit may get sent to Iraq, and if it does, he goes. I don't want that to happen. But if it happens, it happens. But I don't want my grandson going. And how we leave Iraq is going to determine not merely whether my son goes or not, but whether my grandson goes. So the idea of winning and losing this is the wrong language, in my view. It's about salvaging our interest, or not salvaging our interest. And we're very close to not being able to salvage any of these policies."", ""RUSSERT: But these are serious words. If Senator Reid says the war is lost, that's an important choice of words, it's an important message."", ""BIDEN: And it's an important message I'm not delivering."", 'RUSSERT: So you disagree with him?', ""BIDEN: I–he can say what he says, I'll–I stick by what I said."", 'RUSSERT: But you say–if you–if you come to the conclusion that the war is lost, then you have an obligation to try to end it and stop funding.', ""BIDEN: Well, I think you have an obligation to figure out how to salvage your interests. Look, sometimes the game is lost, but what do you do? You may decide you're going to make sure that your halfback ends up winning the scoring championship by letting him run 12 more times. Look, this is not absolute. There's nothing absolute. If you believe–what is lost, is lost the opportunity to establish a democracy there? Well, that was lost on the day we got there. But if it is about whether or not you can establish a stable regime, an environment so this war doesn't metastasize, you do not have Turkey in after the Kurds, you don't have the Iranians in full-bore, you don't find this thing blowing up around the region, that is not lost yet. But it could be lost. What is the prize? What are we attempting to do here?

What is this administration implicitly acknowledging by building a wall? Give me a break. They\'re building a wall, and they\'re talking about a centralized government? Now, look, Tim, you know what happened in the Balkans. Once there was an agreement reached as to this–political agreement reached as to the separation of the parties, from Brcko to Sarajevo to Srebrenica, there was an incredible diminution in the internecine warfare. Why? Because we\'re in the context of an overall political settlement. What this is all about is maneuvering each of these groups to determine who is going to call the shots. Once you\'ve laid that out and you put yourself in a position where–look, there\'s never been a time in history that I can think of, Tim, where there\'s been a self-sustaining cycle of sectarian violence that has ended even remotely reasonably without a federated system.

For example, for $26 billion a year, I can insure every single solitary child under the age of 18 in the United States. America doesn't have health insurance. For $3 billion a year, I can double the investment we have on alternative energy sources and research. For a billion dollars a year I can put 50,000 more cops back on the street. And so this is where–we're, we're talking manageable numbers. But the larger point here, in my view, the larger point here, and I think distinguishes me from Democrats, I think we got to start looking at the direct savings that come from the investments we make. If we make an investment in wellness, we save hundreds of billions of dollars here. And so we got to look at it differently, Tim. But you need start-up dollars. The place I'd start off with is somewhere over $220 billion a year by the tax cuts and ending the war. And, by the way, all you need is $10 billion a year for the next five years to fund every single solitary aspect of the 9/11 Commission report, and I would only use 10 of the 85 billion from the top 1 percent for that purpose."", ""RUSSERT: But, senator, we have a deficit.

We have to do–you and I were talking about Bob Dole earlier. I was one of five people–I was the junior guy in the meeting with Bob Dole and George Mitchell when we put Social Security on the right path for 60 years. I\'ll never forget what Bob Dole said. After we reached an agreement about gradually raising the retirement age, etc., he said, ""Look, here\'s the deal, we all put our foot in the boat one at a time."" And he kicked–he stepped like he was stepping into a boat. ""And we all make the following deal. If any one of the challengers running against the incumbent Democrat or Republicans attack us on this point, we\'ll all stay together."" That\'s the kind of leadership that is needed. Social Security\'s not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you\'ve got to put all of it on the table.', 'RUSSERT: Everything.', ""BIDEN: Everything.

They upheld the ban, and then they engaged in what we lawyers call dicta that is frightening. You had an intellectually dishonest rationale for an honest justification for upholding the ban, and that was this: They went further, and then they, in the language associated with the decision said, by the way, they blurred whether there is the first trimester and third trimester in how much–I know this is going to sound arcane to the listeners–but whether or not they blurred the distinction between the government\'s role in being involved in the first day and the ninth month. They blurred the role in terms of whether or not there is–they became paternalistic, talking about the court could consider the impact on the mother and keeping her from making a mistake. This is all code for saying, ""Here we come to undo Roe v. Wade."" And it went on to say, by the way, that the life of the mother was, in fact, permissible exception, and it went on to say that even–that any woman could challenge, even if her health is at risk, could come back to the court to challenge that. So the bottom line here is, what they did is not so much the decision, the actual outcome of the decision, it\'s what attended the decision that portends for a real hard move on the court to undo the right of privacy. That\'s what I\'m criticizing about the court\'s decision.', 'RUSSERT: You have changed your position on abortion. When you came to the Senate, you believed that Roe v. Wade was not correctly decided and that you also believed a the right of abortion was not secured by the Constitution. Why did you change your mind?', ""BIDEN: Well, I was 29 years old when I came to the United States Senate, and I have learned a lot. Look, Tim, I'm a practicing Catholic, and it is the biggest dilemma for me in terms of comporting my, my religious and cultural views with my political responsibility. And the decision that I have come to is Roe v. Wade is as close to we're going to be able to get as a society that incorporates the general lines of debate within Christendom, Judaism and other faiths, where it basically says there is a sliding scale relating to viability of a fetus. We can argue about whether or not it's precisely set, whether it's right or wrong in terms of its three months as opposed to two months, but it does encompass, I've come to conclude, the only means by which, in this heterogeneous society of ours, we can read some general accommodation on what is a religiously charged and a publicly-charged debate. That's the, that's the decision I've come to."", 'Even within our own church, there\'s been debates about life, you know, from, from ""Summa Theologica,"" Aquinas, and 40 days to quickening and right to, you know, you know, Pious IX, animated fetus doctrine and so on. So this–the, the, the decision\'s the closest thing politically to what has been the philosophic divisions existent among the major confessional faiths in our country. And that\'s why, I think, that\'s why I\'ve come to the conclusion some long time ago, over 25 years ago, that is the–it is the template which makes the most sense.', 'RUSSERT: Are you still opposed to public funding for abortion?', ""BIDEN: I still am opposed to public funding for abortion, and the reason I am is, again, it goes to the question of whether or not you're going to impose a view to support something that is not a guaranteed right but an affirmative action to promote."", 'RUSSERT: Were you yourself–do you believe that life begins at conception?', ""BIDEN: I am prepared to accept my church's view. I think it's a tough one. I have to accept that on faith. That is a tough, tough decision to me.

That's why the late-term abortion, and that's why I continue, like your old boss Pat Moynihan, shared the same view, he was very pro-choice is–to use the jargon. But he, like me, believed that you have this notion of abortion in the last month, where there's clearly viability. And if you make that judgment based upon the nature of the child's health, that is not a good basis for a societal decision. Only the mother's health should be–dictate the outcome then.

""Do you believe gay marriage is inevitable?"" Biden: ""I\'m not sure. I think probably it is.""', 'BIDEN: Well, I think it probably is because social mores change. But look, Tim, I don\'t think the government can dictate the definition of marriage to religious institutions. But government does have an obligation to guarantee that everybody has, every individual is free of discrimination. And there\'s a distinction. You and I talk–I shouldn\'t say this–I think we did–talked about Meacham\'s book, the ""American Gospel."" And I, anticipating you asking me this, I wrote a quote from his, from his book that I think sums it up. He says, ""The American gospel is that religion shapes the life of the nation without strangling it."" That\'s where I think–that\'s how we have to view these very difficult decisions. I think government should not be able to dictate to religions the definition of marriage, but I think, on a civil side, government has the obligation to strip away every vestige of discrimination as to what individuals are able to do in terms of their personal conduct.', 'RUSSERT: So New Hampshire coming out in favor of civil unions is OK by you?', 'BIDEN: Yes.

Do you have a problem?', 'BIDEN: No. I don\'t have a–look, I have met with more world leaders and as many world leaders as anybody who sits in government today. They\'ve never had a problem understanding me. Milosevic had no problem understanding me when I said, ""I think you\'re a war criminal. I\'m going to do everything in power to see you\'re tried as one."" The prime minister of, of Great Britain\'s never misunderstood me. All the way back to Deng Xiaoping, he never understood–misunderstood me. Look, this is a rough game, man. This is a very rough game. My referring to Barack as articulate, it was a mistake. But guess what, if you look at–I will not mention the national press person who just–in saying that the problem with Barack\'s appearance last–on the debate was he wasn\'t articulate enough. I mean look, give me–give me a break. The average American out there understands–look, let me put it another way. The good thing about being around a long time is people have a basis upon which to judge you. And I didn\'t find any serious person in the civil rights community, because of my long history and long support for civil rights, thinking that I was trying to insult Barack Obama in any way.

What happened when we concluded that when Newt Gingrich said the way to win the House is to burn the House down? When all of the sudden we went from–I served, for example, I got here and a lot of old segregationists were still here. Yet, we did not engage in arguments about motive, we engaged in arguments about policy.

8,            Joseph R. Biden          ,"November 08, 2007","[""I've been saying for some time that Pakistan is the most complex country we deal with - and that a crisis was just waiting to happen. On Saturday night, it did."", 'President Musharraf staged a coup against his own government. He suspended the constitution, imposed de-facto martial law, postponed elections indefinitely, and arrested hundreds of lawyers, journalists, and human rights activists. He took these steps the day after Secretary Rice and the commander of all American forces in the region appealed to Musharraf not to take them.', ""America has a huge stake in the outcome of this crisis - and in the path Pakistan follows in the months and years to come. Pakistan has strong democratic traditions and a large, moderate majority. But that moderate majority must have a voice in the system and an outlet with elections. If not, moderates may find that they have no choice but to make common cause with extremists, just as the Shah's opponents did in Iran three decades ago."", 'But unlike Iran, Pakistan already has nuclear weapons.', ""It is hard to imagine a greater nightmare for America than the world's second-largest Muslim nation becoming a failed state in fundamentalist hands, with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea combined."", 'To prevent that nightmare from becoming a reality, I believe we need to do three things:', 'First, deal pro-actively with the current crisis.', 'Second, and for the longer term, move from a Musharraf policy to a Pakistan policy that gives the moderate majority a chance to succeed.', 'And third, help create conditions in the region that maximize the chances of success, and minimize the prospects for failure.', 'Resolving the Crisis', ""To help defuse the current political crisis, we must be far more pro-active, not reactive and make it clear to Pakistan that actions have consequences. President Bush's first reaction was to call on President Musharraf to reverse course. Given the stakes, I thought it was important to actually call him - which is exactly what I did. I also spoke to opposition leader Benazir Bhutto. President Musharraf and I had a very direct and detailed discussion. I told him how critical it is that elections go forward as planned in January, that he follow through on his commitment to take off his uniform, and that he restore the rule of law to Pakistan."", ""It was clear to me that President Musharraf understands the consequences for his country and for relations with the United States if he does not return Pakistan to the path of democracy. Now, President Bush finally got around to calling Musharraf yesterday. As a few of you may know, I'm running for President and I can tell you this: if I'm elected, I won't wait five days to pick up the phone or delegate matters of this magnitude to my secretary of state or to my ambassador. There is too much at stake to leave this kind of conversation to others."", ""If President Musharraf does not restore his nation to the democratic path, U.S. military aid will be in great jeopardy. I would look hard at big-ticket weapons systems intended primarily to maintain the balance of power with India, not to combat the Taliban or Al Qaeda: hardware like F-16 jets and P-3 maritime surveillance aircraft. President Musharraf doesn't want this aid suspension - and neither does the military establishment whose support he needs. Nor can they afford for this crisis to undermine confidence in Pakistan's economy, which has already taken a hard hit. So I believe there is incentive for cooler heads in Pakistan to prevail. But if they don't and if President Bush does not act, Congress almost certainly will."", 'Building a New Relationship', ""Beyond the current crisis lurks a far deeper problem. The relationship between the U.S. and Pakistan is largely transactional — and this transaction isn't working for either party. From America's perspective, we've spent billions of dollars on a bet that Pakistan's government would take the fight to the Taliban and Al Qaeda while putting the country back on the path to democracy. It has done neither."", ""From Pakistan's perspective, America is an unreliable ally that will abandon Pakistan the moment it's convenient to do so, and whose support has done little more than bolster unrepresentative rulers."", 'It is time for a new approach.', ""We've got to move from a transactional relationship -- the exchange of aid for services -- to the normal, functional relationship we enjoy with all of our other military allies and friendly nations. We've got to move from a policy concentrated on one man - President Musharraf - to a policy centered on an entire people… the people of Pakistan. Like any major policy shift, to gain long-term benefits we'll have to shoulder short term costs. But given the stakes, those costs are worth it."", 'Here are the four elements of this new strategy.', ""First, triple non-security aid, to $1.5 billion annually. For at least a decade. This aid would be unconditioned: it's our pledge to the Pakistani people. Instead of funding military hardware, it would build schools, clinics, and roads."", ""Second, condition security aid on performance. We should base our security aid on clear results. We're now spending well over $1 billion annually, and it's not clear we're getting our money's worth. I'd spend more if we get better returns—and less if we don't."", 'Third, help Pakistan enjoy a ""democracy dividend."" The first year of democratic rule should bring an additional $1 billion -- above the $1.5 billion non-security aid baseline. And I would tie future non-security aid -- again, above the guaranteed baseline -- to Pakistan\'s progress in developing democratic institutions and meeting good-governance norms.', ""Fourth, engage the Pakistani people, not just their rulers. This will involve everything from improved public diplomacy and educational exchanges to high impact projects that actually change people's lives."", ""This plan would fundamentally and positively shift the dynamic between the U.S. and Pakistan. Here's how:"", ""A drastic increase in non-security aid, guaranteed for a long period, would help persuade Pakistan's people that America is an all-weather friend… and Pakistan's leaders that America is a reliable ally. Pakistanis suspect our support is purely tactical. They point to the aid cut-off that followed the fall of the Soviet Union… to our refusal to deliver or refund purchased jets in the 1990s… and to our blossoming relationship with rival India. Many Pakistanis believe that the moment Osama bin Laden is gone, U.S. interest will go with him."", ""When U.S. aid makes a real difference in people's lives, the results are powerful. In October 2005, after a devastating earthquake, American military helicopters delivering relief did far more to improve relations than any amount of arms sales or debt rescheduling. And the Mobile Army Surgery Hospital we left behind is a daily reminder that America cares."", ""To have a real impact on a nation of 165 million, we'll have to raise our spending dramatically. A baseline of $1.5 billion annually, for a decade, is a reasonable place to start. That might sound like a lot - but it's about what we spend every week in Iraq. Conditioning security aid— now about three-quarters of our package— would help push the Pakistani military to finally crush Al Qaeda and the Taliban."", ""Aid to the Pakistani people should be unconditioned — that is, not subject to the ups and downs of a particular government in Islamabad or Washington. But aid to the Pakistani military and intelligence service should be closely conditioned — that is, carefully calibrated to results. Like it or not, the Pakistani security services will remain vital players - and our best shot at finding Bin Laden and shutting down the Taliban. Their performance has been decidedly mixed: we've caught more terrorists in Pakistan than in any other country— but $10 billion later, Pakistan remains the central base of Al Qaeda operations. We must strike a much better bargain."", 'A ""democracy dividend"" - additional assistance in the first year after democratic rule is restored -- would empower Pakistan\'s moderate mainstream. The Bush Administration\'s Musharraf First policy was understandable -- at first. Musharraf had broad support, and in the wake of 9/11 he seemed committed to the fight against Al Qaeda. Six years later, the General is diverting his military, his police, and his intelligence assets from the fight against the terrorists to a crackdown on his political opponents.', ""The Pakistani people have moved on. Hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to protest Musharraf's unconstitutional rule— and hundreds have been killed or gravely injured in the process. The Democracy Dividend would help restore the moral currency this administration has squandered with empty rhetoric about democracy. And it would enable the secular, democratic, civilian political leaders to prove that they—more than the generals or the radical Islamists—can bring real improvement to the lives of their constituents."", ""Last, we've got to engage the Pakistani people directly, and address issues important to them, not just to us. On Afghanistan, Iraq, the Palestinians, Kashmir, Pakistanis want a respectful hearing. We owe them that at least that much."", 'Ask an ordinary Pakistani to list his top concerns about America and you may get answers unrelated to international grand strategy: our visa policy and textile quotas.', 'Or she might raise Abu Ghraib and Gitmo or water-boarding and other forms of torture the Bush Administration still refuses to renounce. Pakistanis don\'t see these as mere ""issues."" They see these things as a moral stain on the soul of our nation. In my judgment, so should we.', 'Creating the Conditions for Success', ""This new Pakistan policy cannot succeed in isolation. Conditions in the region and in the broader Muslim world - conditions that the United States can affect - will make a huge difference, for good or for bad. We've got to connect the dots - to be, as I suggested at the outset, smart as well as strong. First, there's what we should do."", 'To increase the prospects that Pakistan will take the lead in the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we should rededicate ourselves to a forgotten war: Afghanistan. When we shifted resources away from Afghanistan to Iraq, Musharraf concluded the Taliban would rebound, so he cut a deal with them.', ""Redoubling our efforts in Afghanistan - not just with more troops but with the right kind… and with a reconstruction effort that matches President Bush's Marshall Plan rhetoric… would embolden Pakistan's government to take a harder line on the Taliban and Al Qaeda."", ""Second, there's what we should not do. Consider all this talk of war with Iran. It is totally counter-productive to achieving our ends in Iran… but also in Pakistan. In Iran, it allows President Ahmadinejad to distract the Iranian people from the failures of his leadership… and adds a huge security premium to the price of oil, with the proceeds going from our consumers to Iran's government. And in Pakistan and also Afghanistan, anything the fuels the sense of an American crusade against Islam puts moderates on the defensive and empowers extremists. It is hard to think of a more self-defeating policy."", ""History's Verdict"", ""History may describe today's Pakistan as a repeat of 1979 Iran or 2001 Afghanistan. Or history may write a very different story: that of Pakistan as a stable, democratic, secular Muslim state. Which future unfolds will be strongly influenced—if not determined— by the actions of the United States."", 'I believe that Pakistan can be a bridge between the West and the global Islamic community. Most Pakistanis want a lasting friendship with America. They respect and admire our society. But they are mystified over what they see as our failure to live up to our ideals.', 'The current crisis in Pakistan is also an opportunity to start anew… to build a relationship between Pakistan and the United States upon which both our peoples can depend - and be proud.']",1

And heating oil costs about $3.23/gallon, a full dollar more than it did this time last year.', '""What does that have to do with our Iran policy? Everything. Just connect the dots.', '""The price of every barrel of oil includes what the energy experts call a \'security premium\' - an extra cost directly tied to tension and the risk of conflict in the Middle East. The more tensions rise, the higher the security premium goes, because people betting on the long term price of oil anticipate supply disruptions.', '""Right now, a barrel of oil costs 100 dollars. But a full 30 dollars of that is the security premium. That\'s right: nearly one-third of the cost of oil pays for that security premium.', '""So what happens when President Bush or Vice President Cheney start talking about ""World War III"" with Iran… or when Congress votes to designate a large chunk of Iran\'s military a ""terrorist organization?""', '""First, it plays right into President Ahmadinejad\'s hands because it allows him to distract the Iranian people from the terrible failures of his leadership.', '""But second, it ratchets up tension with Iran, which means the security premium goes up and oil prices go through the roof.', '""That security premium comes right out of your pockets here in New Hampshire.

President Lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place. Then stand firm. Today, Springfield, I know my feet are in the right place. And I am proud to stand firm for the next president of the United States of America, Barack Obama. Folks, Barack and I come from very different places, but we share a common story. An American story. He was the son of a single mom, a single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids. But she raised him. She raised him to believe in America. to believe that in this country there is no obstacle that could keep you from your dreams. If you are willing to work hard and fight for it. I was different. I was an Irish-Catholic kid from Scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times, but my mom and dad raised me to believe, it's a saying Barack you heard me say before, my dad repeated it and repeated it. Said champ, it's not how many times you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up. It's how quickly you get up. Ladies and gentlemen, that's your story. That's America's story. It's about if you get up, you can make it."", ""That's the America Barack Obama and I believe in. That's the American dream. And ladies and gentlemen, is there no ordinary times, and this is no ordinary election. Because the truth of the matter is, and you know it, that American dream under eight years of Bush and McCain, that American dream is slipping away. I don't have to tell you that. You feel it in your lives. You see it in your shrinking wages, and the cost of everything from groceries to health care to college to filling up your car at the gas station. It keeps going up and up and up, and the future keeps receding further and further and further away as you reach for your dreams. You know, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a mere political saying. I say with every fiber of my being I believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this. We cannot afford to keep giving tax cuts after tax cuts to big corporations and the wealthiest Americans while the middle class America, middle class families are falling behind and their wages are actually shrinking.

He will have such an incredible opportunity, incredible opportunity, not only to change the direction of America, but literally, literally to change the direction of the world. Barack Obama and I believe, we believe with every fiber in our being that our families, our communities as Americans, there's not a single solitary challenge we cannot face if we level with the American people.

The missing piece is leadership."", ""In all my time in the United States Senate, and I want you to know there's only four senators senior to me, but Barack, there's still 44 older than me. I want you to know that part. But all kidding aside, of all my years in the Senate, I have never in my life seen Washington so broken. I have never seen so many dreams denied and so many decisions deferred by politicians who are trying like the devil to escape their responsibility and accountability. But, ladies and gentlemen, the reckoning is now. And the reality, the reality is that we must answer the call or we will risk the harshest version and verdict of history. These times call for a total change in Washington's worldview. These times require more than a good soldier. They require a wise leader. A leader -- a leader who can deliver. A leader who can deliver the change we need."", ""I'll say straight up to you - John McCain and the press knows this, is genuinely a friend of mine. I've known John for 35 years. He served our country with extraordinary courage and I know he wants to do right by America. But the harsh truth is, ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America when you boast. And these are John's words, quote, the most important issues of our day, I've been totally in agreement and support of President Bush. Ladies and gentlemen, that's what he said. You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95% of the time. You can't change America when you believe, and these are his own words, that in the Bush administration we've made great progress economically. You can't change America and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to Bush's scheme of privatizing social security. You can't change America and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear, you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas. You can't change America and end this war in Iraq when you declare and, again, these are John's words, no one has supported President Bush in Iraq more than I have, end of quote. Ladies and gentlemen, you can't change America, you can't change America when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of George Bush's presidency."", ""My friends -- yes, we can. My friends, I don't have to tell you, this election year the choice is clear. One man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need. A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States, Barack Amer -"", ""You know, you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy. Let me tell you about Obama. You learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him. When you debate him 12 or 13 times. When you hear him speak. When you see how he thinks. And you watch how he reacts under pressure. You learn a lot about his strength of his mind, and I think even more importantly, the quality of his heart. Ladies and gentlemen, no one knows better than I do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which you're tested and challenged every single day. And over the past 18 months, I've watched Barack meet those challenges with judgment, intelligence, and steel in his spine. I've watched as he's inspired millions of Americans, millions of Americans to this new cause."", ""And during those 18 months, I must tell you, frankly, I've been disappointed in my friend, John McCain, who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swiftboat politics that he so -- once so deplored. And folks, campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership. And in this campaign, one candidate, one candidate has passed that test."", ""Barack has the vision, and what you can't forget, you know his vision, but let me tell you something. He also has the courage, the courage to make this a better place, and let me tell you something else, this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done. I watch with amazement as he came to the Senate. I watch with amazement. He made his mark literally from day one reaching across the aisle to pass legislation to secure the world's deadliest weapons, standing up to some of the most entrenched interests in Washington, risking the wrath of the old order to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation. But I was proudest, I was proudest, when I watched him spontaneously focus the attention of the nation on the shameful neglect of America's wounded warriors at Walter Reed Army Hospital. Ladies and gentlemen, I know I'm told I talk too colloquially, but there's something about this guy. There's something about this guy. There's something about Barack Obama that allows him to bring people together like no one I have worked with and seen. There's something about Barack Obama that makes people understand if they make compromises they can make things better."", ""It's been amazing to watch him. But then again, that's been the story of his whole life. I end where I began. This is a man raised by a single mother who sometimes was on food stamps as she worked to put herself through school, by grandparents from the prairies of Kansas who loved him, a grandfather, a grandfather who marched in Paton's Army and then came home and went to college on the G.I. Bill, and a grandmother, a grandmother with just a high school education, started off working in a small bank in the secretarial pool and rose to be vice president of that bank. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, these remarkable people gave Barack Obama the determination and drive, and, yes, the values to turn down that big job on Wall Street, to come to Chicago's south side, where he helped workers help themselves after the steel mills had been shut down and the jobs disappeared."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, my wife Jill, who you'll meet soon, is drop dead gorgeous. My wife Jill, who you'll meet soon, she also has her doctorate degree, which is a problem. But all kidding aside, my Jill, my Jill, my wife Jill and I are honored to join Barack and Michelle on this journey, because that's what it is. it's a journey. We share the same values, the values that we had passed on to us by our parents and the values Jill and I are passing on to our sons Beau and Hunter and Ashley."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here for their future. I'm here for the future of your kids. I'm here for everyone I - I'm here for everyone I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, who's been forgotten and everybody in Claymont, Delaware, in Wilmington where I lived. I'm here for the cops and the fire fighters, the teachers and the line workers, the folks who live - the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the American dream endures."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is no ordinary time. This is no ordinary election. And this may be our last chance to reclaim the America we love, to restore America's soul. Ladies and gentlemen, America gave Jill and me our chance. It gave Barack and Michelle their chance to stand on this stage today. It's literally incredible. These values, this country gave us that chance. And now it's time for all of us, as Lincoln said, to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to elect Barack Obama president. It's our time.

Get up.""', 'I wish that my dad was here tonight, but I am so grateful that my mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, is here. You know, she taught her children--all the children who flocked to our house--that you are defined by your sense of honor, and you are redeemed by your loyalty. She believes bravery lives in every heart and her expectation is that it will be summoned.', ""Failure at some point in everyone's life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable. As a child I stuttered, and she lovingly told me it was because I was so bright I couldn't get the thoughts out quickly enough. When I was not as well dressed as others, she told me how handsome she thought I was. When I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, she sent me back out and demanded that I bloody their nose so I could walk down that street the next day."", 'After the accident, she told me, ""Joey, God sends no cross you cannot bear.""

It defines who we are as a people. And now it's in jeopardy. I know it. You know it. But John McCain doesn't get it."", 'Barack Obama gets it. Like many of us, Barack worked his way up. His is a great American story.', ""You know, I believe the measure of a man isn't just the road he's traveled; it's the choices he's made along the way. Barack Obama could have done anything after he graduated from college. With all his talent and promise, he could have written his ticket to Wall Street. But that's not what he chose to do. He chose to go to Chicago. The South Side. There he met men and women who had lost their jobs. Their neighborhood was devastated when the local steel plant closed. Their dreams deferred. Their dignity shattered. Their self-esteem gone."", ""And he made their lives the work of his life. That's what you do when you've been raised by a single mom, who worked, went to school and raised two kids on her own. That's how you come to believe, to the very core of your being, that work is more than a paycheck. It's dignity. It's respect. It's about whether you can look your children in the eye and say: we're going to be ok."", 'Because Barack made that choice, 150,000 more children and parents have health care in Illinois.

He got it done.', 'And when he came to Washington, I watched him hit the ground running, leading the fight to pass the most sweeping ethics reform in a generation.

For example,', 'John thinks that during the Bush years ""we\'ve made great progress economically.""

The Bush-McCain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out. For the last seven years, this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century: the emergence of Russia, China and India as great powers; the spread of lethal weapons; the shortage of secure supplies of energy, food and water; the challenge of climate change; and the resurgence of fundamentalism in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the real central front against terrorism.', ""In recent days, we've once again seen the consequences of this neglect with Russia's challenge to the free and democratic country of Georgia.

We will hold Russia accountable for its actions, and we'll help the people of Georgia rebuild."", ""I've been on the ground in Georgia, Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can tell you in no uncertain terms: this Administration's policy has been an abject failure. America cannot afford four more years of this."", 'Now, despite being complicit in this catastrophic foreign policy, John McCain says Barack Obama isn\'t ready to protect our national security.

Or should we trust Barack Obama, who more than a year ago called for sending two additional combat brigades to Afghanistan?', ""The fact is, al-Qaida and the Taliban--the people who actually attacked us on 9/11--have regrouped in those mountains between Afghanistan and Pakistan and are plotting new attacks. And the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff echoed Barack's call for more troops."", 'John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.', ""Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he rejected talking with Iran and then asked: What is there to talk about? Or Barack Obama, who said we must talk and make it clear to Iran that its conduct must change."", ""Now, after seven years of denial, even the Bush administration recognizes that we should talk to Iran, because that's the best way to advance our security."", 'Again, John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.', ""Should we trust John McCain's judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from Iraq--that we must stay indefinitely? Or should we listen to Barack Obama, who says shift responsibility to the Iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home?"", 'Now, after six long years, the Bush administration and the Iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home.', 'John McCain was wrong. Barack Obama was right.', 'Again and again, on the most important national security issues of our time, John McCain was wrong, and Barack Obama was proven right.', ""Folks, remember when the world used to trust us?

I mean, I hear this talk about, you know, is she going to pick up Hillary voters? Well, I--so far I haven't heard one single policy position, one single position that she has in common with Hillary.

I mean, I think it's--well, I don't--look, that's for voters to decide. You're not going to see anything elitist--look, what you hear immediately from Barack Obama and Joe Biden, families off-limits and we mean it, that the personal stuff relating to some of the stuff that was popping out on, on the talk shows is just inappropriate. She's going to be judged, I assume, the same way I'm going to be judged. What does she know, what does she think, what's her record, what's she going to do? And as I look down the road, that's how I've always debated whoever I've debated, including the really tough women I work with, smart women, in the Senate. So I, I, I really don't view this any differently. I may be surprised here down the road. But, but, you know, I'm just looking forward to debating her. I mean, why--look, she had a great speech. But what was--her silence on the issues was deafening. She didn't mention a word about healthcare, a word about the environment, a word about the middle class. They never parted her lips.

BROKAW: I think we're at the end of stage three of a long campaign for president. You have candidates who announced, then you had the primaries, then you have the convention, then you have the debates and then you have the runoff which leads to the election. Here's what happened last week according to the Gallup Poll. We're going to show you the tracking that went on. On Monday, you had about a six-point lead over John McCain. It went to an eight-point lead by Tuesday. But then it began to tighten up and by the time you got to Saturday, it was just two points separating the two of them.

I hope--hopefully, you\'re not going to be in a position where we\'re going to be recounting anything. But look, I--we\'ve assumed from the beginning this is going to be a close, tough race. This is a historic race. You have not only in terms of the candidates, but the time. You said before the--if you don\'t mind me saying, we were sitting here, you said, ""Look, John McCain had this gigantic number of people watching. Barack had 38 and he had 39 million or whatever it was,"" but more than ever watched a convention. People are focused, man. Their lives, as they view it, their standing in the middle class, their standing in the world, depends on it. So I think this is going to be a very focused election.', 'MR.

BIDEN: Well, I think she is a big player, and you know, as a matter of fact, I hope I'll be campaigning with her in some of those states, particularly in Pennsylvania and Ohio. She's indicated she's prepared to do it. Bill Clinton's indicated to me he's prepared to go anywhere and campaign with us. That's a process being worked out now, how to mechanically do that.

BROKAW: As you know, earlier in the campaign, Barack Obama said that he would be willing to appear in town halls, a proposition put forth by John McCain, go around the country, appear two, three times a week in different venues, and then he decided not to. He wanted to confine it to just three debates. Those numbers that we just referred to, 38 million people watching Senator Obama, 39 million watching McCain, 38 million watching Governor Palin the other night, that is an indication this country is really tuned in in a way that I can't remember maybe since 1968. Why not have town halls? Why not have Senator Obama go head to head with John McCain across the country?"", ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, that's a little above my pay grade, to use the phrase.

I think those debates that are going to take place, the three critical debates between the two nominees, are going to be the most watched debates in the history of American politics, and I think people are going to get everything they need out of those debates, plus they're going to have an opportunity to--look, another reason why, in my view--I can't speak for the campaign, because I haven't gotten into--I mean, I just got on the ticket--is that, you know, we have a different focus. For example, I'm headed to--we think we can win Montana. Now, you know, they'd like very much to not, not spend a lot of time in Montana and Virginia and another 12 states or so that were Republican states we think we can compete in and win. And so when you decide on doing, you know, a campaign, a town hall, you know, every week, what you do, you significantly constrain your ability to get to places where Democratic candidates haven't spent much time before."", ""MR.

BROKAW: He is talking about political reconciliation, but he also said that it has succeeded beyond anyone\'s expectations. Here you were, just one year ago, on MEET THE PRESS. This was your take on the surge at that time, so let\'s listen to that, Senator. ""I mean, the truth of the matter is"" ""this administration\'s policy and the surge are a failure,"" you said, ""and that the surge, which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and - long enough to give political reconciliation, there has been no political reconciliation."" Then you went on to say earlier in the year, ""General Petraeus believes that it is a good idea, the surge. He may be the only one who believes that. Virtually no one else believes it\'s a good idea."" Well, at the time, John McCain did, and all the indications are the surge has worked up to a point. It\'s not a victory, as Senator Lindsey Graham said the other night...', 'SEN. BIDEN: Or as John McCain said.', 'MR. BROKAW: Or John McCain said, but the conditions are in place, and Anbar province, where you have been, where there had been so much difficulty, the Iraqis now have taken over that province.

BIDEN: No. The surge helped make that--what made is possible in Anbar province is they did what I\'d suggested two and a half years ago: gave local control. They turned over and they said to the Sunnis in Anbar province, ""We promise you, don\'t worry, you\'re not going to have any Shia in here. There\'s going to be no national forces in here. We\'re going to train your forces to help you fight al-Qaeda."" And that you--what you had was the awakening. The awakening was not an awakening by us, it was an awakening of the Sunnis in Anbar province willing to fight.', 'MR. BROKAW: Cooperating with the Shia.', ""SEN. BIDEN: Willing to fight. Cooperating with--no, they weren't cooperating with Shiite. They didn't cooperate with the Shiites."", 'MR. BROKAW: Once the awakening got under way.', ""SEN. BIDEN: No, no, no. No, they didn't cooperate with the Shiites. It's still--it's a big problem, Tom. You got--we're paying 300 bucks a month to each of those guys. Now the problem has been and the, and the promise was made by Maliki that they would be integrated into the overall military. That's a process that is beginning in fits and starts now, but it's far from over. Far from--look, the bottom line here is that it's--let's--the surge is over. Here's the real point. Whether or not the surge worked is almost irrelevant now. We're in a new deal. What is the administration doing? They're doing what Barack Obama has suggested over 14 months ago, turn responsibility over and draw down our troops. We're about to get a deal from the president of the United States and Maliki, the head of the Iraqi government, that's going to land on my desk as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee saying we're going to set a timeline to draw down our forces. The only guy in America out of step is John McCain. John McCain's saying no timeline. They've signed on to Barack Obama's proposal."", 'MR. BROKAW: But the surge helped make that timeline possible, did it not?', ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, it did help make it possible. It did help. But it's not the reason. Look, they also--take a look at the analysis, Tom. They say the reason why there's such success against the, the insurgency is because of now small, very well trained counterinsurgency units. It's not the numbers, it's the type of units that are in there. What I was arguing about before was we have the wrong units in there. We have the wrong kind of force in there. We weren't focused on counterinsurgency."", ""And so look--but, but, but the bottom line is we can argue about whether the surge was good, bad or indifferent. Let's assume it was all good. The truth of the matter is, what do we do now? What's John McCain going to do when he's president? He says he will not sign on to a timeline, number one. Number two, he has no, no idea, no suggestion how he's going to deal with the neighbors. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Iraq. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Syria. He has no idea how he's going to deal with Turkey. We have laid out a clear plan."", 'MR. BROKAW: But two years ago you were the principal author, along with Les Gelb of the Council on Foreign Relations, of an entirely different kind of plan. You were promoting heavily the idea of a confederation, or a partition.', ""SEN. BIDEN: That's exact--not, not a partition. You guys keep saying that. It was never a partition."", ""MR. BROKAW: Or the--we'll make it a confederation."", ""SEN. BIDEN: We--yeah, yeah. That's what it was. OK."", 'MR. BROKAW: But the--but terms of real political terms, it would quickly become a partition.', 'SEN. BIDEN: Not true. Absolutely, positively not true.', 'MR. BROKAW: You think that the Kurds in the north and the, and the, and the Sunnis and the Shia would just say, ""Oh, we can all get across--get together across lines,"" without having a prescription...(unintelligible).', ""SEN. BIDEN: No, no. That wasn't it. There was a central government that had power, but there was more power given to the localities like exist right now. Tom, tell me, what's changed up among, among the Kurds? You still not--cannot, under the Iraqi constitution, send an Iraqi army up there. You still not--cannot fly an Iraqi flag up there unless you get permission. Tell me what's happened in Anbar province. There are no Sunnis in Anbar province--I mean, Shia in Anbar province. It is de facto exactly what I said. That's what's working. Everything that's working in Iraq has been the bottom up approach, not a strong central government imposing. And the truth of the matter is the only way you're going to make this--sustain it, the question is, how do we leave and leave a stable Iraq behind? Without a political settlement, Tom, we're going to be back there in another year or two or three or five."", ""MR. BROKAW: But are you encouraged they're moving toward a political settlement?"", 'SEN. BIDEN: Yes, I am encouraged, because they\'re doing the things I suggested. They\'re localizing it, Tom. That\'s why it is moving toward some mild possibility of a resolution. And if you were to now follow up--if John McCain as president, would follow up like we will as president and say, ""OK, how do you get the rest of the neighborhood in the deal?"" How do you get, how do you get Iran and Syria to stop supporting the--specifically, the Shia? And every--you know, this talk about how this has been such a great success, look where we are now in the Middle East. You now have a Shia-dominated government close to Iran. What\'s Maliki do? When Ahmadinejad comes, he kisses him on both cheek and seeks permission. So give me a break about how this is such a great political success.', ""We have the bravest soldiers in the world. I said at the time of the surge, if we sent in 500,000 troops we could tamp this down immediately, shut it down and end all violence. But that would not solve the problem. What do we do when we leave? What's left behind? And that's the hard work, and that requires the region as well. And you don't hear a word from John about that--John McCain. You don't hear a word from Sarah Palin about that. But you do now from the administration. The administration's now signing on to Barack Obama's plan to set a timeline, to--not the exact plan, but to set a timeline to draw down American troops."", 'MR. BROKAW: Five years from now, do you think Iraq will have relative stability and democratic principles in a central government?', ""SEN. BIDEN: If there is an Obama-Biden administration, yeah. If there is a John McCain administration and Sarah Palin, I think it's probably not going to happen, because John does not view this in terms of the region. I never heard him speak about how he's going to integrate Iraq into the region where you have these competing interests that exist. And I, I, I just--now, John may have an idea. I've never heard it. I've never heard it. And by the way, that Biden proposal, 75 senators voted for it, including the majority of the Republican Party."", ""MR. BROKAW: But the Iraqi government didn't like the idea. Maliki..."", ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, the Iraqi government--Maliki didn't, but the rest of the government liked it."", ""MR. BROKAW: But he is the head of the government. It's their country."", ""SEN. BIDEN: Yeah--by the way, it is their country, but he's the head of the government, but he's the head of the government whose popularity is very much in question, and the election itself. You had a whole lot of people--look, here's going to be the key, Tom. They're about to have regional elections. Let's see how they go. Let's see how the regional elections go. Pray God they'll go well for the sake of all of our sons that are there."", ""MR. BROKAW: Let's move on to some domestic issues."", 'SEN. BIDEN: Sure.', ""MR. BROKAW: The country's waking up this morning to the news that the federal government's about to move in on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those are quasi government agencies holding $5.3 trillion in mortgage debt. They're in serious trouble at the moment, but they're in a free fall, in effect. The government reorganized them, it appears that they're going to pump in some fresh capital on a quarterly basis, but shareholders will have their shares greatly diluted by this move. But the preferred shareholders--China and other governments that have invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--will not suffer, because the government will prop them up. Is that fair?"", ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, no, it's not fair, but I don't think that's what's going to happen. I talked to Secretary Paulson last night. I'm not at liberty to lay out what he told me, because he should announce it today. But there's three principles that have to play here for this to work, in my view. One, you have to make sure that you help homeowners and stabilize, at the same time, financial institutions. Secondly, you got to make sure that you're not bailing out shareholders vs. the taxpayers. And the third thing you got to do is make sure that they're still in a position to be able to continue to lend, because there is a need for them to continue to have this elasticity of being able to deal with the market. Now, what I've heard the outline of, I am--I want to wait till I see all the detail, but if it meets those three principles, then I think it has a great chance of succeeding. And as I understand it, whatever proposal Secretary Paulson is going to make is a proposal to get us over this hump of instability and uncertainty. It's not an official reorganization. It will be left to the next administration and the Congress to make those judgments."", 'MR. BROKAW: All investors suffer equally?', ""SEN. BIDEN: They should. They should. We'll see what the plan is."", ""MR. BROKAW: We want to talk a little bit about both campaigns now describing themselves as an agent of change. Senator Obama has been hard on the case about Washington lobbyists and their influence. Let's share with you and our viewers just some of the ads and the statements that he's made about all of that, if we can."", '(Videotape, Yesterday)', 'SEN. OBAMA: And suddenly, he\'s the change agent. He says, ""I\'m going to tell those lobbyists that their days of running Washington are over."" Who\'s he going to tell? Is he going to tell his campaign chairman, who\'s one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington? Is he going to tell his campaign manager, who was one of the biggest corporate lobbyists in Washington? Who is it that he\'s going to tell that change is coming? I mean, come on.

The Republicans and independents who've lost trust in their government but want to believe again."", 'I am in this race to tell the corporate lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over. I have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on the lobbyists and I have won. They have not funded my campaign and they will not drown out the voices of the American people when I am president.', '(End excerpt)', 'MR. BROKAW: That is Senator Barack Obama during the primary campaign. He was campaigning in Iowa at the time. In your hometown newspaper this morning, there\'s a big headline, ""Banking on Biden."" ""As the senator of Delaware\'s financial institutions find themselves banking on Biden. To some, Joe Biden\'s makeover as a blue collar warrior is slightly at odds with the blue blood company that he keeps in the corporate state. Not only is Biden a neighbor to wealthy and powerful company titans and DuPont family members, he\'s thrown his weight behind issues and legislation that benefitted Delaware\'s big banking interests."" This is what The Wall Street Journal had to say about all of this. ""Obama\'s choice of Biden as his running mate is coming under fire from Republicans who are painting him as an old-style insider. They cite his longstanding ties to trial lawyers and lobbyists and a taste for pork-barrel spending...', '""Biden ... had collected $6.5 million in campaign contributions from lobbyists, lawyers and law firms since 1989, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. ...', '""Biden\'s candidacy also is bringing new scrutiny to his family\'s business dealings, especially those of his son Hunter, who is 38 years old."" And that\'s a reference to your son being hired right out of law school by a big company here in Delaware that is in the credit card business, MBNA. He got about $100,000 a year, as I recall. You received $214,000 in campaign contributions from the company and from its employees. At the same time, you were fighting for a bankruptcy bill that MBNA really wanted to get passed through the Senate, making it much tougher for everyone to file bankruptcy. Senator Obama was opposed to the bill. Among other things you couldn\'t, in fact, claim that you had a problem because of big medical bills. You voted against an amendment that would call for a warning on predatory lending. You also called for--you opposed efforts to strengthen the protection of people in bankruptcy. This has been an issue that you\'re heard about before. Your son was working for the company at the same time. In retrospect, wasn\'t it inappropriate for someone like you in the middle of all this to have your son collecting money from this big credit card company while you were on the floor protecting its interests?', ""SEN. BIDEN: Absolutely not. My son graduated from Yale Law School. The starting salary in Wall Street is $140,000 a year if you want to lawyer. Options he had. He came home to work for a bank. Surprise, surprise, number one. Number two, this is the second largest employer in the state. All the contributions added up make up less than 2 percent of the contributions I've received. Number three, I blocked the bank--first three bankruptcy bills that the credit card companies wanted. I would not support a bankruptcy bill until they did three things. They put women and children first. Every single social welfare agency relating to alimony and child support supported this bill. Eight-five senators supported this bill. So try as people might to make to this out."", ""You want to know whether or not I am in the pocket of the corporate lobbyists, which makes it apply--sounds like it's right here. Ask the people in the industry here how happy they are. How happy the DuPont company is with me and the Hercules Corporation that I would not sign on the asbestos bill. How happy they are with me--look, the fact of the matter is, that I have had an entire career that no one has every questioned whether or not anybody has influenced me, number one. No group has ever, ever been involved with more than--contributing more than 2 percent to my campaign. I'm listed as the 98th or 99th of the 100 poorest guy in the Senate in terms of net worth. I have a 35-year career of actually, of being viewed, at least in my state, as being independent. And so you can take individual votes and you can talk about them, but they're totally out of context, Tom."", ""MR. BROKAW: But the fact is, it was not just the Republicans. It's your home town newspaper, consumers groups, a number of other people thought that you went way too far in bankruptcy protection and cracking down on those people who may not get the relief that they need."", ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, and most people thought differently. But how come the social welfare agencies supported it, Tom? Are they a bunch of radical, corporate whatever? How come 89--or 85 United States senators supported it? Now, Barack voted a different way. I respect his vote. The question is, is the glass half-full or half-empty? Fewer than 10 percent of all the filers in bankruptcy are even affected. I'm the guy that insisted there be a safe harbor, that no one making under $50,000 or $49,000 could even be considered in this."", 'And look, the big issue people have is what about people who go bankrupt because of their healthcare bills. That\'s why we need national health insurance. Are we going to say to every doctor and hospital, ""Look, you get to write off your bill, get to write off your bill because people can\'t pay."" The way to do that, that\'s a societal responsibility, not the responsibility of individual doctors and--assuming they\'re charging a fair price. And so look, and everybody else voted--not everybody. The vast majority of the members of the Congress voted that way.', 'MR. BROKAW: So if you get to Washington as president and vice president, given the promises that Senator Obama has made, would you look at situations like you just went through, which has raised some questions, where sons work for big banks that have interests in states...', ""SEN. BIDEN: My son has never spoken. I voted for every campaign reform that's existed with regard to lobbyists. I voted for every single solitary proposal to make it tougher. And if you ask around here, ask--try to find how many lobbyists have actually--I probably have spoken to lobbyists, but I don't--it's not a practice I have. If they want to see me, the CEO has to come and see me from the company."", 'MR. BROKAW: But specifically, what would this administration do about K Street and lobbyists, which has begun...', ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, what, what they would do is they'd stop them from writing the bills. They wouldn't be sitting like Cheney was with lobbyists, writing an energy policy. They'd get to have their voice. Look, there is a thing called free speech. They get to petition their government. But in terms of their ability to be able to set the agenda, write legislation, be these--and my--you know, it's just, it would not--it just a total different atmosphere.

Other people talk about my faith."", ""MR. BROKAW: I'll give you an opportunity to talk about it now."", 'SEN. BIDEN: Yeah.', 'MR. BROKAW: Two weeks ago I interviewed Senator Nancy Pelosi--she\'s the speaker of the House, obviously--when she was in Denver. When Barack Obama appeared before Rick Warren, he was asked a simple question: When does life begin? And he said at that time that it was above his pay grade. That was the essence of his question. When I asked the speaker what advice she would give him about when life began, she said the church has struggled with this issue for a long time, especially in the last 50 years or so. Her archbishop and others across the country had a very strong refutation to her views on all this; I guess the strongest probably came from Edward Cardinal Egan, who\'s the Archbishop of New York. He said, ""Anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being `chooses\' to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name."" Those are very strong words. If Senator Obama comes to you and says, ""When does life begin? Help me out here, Joe,"" as a Roman Catholic, what would you say to him?', 'SEN. BIDEN: I\'d say, ""Look, I know when it begins for me."" It\'s a personal and private issue. For me, as a Roman Catholic, I\'m prepared to accept the teachings of my church. But let me tell you. There are an awful lot of people of great confessional faiths--Protestants, Jews, Muslims and others--who have a different view. They believe in God as strongly as I do. They\'re intensely as religious as I am religious. They believe in their faith and they believe in human life, and they have differing views as to when life--I\'m prepared as a matter of faith to accept that life begins at the moment of conception. But that is my judgment. For me to impose that judgment on everyone else who is equally and maybe even more devout than I am seems to me is inappropriate in a pluralistic society. And I know you get the push back, ""Well, what about fascism?"" Everybody, you know, you going to say fascism\'s all right? Fascism isn\'t a matter of faith. No decent religious person thinks fascism is a good idea.', ""MR. BROKAW: But if you, you believe that life begins at conception, and you've also voted for abortion rights..."", 'SEN. BIDEN: No, what a voted against curtailing the right, criminalizing abortion. I voted against telling everyone else in the country that they have to accept my religiously based view that it\'s a moment of conception. There is a debate in our church, as Cardinal Egan would acknowledge, that\'s existed. Back in ""Summa Theologia,"" when Thomas Aquinas wrote ""Summa Theologia,"" he said there was no--it didn\'t occur until quickening, 40 days after conception. How am I going out and tell you, if you or anyone else that you must insist upon my view that is based on a matter of faith? And that\'s the reason I haven\'t. But then again, I also don\'t support a lot of other things. I don\'t support public, public funding. I don\'t, because that flips the burden. That\'s then telling me I have to accept a different view. This is a matter between a person\'s God, however they believe in God, their doctor and themselves in what is always a--and what we\'re going to be spending our time doing is making sure that we reduce considerably the amount of abortions that take place by providing the care, the assistance and the encouragement for people to be able to carry to term and to raise their children.', 'MR.

People say, ""Well, hey, he\'s my old buddy, he\'s welcome back.""', ""SEN. BIDEN: Well, look. I don't want to personalize this election. Like I said, I heard Sarah Palin and John McCain talk about change. Tell me one single thing they're going to do on the economy, foreign policy, taxes, that is going to be change. Name me one. This is such malarkey. Ninety percent of the time, John votes with the president. Same tax cut, he jumps on his tax cut proposal, which was disastrous, he jumps on his foreign policy, which has been a complete and utter failure. He jumps on the whole idea that he has about how to deal with healthcare, which is to tax. John wants to tax healthcare benefits for people who get their healthcare from their employers?

In the last debate, John McCain felt the need to declare that he's not President Bush. And just yesterday, John McCain actually went so far as to try to compare Barack Obama to George W. Bush. As my granddaughter says: Hello? John McCain is now attacking the Bush budget and fiscal policies. Folks, this is as crazy as the Sundance Kid attacking Butch Cassidy! They were in this together."", 'John McCain voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Until recently, he was bragging about it. He said these policies produced ""great economic progress."" Look, I know Halloween is coming. But John McCain as the candidate of change? That\'s one costume the American people aren\'t going to buy. So I know we\'re not running against President Bush. But we are running against the very Bush economic policies John McCain is promising to continue. John McCain and Sarah Palin call themselves mavericks... but to paraphrase your neighbor -- Senator Bob Casey from Pennsylvania -- you can\'t call yourself a maverick when all you\'ve been is a sidekick.', ""If you give Barack Obama and me the honor of serving as your President and Vice President, here is what we will do: We will commit ourselves - night and day - to two overriding goals. First, restore the middle class. Second, reclaim America's respect in the world. And the first step in reclaiming that leadership is to end this war in Iraq. We will end this war in Iraq -- responsibly. Now, even President Bush is getting behind Barack's plan to set a timeline for the withdrawal of our combat forces from Iraq. Only John McCain says no. He's wrong. And Barack Obama is right."", 'To rebuild the middle class, we need to cut taxes for working people. We need an energy policy that frees us from the grip of foreign oil, with a firm commitment and a long-term investment in alternative energy - wind, solar, biofuels, and clean coal. And let me say on that subject: John McCain doesn\'t believe clean coal is part of our energy future. Don\'t take my word for it - take his. He said ""...in a perfect world, we would like to transition away from coal entirely."" And now, he plans on giving the oil companies - who are recording the largest profits in the history of the United States another $4 billion in tax cuts. So make no mistake: the oil companies have placed their bet on Senator McCain. That\'s why Appalachia can\'t afford to.', ""Barack and I believe clean coal is part of our energy future. That's why we supported adding $200 million in funding for carbon capture and sequestration technology. Instead of pouring our energy dollars into the sands of Saudi Arabia and the pockets of Venezuela, we should be exporting home-made technology - solving not only our own energy challenges, but the worlds. We need to make an investment in rebuilding America's infrastructure - including broadband and the infrastructure of the future. Our plan that we estimate will create 12,000 jobs here in West Virginia alone. This is about jobs. But in a sense, it's about even more than jobs. It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about understanding what people are going through. When a job is lost or a house is foreclosed on, it's not just an economic loss... it's emotionally devastation. It's about having to make that long walk up that short flight of stairs...That's something I've experienced.

Nearly 1,500 West Virginians are currently deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. And 33 of these fallen angels have given their lives. We all love this country. We are all patriots. That\'s why we have to end the scurrilous phone calls -- which lie about Barack Obama and question his character. We\'re joined today by Chaylee Cole. Chaylee is a student at Fairmont State University who worked at a call center - where she was asked to make some of those attack calls.', 'She said no, and she was fired. But I want to read part of what Chaylee said when she was interviewed, ""Democrat or Republican, I wouldn\'t have done this."" Chaylee recognized that regardless of your personal politics, attacks like that don\'t hurt Barack.

(Applause.)"", 'And, folks, the day that President Obama and I were sworn in -- the day we were sworn in, that magnificent day on January 20th, looking out a million people on the mall, watching, we were handed that day a gigantic deficit and an economy that was in free fall, and we moved ahead. We moved ahead to get the economy moving again, but we also moved ahead to begin to cut the deficit.', 'Last year with the help of my two colleagues, we cut spending by $1 trillion. We also made a deal -- we also made a deal with our Republican friends to cut it by another $1.2 trillion and set up that super committee, remember? What did they come up with? Nothing.', 'And we were on our way, on the cusp of negotiating -- I was doing most of the negotiation for an agreement that would have cut the overall deficit by $4 trillion. But the Republicans, they walked away from it. Why? Because they wanted to maintain every major tax cut for the very wealthiest and have them move in perpetuity.', ""Look, they wanted an additional trillion dollars in tax cuts. And I want to explain to you -- when you say that, it's like, a trillion, that doesn't -- I mean a trillion, I can't even -- you can't even calculate that."", 'Let me put it this way, of that trillion dollars, $813 million of that trillion dollar tax cut will go to households making over $1 million a year. Three hundred and fifty -- 315,000 of the wealthiest families in America, average income $3.1 million a year, would get a $100,000 tax break per year for the next 10 years through that.', ""Look, we're not asking anybody very wealthy to change their standard of living. We're not -- no serious. We're not asking them to do anything they can't do now. On $3.1 million, you don't need another $100,000 to maintain your home, to drive the vehicle you drive, to vacation where you want to vacation. But when we ask you to take a 20 percent cut or a 30 percent cut in your Medicare or your Social Security or your children, that changes the standard of living."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, we don't think it's fair, and we don't think it's right. And more importantly, we don't think it's in the interest of the economic growth of this country. Folks, it's simple math, either preserve Medicare and fix Social Security and draw down the deficit, or you spend another trillion dollars on tax cuts for the wealthiest. You can't do both of these things. You can't do both, and we refuse -- we refuse to shift the burden and responsibility of putting America's fiscal house in order on the backs of those who will have to change their standard of living, who have played by the rules, who have worked hard all their life and have earned the retirement benefits they're getting. (Applause.)"", ""Ladies and gentlemen, like so many of you I came from a family where Medicare and Social Security made the difference in the lives of the people I love the most. I'm not sure, as I said, that these guys remember what it was like when folks didn't have Medicare. But I can remember -- a lot of you can remember it, as I said, and it wasn't an era -- it's not an era that we want to go back to again. Without Social Security, nearly half of American seniors, 17 million men and women would be struggling in poverty, just that -- just that alone."", ""Before Medicare, nearly half of all Americans, age 65, lacked health care, one-half of all Americans lacked health care. These programs have afforded the elderly a sense -- and I don't like the world elderly anymore, man. (Laughter.) I'm not big on that word, are you? I don't like that elderly."", ""I mean for years I used to rip up the AARP bulletins I got. (Laughter.) But I'm not ripping up my Social Security checks, you know what I mean? (Laughter.) But I don't like elderly -- those of us who are more mature. Those of us who are more mature. (Applause.)"", ""But I tell you what, it's about -- it's about our independence. It's about the dignity everybody craves. They argue that cutting now is the only way to save programs for the next generation -- I read an article in the paper today here about that. That's not how I see it. Retirement is multigenerational. It's a matter -- it matters to your children if you have a decent retirement. Every one of you -- it matters to your children. Because if you don't, your children feel obliged to step up. Caring for a parent is a privilege and one that any honorable child will try to undertake. But for some families it would come at an incredibly high cost because they're struggling so badly themselves."", ""The cost for my family was de minimis because of the circumstance my mom's four children were in. But there's a lot of families you know that can't get their kid to college, they're having trouble paying the mortgage, they're out of a job, and the added burden of looking at mom and dad and knowing they don't have the health care they need or having to make these choices that you talked about when you go into the drugstore. That's something that is multigenerational."", ""When families are stretched thin, it forces very hard choices. And I say families -- not when we are stretched thin, when our children as well are stretched thin. So, folks, this is about more than the monthly payment or access to health care, it's about who we are."", ""The last thing my mother and father wanted to do was be a burden to me, my brothers or my sister or to our children. Social Security and Medicare helped them live independently right to the very end, preserve their dignity, and most importantly from my dad's perspective, his pride."", ""So when these guys in the name of saving the next generation choose to cut Social Security and voucherize Medicare rather than asking for shared responsibility from all, they're not saving the next generation, they're thrusting an incredible burden on the next generation. And they're thrusting it on them right now. (Applause.)"", ""They're making it even harder for the middle class at a time when we know if we were -- if we want our economy to be strong, the middle class has to be strong. They're tearing the bonds that connect us, generation to generation at the very moment we should be strengthening those bonds."", ""Ladies and gentlemen, this year you're going to make some choices about what you want -- who you want to lead this country and who will speak up for you and speak in the way you want on this and many other issues."", 'On this issue, I ask you to do one thing, as I said in the beginning, when you look at Barack and me, when you look at our opponents, take our measure. I used to say when I ran as a kid, look me over. If you like what you see, vote for me. If not, vote for the other guy. (Laughter.) But look us over, and look into your heart. Look into your heart, and ask yourself the question after all the speeches are done: Who do you believe? Who do you believe is genuinely committed to preserving the dignity of people in terms of their health care and their basic, basic ability to live?', 'Thank you all, very, very much. (Applause.) I love you. Thanks for having me.']",1

And I want to tell you something, I know I'm back in Iowa when the guy introducing you from the factory floor speaks better than you do, I know I'm back in -- I know I'm back in Iowa. (Laughter and applause.) Incredible state. You're an incredible state."", ""I understand the Mayor of Eldridge is here and -- Martin O'Boyle. Terry, thank you for the opportunity of allowing me on the factory floor here, and I understand the chancellor of Eastern Iowa Community College, Don Doucette, is here. Don, where are you? Thank you very much, Don. I'm going to talk about what you guys are doing in just a minute."", ""And, folks, first of all, as it relates to the story that was just told by Chuck, it reminds me, my dad used to have an expression. He'd say -- I mean this sincerely, a guy who had lost jobs, a guy who had to move and move his family -- he said, Joey, you got to understand one thing, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your respect. It's about your sense of yourself. It's about your place in the community."", ""And too many people have been stripped of their dignity as a consequence of this God-awful recession we've inherited. And we're determined -- we're determined -- I think all of us, Republican and Democrat -- are determined to turn that around."", ""But first I want to thank -- I want to thank Terry, the president of PCT, and I also want to thank the community college for doing what is a remarkable thing that's happening all across America, for partnering -- for partnering with this great company and producing jobs, making sure the skills available match the needs."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, I come here today with a very, very simple message: Manufacturing is back. Manufacturing is back. (Applause.)', ""And, folks, that's not only good news for Chuck and all the fellow workers here on this factory floor, it's good news for America. But it's even better news for America's middle class. (Applause.) They've taken an awful beating over the last decade or more, and what's happened just in the last couple years: 430,000 new manufacturing jobs just since 2010; more than 15,000 new manufacturing jobs here in the state of Iowa; the fastest growth in manufacturing since the '90s."", ""After years of hearing the word outsourcing, our children are going to hear a new word as much as we heard outsourcing. It's called insourcing. It's called insourcing. (Applause.)"", ""Because, folks, the facts are -- and you're going to see more of them -- the facts are that the jobs that left the United States are coming back to the United States. Plants that closed are opening, opening and reinvented. Companies like John Deere expanding here in Davenport and in Waterloo and in Des Moines, where they added nearly 500 new jobs in the past two years, good paying jobs. Siemens Wind employs 500 people at Fort Madison. Sixty-five percent of them used to work in companies in the area that are either closed or downsized. So, folks, America is coming back. It's not a political slogan; it's a reality. And it's happening in the sector that built the middle class in manufacturing."", 'Look, you know a lot of my Republican friends and some of our political opponents wonder why the President and I have spent so much time working to bring manufacturing back. No one in the Heartland has to wonder about that. You all know why. You all know why because you were the manufacturing center of the world, and you saw what happened when those jobs were lost.', ""You know that manufacturing jobs just aren't any old jobs. They are good paying jobs; jobs you can raise a family on. Jobs that allow you to own a home and not just rent; jobs that give you the promise of being able to send your kid to college. And here in Iowa, the average manufacturing job pays almost $50,000 a year. And they're jobs that matter to everyone, as was mentioned by Chuck, because they not only are good for America -- they're good for America, because they make America competitive again. And they're jobs of building products of the future in industries of the future for an economy that's able to compete for the future, products like the electronic beam systems built here at PCT -- remarkable."", ""These are jobs building products that export to consumers not just here but all around the world, expanding world markets for the United States of America. You know about that too. Fifty percent -- all the workers here know that 50 percent of what they produce here at PCT Engineering are sales that are destined to be exported. That's a big deal."", ""They're jobs that anchor our communities. They're jobs that get the local community moving again, manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing jobs create more jobs, other jobs -- jobs in diners, hardware stores, schools, police departments. But most importantly, they're jobs that can help rebuild the middle class, which has been battered. And nobody knows it better than all of you."", 'Look, it matters because real growth, growth that is widely shared, the only growth that really matters -- growth that is widely shared by everyone in this country -- can only happen when the middle class is growing again. When the middle class is growing, everyone does well. The wealthy do very well, as they should, and those who are not wealthy have a shot, a ladder maybe they can climb up to change their circumstance.', ""But the middle class will only grow if we build an economy that can support the middle class. And manufacturing is not the only part, but it's a critical part to bringing back the middle class. And no one knows that better than the people of Iowa, who know the essential role that -- it's not only manufacturing. Look at Iowa and agriculture and the role agriculture plays in the economic health and well-being of this nation. That's why the President and I are so proud that last year farm exports reached a record high of $137 billion, $23 billion higher than ever before."", ""That's not only good for the economic well-being of Iowa farmers, it's good for the economic well-being of the entire country. And with the new trade agreements the President negotiated, we expect an additional $2.3 billion in the coming years in agricultural products supporting an additional 20,000 jobs here at home. But it's not only the agricultural sector that's going to benefit from these new trade agreements. It will create tens of thousands of more jobs in manufacturing in the high-tech sector because of these agreements."", ""And, folks, we're not just fighting harder to be able to export our products -- agriculture or manufactured -- abroad. They're important, but we're fighting to export complex, high-tech services as well, services that Americans provide better than any other people in the world, but things most people don't think about -- (applause) -- things most don't think about, that they contribute and contribute tens of billions of dollars to our economy like construction, engineering, health care technology, IT. We do that better than anyone in the world."", ""We recently signed an agreement, after my negotiations with the Vice President of China, opening America's automobile insurance industry to the largest automobile market in the world. You say, what does that have to do? If you have access for American automobile insurance companies to sell insurance, which has been blocked up to now, in China to the largest number of folks in the world who drive automobiles, that's real money. That's real jobs. That's real jobs back here at home."", 'But ultimately, it all comes down to the same question, the real question, quite frankly, of this election and the challenge of our time -- will we be a country that values the role of workers in the success of businesses and values the middle class in the success of the economy or are we going to move backwards to the same disastrous philosophy that rewarded speculators rather than builders?', ""Look, this is the third in a series of speeches I'm giving on behalf of our administration laying out the stark choices we believe the American people are going to face in November and what's at stake for the middle class. Today, I want to focus primarily on manufacturing because President Obama and I -- President Obama and I have been working to rebuild our manufacturing sector and rebuild our country because we think they're one and the same. We don't know how you do one without the other. We don't know how you leave it out, manufacturing and rebuild the country."", ""So let me tell you what we've done, but maybe equally as important, let me tell you what we think we have to do, what more we have to do. When we came into office, the manufacturing sector, had been neglected badly and was getting devastated."", 'During the 2000s, before we came in, 5.8 million manufacturing jobs were lost in the United States of America. Right here in Iowa, you lost 53,000 manufacturing jobs. You saw companies like Maytag and Electolux and many others close shop. Thousands of factories closed out and laid off workers, a lot of them reopened in places like Vietnam, Mexico, China, ""cheaper markets."" And we were told -- how many times have you been told over the last 15 years that America\'s days as a leading manufacturer in the world had passed?', 'Look, the President and I said, where is it written, where is it written that says our day has passed in anything? The President and I fundamentally disagreed with that proposition. And by the way, it was a widely held proposition, not just with our friends on the other side, with a whole lot of people.', 'We knew -- we knew we had to get manufacturing back on its feet again because for every one of those manufacturing jobs lost, somebody lost their place in the middle class. For every one of those jobs lost.', 'So we went to work first and foremost over significant opposition, and with Mitt Romney arguing that we should let Detroit go bankrupt.', 'AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Booo!', 'THE VICE PRESIDENT: What we did is we rescued the auto industry. We administered some of the very toughest medicine -- (Applause.) We were criticized by many on our side. We administered some very tough medicine, but together we saved literally 1 million jobs.', ""And since restructuring, the industry has already added back another 200,000 jobs and GM is leading the world again as the world's largest automobile manufacturer. (Applause.)"", ""Folks, we knew that was essential, but not enough, so we went to work to provide a skilled workforce for companies that have already come back or are bringing their folks back. We met with the leading companies in the world who came to the White House in January. They pointed out to us that right now there are 600,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States that companies who have come back home can't fill because of their inability to match the workers' skills with the need of the companies."", 'So we launched a partnership between what my wife, Jill, who is a community college professor, calls the best-kept secret -- (Applause.) Beautiful. What my wife, Jill, calls the best-kept secret in America, American community colleges. And businesses looking to fill those 600,000 slots married up with them.', ""We've also proposed an $8 billion partnership to give more momentum to this effort. My wife and the Secretary of Labor, Secretary Solis, just did an 800-mile bus trip, starting off in Iowa, working all the way -- their way through Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, visiting community college and business after community college and business, providing hundreds and hundreds of good paying jobs because they're training directly, exactly what the companies need."", ""And it was all over the countryside, from Tennessee, to North Carolina, to Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, and it's working. So let me say it again, thank you, Terry. And thank you, Dr. Paper, and thank you, Chancellor -- Dr. Paper, and thank you, Chancellor, for this partnership of yours. You are one of the reasons why. You're literally one of the reasons why American companies are now insourcing instead of outsourcing."", ""We've committed to breaking down barriers that block access of American products to overseas markets, so the rest of the world and the consumers can understand what we already know, that we make the best products. No one makes a better product than American workers, and there's no worker in the world more productive than an American worker. That's not hyperbole. That is a fact. That is literally a fact. (Applause.)"", ""In addition, the President has signed into law three free trade agreement with Korea, Colombia and Panama. They're going to open up markets for the best products in the world -- for the best products in the world, Made in America products, to all those countries, which now can't get into those countries and are committed to leveling the playing field across the board."", ""To that end, we created for the first time a thing we call the Trade Enforcement Unit, whose sole job is to crack down on countries that pursue unfair trade practices. We're not -- we don't think that's a trade war. We think that's a fair way to trade. And so just this month, we brought a new trade case against China."", 'China is unfairly limiting American access to so-called rare earth materials that they possess, that are needed by American manufacturers to make high-tech products like electronic vehicles and advanced electronics.', 'We changed the tax code to give a 30 percent tax credit to a company that builds wind turbines, solar panels or other clean energy products here in the United States rather than abroad. (Applause.) The result so far -- the result so far is $2.3 billion of new investment in factories built here in the United States of America, rather than abroad. (Applause.)', 'Look, even more to come as they invest in new plants and equipment right now, right now if they invest, by allowing them to write off more rapidly the cost of the factory, the cost of the equipment, the cost of their vehicles so they can expand opportunities. That means more people being hired.', ""The bottom line is we're changing the paradigm here. We're rewarding instead of penalizing American companies that invest in building and hiring here in America, and manufacturers are responding. They're hiring workers by the hundreds of thousands. They're exploiting products all around the world."", ""With this added incentive, we're on pace to double, as the President committed to, double American exports by the year 2015. And let me translate what that means, if we double American exports by the year 2015, that creates another 2 million American jobs. (Applause.)"", ""So, folks -- so all those skeptics and our Republican opponents who -- especially don't tell me that America can't make things anymore; can't compete in the world market anymore; can't lead the world again any more. We will lead the world again in every aspect of the economy. (Applause.)"", ""And, folks, we've already begun. You've begun -- not me -- you've begun, and we're not done. For years, American manufacturers have faced one of the highest tax rates in the world. We want to reduce that by over 20 percent. We want to drop the rate particularly for high-tech manufacturers like you, Mr. President, even further than the 20 percent. We want to create what's called a global minimum tax, because American taxpayers shouldn't be providing a larger subsidy for investing abroad than investing at home. (Applause.)"", 'Look, we want to end and we want to end it right now, the practice of getting a tax break, which you saw happen here in Iowa for dismantling a factory, floor to ceiling, and shipping it abroad and getting a moving expense to go abroad. Instead, we should be giving a tax credit to companies that dismantle factories abroad and bring them back home. (Applause.)', ""Look, this and a lot of other ways is why we're bringing American manufacturing back and it's how we're going to grow the middle class. Look, folks, conventional wisdom that manufacturing is dead in this country is dead wrong -- dead wrong -- and we've got to maintain this momentum. But if you'll forgive me for saying this, one thing that could bring this momentum to a screeching halt is turning over the keys of the White House to Santorum or Romney. (Applause.)"", 'Look, they\'re both good guys. They\'re both good guys and I\'ve worked with Rick for a long time. Senator Santorum is the only one of them who is even claiming to care about manufacturing, but his Senate record tells a different story. He voted against ending loopholes for companies that move manufacturing jobs offshore, from America offshore. And just like Mitt Romney, when asked if we should have rescued the automobile industry, he said, ""No, absolutely not.""', 'But if Senator Santorum has been inconsistent in what he has said and what he has done, Mitt Romney has been remarkably consistent -- (laughter) -- as an investor/businessman, as the governor of Massachusetts, and now as a candidate for President, remarkably consistent and I respectfully suggest, consistently wrong. (Applause.)', ""Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, when he was CEO of Bain Capital, Bain Capital closed down two factories in South Florida that made medical devices, moving the production to Germany. They shut down a plant in South Carolina and cut jobs in another one in Rhode Island that made photo albums and picture frames and outsourced production overseas. I'm tempted to say, Mitt, thanks for the memories. (Laughter.) You know what I mean?"", 'As governor of Massachusetts, he repeatedly slashed funding for workforce training in manufacturing specifically. And despite the fact that millions of taxpayer dollars were flowing to companies outsourcing state services like overseas call centers, he vetoed a bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature that would have stopped the state from outsourcing contracts overseas, state contracts.', ""Look, think about it, a Massachusetts taxpayer with a question -- this is how it works -- with a question about Massachusetts state services, picks up the phone, dials an 800 number expecting to talk to somebody in the Massachusetts government to get an answer to their question. And instead, he talking to -- or she's talking to someone on the other side of the world and all of it paid for by his or her tax dollars. I find that kind of fascinating. (Laughter.) No, I really mean it. I mean, that's one when I was told about, I said, I'm not going to say that until you fact check that for me again."", ""But think about it, it's one thing for the local company to outsource a call service, but for the state government to outsource a call service that's set up to answer questions for people in the state about a problem they have with the government, to outsource that, denying folks in Massachusetts the jobs that are attendant to that? Is it any surprise to you that Massachusetts, under Governor Romney, was losing manufacturing jobs twice as fast as the rest of the country?"", ""Now, as a presidential candidate, he has proposed a new international tax system that zeroes out taxes for companies that create jobs outside the United States of America. I'm not making this stuff up."", ""Look, your -- President Obama and Governor Romney, Joe Biden, and whoever the nominee is going to be, we are talking about taxes and the burden on manufacturers. But there's a big difference. Our tax cuts go to companies that create jobs over here. The Romney tax cut goes to companies that create jobs overseas. It's a fundamentally different philosophy from ours."", 'When China was dumping tires into the international marketplace, hurting American manufacturers of tires and their workers, President Obama stepped up and enforced our trade laws and won. Governor Romney, at the time, called what the President has done protectionism. That\'s his quote -- ""protectionism."" Now, when it\'s politically expedient, he wants to get really tough on China.', 'Look, it\'s a different philosophy. Governor Romney has called the President of the United States ""out of touch"" -- that\'s a quote, ""out of touch"" -- for encouraging young people to try to get manufacturing jobs. Out of touch? Romney? (Laughter and applause.) I mean, pretty remarkable, pretty remarkable. As an old friend of mine says, that\'s chutzpah. (Laughter.) Look, the Wall Street Journal wrote, ""Romney appeared to scoff first in Detroit, then in Florida at the notion of manufacturing as a job engine for the future.""', 'So, look, folks, we have a choice in this election between our philosophy that believes manufacturing is central to our economy and their philosophy that scoffs at it, between our philosophy that says there is nothing out of touch about fighting for the future of the middle class by creating manufacturing jobs -- a philosophy that says if the folks at the top -- and their philosophy says if the folks at the top do well, everything else will do well. How many times have you heard about the job creators?', ""Look, Governor Romney's business practices and his policies have clearly benefited the wealthy and most powerful among us, often at the expense of working and middle-class families. They actually believe it's the best way. I'm not doubting their belief. But it just doesn't work that way."", 'As the President said, and I quote, ""this"" -- meaning the middle class -- ""this is the defining issue of our time. This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class, and for all those who are fighting to get into the middle class.""', ""Folks, I stood outside of a lot of plant gates in my career, both here in this state, the state of Iowa, and in my home state of Delaware, shaking hands and asking for support. I've also stood outside those gates -- like the General Motors gate of my home state -- asking those -- when those workers needed my help because the plant was shutting down, going somewhere else. Those are the days that stick with me the most in my career."", ""Those are the days when the longest walk that these folks were taking wasn't from the factory floor to the parking lot for the last time, it was up that flight of stairs they had to go up once they got home into their child's bedroom to say, Honey, I'm sorry but you're not going to be able to go back to Roosevelt High School, or St. Mary's, or not be able to be in that little league; Daddy, Mommy, I lost my job. We've got to do something else."", ""My dad made that walk when I was young. An awful lot of kids heard the same words I heard, except the difference between then and now was that my father said everything was going to be okay. In the mid '50s he believed it, and I believed it. So many people have made that walk in the recent past five, six, seven years, and they can't even say with certainty when they look at their child up until now, it's going to be okay."", ""But the good news is that today, hundreds of thousands of workers are replacing that longest walk with walks of a totally different journey. (Applause.) A journey that ends with workers who are able to come home and say, I've got a job -- just like you were. (Applause.) I've got a job."", ""They've been able to say, I've got a good job building amazing products that the world wants to buy. That's what makes me so optimistic. We've got a way to go yet, but knowing these journeys are taking place again in the thousands -- more of them every single day."", ""Look, some of you know me fairly well. My entire career I've been characterized as an optimist, since I got elected as a 29-year-old kid to the Senate. Well, I've got to tell you, I mean this sincerely, I've never been more optimistic in my life about the prospects for America. (Applause.) America today is better positioned than any country in the world to lead the 21st Century. (Applause.)"", ""Folks, it's not just manufacturing that's coming back. The middle class is coming back. America is coming back. Worker by worker, home by home, neighborhood by neighborhood, the country is coming back. So as my grandpop would say, keep the faith. And thank you.

I've spoken about the rescue of the automobile industry, the American automobile industry; about retirement security and having America lead the world again in manufacturing. And today, I want to speak about a fourth topic that's going to impact significantly on -- with the other three -- on the state of the middle class in America, and that is the tax system."", ""All of these issues touch the most fundamental issue of all: How do we rebuild an economy with a strong and growing middle class? That's the challenge. As the President says, that's the challenge of our time."", ""When all is said and done, this campaign we're on is going to really boil down to a very simple question: Are we going to rebuild an economy with a middle class that's growing and not shrinking? And we are going to restore the value that says, in America if you work hard, you can get ahead, that personal responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone -- everyone -- from Main Street to Wall Street will play by the same rules?"", ""We are as a country going to make I believe the responsible choice to ensure that that kind of future we want for our children is back within reach for our children. Because you know the neighborhoods you grew up in, so many parents today of young children have doubt unlike we had raising our children that if they played by those rules, if they did it by the numbers, if they worked hard, they could be certain that they'd provide that opportunity for their children. That's what this is really all about."", ""And part of the debate is about the tax system we have, and the subject that's on everyone's mind as April 15th approaches. President Obama and I believe that it's simply wrong to have a system that's so riddled with loopholes and preferences that the wealthiest and most successful of all Americans often pay at a lower rate -- at a lower rate of their taxes than average middle-class people do."", 'Warren Buffett who many people in America have come to know as an extremely successful, generous and gregarious man who shined a very, very bright light on this subject about -- when he noted the absurd fact that he, as a billionaire under the current tax laws, pays actually at a lower tax rate than his secretary pays.', ""But the thing is he's not alone. There are tens of thousands and several millions of people who are in that same situation that -- making over a million dollars do the same exact thing. It happens all the time because the law allows it and because we are fortunate enough to -- they're fortunate enough to hire good accountants and lawyers who know who to take full advantage of every aspect of the tax code."", 'And so as we start, we have -- we decided how do we gain this -- how do we begin to get this back under control? How do we being to right the ship here so middle-class people have an even chance?', ""And to start, we started by proposing what we call the Buffett Rule to ensure that no one who makes a million dollars or more in any single given year will pay at an effective tax rate that's less than 30 percent. It's simply a matter of fairness."", 'But more than that, it\'s also, I would argue, a matter of common sense. Let me read you a quote, and this is a quote from someone else: ""Just a moment ago, I told some people about a letter I just received. It\'s a letter from a man out there in the country, an executive who\'s earning six figures, well above a hundred thousand dollars a year. He wrote me,"" it goes on to say, in support of my -- ""in support of the tax plan because he said, I am legally able to take advantage of the present tax code, nothing dishonest, doing what the law prescribes and wind up paying a smaller tax than my secretary pays. That letter wasn\'t written to Warren Buffett. That letter was written to and read by President Ronald Reagan.', 'The person went to say, ""and I\'d like to be able to come to Washington to be able to testify before the Congress to explain to them how I do that and why it\'s wrong.""', 'Look, I remember -- I remember a time not too long ago when President Clinton was President of the United States, and when he left office, he left America with an enormous surplus and an enormous projected surplus. I was proud to have been in the Senate at the time and helped him accomplish that goal.', 'But then Washington made a series of really bad choices after he left: Two huge tax cuts, two huge tax cuts, neither of which were paid for, skewed overwhelmingly to the very wealthiest Americans of all; two wars -- two wars -- carried on the books, not a single penny paid for either one of those wars; and a [sic] Medicaid drug program worthy but also not paid for. In addition, the Bush administration went on and eviscerated the oversight functions of the federal government, and as a consequence too many investors bet on short-term gains and made extremely risky financial schemes. And you know the result, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.', 'So when Barack and I came to office, when we walked in the door at the peak of this crisis, we were handed a $1 trillion bill, deficit projection for that year, which started -- which started in September, the budget year, we were handed a $1 trillion bill before we were -- we had 10 minutes on the job, and the near certainty that we were going to lose several more million jobs before we even could get started with our program -- billions of dollars in lost revenues as a consequence of the Great Recession, coupled with the steps that had to be taken to prevent that recession from turning into a depression, which added more to the deficit.', ""And now -- now that we turn the corner, we're faced with another choice: Do we pay down those deficits, cutting wherever we can, as we've been doing, while at the same time investing in things we know we must invest in, in order for the economy to grow and create good, middle-class jobs? We know what they are. It's invest in education, research and development, new technologies, clean energy. Or do we continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on tax windfalls for millionaires, windfalls they don't need and I might ask, they never asked for it?"", ""I come from a wealthy little state. I often point out, wealthy people are just as patriotic as poor people. They're just as patriotic as middle-class people, and I think they know -- I think they know they should be doing more."", ""And now Governor Romney and others argue that if we keep these windfalls and then shower even more windfalls on the very wealthiest, that's how America's economy will grow. That's how we will create jobs. That's their thesis in a nutshell. It amazes. It absolutely amazes me. He offers this prescription as if it's somehow a new idea, folks, like something we haven't seen before; even worse -- like something we haven't actually tried before."", ""Folks, we've seen this movie before. You've seen the movie. It does not end well. It does not end well. (Laughter.) Where has he been? (Applause.) Where has he been?"", ""Could it be that he's out of touch? (Laughter.) I don't know, but I tell you what, he missed the movie. (Laughter.) Although he benefitted from the movie."", 'Folks, this is the same argument that was touted out a decade ago by President George Bush to justify the unjustifiable tax cuts for the very wealthy then. And look what happened. It actually had the opposite impact. It produced the slowest job growth in half a century. And during that period from 2000 to 2007, middle-income people actually lost $2,300 in income. They actually retreated, did not grow. But it is true that the very top did very, very, very well. But the impact was our economy faltered, the middle class shrank, the poor got poorer, and ultimately the economy collapsed.', ""And on whom did it collapse? It collapsed on all of you. It collapsed on the middle class, and it came down with a crash -- $1.7 trillion in lost income -- lost value, the American people. You watched the equities in your homes evaporate. You watched your 401(k)s be eviscerated. That's what it produced, and now Mitt Romney wants to take us down that same road again."", 'Let me state it plainly. The President and I are determined to do all in our power to make sure we never go down that road again. (Applause.)', ""Look, folks, it really is a simple, straightforward proposition. There's nothing very complicated about this. We believe, as I suspect most of you do, Democrats and Republicans, we believe it's fundamentally unfair to ask some middle-class families to pay more and to lose more opportunity so a millionaire can pay less."", ""Look, it's that simple. I don't know any person -- I don't know any reasonable person, regardless of their political background, who disagrees with that proposition. Back when we were trying to put more teachers and cops back on the street, and we had a very small tax -- surtax on the first dollar over a million dollars, the polls showed the vast majority of millionaires thought it was the right thing to do."", ""So I don't buy this argument Republicans offer. I don't buy this argument that the very wealthy aren't prepared to contribute to the recovery in the same way that everybody else is prepared -- they're not prepared. They're not prepared."", ""Ronald Reagan, Warren Buffett, Diedre, the President -- nobody that I know, no reasonable person, at least in my view thinks this is the American way. In America, we're not supposed to have a system that's rigged. We're not supposed to have a system with one set of rules for the very wealthy and one set of rules for everybody else. And I might add if you notice, we've maintained our position that nobody under $250,000 would have their taxes raised, and where I come from, that's wealthy."", ""This is -- we're talking about the very wealthy. Ladies and gentlemen, time and again, time and again, middle-class Americans have shown their willingness to stand up and do their part in times of political, economic or military crisis -- time and again. But the one thing the neighborhoods I come from and I suspect all of you, the one thing we don't like being played for is a sucker. The one thing we don't like is being played for as a sucker. (Applause.)"", ""So when you all pay your taxes next week, you and every citizen in New Hampshire and my home state of Delaware ought to be able to know that everyone one else is paying their fair share, as well. But the truth is you know they're not. The truth is when you pay those taxes you know not everyone is paying their fair share."", ""And, folks, it's not just the Buffett Rule. The Buffett Rule is not going to solve all problems. It just brings a modicum of fairness at the outset here. If Governor Romney has his way, we'll have the Romney Rule. And I mean it sincerely -- this isn't a cute little deal. There's a Romney Rule. The Romney Rule says, let's double down on the tax cuts for the wealthy."", ""Look, folks, it's not -- this is not about -- this not about class warfare; this is about math. This is about math and people's lives. As my dad used to say, and I know the Congressman has heard me say this many times, don't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I will tell you what you value. Show me your budget and I will tell you what you value. (Laughter and applause.)"", ""So let's take a look. Let's take a look. Let's take a look what the Romney Rule values, what the Governor values, and his colleagues. He values Bush tax cuts to be made permanent for the wealthy. The ones that are intended to expire this December, he wants to extend them permanently. That will cost $1 trillion over the next 10 years; $800 billion of that trillion going to people who make a minimum of $1 million. And to add insult to injury, the Romney Rule proposes to give another $250,000-a-year tax cut to the average millionaire, on top of maintaining the Bush tax cuts."", ""I know -- if you hadn't watched all the debates, you'd probably think I'm making this up. (Laughter.) But seriously, that's what -- that's what he calls for, the Romney Rule calls for. That's another trillion dollars in tax cuts over the next 10 years going to the top 1 percent of American taxpayers."", '(Baby cries.)', ""THE VICE PRESIDENT: I don't blame her for crying. She's going to -- (Laughter and applause.) She is going to inherit it. She's going to pay for it. That's one smart baby. (Laughter and applause.)"", ""Look, folks, let me say it again, the Bush tax cuts for the very wealthy, and the new proposal of a trillion dollars in additional tax cuts. These are tax cuts that folks in that category, the vast majority, didn't ask for. They didn't ask for them. They don't need them to maintain their standard of living. And by the way, I'm being serious about that. The only time people really sacrifice is when they lose a tax break or a tax structure that forces them to change their standard of living. That what changes people -- when you have to move out of your house and rent, instead of own; when you can't send your kid to college and you can only send them to trade school and so on and so forth. But nobody in the category designed to benefit from these tax cuts is going to have to change one, single aspect of their standard of living."", ""It's a stark choice we have to make, a choice between the Romney Rule that I think will take the country -- take the country in a direction that we don't want to go. Look, the Buffett Rule says no one making more than a million dollars will pay a smaller share of their income taxes than middle-class families do. And you'll hear them come back and say, well, the effective tax rate for middle-class families is lower and so on, a lot of what that is said it true, but the bottom line is -- let me put it another way: Anybody making a million dollars can't pay 30 percent in taxes? That's lower than the prescribed tax rate for millionaires already -- not just for millionaires, for people making over $200,000."", 'The Romney Rule says that the very wealthy should keep every tax break and loophole they have and get additional new tax cuts every year that are worth more than what the average middle-class family makes in a year -- in an entire year! And in the neighborhoods -- I asked them to look up what the average income in this area is -- that one -- new $250,000-a-year tax break would be roughly -- if the numbers we were given are right -- somewhere between two -- excuse me, four times greater than the average income of a family in this -- in ""this neighborhood."" It\'s just not fair.', ""But beyond being not fair, it is literally bad economic policy. It is bad economic policy. I understand -- we understand rewarding risk. We understand rewarding people who innovate. We understand that. We understand some cases that deserve a different tax treatment to get people to take risks to benefit us all. But let me put this in perspective by giving you an illustration. This summer -- and Diedre just indirectly referenced it -- this summer, the interest rate on student loans is supposed to double, is set to double. We are pushing the Congress to try to hold it at what it is, 3.8 percent. It's going to double now -- unless we enact the President's plan."", ""With the Romney Rule, we couldn't afford to do anything like that. You know what it would mean to middle-class families in New Hampshire with a couple of kids going to college, will see their interest rates double. Just imagine if tomorrow, your interest rate on your car loan doubled, what it means out of your pocket. Imagine tomorrow if the interest rate you're paying on your mortgage doubled. I think these guys don't come from the same place we come from. That makes a difference. It makes a difference in your standard of living. It makes a difference in what you can do for your family. It matters."", ""It's all about the impact of the Romney Rule on the middle class or the Obama-Biden approach. It's about whether or not you're going to be able to afford to send your kids to college, whether or not you can live in a safe neighborhood because there's adequate resources to have sufficient police protection and fire protection. It's about whether or not your mom can pick up all her prescription drugs and not leave two at the counter."", ""My mom was living with me. I didn't even know she was doing it till I followed her to the drug store, literally, and watched my mom say to the druggist, no, Honey, that's okay. I only need four of these. It's about whether or not working moms, as Diedre, can afford not just childcare, decent childcare -- decent childcare."", ""Look, in our view the fair way to do this is also the right way to do this, the economically sound way to do this, and that's why the President and I have been talking about this and we'll continue to talk about it for a while."", 'Let me tell you what we propose in addition to the Buffett Rule. We laid out a plan to reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, and people say, well, how do you do that? Well, we do that by making some very painful cuts -- we already cut over a trillion dollars, painful cuts.', ""But we also get that $4 trillion by coming up with $1.5 trillion by ending unnecessary tax breaks for the very wealthy, so our children don't have to carry the burden. That's how we get to $4 trillion. You can't get there without cutting bone and marrow if you don't include the elimination of the tax breaks for the very wealthiest among us."", ""If we put the Buffett Rule in place, let the Bush tax cuts expire for the very wealthy, and reject Romney's additional trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthy, America will be able to do the things we need to do to grow the economy. And you all know -- everyone knows what they are."", ""We can't be the most competitive nation in the world when we rank 16th in the world in the percent of college graduates we have as a nation. We have to invest in education. It is self-evident. But to do that, to do that, you have to say it's more important to help educate hundreds of children or send hundreds of kids to college than to give one billionaire the Romney rule tax cuts because that it would equate to. (Applause.) One, just one. (Applause.)"", ""And you don't even have to go to billionaire. How many kids can we send to college for $250,000 a year, the tax break he wants to add for people making over a million? Look, choices matter. They have consequences. The President and I will make that choice but Mitt Romney will make a different choice."", ""We believe we need to provide tax credits for cutting-edge manufacturing enterprises so Americans will be able to lead the world in the industries of the future, what you're doing up here in New Hampshire -- providing good paying jobs for a growing middle class. But to do that -- to do that, you have to say that creating jobs in America is more important than another tax break for millionaires and billionaires, or for that matter, a tax break that is going to go overseas. (Applause.)"", ""The American people know the choice the President and I have made, and we're going to make sure they know the choice the Romney rule is making. Look, Governor Romney and his friends just have a -- they're good people, but they have a fundamentally different economic philosophy than we do."", ""It's -- to put it bluntly, we think it's out of step with basic American values. Now, I'm not calling these guys un-American; they're sound, patriotic Americans. I don't want to hear anybody play that game with me. But it is out of step, at least with the American values, those middle-class values that most of us were raised with. And Governor Romney calls the President out of touch, and anti-woman, by the way but I -- out of touch? Hey, how many of you all have a Swiss bank account? (Laughter and applause.) No one? And how many of you have somewhere between $20 and $100 million in your IRA?"", 'AUDIENCE MEMBER: Oh, I do.', ""THE VICE PRESIDENT: All right. I've got to meet you. I've got to meet you. (Applause.) Out of touch? He calls the President out of touch? Look, folks, the President and I -- as I've said before -- we value investment and risk. And risk should be rewarded and investment should be encouraged, but we also value work. We also value the work of our hands and the work of our head. We value the work of the American people because guess what -- when they work, everything is added in value, everything has a higher value."", ""Look, this is the basic choice in the election. The President and I are determined to make the economy work for everybody -- everybody. Not just because it's fair -- literally, not just because it's fair. That's reason enough. But we believe, and history shows, when the middle class grows the wealthy get wealthier, the poor have a better shot, the economy is sound and the economy grows. We believe in a fair shot and a fair shake. Governor Romney and those who share his philosophy believe in no rules, no risk when you fail taking a risk, and no accountability."", ""Folks, I want to state it very plainly -- the President and I have absolute confidence in the American people. That's not hyperbole. We have absolute confidence in the American people. They have been and continue to be the most innovative and productive people on the planet. That is a fact. We have absolute faith because we know, given the opportunity, they have never, never, never, never failed to step up -- never."", 'And we also know one other thing: We are better positioned as a nation -- and you should know we are better positioned as a nation, counting every nation -- China, every other nation in the world -- we are better positioned as a nation at this moment to be the leading economy in the 21st century, if we act responsibly, if we invest in our people, if we invest in education, if we invest in innovation, if we invest in new technologies, if we invest in alternative energy. We have absolute confidence.', 'And one other thing, that although we have a long way to go, we are on the right track. Twenty-five months of growth -- not enough, but we are on the right track. And let me make it clear to you, and I want to say it as plainly as I can, this is no time to turn back.', 'God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all so very much. Thank you.

I got elected. Before I was eligible to serve, I had to literally wait to be sworn in because I wasn\'t eligible under the Constitution. You must be 30 years old.

(Applause.)"", ""Folks, over the last -- the past months, I've given on behalf of the campaign a series of speeches on major issues in this campaign laying down the markers, at least from our perspective, of the President and mine, the distinguishing differences between the President [sic] and us on a series of issues -- issues that we believe affect the middle class and our country's future."", ""I've spoken about the rescue of the American automobile industry in Toledo, Ohio. I've spoken about retirement security down in Florida, about leading the world again in manufacturing in the Quad Cities area, and about the tax system and the unfairness of it and how to make fair up in New Hampshire."", 'Today, I will -- this is the fifth in the series of those speeches, and I want to talk about an American President\'s single most important responsibility -- single most important responsibility -- and that\'s keeping our fellow citizens safe and our nation secure, particularly at a time of such extraordinary challenge and change.

Al Qaeda was resurgent and Osama bin Laden was at large. Our alliances were dangerously frayed. And our economy -– the foundation of our national security -– was on the precipice of a new depression.', ""President Obama began to act immediately. He set in motion a policy to end the war in Iraq responsibly. He set a clear strategy and an end date for the war in Afghanistan, which has been going on for close to a decade. He cut in half the number of Americans who are literally serving in harm's way. He decimated al Qaeda's senior leadership. He repaired our alliances and restored America's standing in the world and he saved our economy. He saved our economy from collapse with some very unpopular but bold decisions that have turned out to be right, including the rescue of the automobile industry, all of which has made us much stronger not only at home but abroad."", ""If you're looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited, it's pretty simple: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. (Applause.)"", ""Governor Romney's national security policies, in our view, would return us to a past we've worked so hard to move beyond. And, in this regard, there is no difference in what Governor Romney says and what he has proposed for our economy than he has done in foreign policy. In every instance, in our view, he takes us back to the failed policies that got us into the mess that President Obama has dug us out of, and the mess that got us into this in the first place."", ""Governor Romney, I think, is counting on collective amnesia of the American people. Americans know -- American know that we can't go back to the future, back to a foreign policy that would have America go it alone -- shout to the world you're either with us or against us, lash out first and ask the hard questions later, if they get asked at all, isolate America instead of isolating our enemies, waste hundreds of billions of dollars and risk thousands of Americans' lives on a war that's unnecessary -- and see the world through a Cold War prism that is totally out of touch with the realities of the 21st century."", ""On this and everything else, President Obama, in my view, has demonstrated that he is totally in touch with our times. He has acted boldly, strengthening America's ability to contend with the new forces shaping this century and to attend to the challenges and opportunities around the world that have been neglected over the past -- or previous past eight years."", ""Under President Obama's leadership, our alliances have never been stronger. He returned Europe to its rightful place as a partner of first resort in dealing with global threats, while at the same time reclaiming America's place in Asia as an Asian Pacific power -- a region where U.S. exports are producing new jobs and driving our economic recovery. We've forged a new relationship based on mutual interest with emerging powers like China, Russia, Brazil, Turkey, South Africa -- all of which are helping advance American security."", ""We reduced our reliance on nuclear weapons, achieved major arms control agreements with Russia, and brought the world together to secure nuclear materials from getting into the hands of terrorists. We've isolated countries like Iran and North Korea whose nuclear programs threaten peace and stability. And we've taken far more terrorists off the battlefield in the last three years than in the previous eight, putting al Qaeda on a path to defeat."", ""At the same time, the President shut down secret prisons overseas, banned torture, and in doing so demonstrated that we don't have to choose between protecting our country and living our values; and, as a consequence of those decisions, enhanced the security of our own soldiers abroad and the power of our persuasion around the world."", ""We plan for conflicts in the future with a new defense strategy, supported by the entire Defense Department's senior leadership.

He starts with a profound -- a profound -- misunderstanding of the responsibilities of a President and the Commander-in-Chief."", 'Here\'s what he said, and I want to quote him exactly. And I quote: ""If we want someone who has a lot of experience in foreign policy, we can simply go to the State Department."" He went on to say, and I quote, ""But that\'s not how we choose a President. A President is not a foreign policy expert.""', ""In my view, the last thing we need is a President who believes that he can subcontract our foreign policy to experts at the State Department, or for that matter, any other department or agency. Because here how it works -- I've been around for eight Presidents of the United States. I hate to admit. (Laughter.) I know I don't look that old, right? (Laughter.) But eight Presidents. That's not how it works."", ""President Obama has built a great national security team, from Secretary of State Clinton, to CIA Director Petraeus, to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, to the Chairman of Joint Chiefs, Dempsey. President Bush put together his own team of experts. But the bottom line is this: no matter how experienced the team, no matter how wise the advice and counsel, to use that old expression, the buck literally stops on the President's desk in the Oval Office."", 'One of the toughest -- only the toughest decisions land on that desk. And as often as not, his advisors are in disagreement -- disagreements among themselves -- all smart people, but they disagree -- seldom completely unified.', ""As I know the General has heard me say before, I cannot think of any consequential decision in the eight Presidents I've served with where the President had more than 75 percent of the facts. It never works that way. Almost every significant case, it calls for a final judgment call to be made by the President, a call that the Vice President can't make, the Secretary of State can't make, the Secretary of Defense can't make -- only the President can make."", ""I know from experience. I literally get to be the last guy in the room with the President. That's our arrangement. I can give him all the advice that I have and make my case, but I walk out of the room. He sits there by himself, the President sits there by himself and has to make the decision, often -- often -- reconciling conflicting judgments that are made by very smart, honorable, informed, experienced people."", ""And the President is all alone at that moment. It's his judgment that will determine the destiny of this country. He must make the hard calls. I'd respectfully suggest President Obama has made those hard calls with strength and steadiness."", ""And the reason he has been able to is because he had clear goals and a clear strategy how to achieve those goals. He had a clear vision and has a clear vision for America's place in the world. He seeks all the help he can get from experts as to how to realize that vision, but ultimately he makes the decision."", ""So it seems to me, Governor Romney's fundamental thinking about the role of the President in foreign policy is fundamentally wrong. That may work -- that may work -- that kind of thinking may work for a CEO. But I assure you, it will not and cannot work for a President and it will not work for a Commander-in-Chief."", ""Thus far, Governor Romney has not made many foreign policy-focused decisions or pronouncements. Foreign policy has not been a focus of his campaign. Now, if you'll excuse me a point of personal privilege, given President Obama's record -- the strongest foreign policy in decades -- I can understand why the President -- why Governor Romney doesn't want to make it a focus of his campaign. But it is, these are, critical issues."", ""So how do we fairly assess the views of Governor Romney on foreign policy? What are they? I think a fair way to do this -- and obviously others may disagree with whether or not I'm being as objective as possible, I think the fair way to do this is look at the few things that we do know about Governor Romney."", ""We know Governor Romney reflexively criticizes the President's policy and almost in every case without offering any specific alternative. We know that when the Governor goes -- does venture a position, it's a safe bet that he previously took or is about to take an exactly opposite position -- (laughter) -- and an equally safe bet that he is going to end up landing in the wrong place and out of the mainstream of the thinking of Republican and Democratic foreign policy experts."", ""We know that when he agrees with the President of the United States, as he has done, he then goes on to mischaracterize our record to create what is a non-existent contrast. And most importantly, we know that the extent that Governor Romney -- to the extent he has shown any foreign policy vision, it's through the glass of a rear-view mirror."", ""Look, in my view, he would take us back to a dangerous and discredited policies that would make Americans less safe and America less secure. And the best way to try to make the points I believe are honest to make is to illustrate these propositions, is to compare President Obama's record and Governor Romney's rhetoric on major foreign policy and the national security interests of our day."", ""Let's start with Iraq. When President Obama ran four years ago, he promised to end the war responsibly. He gave me the honor and the responsibility of coordinating that policy. He kept this commitment. He brought home -- it was already mentioned -- all 150,000 of our troops and developed a strong relationship with a sovereign Iraq."", 'Last December, Governor Romney initially applauded the withdrawal, which he went on to say -- partially, which is true -- he went on to say the credit should go to President Bush, but he applauded the decision. Three months later, he reversed him, saying, and I quote, it was an ""enormous error"" -- I can back this up -- and saying that he would have left tens of thousands of U.S. troops behind in Iraq.', ""In Afghanistan, President Obama developed a clear strategy to end the war in 2014, while building the capacity of the Afghan government, its security forces and its people. Setting a withdrawal date was the best way to get the Afghans to step up and take responsibility for their own country. Without it, we know from Iraq, it doesn't happen. If we're doing it all, why step up? So we know unless you set a date, the likelihood of stepping up and taking on the responsibility is unlikely to occur."", 'Folks, as I\'ve said in many circumstances, we cannot want peace and security in Afghanistan more than the Afghans want it. Our NATO partners, the International Security Assistance Force -- of some 50 countries -- embraced the President\'s strategy. And so did Governor Romney embrace the President\'s strategy -- at least at first. He endorsed the President\'s plan to transition to Afghanistan responsibility and withdraw our combat troops in 2014. Here\'s what he said, and I quote, ""that\'s the right timeline.""', 'But two months later, he was against the President\'s plan, calling it and I quote, ""one of the biggest mistakes."" And now, and I want to be completely straight about this, he seems -- I emphasize seems -- seems to want to keep American forces in Afghanistan indefinitely. Here again I want to quote him. And I quote, ""it\'s my desire and my political party\'s desire not to leave."" I\'m not sure the exact context. I\'m not sure exactly what he meant. But I am sure he is going to have a responsibility to explain to the American people what he meant by that. He may have a reasonable explanation. But the American people deserve an explanation.', ""Where Governor Romney has expressed a clear and consistent point of view, he has been clearly and consistently stuck in the past -- and, in my view and the President's view, I might add, wrong."", ""When we came to office, President Obama reset our relationship with Russia. To state the obvious, we had then and we have now important disagreements with Moscow. And we're going to continue to have disagreements with Moscow. But in the wake of the reset -- as we called it, when I was asked to go over and make that first speech on behalf of the administration over at a conference called the Wehrkunde Conference. In the wake of that reset, we've negotiated a major nuclear arms reduction treaty that has made us safer and sets an example, I might add, for the rest of the world for the possibility we can continue to reduce nuclear arms around the world."", ""In addition, President Obama convinced Russia to cancel the sale of Russia's very sophisticated S300 cutting edge, air defense radar system, to Iran. Russia joined the United States -- hadn't been until then -- joined the United States in the toughest ever sanctions against Iran, gave us permission to transit Russian territory and airspace with weapons and supplies for American troops in Afghanistan -- the only other source and now the sole source, hopefully, only temporarily."", 'But just a month ago, Governor Romney, called and here again I quote, ""without question our number one geopolitical foe"" is Russia. (Laughter.) As my brother would say, go figure. (Laughter.) And sometimes -- I don\'t know whether it\'s a slip of the tongue or it\'s a mindset -- but he even refers to Russians as ""Soviets"" -- (laughter) -- which I think -- no, I think reveals a mindset. Everybody sometimes slips -- I never do, but everybody sometimes slips. (Laughter and applause.)', ""Look, I think it's fair to say when it comes to Russia, based on only what we know he's said so far, Governor Romney is mired in a Cold War mindset. Similarly, the Governor aggressively attacked New START, the nuclear arms control treaty that President Obama negotiated with Moscow. He attacked it. That treaty reduces a number of strategic nuclear weapons in Russia's arsenal and allows inspections of Russia's nuclear arsenals to resume without placing any constraints on U.S. missile defense and our conventional strike capabilities."", ""Governor Romney was part of a very small group of Cold War holdovers who never met an arms control treaty that he likes. He was way out of the mainstream in this issue, unless you think that's just political hyperbole. Let me tell you why. Virtually the entire Republican foreign policy establishment disagreed with him, starting with Secretary Henry Kissinger, Secretary Colin Powell, Senator Richard Lugar -- the most informed person on foreign policy in the Senate, National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley, Secretary of State Jim Baker, Secretary of State George Schulz, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft and President George H. W. Bush, all -- all support it and strongly support it and helped us get past through some recalcitrant Republican senators this critically important treaty."", 'Unfortunately, Governor Romney\'s apparent determination to take U.S.-Russian relations back to the \'50s also causes him to misstate the facts. For example, he charged that -- as he calls it to appease Moscow -- to appease Moscow, ""President Obama has been pliant on missile defense and abandoned our missile defense sites in Poland.""', 'Here again he is either woefully misinformed or totally misunderstands. As it happens, President Obama asked me to secure allied support for a new and more effective missile defense system in Europe, the so-called Phased Adaptive Approach.', ""So the first visit I made was to Poland. And who did we ask to host these new components for this more sophisticated system? That's right, Poland, along with Turkey, Romania, Germany and Spain, who all said yes. These countries and all of NATO embraced our new approach, because they understand it will protect them more quickly and more effectively than the missile defense program Romney wanted to stick with."", 'And I\'d add parenthetically, it also provides better protection for the United States of America. As then Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, who served in Republican and Democrat administrations, said, and I quote, ""we are strengthening, not scrapping, missile defense in Europe.""', 'But I think nothing speaks more powerfully to the differences between President Obama and Governor Romney than one of the defining moments in the past four years, the hunt for Osama bin Laden. In 2008, while campaigning for the nomination, Governor Romney was asked what he would do about bin Laden. Let me tell you exactly what he said, and I quote. He said, ""there would be very insignificant increase in safety,"" then he went to say, ""if Bin Laden was brought to justice."" He then went on -- that\'s a quote. He then went on to say, ""it\'s not worth moving heaven and Earth, spending billions of dollars just to catch one person.""', 'Here\'s how candidate Obama answered that question. He said, ""if I have Osama bin Laden in our sights, I will take him out. I will kill bin Laden. We will crush al Qaeda. This has to be our biggest national security priority.""', ""I was a little bit more direct. I said, we'd follow the S.O.B. to the gates of Hell if we had to. (Laughter and applause.)"", ""But here's the deal, President Obama always means what he says. He said it as a candidate, and he kept that commitment. Just a few months into office, sitting in the Oval Office, and I spend four to six hours a day with this President, that's why we've become such good friends, and I've gotten to know him so well, literally, and has -- made almost every meeting he has. We were sitting in the meeting, and he turns to Leon who was -- Panetta, who was then the chairman of -- excuse me, the head of the CIA, Director of CIA and military personnel there, and he made it clear what his priority was."", 'And on June 2, 2009, he ordered Leon Panetta, gave the following written order, and I quote, ""in order to ensure that we have expended every effort, I direct you to provide me within 30 days a detailed operational plan for locating and bringing to justice Osama bin Laden."" It was the President\'s highest priority for the CIA.', ""Then, he made one of the most courageous decisions I've seen a President make and I would argue in a long time. He authorized a very, high risk mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden, even though -- and I was one of six people who for four months or so were the only ones who knew about the possibility of his location -- even though at the end of the day, there was no better, as you know, General, than a 50/50 chance bin Laden was present in the compound."", 'But despite that reservation -- and I might add the reservations of almost every one of his -- the only full-throated support for moving when we did was from Leon Panetta, the Director of the CIA, myself included.', 'President Obama said afterwards when he made the decision: ""This was a very difficult decision. It entailed enormous risk to the guys I sent there. But ultimately I had so much confidence in the capacity of our guys to carry out the mission that I felt the risks were outweighed by the potential benefit to us of finally getting our man.""', ""And I might add parenthetically, does anybody doubt had the mission failed, it would have written -- the beginning of the end of the President's term in office. This guy has got a backbone like a ramrod. No, no, for real. (Laughter.) For real."", 'On this gut issue, we know what President Obama did. We can\'t say for certain what Governor Romney would have done. But we can say that, unlike Governor Romney, the American people believe, and I quote, ""it was worth moving Heaven and Earth to get bin Laden.""', ""I said before thanks to President Obama, bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive. You have to ask yourself, if Governor Romney had been President, could he have used the same slogan –- in reverse? People are going to make that judgment. It's a legitimate thing to speculate on."", ""Look, on a few core issues, there's no real difference between President Obama and Governor Romney. So in those cases, as I said at the outset, in my view, Governor misrepresents the President's approach or suggests that the President is not doing things that in fact he is already doing."", ""Again, let me give you some examples. Iran's nuclear program is maybe the clearest example. President Obama is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. He has stated that no options are off the table, and he's been clear and concise saying that containment is not our policy."", ""When he took office, the effort to pressure Iran was stuck in neutral, Iran's influence -- and think about this, when he took office, Iran's influence was spreading in the region. And American leadership was in doubt. I would argue we were not much respected by our friends, and not really feared by our enemies."", 'But President Obama understood that by seeking to engage Iran in the first interest, by going the extra diplomatic mile and presenting Iran a clear choice, we would demonstrate to the world that Iran, not the United States, was the problem.', ""The President's smart, tough diplomacy turned the tables on Tehran and secured the strongest unilateral and international sanctions in history; all the major powers, including Russia and China, participating."", ""Now, Iran is more isolated and the international community more united in their effort to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon than ever before. Tehran has deep difficulties acquiring equipment and technology for its nuclear and missile program. It's increasingly cut off from the international financial system, unable to do the most basic business transactions."", ""And its economy has been grievously wounded, and the worst is still to come. In June, a European embargo on imports of oil from Iran kicks in. Folks, look, as a result of this unprecedented pressure, Iran is back to the negotiating table. You can't predict what the end result will be, but they're back to the table."", 'Governor Romney has called for what he calls for a ""very different policy"" on Iran. But for the life of me, it\'s hard to understand what the Governor means by a very different policy. Here\'s what he says. He says we need ""crippling sanctions"" -- apparently unaware that through President Obama\'s leadership, we have produced just that –- crippling sanctions.', 'He emphasizes the need for ""a credible military option"" and a ""regular presence of aircraft carrier groups"" in the region –- apparently ignorant of the fact that\'s exactly what our policy is and what we\'re doing.', ""The only step -- I think it's fair to say -- the only step we could take that we aren't already taking is to launch a war against Iran. If that's what Governor Romney means by a very different policy, he should tell the American people. He should say so. Otherwise, the Governor's tough talk about military action is just that -- talk. And I would add counterproductive talk."", ""Folks, loose talk about a war has incredible negative consequences in our efforts to end Iran's nuclear quest. And let me tell you why: Because it unsettles world oil markets. It drives up oil prices. When oil prices go up, Iran's coffers fill up, undermining the impact of the sanctions that are in existence. This kind of Romney-talk is just not smart."", 'President Obama has said, and I quote, ""now is the time to let our increased pressure sink in, and to sustain the broad international coalition we have built. Now is the time to heed the timeless advice from Teddy Roosevelt: \'speak softly and carry a big stick.\'"" I promise you the President has a big stick. (Laughter.) I promise you.', ""President Obama understands what Governor Romney apparently doesn't: It is possible -– it's indeed necessary -– for America to be strong and smart -- and smart -- at the same time."", ""Look, no country is more concerned about a nuclear Iran than Israel, and rightly so. And no President since Harry Truman has done more for Israel's security than Barack Obama."", ""Our administration provided record levels of security assistance. We funded what's referred to as the Iron Dome, a missile defense system that recently intercepted in those rockets coming out of Gaza, nearly 80 percent of the rockets fired from Gaza just a few weeks ago, saving homes, schools, hospitals and the men, women and children who inhabit them."", ""We're collaborating right now and have been on longer range missile defense systems like Arrow and David's Sling, and tying Israel into our early warning radar system. The U.S. and Israel's top political, defense, and security intelligence officers are engaged in the most consistent, comprehensive consultations ever."", ""You know this better than anybody, General. Together we're conducting the largest joint military operations in the history of the relationship. And President Obama has stood up to what is I think the gravest threat to Israel, the effort of the rest of the world to delegitimize it as a state and I might add, often stood up alone -- alone -- in fighting the effort to delegitimize Israel at the United Nations and other international organizations -- single vetoes."", 'Israel\'s leaders have called President Obama\'s support for and cooperation with Israel ""unprecedented."" Governor Romney though, said relations between the United States and Israel had ""hit a low"" and went on to accuse President Obama of -- this is a good one -- ""throwing Israel under the bus."" That\'s just one in a long litany of untruths about our administration\'s policy toward Israel uttered by Governor Romney and repeatedly debunked by reporters, policy experts, fact checkers across the country -- and maybe most convincingly debunked by Israeli leaders.', ""Maybe the Governor is simply unaware or misinformed again. Unfortunately, it's more likely in my view the Governor is falling back on one of his party's favorite tricks of late -- distort and mischaracterize your opponent's position, keep repeating the distortions and mischaracterizations over and over again even when every objective observer says you're wrong, keep repeating in the hope that it will eventually stick."", ""President Obama has reshaped American foreign policy to contend with the challenges of the present, but also to face the threats of the future. And I believe he has done it with strength and wisdom. Governor Romney wants to take us back to a world that no longer exists, with policies that are dangerously divorced from today's realities. Looking backwards is all the more misguided, because for all the peril of our times America's promise has never, never, never been greater."", 'In the 20th century, the wealth of a nation was judged by the size of its population, the strength of its army, the abundance of its raw materials and the expanse of its landmass. In the 21st century, these measures still matter and on that measure America still prevails. But more than ever before -- you students know better than any of us -- more than ever before, the 21st century, the true wealth of a nation is to be found in its human resources, its people and their ability to imagine, to innovate, to build, to compete -- folks, by that measure, America is also uniquely blessed.', 'And the President and I believe our job -- our job -- in government is to help provide our people, all of our people, an environment in which they can fulfill the incredible potential our younger people have.', ""If we do our job, I believe our nation will be more secure, because America's strength -- America's strength in the world depends ultimately on the strength of the American Dream here at home and in our economy. That means investing in our students, our teachers, our schools, our university. It means investing advanced research and development, attempting to catch up to the rest of the world in medicine, in science and the most modern airports, ports, bridges, roads -- all of which help increase the ability of American businesses to increase productivity and access to the world; to invest in clean, sustainable energy in cutting edge manufacturing. No one is better positioned -- no one, no nation is better positioned than the United States in all those areas."", 'It also means welcoming people from around the world, which has always been the source of new blood and new brain power throughout American history. It means rewarding hard work, demanding responsibility, insisting on accountability and creating opportunity for all our citizens. These are the investments and the commitments that will grow our economy, create new jobs, keep America strong at home and allow us to continue to be the strongest nation in the world and the leader of the world.', ""And these investments and commitments, and the commitments that President Obama and I have made and will continue to make, I think, is what's needed for America's future. As Vice President, on behalf of our nation, I have traveled well over a half a million miles since being sworn in as Vice President, many of them to far-flung countries all around the world. And like many of you who have traveled, students and non-students here, we all have the same kind of feeling when you get home, the same just sort of intuitive feeling -- there is no country like America, there is no potential like America."", 'I was asked earlier how would I best define America. I was with a group of high school students. I said one word, possibilities -- possibilities.', ""I am absolutely convinced, I am more certain after having served 40 years in government than I was when I was the idealistic, young senator at age 29 -- I am more confident and convinced -- that there is no country, and we want all countries to do well, but there is no country better positioned to lead the world in the 21st century than the United States of America, but only if we stay the course we're on, with the strong, smart leadership of President Obama looking forward and not in a rear-view mirror."", 'Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. May God bless you all and may God protect our troops.']",1

Not just from our elected leaders or our public health officials — from all of us."", 'We all must follow the guidance of health officials and take appropriate precautions — to protect ourselves, and critically, to protect others, especially those who are most at-risk from this disease.', 'It will mean making some radical changes to our personal behaviors: more frequent and more through handwashing and staying home from work if you are ill, but also altering some deeply-ingrained habits, like handshakes and hugs, and avoiding large public gatherings.', 'That is why earlier this week, on the recommendation of officials, my campaign cancelled the election night rally we had planned to hold in Cleveland, Ohio.

We will be led by the science.', 'The World Health Organization has now officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Downplaying it, being overly dismissive, or spreading misinformation will only hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease. But neither should we panic or fall back on xenophobia. Labeling COVID-19 a ""foreign virus"" does not displace accountability for the mismanagement that we have seen from the Trump Administration.', 'Let me be crystal clear: the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation.

The White House should measure and report each day how many tests were ordered, how many tests have been completed, and how many have tested positive. By next week, the number of tests should be in the millions, not the thousands. We should make sure every person in a nursing home, a senior center, or a vulnerable population has easy access to a test."", 'We should establish hundreds of mobile testing sites — at least 10 per state — and drive-thru testing centers to speed testing and protect health care workers.', 'The CDC, private labs, universities, and manufacturers should be working in lock-step to get this done, and get it done right. No effort should be spared. No excuses should be made. Tests should be available to all who need them and the government should stop at nothing to make that happen.', 'We must know the true extent of this outbreak so we can map it, trace it, and contain it. Nor should we hide the true number of infections in hopes of protecting political interests or the stock market.

This means not just getting out the testing kits and processing them quickly, but making sure communities have the hospital beds, the staff, the medical supplies, and the personal protective equipment necessary to treat patients.', ""The president should order FEMA to prepare the capacity with local authorities to establish temporary hospitals with hundreds of beds on short notice. The Department of Defense should prepare for the potential deployment of its resources to provide medical facility capacity and logistical support.

Science takes time. It will still be many months before we have a vaccine that can be proven safe for public use and produced in sufficient quantity to make a difference. Therapeutics can and should come sooner. That will save lives. We passed the Cures Act in 2016 to accelerate work at the National Institutes of Health, but now it must have every available resource to speed the process along.', 'We must fast-track clinical trials within the NIH, while closely coordinating with the Food and Drug Administration on trial approvals, so that the science is not hindered by the bureaucracy.

critical health infrastructure, hiring additional health care and emergency service personnel, or cushioning the wider economic blow this virus will cause our communities.', 'We need smart, bold, and

further decisive action, including direct relief, that will be large in scale and focused on the broader health and stability of our economy.', 'But we can only protect the health of our economy, if we do everything in our power to protect the health of our people.', 'The last point I want to make today is this — we will never fully solve this problem if we are unwilling to look beyond our own borders and engage fully with the world.', 'A disease that starts any place on the planet can be on a plane to any city on earth a few hours later.', 'So we have to confront coronavirus everywhere.',
