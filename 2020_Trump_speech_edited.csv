It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this."", ""And, I can tell you, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. [laughter]"", ""They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. [applause]"", ""Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. [applause]"", 'Audience Member: We want Trump. We want Trump.', ""Trump: When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time."", ""When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically."", ""The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. [applause]"", ""Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."", ""But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people."", ""It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably — probably — from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. [applause]"", ""Trump: Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them."", ""They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken."", 'So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don\'t have, Iran has. And in 19 — and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said — and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we\'ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, ""Don\'t hit Iraq, because you\'re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil."" And it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they\'re taking it over big league.', ""We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love — they're great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers."", ""And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it."", 'Last week, I read 2,300 Humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.', 'Audience Member: We need Trump now.', ""Trump: You're right. [applause]"", 'Audience Member: We need Trump now.', ""Trump: Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero."", 'Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.', ""And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."", ""That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs."", ""But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense."", 'Audience Member: We want Trump now.', ""Trump: Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work."", 'It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don\'t know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, ""That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don\'t know what they\'re doing. They don\'t know what they\'re doing.""', 'Audience Member: We need Trump now. [applause]', 'Trump: We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.', ""Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster."", ""Trump: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion Web site."", 'I have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site. [applause]', 'Audience: We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump. We want Trump.', ""Trump: Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. They will not."", 'As an example, I\'ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they\'re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don\'t know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I\'m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don\'t know — ""Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?""', ""I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us."", ""But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches."", 'Audience Member: No more free [inaudible].', 'Trump: Thank you.', 'I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, ""What\'s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don\'t need the rhetoric. I want a job.""', ""And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to — I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. [applause]"", ""In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. [laughter]"", 'But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who\'s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, ""Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\'s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.""', 'We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. [applause]', 'Audience: Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump. Trump.', ""Trump: So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully — they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully."", ""Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? It won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now."", 'Audience: It needs Trump.', 'Trump: Now, our country needs — our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote ""The Art of the Deal.""', 'Audience Member: Yes.', 'Trump: We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. [applause]', 'And we also need a cheerleader.', 'You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, ""Well, the one thing, I think he\'ll do well. I think he\'ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he\'d be a great spirit.""', 'He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.', 'Audience Member: But not a leader.', ""Trump: He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that."", ""But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite."", ""We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. [applause]"", 'We need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.

They\'re saying, ""Dad, you\'re going to do something that\'s going to be so tough.""', ""You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again."", 'So ladies and gentlemen... [applause]', 'I am officially running...[applause]... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. [applause]', 'It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.', ""We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work.

It can happen. [applause]"", 'I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. [applause]', ""I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money."", ""Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better."", 'How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? [applause]', ""I'm going to tell you — thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons."", ""Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator."", ""He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there."", ""We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have."", ""Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But..."", 'Audience Member: Yes, we do. Yes, we do. [applause]', ""Trump: So we need people — I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible."", ""Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work."", ""So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again."", ""But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete."", 'So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who\'s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He\'s very upset. I said, ""What\'s your problem?""', 'He said, ""You know, I make great product.""', 'And I said, ""I know. I know that because I buy the product.""', 'He said, ""I can\'t get it into China. They won\'t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.""', 'I said, ""Oh, wait a minute, that\'s terrible. Does anyone know this?""', 'He said, ""Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.""', 'I said, ""They send it back?""', '""Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They\'re not supposed to be doing that. I told them.""', 'Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.', ""Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing."", ""Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for — I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable."", 'I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, ""Oh, you don\'t like China?""', ""No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much — it's like — it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders."", ""They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place."", ""We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly."", ""Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country — we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port."", ""They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China."", 'And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.', 'So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, ""That\'s a terrible story. I hate to hear it.""', 'But I have another one, Ford.', ""So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people."", ""All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good."", ""Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company."", ""So I announced that I'm running for president. I would... [applause]"", ""... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in — and I wouldn't even use — you know, I have — I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones."", ""You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they're not good."", 'But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.', 'But I wouldn\'t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I\'d say, ""Congratulations. I understand that you\'re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\'re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.""', 'And you say to yourself, ""How does that help us,"" right? ""How does that help us? Where is that good""? It\'s not.', 'So I would say, ""Congratulations. That\'s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\'re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that\'s it.', 'Now, here\'s what is going to happen. If it\'s not me in the position, it\'s one of these politicians that we\'re running against, you know, the 400 people that we\'re [inaudible]. And here\'s what\'s going to happen. They\'re not so stupid. They know it\'s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they\'re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, ""You can\'t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\'t do that to Ford.""', ""And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us."", ""So under President Trump, here's what would happen: [applause]"", ""The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool."", 'And he\'ll say, ""Please, please, please."" He\'ll beg for a little while, and I\'ll say, ""No interest."" Then he\'ll call all sorts of political people, and I\'ll say, ""Sorry, fellas. No interest,"" because I don\'t need anybody\'s money. It\'s nice. I don\'t need anybody\'s money.', ""I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I [inaudible]...[applause]"", ""And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a — that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country."", 'Audience Member: Absolutely.', 'Trump: So — because we got to make the country rich.', 'It sounds crass. Somebody said, ""Oh, that\'s crass."" It\'s not crass.', 'We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.', 'We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.', ""We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it.

He\'ll say. ""Please reconsider,"" I\'ll say no.', 'He\'ll say, ""Mr. President, we\'ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we\'re not going to build it in Mexico."" That\'s it. They have no choice. They have no choice.', ""There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example."", 'Trump: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say ""we\'re gonna protect."" What are we doing? They\'ve got nothing but money.', ""If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us."", 'And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.', ""They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff."", ""But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone."", ""And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now — it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running.

He couldn\'t answer the question. He didn\'t know. I said, ""Is he intelligent?""', ""Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question."", ""How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible."", 'But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.', ""There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people."", ""So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence."", 'Audience Member: Yes.', ""Trump: Somebody said — thank you, darlin'.

I think I\'m actually a very nice person.""', 'But, I said, ""This is going to be an election that\'s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people.

And they\'re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we\'re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I\'ll do. I\'ll do it. Because a lot of people said, ""He\'ll never run. Number one, he won\'t want to give up his lifestyle.""', ""Trump: They're right about that, but I'm doing it."", ""Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth.

I\'ve done an amazing job.', 'I started off — thank you — I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said — and I love my father. I learned so much.

Donald Trump, great to have you on the program. Thanks so much joining us.', 'DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you, Maria. Nice to be with you.', 'BARTIROMO: Congratulations on closing the gap on Hillary. I want to ask you about that and about this e-mail controversy.', ""Let me begin on the breaking news this morning, Donald, because the AP has uncovered a document showing that Iran will be allowed to use its own inspectors to investigate a site that has repeatedly been accused of developing nuclear arms. How concerned are you about this deal? And what would you do about it in the president's office?"", ""TRUMP: Well, that's incredible statement. I've just heard this too. And, look, it's one of the worst deals I have ever seen. It's like negotiated by babies, by incompetent people. And now on top of everything else, on top of the 24 days and the long period before you get to the 24 days, on top of not getting our prisoners back, on top of all of the other things, the 25 different points, they can inspect their own site? I mean, you must be kidding. It's just hard to believe, hard to fathom."", ""BARTIROMO: How do you manage your own policy when it comes to foreign issues? We've got Iran. We've got, a fight with ISIS, not to mention other conflicts around the world. How would you characterize your foreign policy?"", ""TRUMP: Well, I think my foreign policy would be very fair but very, very tough and I would strengthen up our military, I'll take care of our vets. Our vets are treated horribly, by the way. But we will strengthen up our military, and nobody is going to be messing with us. And I certainly wouldn't be making deals like we did with Iran. You know, we're going to make -- Iran is going to be absolutely a superpower. They're getting $150 billion, and sadly they get that whether the deal happens or not. That's like a signing bonus."", ""That's a tremendous amount of money. They're getting $150 billion and much more than that, over term. And it's just inconceivable that a deal -- I don't know, they just wanted to make it. You know, you do business, all right. And probably most of the people watching your show probably cannot understand how a thing like this could happen."", ""We were so desperate to get this deal. We should have doubled up and tripled up the sanctions and made a deal the way it has to be made. We dealt with -- from weakness, we had bad negotiators, we had bad everything. You know, one of the things I've done is, on trade pacts, I have spoken to Carl Icahn, who's a friend of mine, a good friend of mine, and others of the great dealmakers and negotiators, and they're going to represent me, if I win. And they're going to represent our country on trade deals. We're going to get best dealers in the world, and we have them."", ""I saw Charlie Gasparino on your show, and he understands when I mentioned Carl and I mentioned some of these other names -- these are the people that we need negotiating for us, not diplomats and not people that have no business ability. When you look at Secretary Kerry and the deal that he made, it's such an embarrassment to our country. And now you tell us that they can inspect their sites themselves? It's incredible."", ""BARTIROMO: In fact, you've mentioned Carl Icahn would be part of the Trump administration. Who would you have as Secretary of State? Have you thought about Cabinet positions?"", ""TRUMP: No, I haven't done that. Actually what I have done is I said to Carl, I said Carl -- in fact, I had dinner with him the other night. I said, Carl, you're great at this. I'm great at this. We have -- there aren't too many of us. We need to bring our country back. Our trade deals are so bad."", ""I said would you like to -- supposing I let you run, you know, be involved with China, would be involved with Japan -- Japan sends us cars -- I was in Los Angeles, two weeks ago. I saw ships come in, the biggest ships I have ever seen, with cars from Japan. And, you know, we give them beef and they don't even want to take. We sell them wheat. It's ridiculous."", ""So I said to Carl what do you say? And, oh, I'd love it, I'd love it. Carl would love it. I mean, you should call Carl. I mean, Carl would love it."", ""And, you know, with people like Carl and others that we know, and others that you -- that are on your show, if you know the good ones and so do I, and we also know bad ones. We don't use bad ones. But with -- you know, you put let's say Carl in charge and some others in charge, you know you're going to come out, it's going to come out great. It is going to come out so good for us."", ""So, I mean, my policy would be a smart policy. It would it be tough but it would be fair. But we'd bring our country back; we'd bring our jobs back. We are losing our jobs, we're losing our base, we're losing our money."", 'BARTIROMO: Yes.', ""TRUMP: And then the amazing thing is we owe China right now $1.4 trillion. You know they do this and w -- by the way, the same amount we owe Japan 1$.4 trillion. So it's like a magic act to them. They take everything and then we owe them money."", ""BARTIROMO: You've talked about Carl Icahn. What about a running mate? Would you -- have you thought about that? Rick Perry told me earlier he would ask Carly Fiorina perhaps to be his running mate. Is there anyone in the GOP field right now that you would consider as a running mate?"", ""TRUMP: It just too soon. I mean, I've gotten to know a lot of the candidates. Well, I know so many people in -- as you know, because you have known me a long time, I've been very involved politically for many years, and I know -- I know tremendous people in the world of politics, too, although, generally speaking, the politicians are not going to bring us to the promised land. That I can tell you. It's not - [Crosstalk]"", ""BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about -- you've mentioned obviously -- put this immigration story on the table, in particular with Mexico, we've heard all about your plans for neighbor to the south. What about our neighbor to the north, Donald? We've got security concerns about terrorists crossing that border with Canada, worries about terror cells in large cities like Minneapolis. Do we need a wall there too? And what's the answer to some of these open spots?"", ""TRUMP: We don't need a wall there. It's a much different situation. And frankly in terms of Canada, what -- you look at what's going on with Canada, it's a much different kind of situation that we have with Canada. We have to police it; we have to be very vigilant; we have to be careful. But also the length, you're talking about a tremendous length, a tremendous distance."", ""You know, interestingly, the wall on southern border, it's -- really, if you think it's 1,000 miles but it's 2,000 miles, but a lot of it -- some of it's done -- it's done poorly by the way, what they have done is very poor, very poor work, a very poor job, and very -- not much of a wall. But you also have natural terrain which is automatically a barrier, which is a good thing. So you're talking about 1,000. And then you look at the Great Wall of China that was built 2,500 years ago. It's 13,000 miles. And we're really talking about something more than a little more than 1,000 miles."", ""So it is something that can be absolutely done, not done at tremendous cost. You know, it's been costed by politicians and they came out with these outrageous numbers. As you know, I know how to build. I know how to get it done. We'll have a great wall. We'll call it the Great Wall of Trump. We'll have a great wall and it will be -- it'll be actually -- it can be a good-looking wall, as walls go, but we will have a really terrific wall and it will be gone for the right price."", ""You know, for years, they've wanted to do it. I don't know if you know, even Hillary Clinton, I mean, for years they've wanted to do it, but they could never get it figured out how to get it done. And, you know, one of the things that stopped it was the environmental impact statement. Can you believe it?"", 'BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. Well --', ""TRUMP: They couldn't get an environmental impact statement completed to get the wall built."", ""BARTIROMO: That's a whole 'nother conversation."", ""TRUMP: That's a whole 'nother conversation."", ""BARTIROMO: You said it's going to be the Great Wall of Trump. Does that mean you're going to put your name on it?"", ""TRUMP: No, I'm only -- I'm only being facetious. [laughter]"", ""BARTIROMO: You are a builder. You are a builder, Donald, and you've built so much in the city. You're a New Yorker. Have you seen the city change under Mayor Bill de Blasio?"", ""TRUMP: Well, it is changing and some people are not happy about it. We're going to have to see what happens. It's still a little bit early but some people are not happy about what's going on."", 'BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about Hillary and the e-mail scandal. You just released this ad that we all just watched. Do you believe she broke the law? Do you think there is criminality here?', ""TRUMP: Well, I think there is no question about it. I think the one advantage she has is that the prosecutors are Democrats. And she seems not -- I think they maybe won't prosecute her. And a lot of people are watching to to see whether or not they are honorable in that respect, because if you look at General Petraeus , what he did is a tiny fraction of what she's done. First of all, those documents were far less important than the documents that she's talking about. And, you know, so many mistakes were made by her and so many lies were made, and you would think that if they did that to General Petraeus where they virtually destroyed his life, they went after him, I mean, and if hers is a far more serious set of documents, and far more documents, you would really think that something has to happen. But I think she is shielded. And interestingly she better hope that a Republican doesn't get in , because you have 6 year statute of limitations."", ""But she did something that is very serious and yet I have a feeling she probably, possibly, won't be prosecuted only because she is protected by her own party."", ""BARTIROMO: Yes, she was very flippant about it, too. You know, she made a joke about Snapchat, and she's got a Snapchat account that deletes --"", ""TRUMP: Yes, she should not have made that joke, because that's sort of throwing in it their face. She should not have made that joke, but, you know, we will have to see. A lot of people are watching to see what they do."", ""BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about some of the issues that are important to the American people, Donald, and that is wages and tax reform. What's your plan for tax reform."", 'TRUMP: Well, we have to simplify because -- you know, I have a little cute statement. ""I want H&amp;R Block out of business."" And it\'s so complicated, people that are making $50,000 a year, $60,000 dollars a year, they have go and pay a lot of money to tax, you know, these firms that do this stuff. It\'s ridiculous. We have to, at a minimum, we have to simplify. And I\'m going to be coming out over the next four weeks with a I think a really comprehensive, like I did on immigration -- I\'m very proud of that because now everybody is taking about immigration and illegal immigration. And if I wasn\'t involved, Maria, you know, they wouldn\'t be talking about it. They wouldn\'t -- I don\'t think immigration would even come up as a presidential point to be discussed.', 'BARTIROMO: Well --', ""TRUMP: I think that what I'm going to be doing with taxes will be similar, maybe less dramatic actually. But similar. We have to simplify our system. At a minimum we have to simplify our system and I would like to see a reduction in taxes. And we have to simplify our taxes."", 'BARTIROMO: Reduction in corporate taxes or all taxes, what?', ""TRUMP: Oh absolutely -- a reduction in all taxes but especially corporate and especially for the middle class. I mean, what we are doing to our middle class is inconceivable. It's terrible. You know, this country was sort of built by the middle class, it is one of those facts of life, and we are really treating them badly and they're disappearing, so we've got to take care of them."", ""BARTIROMO: So you're saying you could cut taxes. You would cut taxes."", ""TRUMP: I would cut taxes. And the other thing, in terms of cutting taxes, people think cut taxes? We pay the highest taxes in the world. At almost every level, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. And then when you add regulatory to it, from your standpoint from your ,you know, a lot of your corporate executives that are watching, the regulatory burdens that this country faces are second to none. And add that on, almost call that a tax."", 'So a lot of things will change, and we would unleash that is the greatness that is this country.', 'BARTIROMO: So, for example, on Dodd-Frank, would you move to roll that back? Would you change some of the --', ""TRUMP: I would at a minimum roll that back. We'd get rid -- you know, if people have a lot of money, if I go to bank, I can get whatever I want because you don't need money. If people are really good and they're building a company but they need some help from a bank, you can't get money today. Even at low interest rates, you can't get money. It's the weirdest thing."", ""The people that need money can't get money; the people that don't need money can have all the money they want. The regulators are controlling the banks. I wouldn't want to be banker, I'll be honest with you. It is so regulated and so tough, and these bankers, I deal with them, the biggest guys, they're friends of mine, and they're petrified of -- they're literally petrified of the regulators."", 'BARTIROMO: Yes, well, you make a really good point because certainly things have changed in that world.', ""Wages, Donald, they haven't moved in seven years. People are not feeling this economic recovery because they haven't seen any changes in their salary. What's the solution to moving the needle on wages for the American people."", ""TRUMP: I don't think there is a recovery, first of all. If you look, we have 93 million people that really are out of work. And if you look at the real number of unemployment -- you know, I actually heard a number the other day, 42 percent, but I've always -- I've been saying, from 19 to 21 percent, if you really look at the numbers. And this nonsense about 5.4, 5.3 percent, it's total nonsense. And what we have to do is bring jobs back. We have to stop with the China, with the Japan, with even Mexico. Nabisco now is moving their -- a big, big factory, they're moving a big plant from Chicago to Mexico. Ford is building a massive building, a massive assembly plant in Mexico, $2.5 billion. So many other things, like Mexico is becoming the new China. We have to keep our jobs, Maria. You see al the time. I mean, you are seeing it."", ""Another thing, interesting, and I'm going to start talking about it big, is corporate inversion. The money that's out there and the corporations that are leaving this country now."", 'BARTIROMO: So you mean a foreign company acquiring an American company just to improve their tax story?', 'TRUMP: Not even that. An American company buying a foreign company and then moving.', 'BARTIROMO: Same thing, right.

Some of these companies now, Maria, are going out to get money, which is bad because they're taking the company with them, and that means the jobs and all of the other things."", ""You know, a lot of the people that you interview, and I see it, they're international people. They come from London, they come from other countries. They run even -- they run American companies and they're from different -- they don't care about our country. They will move if lower taxes. If they have lower wages, if they have -- they'll move the -- and you see all the time. But they have to allow that money to come back into this country."", ""BARTIROMO: So how are you going to balance this? Because you are saying a lot of things here.

And at the same time, you're saying you don't want any illegals here and it sounds a little protectionist. Do you find that you're a protectionist?"", ""TRUMP: No, I'm not. I'm a free trader, but the problem with free traders is you need smart leaders and we don't have smart leaders. You need great negotiators and we don't have great negotiators. We're not using our great negotiators; we're using diplomats, we're political hacks. We're using people to negotiating with China, and Japan, and we're using -- and the, by the way, I use them as examples, but we don't make good deals with anybody.

What would Trump space program look like?', ""TRUMP: Well, I wouldn't be thinking about Mars. I'd be thinking about getting our country fixed first, OK? Before we worry about Mars, wI'd be thinking about our infrastructure, our bridges that are falling down, our airports that are third world.

You look at their airports and their highways and their roads, and their everything, their infrastructure, and then you come back at home and you land at LaGuardia, you land at JFK, you land at LAX or Newark, and it's third world airports. It's so sad what has happened to our country."", ""BARTIROMO: Right, that's absolutely right. But where does the money come from, Donald, to pay for it? You're saying all, you know, very important things, in terms of infrastructure in this country, but will you have to raise taxes to get there?"", ""TRUMP: No, it comes from cutting costs. We are tremendously bloated. It comes from cutting costs and it comes from bringing back jobs from these other places. And it comes from fairness. You know, China devalued, as you know, because you covered it very big a few days ago, China devalued, the biggest in two decades. Nobody thought they'd do that again. They have been devaluing their currency now and they're making it impossible for our companies to compete. We can't allow this to happen. So we -- and as you know, we can do things. We have tremend -- we have so many cards over China.. People say, oh well, they have the power over us. It's really wrong. We have the power. We have rebuilt China. If you think about it, the money they have taken out from our country, alone. Now they have done it in a smaller way to Europe and other places, but they've taken out of the United States, we've rebuilt China."", 'BARTIROMO: Well, part of the issue is the dollar is so strong here. Do you think the dollar is too strong? Do you have a strong dollar policy?', ""TRUMP: Well, you know, the beauty that is China so we owe them $1.4 trillion. They did it when it was weak and now it's strong, so they're making it on that end and they're also making it with trade, all the money they're making. I mean, they're making it every different way. The dollar is hurting us, there's no question about it. I mean, these companies can't compete. A friend of mine is in the excavation business and he just ordered Komatsu tractors, Komatsu. He always ordered Cats, right? He's a big Caterpillar guy. And he ended up ordering Komatsu excavators. And I said, why? He said it was impossible for anybody to compete."", ""Nice equipment. I said is equal? Eh, maybe not. So it's not equal. He hated doing it. He was depressed over doing it, but he ends up buying Komatsu, which is Japanese, and it's all because they've cut the hell out of the yen also. So I think the dollar is going to hurt us very badly, the strong dollar."", 'BARTIROMO: What do you do though? Do you want to rein it in?', ""TRUMP: Well, maybe they're going to have to. Look, we're going to lose a lot of business with it. You know, the strong dollar sounds good. It sounds good to say we have a strong dollar."", ""BARTIROMO: That's what they always say, but they don't do it."", ""TRUMP: That's about where it stops, because, you know, if you look at it, you can say we have a strong dollar, we have a strong currency, and there are certain advantages to that, but there are certain huge disadvantages. And the disadvantage is our companies are really suffering. It's very hard for Caterpillar and a lot of these other companies -- look at their stock. I saw their stock the other day, it's bad. It's very hard for these companies to compete when you have, you know, China, Japan, knocking the hell out of their currency. It's very hard."", 'BARTIROMO: So as the leader the free world, what do you do about it, Donald?', ""TRUMP: You have to have respect. You have to have them not do that. And if they do that, you're going to have to put a tariff on their goods coming in to equalize it."", ""BARTIROMO: OK, so you're talking about tariffs. You're talking about --"", ""TRUMP: You have no other choice. Well, you have no other choice. I don't want tariffs. Hey look, let's face it. China does tariffs on us like crazy. I have neater friend who's a manufacturer. He can't get goods into China. And when he does -- and he's a really good manufacturer, really good. When he does get them in they charge him a tariff and it's a massive -- he gave me a number which I won't even say because I can't even believe it. But they charge him massive tariffs to get his stuff into China. They've put their stuff in and we don't charge anything.

I wonder what you have to say about that, and this article in ""The Journal"" today that basically says, look, let\'s do away with quarterly earnings. Are we too short term thinking when it comes to money? And what about the private equity part of business, which basically is being criticized for, you know, activist investing and short term thinking?', ""TRUMP: Well, I think the short term is terrible and I think it is hurting the company. You know, the nice part about a company like mine, I'm a private company, I can do whatever I want. I can paint the ceiling and say what's my return on investment? I don't think about it. Whereas they don't want to do that.

I mean, the company is a great company. It's very liquid. We have very little debt. We have tremendous cash flow, and it's a great company. I tell them don't do deals. Just don't do anything.

We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me."", ""And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has.

And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them."", ""The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel."", ""When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region."", ""Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please."", ""Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have."", ""Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation."", ""Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror."", ""Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us."", ""Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me."", ""Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me."", ""Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me."", 'Thank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words ""Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."" You can forget that.', ""What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will."", ""Thank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel."", 'With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster.', 'The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent.', ""When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is."", ""A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks."", ""And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it."", ""So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen."", ""When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent."", 'You see, I know about deal making, that\'s what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I\'m saying ""one of,"" because I\'ll be criticized if I say ""the,"" so I\'m going to be very diplomatic, ""one of,"" I\'ll be criticized, I think it is', 'number one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making.', 'To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying.', ""That's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also."", ""Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one."", 'Thank you. And when I say something, I mean it.', ""I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop."", ""When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer."", ""You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now."", 'There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies.', 'And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly.', ""But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen."", ""President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved."", ""But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States."", 'We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel.', 'The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that.', 'And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state.', ""I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned."", 'So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.']",0
3,            Donald J. Trump          ,"April 27, 2016","['Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.', 'It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy. It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. Has to be first, has to be.', 'That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make. America – thank you. [Applause]', 'America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.', 'In the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War, it lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, “Tear down this wall.” [Applause]', 'History will not forget what he did. Very special, special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.', 'They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy.', 'We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.', 'They have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.', 'First, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.', 'We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.', 'I’m the only one — believe me, I know them all, I’m the only one that knows how to fix it. [Applause]', 'Secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.', 'They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.', 'The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice. [Applause]', 'The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.', 'Thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. [Applause]', 'And under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon. [Applause]', 'All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.', 'When the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program, then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.', 'Israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.', 'President Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself. [Applause]', 'We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.', 'Fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don’t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.', 'Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It’s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.', 'Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.', 'The list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don’t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.', 'He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.', 'Finally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.', 'We’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide. [Applause]', 'We have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we’re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never, ever solve the problem. [Applause]', 'Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.', 'Clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true.', 'This will all change when I become president.', 'To our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It’s going to be a friend again. We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies. [Applause]', 'We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.', 'This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president. [Applause]', 'First, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.', 'In this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.', 'We should work — thank you. [Applause]', 'We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It’s now two-way. And remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. We’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There’s no documentation. There’s no paperwork. There’s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.', 'A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.', 'And then there’s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how. We must … [Applause]', '… we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.', 'But they’re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president. And they’ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly. [Applause]', 'Secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.', 'And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that, in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted, and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.', 'We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.', 'But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.', 'This will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge. This includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare.', 'A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans … [Applause]', '… our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration. [Applause]', 'Finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible period of time for us — were attacked, and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole.', 'And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do it.', 'And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.', 'In the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.', 'We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends. [Applause]', 'We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.', 'Russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, an improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.', 'Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It’s as simple as that. We’re going to find out.', 'Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating a even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.', 'We have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They’re not supposed to be doing it.', 'No respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.', 'After I’m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism. [Applause]', 'I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win. [Applause]', 'I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V. [Applause]', 'Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake.', 'After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.', 'I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination.', 'Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me. [Applause]', 'However, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really, truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very, very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.', 'And now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people. [Applause]', 'We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television.', 'Finally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions. [Applause]', 'These are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. We want them to be our allies.', 'We want the world to be our — we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons.

I've been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls, I said, don't go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I've made."", ""You take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he's wrong, he's wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they're going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don't want to be told what to do. And they don't want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they're not qualified, even if they don't have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from."", ""And I said that Brexit's going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I'm the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn't, so that's OK."", ""So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I'm an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it's one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn't close. This wasn't close. [applause]"", ""No, this wasn't close. This was -- in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got -- I say we, because I'm the messenger, I'm a messenger -- I'm doing a good job, but I'm a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes. That's more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president."", ""Think of it. That's more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That's more than Richard Nixon. It's more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It's more than the Bushes."", ""But I mean by a lot. I don't mean by a little. But that's with 17 people. People don't over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it's going to be so amazing."", ""But they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who -- many of whom I've known, and I won't say, because for party unity, I'll say they're wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we're going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we're saying to happen."", ""They're tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don't allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we're going to take care of the miners and we're going to take care of the steelworkers. We're going to put 'em back to work. [applause]"", ""So they're very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112-12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we're going to have a big fight. We're not going to have a fight. People agree with what we've -- they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen."", ""And what we're doing... [applause]"", ""And what we're doing that I'm so proud of, so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it. We'll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he's not perfect. But you know what? They know I'm going to get the job done, and they're really smart. [applause]"", ""And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals, that we're going to do something that nobody's even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president."", ""And we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you're evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we're going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we're going to let evangelicals, we're going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk."", ""I saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you're so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you're sort of timid?"", ""And they didn't know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we're going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that's even slightly political."", ""And I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don't. That means they're more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start? [applause]"", ""And they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we're going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion's voice has been taken away. And we're going to change that. OK? All right. [applause]"", ""Back to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That's where Trump was going down -- they agreed I'd win New York, I'd win Pennsylvania, I'd win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall."", ""So I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we've never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55, 60 percent. It's a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places."", ""I have a friend who's a great builder. What he builds is plants. That's all he does, is build plants. He doesn't build buildings. He doesn't -- he builds plants. It's the biggest in the world, from what I hear."", ""I said, how's business? I was with him the other day. How's business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I'm surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we're doing in Mexico, you won't believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we're building plants in Mexico the likes of which we've never seen."", ""I said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That's the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you've never seen anything like it. It's incredible."", ""Folks, that's going to stop. We're going to go reverse it. We're going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can't be the stupid people anymore. OK? [applause]"", ""And he was better than a pollster. He's better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn't cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK? [laughter]"", ""It costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it's millions. But I'll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn't say it from the standpoint of he's upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I've never, ever seen anything like it."", ""And if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They're going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy."", ""But they're not going to do and they're not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you're going to you're your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It's very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won't say that because I'm much more interested right now in Mike. [laughter]"", ""Indiana's unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he's got an incredible family, incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing. [applause]"", ""Incredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen. When he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana's labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I've gone around to all these states. I've gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state."", ""And it's always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here's somebody where it's gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That's like very unusual."", ""Governor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget's so out of whack in this country, we don't know what we're doing. We're going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don't know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana."", ""It's also rated triple-A, their bonds are rated triple-A. Very few states have that. Triple-A. The best. That's as good as you can get, whether you're a company, a state, triple-A."", ""Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it's not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana."", ""And besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I'm saying. He loves the governor."", ""Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind. [applause]"", ""If you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said the, really -- they're doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They're doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on -- they can't even see a doctor. It's a scandal."", ""Take a look at what's happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what's happening with -- you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It's a scandal. It's corrupt. It's incompetent. It's a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact. [applause]"", ""So it's now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it's almost the best. Got 'em jobs. Got 'em jobs."", ""Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That's a great thing. They're going to stay there. That's a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy."", ""Under Governor Pence's leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the state's history. So you're balancing budgets, and yet you're giving more money to education. Isn't that a great thing? [applause]"", ""Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it's at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you gotta get rid of Common Core fast."", ""Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state's history. Think of that. We're cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure."", ""So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we're spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much -- look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?"", ""You know, it's very interesting. We're building -- we're building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it's an amazing -- probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what's happened. We're going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it."", ""But I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we're under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but we're a year ahead of schedule, and we're under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do. [applause]"", ""And when I explained to a government representative that we're under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they've never heard those words before. They've never heard them."", ""So when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike's work -- also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who's now at Duke -- who's now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it's something that hasn't happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country."", ""The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted -- who's a good guy, by the way, who's going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy -- but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?"", ""So even though he was under pressure, because I'm so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non-endorsement I've ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you. [applause]"", 'So with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [applause]']",0

U.S.A.! U.S.A.!', 'Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.', 'Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.', 'Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.', 'I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.', 'Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.', 'The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.', 'It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.', 'I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.', 'So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.', 'But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.', 'These are the facts:', ""Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement."", ""Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore."", ""In the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office."", 'The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.', 'The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.', 'One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.', ""I've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?"", 'Again, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.', ""Household incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that."", 'The budget is no better.', 'President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.', 'Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad.', 'Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.', 'This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.', ""In Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy."", ""Let's defeat her in November, OK."", ""I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record."", 'In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.', 'After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.', 'This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.', ""But Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America."", 'The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.', 'The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.', ""A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit."", 'Big business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.', ""That is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned."", ""I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long.

And how great is Cleveland?', 'I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.', ""When innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way."", ""And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country."", 'When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent,"" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.', 'In fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.', 'I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.', 'But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.', 'We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.', 'America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.', 'On Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me.', 'I will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.', 'The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.', ""This Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level."", 'When I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.', 'Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.', 'To make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.', 'Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.', 'The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.', ""Only weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it."", 'As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me.', 'And as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.', 'To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.', ""We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast."", 'This includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.', 'Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.', ""Lastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country."", ""My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama.

Because despite the nice platitudes, she's been a mess."", ""You look at what's happened with ISIS, which isn't even mentioned. You look at what's happening with law and order, they don't even mention our police. They mention everybody but our police. They don't have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags, one that we saw."", ""So you know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that its fun. 235 days, no news conference for Hillary Clinton. You oughta check it out because there's a lot going on."", 'Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she totally rigged it.

What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible, absolutely horrible."", ""If I would've used language like they used about religion, about race, about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I would've had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race."", ""With her, everything's just fine. So just ask yourself why she doesn't have news conferences. And honestly, the reason is because there's no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad."", ""When they talk about change, I noticed they have change. She's been there for 30 years. Thirty years. There's no change. It's going to be the same, it's going to be an extension of Obama. In my opinion, worse."", ""She lied about TPP. She was for TPP, she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because it's a horror show, it's going to kill all our jobs, it's going to be almost as bad as NAFTA, maybe worse which her husband signed, by the way, which destroyed this country, destroyed manufacturing in the United States."", ""And I'll do something about it, that'll be so renegotiated. And by the way, yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements. First time, yesterday. Well, because of me."", ""She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation. And she heard it and she said wow, she can't win that subject in a debate."", ""So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP, her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now he's going against it. And Bernie Sanders was right, he was against it."", ""They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins, which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesn't.

It's just a total deflection, this whole thing with Russia. In fact, I saw her campaign manager I don't know his title, Mook. I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking."", ""By the way, they hacked—they probably have her 33,000 e-mails. I hope they do.

Yes, it could be Trump, yes, yes. So it is so farfetched. It\'s so ridiculous. Honestly I wish I had that power. I\'d love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country.', ""And that's why—if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total—assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most farfetched I've ever heard. Yes, Jon?"", 'Question. [off-mike]', ""Donald Trump. I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me.

I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries.

I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast."", ""You saw what happened with the priest, it's only going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are, where they come from, where their documentation is, it's only going to get worse and it's going to start getting bad in our country. We're letting people come in by the tens of thousands. You see what happened to the French priest. A friend of mine, he said he was going to France, like three, four months ago. I saw him yesterday. I said how'd you like France. He said I wouldn't go to France. I wouldn't go to France. Because France is no longer France. France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice, you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man. France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and they'll never do it with Hillary Clinton."", ""And by the way, in terms of change, she's been there for 30 years.

But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?"", 'Question. [off-mike]', ""Donald Trump. I don't know, I don't know. It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's OK.

I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia."", ""And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows."", 'Question. [off-mike]', ""Donald Trump. I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said don't blame them, essentially, for your incompetence. Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It was about the things that were said in those e-mails. They were terrible things, talking about Jewish, talking about race, talking about atheist, trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace, and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and believe me, as sure as you're sitting there, Hillary Clinton knew about it. She knew everything."", ""Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton. Couldn't breathe. And you saw that. It also showed that it was a fixed race, but I've been saying that long before I saw the e-mails. It was a rigged race. It was totally rigged. And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton, and the sad part is, Bernie Sanders has, to use an old word that I use on occasion, he's lost his energy. He wants to go home and go to sleep. But he's got a lot of people that walked out last night. Now, hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night. I didn't even hear about it. Nobody showed it. I didn't see it on television. You people don't talk about it."", 'The Republican Convention was incredible. I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades. Like, some people are saying nine points. In fact, a poll just came out ten minutes ago, ""Los Angeles Times"", Trump 47, Clinton 40.

I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia—which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir..."", 'Question. [inaudible] this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country [inaudible]?', ""OK. Sure. Two big questions. The minimum wage has to go up. People are—at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up."", ""Now, Bernie Sanders lied. Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7. I said, where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today. He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said, Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East. Now, that was Ted Cruz that said that. That was not Donald Trump. I mean, he's not a very bright guy, but that was Ted Cruz that said it. And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb. That was Ted Cruz. You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that, I think. Go ahead."", ""So I would like to raise it to at least $10, and what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers you're talking about are going to—literally, they're going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country, because I'm going to bring jobs back from Mexico, which is booming, booming. I have a friend who builds plants and he's a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy. He builds massive plants, for automobiles, for computers, for anything. That's what he does. I think he's the biggest, but certainly one of the biggest."", ""And I said, how's it going? He said, unbelievable. Oh good, that's good news. The country's doing well. No, the country's not doing well, but Mexico is unbelievable. The plants I'm building in Mexico, I've never seen anything—it's the eighth wonder of the world. And he's not happy. He's an American guy. He'd rather build them here. But he said it's unbelievable. That's what's happened to our country. Because we have leadership that doesn't know what they're doing."", 'Question. [inaudible] special extreme vetting?', ""Donald Trump. Yes we're going to be listing; yeah we're going to be giving a list of those territories. And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting. And we're going to have extreme vetting anyway. Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions. And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's a lot of other things, and you look all over the world and you see what's happening."", ""You look at Orlando, how bad was that? And that was horrible. That was going after the gay community it looks like. We can't let this happen. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let people come in."", ""Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it. Her running mate Tim Kaine, who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey. First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and he's not very popular in New Jersey. And he still isn't. What?"", ""I mean Virginia. The first thing he did, the first thing that Tim Kaine did, he asked for a $4 billion tax increase. And he's not very popular. So let me just tell you, and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day. And I thought he'd be popular. He's not popular because he asked for tax increases. Big tax increases in Virginia. Big. And also the unemployment went up, I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure."", ""But what he wanted to do is very strongly and he's on record, he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants.

This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration. Unbelievable numbers. Unbelievable numbers. The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare, welfare, housing, schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Department's placement figures. Think of this: $400 billion. In short, Hillary Clinton wants to be America's Angela Merkel. [Boos] And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany. Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe. We have enough problems in our country. We don't need more.\n"", 'Lastly, we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures. Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored. The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications. Almost every one of them. It said practically in big bold letters ""fraud"". And nobody saw it. The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers, here on political asylum, and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI. Very sad.\n', ""The female San Bernardino shooter, on her--on her statements, and everything that she said: she was here on a fiancée visa, which most people have not even heard of, from Saudi Arabia, and she wanted to support very openly jihad online. These are the people we're taking in.\n"", ""A neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor, and other things--but didn't warn authorities because they said they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. Now, many are dead and many more are gravely wounded.\n"", ""The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 . He, too, was interviewed by the FBI. His father, a native of Afghanistan, supported the oppressive Taliban regime, and expressed anti-American views very strongly , and by the way, was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face, all the way through her speech. [Boos] He obviously liked what she had to say. It's called: weakness, weakness. It's called stupidity, and we've had it. [applause]\n"", 'The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another.

Thank you.\n', ""That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam, which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community, who will hopefully work with us. We want to build bridges and erase divisions. The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam, to identify the warning signs of radicalization, and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization. This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers, federal investigators and immigration screeners.

[applause] To accomplish a goal, you must state a mission. The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed, one-by-one, viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary. Immigration offices will also have their powers restored. Those have been taken away. Those who are guests in our country that are preaching hate will be asked to return home immediately and if they don't immediately, we will return them home.\n"", 'To make America safe again, we must work together again.

Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.', 'Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.', 'The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.', 'Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.', 'The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.', 'There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.', 'The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.', 'More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.', 'Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.', 'Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.', 'They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.', 'Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.', ""During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.

Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school.', 'For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.', 'Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.', 'I care too much about my country to let that happen.', 'We all care too much about our country to let that happen.', 'Good policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.

Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.', ""Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil.

In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system."", 'The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.', 'I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.', 'Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.', ""We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.

No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.

The Institute for Energy Research cites a ""short-run"" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.', 'Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:', ""We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs.

As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.', 'We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.', 'We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.', 'As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.', 'Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.', ""In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities. Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking."", 'Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.', 'Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department. Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.', 'We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.', 'One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure. I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities. At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.', 'These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.', ""America must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs."", 'We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.', 'Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.', 'To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.', 'We will protect those who protect us.', 'And we will follow their example of unity.

By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.', 'Throughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State. These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.', ""It's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation."", ""As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena. Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer."", 'Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn\'t remember important events 39 times. She couldn\'t even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information. She even said she didn\'t know that the letter ""C"" stood for confidential classified information.', ""All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart. Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria. She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea."", 'Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons – not to mention the ransom payments.', ""On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy. She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes. She believes in globalism, not Americanism."", ""Last night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya. Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now."", 'Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race. I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out – letting ISIS fill the void.', 'But I was opposed to the war from the beginning.', 'Long after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that ""perhaps [we] shouldn\'t be doing it yet,"" and that ""the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.""', 'Then, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is ""a mess,"" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.', 'In July of 2003, I said that ""I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly."" I had a number of quotes to this effect.', 'Then, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.', '""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we\'re in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C\'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there\'s going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.', ""What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!"", 'I would have been tougher on terrorism. Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.""', ""Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition. For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career."", 'Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen. I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had. But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.', ""Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it – all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator.

This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.', ""Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative – with billions left over. It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy."", ""Let's run through the numbers."", ""At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year. That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools."", 'The federal government pays for about 10 percent—$64 billion, to be precise—of the K-12 costs. That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.', 'The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.', 'We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world. Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.', 'Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.', 'New York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.', 'Baltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.', 'Chicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.', 'Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money – allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.', 'Not only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.', ""These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family – not the needs of the Teachers' Union. There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms."", 'The current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.', 'According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.', 'Failing schools then contribute to failing economies.', 'In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent. In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.', 'In Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty. In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent. In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.', 'Nationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty – including 45% of children under the age of six.', 'Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.', ""Meanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities – which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children."", 'Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015. Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%. There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.', 'Government is failing our citizens at every level.', 'That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.', 'That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.', 'Here is how it will work.', 'Right now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide. These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts. This covers about 400,000 students in our country.', 'Altogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.', 'Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.', 'They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.', 'My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice. This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.', 'Specifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.', 'We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend. Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.', 'This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.', 'A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds. Ohio is a leader in school choice. Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.', 'But the $20 billion is only the beginning. As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.', 'That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.', 'Each state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.', '9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level. To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission – to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.', 'I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.', 'My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America – Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit – that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community. In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.', 'I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.', 'If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.', 'If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.', 'The money will follow the student. That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice – and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.', ""As your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice. I understand many stale old politicians will resist. But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again. We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead."", 'I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers – instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.', 'At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.', 'My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.', 'My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.', 'By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.', ""Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America. We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world – that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others. By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America."", 'The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.', ""All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past.

Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches. And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason. And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.', ""So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk. And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty. And one of the pastors, who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts, much more importantly – they looked at me and they said, that's actually right. They have more power than we do. We're not allowed to express."", ""And that's what I said. We have to start thinking about this. And I thought about it.

But one of the most important – some people think it's actually the most important – is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court. You see what's happening right now? Essentially it's four and four. And you see what – how bad it is. We're going to pick great judges. I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people. And we are going to put truly great people.

Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four. If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye. And we don't want to see that."", ""Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security. Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. [cheers and applause] Failed at everything. Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power. They were dying three years ago. The sanctions were choking them. They would have fallen.

You can use your plan. You can use your doctors – 27 times, right? Twenty-seven times. You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie. It's all a lie. It's all a big lie.

Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages. They waited there for hours and hours. And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something. It was this – just another lie."", ""But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai, yai, yai. They think we're stupid.

Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.', 'The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America – including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians – to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.', 'They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.', 'Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.', 'The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.', 'Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions', 'to their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.', 'For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax – a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.', ""Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans – you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them."", 'Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.', ""The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year – they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover – so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings."", 'These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms', 'I outlined last week.', 'The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.', 'For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds – if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.', 'These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.', 'Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.', 'But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.', 'In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button – including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.', 'Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well. This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.', 'Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.', 'There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.', 'On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.', ""These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together – not as Republicans or Democrats – but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people."", 'While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love', 'your families, and want a better future for all Americans.', ""It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people."", ""It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead."", 'It is time to Believe In America.', 'Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.', 'We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.', 'And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.']",0

Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.', 'Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.', 'Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times – but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation.

But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.', 'Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.', 'The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities. It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer – and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.', 'There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.', 'Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.', 'For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.', 'More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.', 'Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.', 'More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.', 'Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.', 'This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.', 'Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York. The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.', 'We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.', 'I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates – and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.', 'My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.', 'Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job. To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.', 'That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.', 'We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas – hunted down for execution – continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.', 'Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.', 'Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.', 'But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude.

That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.', 'This brings us to the subject of energy.', 'Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again – especially for the poorest Americans.', 'America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy – some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.', ""It's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices."", 'I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities – including right here in Pennsylvania.', 'According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:', 'increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually', 'add over 500,000 new jobs annually', 'increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years', 'increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades', 'increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.', 'In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.', 'Overall, my entire economic plan – tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform – will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.', 'My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today – turning America into a jobs magnet. Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.', 'Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut – including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.', 'My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety. Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.', 'On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.', ""Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States. Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term."", 'It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.', 'Compare that to my opponent. She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production. Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.', 'Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.', 'This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.', 'Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.', 'She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.', 'According to the Wall Street Journal, ""Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.""', 'Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.', 'Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.', 'The platform produced by Hillary Clinton\'s party this year also calls for a ""price on carbon."" That\'s just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production – a tax on American consumers.', ""And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country – often foreign countries not very friendly to us."", 'That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.', ""That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves."", 'We need an America-First energy plan.', 'This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.', 'The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions – more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.', ""Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars."", 'She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production – which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.', 'Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.', 'We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy. The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.', 'At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.', 'But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.', 'Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.', ""Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production."", 'Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.', 'That means we will end the war on coal.', 'I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.', 'We will eliminate the highly-invasive ""Waters of the US"" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan – these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.', 'I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.', 'I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats. My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.', 'It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.', 'It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.', 'It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.', 'We Will make America Wealthy Again.', 'We Will make America Safe Again.', 'And We Will Make America Great Again.']",0
