The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it’s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It’d be all right.', 'The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.', 'And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on – in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.', 'But there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble.', 'I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things weren’t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.', 'That’s why I’m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we’re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We’re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We’re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can’t take over.', 'The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we’re in this problem right now.', 'In addition to that, we’re in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn’t do much at all. By the time he left, there’s – things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos.', 'And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug – all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year.', 'And the situation is making – and we’re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we’re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that’s what we’re going to get done.', 'Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he’s the only one who thinks that, I think. I don’t know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world.', 'And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy – he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He’s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.', 'And the military – you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn’t do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any – this – this decade – doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.', 'He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one.', 'Number two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy.', 'What I’m going to do is fix the taxes.', 'For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what’s happening? They’re in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they’d raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.', 'We’d be able to right – wipe out his debt. We’d be able to help make sure that – all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with the COVID – excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with.', 'Look, if – we finally beat Medicare.', 'It’s been a terrible thing what you’ve done.', 'The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was – that’s – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.', 'And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We’re in a state where in six weeks you don’t even know whether you’re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.', 'The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we’re going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule.', 'Look, there’s so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by – by – by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that.', 'But here’s the deal, there’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by – just – it’s just – it’s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines.', 'I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters.', 'First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor – I mean, it’d be between the woman and the state.', 'The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman’s health is ridiculous. That’s the last – no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That’s how it should be run. That’s what you’re going to do.', 'And if I’m elected, I’m going to restore Roe v. Wade.', 'He’s lying. That is simply not true.', 'That – Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That’s not the circumstance. Only when the woman’s life is in danger, she’s going to die, that’s the only circumstance in which that can happen.', 'But we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period.', 'For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away.', 'What’s he going to do? What’s he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I’ll veto it. He’ll sign it.', 'Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position.', 'In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That’s not the right way to go.', 'What I’ve done – since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened? I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It’s better than when he left office. And I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.', 'The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed – an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That’s the only terrorist that’s there.', 'I’m not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they’re emptying their prisons, we’re welcoming these people, that’s simply not true. There’s no data to support what he said.', 'Once again, he’s exaggerating. He’s lying.', 'Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one.', 'For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it – and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they’re all being covered now. And he opposed – his group opposed that.', 'We’re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My – my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma.', 'I was recently in – in – in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him – he said, I don’t want to go in there because they’re a bunch of losers and suckers.', 'My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You’re the sucker. You’re the loser.', 'You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That’s number one.', 'And, number two, the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We’ve done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history. And they now – and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war.', 'That’s what we’re doing. That’s what the V.A. is doing now. They’re doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.', 'I’ve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life.', 'Look, the fact of the matter is that we’re in a situation where – let’s take the last point first. Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently – when he was president, they attacked. He said they’re just having headaches. That’s all it is. We didn’t do a thing when the attack took place, number one.', 'Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift.', 'Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he’s – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that’s exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in.', 'And listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it’s part of the old Soviet Union. That’s what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn’t do it at all. He didn’t – wasn’t able to get it done. And they’ve lost over – they’ve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.', 'The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He’s killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That’s what he wants.', 'And then do you think he’ll stop there? Do you think he’ll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?', 'And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he’s going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away – by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That’s why it’s – that’s why we’re strong.', 'Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.', 'The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know – the end of the war.', 'The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They’re the only ones standing out (ph). We’re still pushing hard from – to get them to accept.', 'In the meantime, what’s happened in Israel? We’re finally – the only thing I’ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don’t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them.', 'And by the way, I’m the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic – ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No – one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel.', 'We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that’s – there’re two different things.', 'Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don’t have to do it.', 'And by the way, they’ve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated.', 'But you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.', 'I’ve never heard so much foolishness.', 'This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You’re going to stay in NATO or you’re going to pull out of NATO?', 'The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we’re – (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then.', 'He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about.', 'And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was – this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No – no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.', 'Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one.', 'I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging – being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked – they’ve talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he’ll now forgive them for what they’ve done. They’ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that – no.', 'He went to every single court in the nation, I don’t know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said – they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done.', 'He didn’t do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out.', 'And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.', 'The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is – what he’s telling you is simply not true.', 'The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn’t kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues – the idea that those people are patriots? Come on.', 'When I asked him, the first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I’ll tell them to stand by. The idea he’s refusing – will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we’re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do?', 'The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you’re talking about is outrageous. It’s simply a lie, number one.', 'Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you’re a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president’s ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.', 'Number three, the crimes that you are still charged with – and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night – and – while your wife was pregnant?', 'I mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.', 'The more they know about what he’s done, yes. The more they know about what he’s done.', 'And there’s a lot more coming. He’s got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He’s got – he’s got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don’t know what the juries will do, but I do know – I do know he has a real problem.', 'And so the fact that – could you ever think you’re hearing any president say that, I’m going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea?', 'What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq, I said, I wasn’t going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches – torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when – back in Germany.', 'And what did – and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she – they asked him, they said, what – well, what do you think of those people, the people who – the one who – the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there’s fine people on both sides?', 'What American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people?', 'This is a guy who says Hitler’s done some good things. I’d like to know what they are, the good things Hitler’s done. That’s what he said.', 'This guy has no sense of American democracy.', 'And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.', 'And the idea that somehow that’s the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.', 'If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that forest, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn’t deserve to be president, didn’t deserve to be president at all.', 'And the idea that he’s talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there.', 'His own vice president – look, there’s a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn’t endorsed him this time.', 'So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?', 'They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they’re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.', 'And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We’ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We’ve got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market.', 'So there’s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we’ve done a great deal so far and I’m not letting up and they know it.', 'I say, I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.', 'I made sure that we’re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we’re going to do a whole lot more for black families.', 'There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That’s why there was no inflation at the time.', 'There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with – the ACA has increased. I made sure that they’re $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they’re going to try again if they win.', 'You find ourselves in a position where the idea that we’re not doing it. I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We’re providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic.', 'I don’t know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I’ve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don’t have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they’ll be able to get those jobs in high tech.', 'We’re in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done.', 'Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we’re not able to – the United States can’t get it’s pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We’re making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have – we have made significant progress. And we’re continuing to make progress.', 'We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we’re going to – we’re moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.', 'But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he’s really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I’ve not seen any indication of that.', 'And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.', 'And, by the way…', 'Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they’re 18 years old.', 'The idea that they’re going to – I’m not – I’ve been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.', 'Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I’ll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there’s plenty to cut in Social Security. He’s wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that’s with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.', 'The idea that we don’t need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you’re in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.', 'And, by the way, the other thing is we’re in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I’ve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.', 'It’s just – he – he just doesn’t know what he’s talking about.', 'The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said “suckers and losers,” he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he’s the one that acknowledged that that’s what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.', 'Number two, the idea that we’re going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there’s a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We’re doing better than any other nation in the world.', 'And, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we’re likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.', 'And by the way, worst president in history – 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.', 'We are the most admired country in the world. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we’re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one.', 'Number two, the idea that we’re talking about worst presidents. I wasn’t joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don’t hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They’ve had meetings and they voted who’s the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That’s a fact. That’s not conjecture. He can argue they are wrong, but that’s what they voted.', 'The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities.', 'Look, the fact of the matter is that he’s dead wrong about it. He’s increased the tariff – he’s increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I’d never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn’t.', 'But this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That’s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they’re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.', 'Number two, he’s in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.', 'Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.', 'Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.', 'More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don’t do it. It’s going to hurt me politically.', 'He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we’re coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don’t have the technology to be able to put it together. That’s what we have to do. We need those machines.', 'Well, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I’m the oldest. This guy’s three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I’ve done. Look how I’ve turned around the horrible situation he left me.', 'As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing. We’ve – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.', 'So I went – I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don’t need a college degree for them.

Biden,2024,,"How are you?Good to be here. Thank you. You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it’s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It’d be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on – in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things weren’t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That’s why I’m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we’re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We’re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We’re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can’t take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we’re in this problem right now. In addition to that, we’re in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn’t do much at all. By the time he left, there’s – things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug – all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year. And the situation is making – and we’re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we’re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that’s what we’re going to get done. Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he’s the only one who thinks that, I think. I don’t know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy – he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He’s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant. And the military – you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn’t do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any – this – this decade – doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did. He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one. Number two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy. What I’m going to do is fix the taxes. For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what’s happening? They’re in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they’d raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period. We’d be able to right – wipe out his debt. We’d be able to help make sure that – all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with the COVID – excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with. Look, if – we finally beat Medicare. It’s been a terrible thing what you’ve done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was – that’s – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous. And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We’re in a state where in six weeks you don’t even know whether you’re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help. The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we’re going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule. Look, there’s so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by – by – by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that. But here’s the deal, there’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by – just – it’s just – it’s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines. I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor – I mean, it’d be between the woman and the state. The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman’s health is ridiculous. That’s the last – no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That’s how it should be run. That’s what you’re going to do. And if I’m elected, I’m going to restore Roe v. Wade. He’s lying. That is simply not true. That – Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That’s not the circumstance. Only when the woman’s life is in danger, she’s going to die, that’s the only circumstance in which that can happen. But we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period. For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away. What’s he going to do? What’s he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I’ll veto it. He’ll sign it. Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position. In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That’s not the right way to go. What I’ve done – since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened? I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It’s better than when he left office. And I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers. The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed – an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That’s the only terrorist that’s there. I’m not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they’re emptying their prisons, we’re welcoming these people, that’s simply not true. There’s no data to support what he said. Once again, he’s exaggerating. He’s lying. Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one. For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it – and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they’re all being covered now. And he opposed – his group opposed that. We’re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My – my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in – in – in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him – he said, I don’t want to go in there because they’re a bunch of losers and suckers. My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You’re the sucker. You’re the loser. You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That’s number one. And, number two, the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We’ve done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history. And they now – and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what the V.A. is doing now. They’re doing more for veterans than ever before in our history. I’ve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we’re in a situation where – let’s take the last point first. Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently – when he was president, they attacked. He said they’re just having headaches. That’s all it is. We didn’t do a thing when the attack took place, number one. Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he’s – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that’s exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in. And listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it’s part of the old Soviet Union. That’s what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn’t do it at all. He didn’t – wasn’t able to get it done. And they’ve lost over – they’ve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops. The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He’s killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That’s what he wants. And then do you think he’ll stop there? Do you think he’ll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries? And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he’s going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away – by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That’s why it’s – that’s why we’re strong. Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it. The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know – the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They’re the only ones standing out (ph). We’re still pushing hard from – to get them to accept. In the meantime, what’s happened in Israel? We’re finally – the only thing I’ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don’t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them. And by the way, I’m the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic – ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No – one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that’s – there’re two different things. Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don’t have to do it. And by the way, they’ve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated. But you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers. I’ve never heard so much foolishness. This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You’re going to stay in NATO or you’re going to pull out of NATO? The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we’re – (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then. He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about. And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was – this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No – no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe. Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging – being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked – they’ve talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he’ll now forgive them for what they’ve done. They’ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that – no. He went to every single court in the nation, I don’t know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said – they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done. He didn’t do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out. And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath. The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is – what he’s telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn’t kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues – the idea that those people are patriots? Come on. When I asked him, the first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I’ll tell them to stand by. The idea he’s refusing – will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we’re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do? The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you’re talking about is outrageous. It’s simply a lie, number one. Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you’re a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president’s ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before. Number three, the crimes that you are still charged with – and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night – and – while your wife was pregnant? I mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat. The more they know about what he’s done, yes. The more they know about what he’s done. And there’s a lot more coming. He’s got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He’s got – he’s got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don’t know what the juries will do, but I do know – I do know he has a real problem. And so the fact that – could you ever think you’re hearing any president say that, I’m going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea? What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq, I said, I wasn’t going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches – torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when – back in Germany. And what did – and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she – they asked him, they said, what – well, what do you think of those people, the people who – the one who – the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there’s fine people on both sides? What American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people? This is a guy who says Hitler’s done some good things. I’d like to know what they are, the good things Hitler’s done. That’s what he said. This guy has no sense of American democracy. And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time. And the idea that somehow that’s the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected. If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that forest, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn’t deserve to be president, didn’t deserve to be president at all. And the idea that he’s talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there. His own vice president – look, there’s a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn’t endorsed him this time. So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him? They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they’re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses. And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We’ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We’ve got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market. So there’s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we’ve done a great deal so far and I’m not letting up and they know it. I say, I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started. I made sure that we’re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we’re going to do a whole lot more for black families. There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That’s why there was no inflation at the time. There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with – the ACA has increased. I made sure that they’re $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they’re going to try again if they win. You find ourselves in a position where the idea that we’re not doing it. I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We’re providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic. I don’t know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I’ve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don’t have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they’ll be able to get those jobs in high tech. We’re in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done. Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we’re not able to – the United States can’t get it’s pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We’re making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have – we have made significant progress. And we’re continuing to make progress. We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we’re going to – we’re moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution. But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he’s really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I’ve not seen any indication of that. And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay. And, by the way… Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they’re 18 years old. The idea that they’re going to – I’m not – I’ve been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life. Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I’ll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there’s plenty to cut in Social Security. He’s wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that’s with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well. The idea that we don’t need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you’re in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA. And, by the way, the other thing is we’re in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I’ve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition. It’s just – he – he just doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said “suckers and losers,” he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he’s the one that acknowledged that that’s what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one. Number two, the idea that we’re going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there’s a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We’re doing better than any other nation in the world. And, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we’re likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up. And by the way, worst president in history – 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America. We are the most admired country in the world. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we’re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one. Number two, the idea that we’re talking about worst presidents. I wasn’t joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don’t hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They’ve had meetings and they voted who’s the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That’s a fact. That’s not conjecture. He can argue they are wrong, but that’s what they voted. The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities. Look, the fact of the matter is that he’s dead wrong about it. He’s increased the tariff – he’s increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I’d never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn’t. But this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That’s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they’re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important. Number two, he’s in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one. Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010. Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal. More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don’t do it. It’s going to hurt me politically. He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we’re coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don’t have the technology to be able to put it together. That’s what we have to do. We need those machines. Well, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I’m the oldest. This guy’s three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I’ve done. Look how I’ve turned around the horrible situation he left me. As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing. We’ve – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product. So I went – I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don’t need a college degree for them. And there’s billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world. Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We – we’re the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn’t trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we’re the most progressive country in the world in getting things done. We’re the strongest country in the world. We’re a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies. And our – those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don’t want to screw around with us. You’re going to see he’s six-foot-five and only 225 pounds – or 235 pounds. Well, you said six-four, 200. Well, anyway, that’s – anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is. Look, I’d be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6. And by the way, I told you before I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it? I was 8 handicap. Eight, but I have – you know how many… You are a child. If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO – just do what you want. There’s a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response. The idea – the idea – I can’t think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn’t trade places with what job I’ve done and what they’ve done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They’re capable of anything and they step up when they’re needed. And right now, we’re needed. We’re needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake. And again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war. Let’s see what your numbers are when this election is over. Let’s see. You’re a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country. Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none. But you continue to promote this lie about somehow there’s all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There’s no evidence of that at all. And I tell you what? I doubt whether you’ll accept it because you’re such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you’re accepting anything, you can’t stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time. We’ve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term. We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair? The fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I’m reelected, that’ll be the case again. But this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he’s increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America. What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the – us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it – we got it down to 15 – excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need. You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) – debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn’t have to pay the exorbitant prices. I’m going to make that available to every senior, all – or go longer. It’s happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have – I’m going to make sure we have childcare. We’re going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I’m going to make sure we do something about what we’re doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country. We’re going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.","How are you?Good to be here. Thank you. You have to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me. We had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic are so badly handled, many people were dying. All he said was, it’s not that serious. Just inject a little bleach in your arm. It’d be all right. The economy collapsed. There were no jobs. Unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible. And so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. That’s exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought on – in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. But there’s more to be done. There’s more to be done. Working class people are still in trouble. I come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come from a household where the kitchen table – if things weren’t able to be met during the month was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things. That’s why I’m working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems. And we’re going to make sure that we reduce the price of housing. We’re going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We’re going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can’t take over. The combination of what I was left and then corporate greed are the reason why we’re in this problem right now. In addition to that, we’re in a situation where if you had – take a look at all that was done in his administration, he didn’t do much at all. By the time he left, there’s – things had been in chaos. There was (ph) literally chaos. And so, we put things back together. We created, as I said, those (ph) jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug – all the drugs they (inaudible) beginning next year. And the situation is making – and we’re going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we’re working to bring down the prices around the kitchen table. And that’s what we’re going to get done. Well, look, the greatest economy in the world, he’s the only one who thinks that, I think. I don’t know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world. And, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy – he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He’s the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant. And the military – you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. He didn’t do anything about that. When he was president, we still found ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any – this – this decade – doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did. He had the largest national debt of any president four-year period, number one. Number two, he got $2 trillion tax cut, benefited the very wealthy. What I’m going to do is fix the taxes. For example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what’s happening? They’re in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they’d raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period. We’d be able to right – wipe out his debt. We’d be able to help make sure that – all those things we need to do, childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we’re able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I’ve been able to do with the COVID – excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with. Look, if – we finally beat Medicare. It’s been a terrible thing what you’ve done. The fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And I was – that’s – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous. And this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We’re in a state where in six weeks you don’t even know whether you’re pregnant or not, but you cannot see a doctor, have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help. The idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we’re going to turn civil rights back to the states, let each state have a different rule. Look, there’s so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by – by – by an immigrant coming in and (inaudible) talk about that. But here’s the deal, there’s a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by – just – it’s just – it’s just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it. And they try to arrest them when they cross state lines. I supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between a doctor and an extreme situation. A third time is between the doctor – I mean, it’d be between the woman and the state. The idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about a woman’s health is ridiculous. That’s the last – no politician should be making that decision. A doctor should be making those decisions. That’s how it should be run. That’s what you’re going to do. And if I’m elected, I’m going to restore Roe v. Wade. He’s lying. That is simply not true. That – Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That’s not the circumstance. Only when the woman’s life is in danger, she’s going to die, that’s the only circumstance in which that can happen. But we are not for late-term abortion, period, period, period. For 51 years, that was the law. 51 years, constitutional scholarship said it was the right way to go. 51 years. And it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. Takes credit for taking it away. What’s he going to do? What’s he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected, and the MAGA Republicans control the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board at six weeks or seven or eight or 10 weeks, something very, very conservative? Is he going to sign that bill? I’ll veto it. He’ll sign it. Because we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me, endorsed my position. In addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That’s not the right way to go. What I’ve done – since I’ve changed the law, what’s happened? I’ve changed it in a way that now you’re in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. It’s better than when he left office. And I’m going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we’re going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers. The only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three in his administration, killed – an al-Qaida person in his administration killed three American soldiers, killed three American soldiers. That’s the only terrorist that’s there. I’m not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they’re emptying their prisons, we’re welcoming these people, that’s simply not true. There’s no data to support what he said. Once again, he’s exaggerating. He’s lying. Every single thing he said is a lie, every single one. For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it – and their families have it. Because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they’re all being covered now. And he opposed – his group opposed that. We’re also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My – my son spent a year in Iraq living next to one of those burn pits. Came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in – in – in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him – he said, I don’t want to go in there because they’re a bunch of losers and suckers. My son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You’re the sucker. You’re the loser. You had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That’s number one. And, number two, the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We’ve done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history. And they now – and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what the V.A. is doing now. They’re doing more for veterans than ever before in our history. I’ve never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we’re in a situation where – let’s take the last point first. Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently – when he was president, they attacked. He said they’re just having headaches. That’s all it is. We didn’t do a thing when the attack took place, number one. Number two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he’s – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump, do whatever you want. Do whatever you want. And that’s exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in. And listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it’s part of the old Soviet Union. That’s what he wanted to re-establish, Kyiv. And he, in fact, didn’t do it at all. He didn’t – wasn’t able to get it done. And they’ve lost over – they’ve lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops. The fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He’s killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear: He wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire. Not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That’s what he wants. And then do you think he’ll stop there? Do you think he’ll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries? And so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he’s going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away – by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and weapons we make here in the United States. We give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That’s why it’s – that’s why we’re strong. Number one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it. The first stage is trade the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know – the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They’re the only ones standing out (ph). We’re still pushing hard from – to get them to accept. In the meantime, what’s happened in Israel? We’re finally – the only thing I’ve denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don’t work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them. And by the way, I’m the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic – ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No – one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that’s – there’re two different things. Hamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don’t have to do it. And by the way, they’ve been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened. And they should be. They should be eliminated. But you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers. I’ve never heard so much foolishness. This is a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You’re going to stay in NATO or you’re going to pull out of NATO? The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we’re – (inaudible) able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe. What happens if, in fact, you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about, go ahead, let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then. He has no idea what the hell he’s talking about. And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was – this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No – no major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe. Look, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours, three hours, watching, begging – being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked – they’ve talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America. In fact, he says he’ll now forgive them for what they’ve done. They’ve been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that – no. He went to every single court in the nation, I don’t know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court, and they said they said – they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done. He didn’t do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out. And now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath. The only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I’m looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is – what he’s telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted, deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn’t kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues – the idea that those people are patriots? Come on. When I asked him, the first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys? He said, no, I’ll tell them to stand by. The idea he’s refusing – will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we’re talking about now? Will you denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do? The idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you’re talking about is outrageous. It’s simply a lie, number one. Number two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American just because you’re a president is wrong, is simply wrong. No president’s ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before. Number three, the crimes that you are still charged with – and think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night – and – while your wife was pregnant? I mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat. The more they know about what he’s done, yes. The more they know about what he’s done. And there’s a lot more coming. He’s got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He’s got – he’s got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don’t know what the juries will do, but I do know – I do know he has a real problem. And so the fact that – could you ever think you’re hearing any president say that, I’m going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that he thought it might be a good idea? What got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq, I said, I wasn’t going to run again. Until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, people coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches – torches and singing the same antisemitic bile they sang when – back in Germany. And what did – and the young woman got killed. I spoke to the mother. And she – they asked him, they said, what – well, what do you think of those people, the people who – the one who – the ones who tried to stop it and the ones who said, I think there’s fine people on both sides? What American president would ever say Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same antisemitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people? This is a guy who says Hitler’s done some good things. I’d like to know what they are, the good things Hitler’s done. That’s what he said. This guy has no sense of American democracy. And debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time. And the idea that somehow that’s the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected. If he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that forest, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn’t deserve to be president, didn’t deserve to be president at all. And the idea that he’s talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking through the windows. We saw people occupying there. His own vice president – look, there’s a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused to endorse him this time. His vice president hasn’t endorsed him this time. So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him? They acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level it has been in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they’re trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses. And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We’ve got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We’ve got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market. So there’s more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we’ve done a great deal so far and I’m not letting up and they know it. I say, I don’t blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started. I made sure that we’re in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we’re going to do a whole lot more for black families. There was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15 percent unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That’s why there was no inflation at the time. There were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved in communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with – the ACA has increased. I made sure that they’re $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they’re going to try again if they win. You find ourselves in a position where the idea that we’re not doing it. I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We’re providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous malfeasance in the way he handled the pandemic. I don’t know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I’ve passed the most extensive, it was the most extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don’t have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing what any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they’ll be able to get those jobs in high tech. We’re in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done. Where does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not who are not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything when (ph) we’re not able to – the United States can’t get it’s pollution under control? One of the largest polluters in the world, number one. We’re making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half. We have – we have made significant progress. And we’re continuing to make progress. We set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we’re going to – we’re moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution. But the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he’s really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I’ve not seen any indication of that. And, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay. And, by the way… Yes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they’re 18 years old. The idea that they’re going to – I’m not – I’ve been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life. Well, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I’ll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there’s plenty to cut in Social Security. He’s wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that’s with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well. The idea that we don’t need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you’re in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA. And, by the way, the other thing is we’re in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I’ve raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition. It’s just – he – he just doesn’t know what he’s talking about. The idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said “suckers and losers,” he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he’s the one that acknowledged that that’s what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one. Number two, the idea that we’re going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there’s a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We’re doing better than any other nation in the world. And, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates he talked about being phony, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that, if Trump is re-elected, we’re likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up. And by the way, worst president in history – 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America. We are the most admired country in the world. We’re the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we’re weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one. Number two, the idea that we’re talking about worst presidents. I wasn’t joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don’t hold me to the exact number, presidential historians. They’ve had meetings and they voted who’s the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That’s a fact. That’s not conjecture. He can argue they are wrong, but that’s what they voted. The idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities. Look, the fact of the matter is that he’s dead wrong about it. He’s increased the tariff – he’s increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I’d never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn’t. But this tariff, this 10 percent tariffs. Everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That’s going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they’re going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important. Number two, he’s in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one. Number two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010. Fentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal. More fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don’t do it. It’s going to hurt me politically. He never argued it’s not a good bill. It’s a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we’re coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don’t have the technology to be able to put it together. That’s what we have to do. We need those machines. Well, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I’m the oldest. This guy’s three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I’ve done. Look how I’ve turned around the horrible situation he left me. As I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing. We’ve – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product. So I went – I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don’t need a college degree for them. And there’s billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world. Yeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We – we’re the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn’t trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we’re the most progressive country in the world in getting things done. We’re the strongest country in the world. We’re a country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies. And our – those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don’t want to screw around with us. You’re going to see he’s six-foot-five and only 225 pounds – or 235 pounds. Well, you said six-four, 200. Well, anyway, that’s – anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is. Look, I’d be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6. And by the way, I told you before I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it? I was 8 handicap. Eight, but I have – you know how many… You are a child. If you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO – just do what you want. There’s a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response. The idea – the idea – I can’t think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn’t trade places with what job I’ve done and what they’ve done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They’re capable of anything and they step up when they’re needed. And right now, we’re needed. We’re needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake. And again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war. Let’s see what your numbers are when this election is over. Let’s see. You’re a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country. Not one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none. But you continue to promote this lie about somehow there’s all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There’s no evidence of that at all. And I tell you what? I doubt whether you’ll accept it because you’re such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you’re accepting anything, you can’t stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time. We’ve made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term. We find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair? The fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I’m reelected, that’ll be the case again. But this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he’s increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything that comes into the United States America. What I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the – us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies. Well, guess what? We got it – we got it down to 15 – excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need. You know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) – debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn’t have to pay the exorbitant prices. I’m going to make that available to every senior, all – or go longer. It’s happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that. We have – I’m going to make sure we have childcare. We’re going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I’m going to make sure we do something about what we’re doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country. We’re going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.","['look', 'left', 'became', 'mr', 'trump', 'left', 'economy', 'freefall', 'pandemic', 'badly', 'handled', 'dying',

0,"July 23, 2021","[""The President. Hello, Virginia! It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us."", 'Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January; 54 percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, 82 percent of your seniors, both of which are above the national average.', ""But this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program, one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history. It happens when we all work together: the Federal Government, States, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans."", ""Look, it happens when you have Governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the State to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people."", ""You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected."", 'And now—what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And by the way—you know the old expression—you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" [Laughter] They\'ve seen the Lord—[laughter]—whether it\'s on Fox News or whether it\'s the most conservative commentators or Governors.', ""Thank God the Governor of Arkansas—excuse me, of Alabama—had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country—is now—and I give—I'm genuinely complimenting her——"", 'Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3!', 'Audience member. We love you, Joe!', ""The President. That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no. Let them talk. No, let——"", 'Audience members. [Inaudible]', ""Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!"", 'Audience members. [Inaudible]', ""The President. That's okay. Look, look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them."", 'Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! ', ""The President. Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red States or blue States or guys like that hollering; it's about life, and it's about death. And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. Thank you, Gov."", ""Look—and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around—I've been around a long time, and I've—seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York."", ""I'm talking about—and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. [Laughter] Her roots don't go there, but it—look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia, and she will be again. She is the very best."", ""And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your—turn on the Olympics and watch Team U.S.A., you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them."", ""The Japanese Prime Minister, who was—I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House—head of state—he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. [Laughter] He is a man of incredible judgment. [Laughter]"", ""Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future Governor, Terry McAuliffe."", 'I mean this—think about this——', 'Audience members. Terry! Terry! Terry!', ""The President. You've got it. You're not going to find anyone—I mean anyone—who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be; you know what kind of Governor he was and what kind of Governor he'll be again."", ""He was a great Governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you've got to elect him again. You've got to elect him again. And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal."", ""Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. [Laughter] And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry. I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like—I don't know where these guys come from. [Laughter] I really mean it."", ""But above all, Terry and I—Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy—and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal: They don't need me to protect them."", 'I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from—Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town—delivering results for hard-working people, who, if you just give them a chance—just a chance, they never, never let the country down.', ""You know—I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look—I've been in office now for 6 months, as of a couple days ago."", 'Audience members. Yeah!', ""The President. And I think the administration has a lot to be proud of. We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. We've created over 3 million new jobs, more than any administration has in the first 6 months in entire Presidential history. Never has it happened before."", ""We eliminated—what we're on—we're now estimated to be on track—the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow—it would be 3 and 3½ percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now."", 'And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week.', ""I've been saying—I really mean this—it's about time ordinary, hard-working people get a tax break. Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that."", ""Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. And by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle class and the working class people do well—they do well."", ""Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most, folks who were on the back of their—on heels, a lot of them knocked down. Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people."", 'My dad used to say—I really mean this—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it\'s about your dignity. It\'s about respect. It\'s about your place in the community. It\'s about just having, Joey""—and I mean this sincerely. When he left—lost everything in Scranton, and we moved to Delaware, he said: ""Joey, it\'s about a little breathing room. That\'s all people are asking for, is just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room.""', ""Look, aid for small businesses, that helps them hire, reopen their doors. I'm looking—here it is. Excuse me."", '[At this point, the President paused to take a drink of water.]', 'Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. And Terry knows the work continues: that health care should be right, just not a privilege, folks.', ""And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis—the only one. I'm not joking. We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it?"", 'But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger, who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure. Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. And we had the number-one infrastructure in the world: the best roads, highways, airports, ports.', 'Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban; making sure ""Buy American""—so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work.', ""It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it."", ""Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. No, by the way—no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this State and others have—in the last 8 years—have pointed out that if a kid goes to—not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age 3, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college."", ""That's why we support universal pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old. And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia."", ""And look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st-century economy. That's why I want to make 2-year community college available to every single American. We can afford to do this."", 'I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching full time still as a community college professor and First Lady. But Terry is going to be her boss again. [Laughter] Because she teaches at—anyway—Northern Virginia Community College. [Laughter]', ""And by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. Teaching is not what my wife does, it's who she is."", 'And, folks, look—look—the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within—you know, look—and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit.', 'Terry and I know how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare.', 'Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed, and my two boys almost died. And by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the ""Jaws of Life"" 3 hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives.', 'And I needed help. I was a Senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids, then fly. And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who—she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky.', ""But look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children, it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country."", ""And by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices, how incredibly high they are and how they—we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world."", ""But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done."", 'Look—and here\'s the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact, not a single penny was paid for, the so-called ""Trump tax cut.""', 'And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America—I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. I got elected 36 years there, because I was honest with them.', ""Look, right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500—50 of them don't pay—and this is not an exaggeration; check it out—not a single solitary penny in Federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, but—no, but I'm not doing this to get—I just want to make it clear to you. [Laughter] Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars—all we need to do all this education we're talking about here."", 'Look, you know—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six—it could have been forty-six—but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations.', 'You know what they all said? ""I need a better educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They\'re not spending any money to educate the workforce.', 'But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again—economically runs and—be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance.', ""These millionaires and billionaires—I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share."", ""Look, all told, experts in the World Bank and outfits like Wall Street—on Wall Street, like Moody's, estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create—good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs."", ""A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree.

Biden,2024,0.0,"The President. Hello, Virginia! It's so great to be back. First off, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam, by the way. Because of the hard work of the American people, we've put ourselves in a position for us to control the virus instead of it controlling us. Here in Virginia, COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are down 90 percent since January; 54 percent of your population has been fully vaccinated, 82 percent of your seniors, both of which are above the national average. But this didn't happen by itself. It's due to the heroic vaccination program, one of the greatest and most complex operational challenges in American history. It happens when we all work together: the Federal Government, States, cities, the private sector, and all of Americans. Look, it happens when you have Governors like Ralph who've been a key partner, coordinating FEMA and the National Guard to move personnel and resources around the State to get shots in arms. It happens when you're honest with people. You know, I know folks are watching the number of cases rising again and are wondering what it means for them. Well, here's the truth: If you're fully vaccinated, you're safer with a higher degree of protection. But if you're not vaccinated, you are not protected. And now—what we have now is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And by the way—you know the old expression—you notice a lot of our very conservative friends have finally had an ""altar call."" [Laughter] They've seen the Lord—[laughter]—whether it's on Fox News or whether it's the most conservative commentators or Governors. Thank God the Governor of Arkansas—excuse me, of Alabama—had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country—is now—and I give—I'm genuinely complimenting her—— Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. That's okay. That's all right. That's all right. No, no, no. Let them talk. No, let—— Audience members. [Inaudible] Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Audience members. [Inaudible] The President. That's okay. Look, look, this is not a Trump rally. Let them holler. No one is paying attention to them. Audience members. Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3! Stop Line 3!  The President. Look, here's the point: Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people. And I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red States or blue States or guys like that hollering; it's about life, and it's about death. And I know Governor Northam is going to work like the devil to finish the job. Thank you, Gov. Look—and, of course, it's great to be with another great friend that's been around—I've been around a long time, and I've—seldom do I get to campaign for someone who I've agreed with more on basically everything. We go back all the way to roots in Syracuse, New York. I'm talking about—and before that, I'm actually talking about Dorothy. [Laughter] Her roots don't go there, but it—look, she's always been there for me and Jill when we've needed her most. She was an incredible First Lady of Virginia, and she will be again. She is the very best. And, Dorothy, speaking of First Ladies, I'm Jill's husband. Jill wanted to be here tonight. But if you turn on your—turn on the Olympics and watch Team U.S.A., you'll see Jill Biden standing there, cheering with them. The Japanese Prime Minister, who was—I invited him to be the first person to come to the White House—head of state—he made it real clear: He didn't want me, he wanted her to go. [Laughter] He is a man of incredible judgment. [Laughter] Look, folks, now, of course, it's great to be with my friend and your once and future Governor, Terry McAuliffe. I mean this—think about this—— Audience members. Terry! Terry! Terry! The President. You've got it. You're not going to find anyone—I mean anyone—who knows how to get more done for Virginia than Terry. That's a fact. You don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be; you know what kind of Governor he was and what kind of Governor he'll be again. He was a great Governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you've got to elect him again. You've got to elect him again. And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal. Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. [Laughter] And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry. I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like—I don't know where these guys come from. [Laughter] I really mean it. But above all, Terry and I—Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy—and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal: They don't need me to protect them. I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from—Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town—delivering results for hard-working people, who, if you just give them a chance—just a chance, they never, never let the country down. You know—I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look—I've been in office now for 6 months, as of a couple days ago. Audience members. Yeah! The President. And I think the administration has a lot to be proud of. We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. We've created over 3 million new jobs, more than any administration has in the first 6 months in entire Presidential history. Never has it happened before. We eliminated—what we're on—we're now estimated to be on track—the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow—it would be 3 and 3½ percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now. And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week. I've been saying—I really mean this—it's about time ordinary, hard-working people get a tax break. Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that. Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. And by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle class and the working class people do well—they do well. Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most, folks who were on the back of their—on heels, a lot of them knocked down. Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people. My dad used to say—I really mean this—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about just having, Joey""—and I mean this sincerely. When he left—lost everything in Scranton, and we moved to Delaware, he said: ""Joey, it's about a little breathing room. That's all people are asking for, is just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room."" Look, aid for small businesses, that helps them hire, reopen their doors. I'm looking—here it is. Excuse me. [At this point, the President paused to take a drink of water.] Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. And Terry knows the work continues: that health care should be right, just not a privilege, folks. And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis—the only one. I'm not joking. We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it? But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger, who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure. Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. And we had the number-one infrastructure in the world: the best roads, highways, airports, ports. Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban; making sure ""Buy American""—so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work. It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it. Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. No, by the way—no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this State and others have—in the last 8 years—have pointed out that if a kid goes to—not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age 3, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college. That's why we support universal pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old. And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia. And look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st-century economy. That's why I want to make 2-year community college available to every single American. We can afford to do this. I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching full time still as a community college professor and First Lady. But Terry is going to be her boss again. [Laughter] Because she teaches at—anyway—Northern Virginia Community College. [Laughter] And by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. Teaching is not what my wife does, it's who she is. And, folks, look—look—the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within—you know, look—and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit. Terry and I know how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare. Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed, and my two boys almost died. And by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the ""Jaws of Life"" 3 hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives. And I needed help. I was a Senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids, then fly. And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who—she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky. But look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children, it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country. And by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices, how incredibly high they are and how they—we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world. But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done. Look—and here's the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact, not a single penny was paid for, the so-called ""Trump tax cut."" And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America—I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. I got elected 36 years there, because I was honest with them. Look, right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500—50 of them don't pay—and this is not an exaggeration; check it out—not a single solitary penny in Federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, but—no, but I'm not doing this to get—I just want to make it clear to you. [Laughter] Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars—all we need to do all this education we're talking about here. Look, you know—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six—it could have been forty-six—but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations. You know what they all said? ""I need a better educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They're not spending any money to educate the workforce. But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again—economically runs and—be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance. These millionaires and billionaires—I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share. Look, all told, experts in the World Bank and outfits like Wall Street—on Wall Street, like Moody's, estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create—good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree. Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century. But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this State, but is respected by Governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the States. Folks, on his watch as Governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million—200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent. He attracted major companies to this State. Look how your State grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your State, your town—the first thing they ask is: ""What's the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not""—all the things. All the things we're going to build. You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and Active Duty military members, more than almost any State. And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses. No veteran—from my son who passed away on—should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can't see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. Immediate. It's a sacred obligation. And I know no Governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs, fields like cybersecurity and health care. He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe. Terry understands. He knows—he knows—also about crime prevention as a top priority. He understands how important it is to have funding—to find funding—from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources. Look, we need to help them in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but the other side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe. And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you—maybe some of you, maybe you know people. Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period. An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that?

You don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be; you know what kind of Governor he was and what kind of Governor he'll be again. He was a great Governor of Virginia, and he'll be even greater this time because he even has more going for him. And, Virginia, you've got to elect him again. You've got to elect him again. And I mean this: not just for Virginia, but for the country. The country is looking. These off-year elections, the country is looking. This is a big deal. Terry and I share a lot in common. I ran against Donald Trump, and so is Terry. [Laughter] And I whipped Donald Trump in Virginia, and so will Terry. I tell you what, the guy Terry is running against is an acolyte of Donald Trump, for real. I mean, it's just like—I don't know where these guys come from. [Laughter] I really mean it. But above all, Terry and I—Terry, we share the same vision about delivering results and, maybe most importantly, why we got involved in politics in the first place. The very wealthy—and I respect anybody who makes a lot of money; you should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire, whatever you want, as long as you pay your fair share. But here's the deal: They don't need me to protect them. I got involved in politics because the neighborhood I came from, the towns I came from—Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town—delivering results for hard-working people, who, if you just give them a chance—just a chance, they never, never let the country down. You know—I really mean that. That's not hyperbole. I really mean it. Just, look—I've been in office now for 6 months, as of a couple days ago. Audience members. Yeah! The President. And I think the administration has a lot to be proud of. We've vaccinated over 160 million Americans. We've created over 3 million new jobs, more than any administration has in the first 6 months in entire Presidential history. Never has it happened before. We eliminated—what we're on—we're now estimated to be on track—the economy, not growing before the recession, before COVID, said the economy would grow—it would be 3 and 3½ percent. Now everything from the OECD to all Wall Street suggests that we're going to grow this economy 7 percent just this year. That is the highest growth in more than four decades in America. In fact, it's the best job growth in the world right now. And in just the past few weeks, one of the biggest tax cuts in the history for families in American with kids went into effect this last week. I've been saying—I really mean this—it's about time ordinary, hard-working people get a tax break. Because that's what it is. Parents should see that money going into their bank accounts right now. And let me tell you what it's going to mean for Americans: We're going to cut child poverty in half this year because of that. Look, Terry and I share the same basic truth: Trickle-down economies never work. It's time to build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. That's where we are. And by the way, the wealthy have never done poorly when the middle class and the working class people do well—they do well. Look, Terry understands that it started with the American Rescue Plan that's delivering immediate relief to the folks who needed it most, folks who were on the back of their—on heels, a lot of them knocked down. Those rescue checks that went out to more than 80 percent of the adults and children in Virginia that provide a little extra breathing room for people. My dad used to say—I really mean this—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck; it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about just having, Joey""—and I mean this sincerely. When he left—lost everything in Scranton, and we moved to Delaware, he said: ""Joey, it's about a little breathing room. That's all people are asking for, is just a little bit of breathing room, a little extra room."" Look, aid for small businesses, that helps them hire, reopen their doors. I'm looking—here it is. Excuse me. [At this point, the President paused to take a drink of water.] Aid to cities and counties to keep their police officers and firefighters and first responders on the job, educators on the job. The American Rescue Plan lowered health insurance premiums for those buying into the Affordable Care Act by 40 percent on average, saving people $600 a year. And Terry knows the work continues: that health care should be right, just not a privilege, folks. And as I said when I was running, with Terry and Dorothy's help, it's not enough to build back. I mean this sincerely. America is the only nation in the world, when it's faced a crisis, has come back stronger than before the crisis—the only one. I'm not joking. We have to build back and build back better. It's amazing how that phrase has caught on around the world, isn't it? But Terry and I know, along with Mark Warner and Tim Kaine and Don Beyer and Abby Spanberger, who are working on this in Congress. It means modernizing our physical infrastructure. Folks, we used to invest more than any country in the world in research and development. And we had the number-one infrastructure in the world: the best roads, highways, airports, ports. Infrastructure is about rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing lead pipes that are poisoning our kids and the water system; delivering high-speed internet to every single Virginian, rural and urban; making sure ""Buy American""—so when we invest in the jobs, when we purchase all this, that American workers are doing the work. It's not that complicated. It really isn't if you fight for it. Terry and I share the belief that building back better means investing also in our human infrastructure. You know, that's my plan. It includes all the things Terry is fighting for. Terry and I believe that when we educate our children earlier, they do better. They do better. No, by the way—no matter what background they come from, all the studies at the great universities in this State and others have—in the last 8 years—have pointed out that if a kid goes to—not daycare, but preschool, beginning at age 3, they increase, by 58 percent, the possibility of going all the way through school and on to community college. That's why we support universal pre-K for 3- and 4-years-old. And, Terry, if I get it done, you all aren't going to have to pay for it here in Virginia. And look, we believe 12 years of education is not enough to compete in the 21st-century economy. That's why I want to make 2-year community college available to every single American. We can afford to do this. I do have one concern. My wife Jill is teaching full time still as a community college professor and First Lady. But Terry is going to be her boss again. [Laughter] Because she teaches at—anyway—Northern Virginia Community College. [Laughter] And by the way, Terry, since the time she started working there, she's never stopped teaching. When we got elected, she thought that she was going to continue to teach. She thought I might object. I strongly supported it. Teaching is not what my wife does, it's who she is. And, folks, look—look—the fact is that the idea that we are able to bring together people to give them great opportunities is totally within—you know, look—and we can afford to do this. We can afford to do this. If the very wealthy just start paying their fair share just a little bit. Terry and I know how hard the pandemic has been on working families, especially women. About 2 million women are still unable to go back into the workforce during this pandemic due to things like not being able to afford childcare. Look, when I got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. Between the time I got elected and before I was sworn in, there was an automobile accident. My wife and daughter were killed, and my two boys almost died. And by the way, I thank all firefighters. It took the ""Jaws of Life"" 3 hours to get them out on top of their dead mom and dead sister. You saved their lives. And I needed help. I was a Senator making $42,000 a year. I could no longer afford daycare and someone to take care of my kids, then fly. And thank God I had a sister who is my friend, who—she and her husband, without my asking, moved in and helped me raise my kids. My mom and my brother as well. I got lucky. But look, the idea, as a single mom or a single dad, working and having young children, it's awful hard. That's why Terry and I want to expand paid leave and childcare in this country. And by the way, Terry, you and I have been talking about this for a long time. We've been talking about high drug prices, how incredibly high they are and how they—we keep getting ripped off. You know, we pay more for our drugs than any major country in the world. But here's the deal. There's a way to do it: Let Medicare negotiate drug prices. And guess what? All of the prices are going to come down. And it will pay for itself. I promise you, I'm going to get that done. Look—and here's the deal, Terry and I know this can be paid for. Look, we support asking the wealthiest 1 percent who got that $2 trillion tax cut that, in fact, not a single penny was paid for, the so-called ""Trump tax cut."" And guess what? Just pay. Begin to pay their fair share. Corporate America—I come from the corporate capital of the world. More corporations are, in fact, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Union combined. I got elected 36 years there, because I was honest with them. Look, right today, 50 of the biggest corporations in America of the Fortune 500—50 of them don't pay—and this is not an exaggeration; check it out—not a single solitary penny in Federal taxes. Not one. And they made over 40—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, but—no, but I'm not doing this to get—I just want to make it clear to you. [Laughter] Here's the deal: They made over $40 billion. If they just paid a minimum tax of 15 percent, they'd raise the dollars—all we need to do all this education we're talking about here. Look, you know—when I was Vice President, the President asked me to check out what the major corporations needed the most. Along with the Secretary of Commerce, we interviewed three hundred and, I think it was, fifty-six—it could have been forty-six—but over three hundred and fifty CEOs and major corporations. You know what they all said? ""I need a better educated workforce."" Well, guess what? They're not spending any money to educate the workforce. But if we want to make sure America succeeds and runs the world again—economically runs and—be the most powerful economy in the world, we should make sure that they have a chance. These millionaires and billionaires—I'm not one of these guys that say you shouldn't be able to be a millionaire or billionaire. But just pay your fair share. Look, all told, experts in the World Bank and outfits like Wall Street—on Wall Street, like Moody's, estimate that my plan will grow the economy and create $2 million more jobs over the $16 million they said in 10 years we'd create—good-paying jobs. Good-paying jobs. A significant amount of these jobs will pay the prevailing wage of 30, 40, 50 bucks an hour. Ninety percent of the jobs in our infrastructure plan go to people without a college degree. Folks, we're proposing a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America, a once-in-a-generation investment in American jobs and families that's going to position us to win the competition for the 21st century. But we've got to get it done. And I need a partner like Terry who not only is respected in this State, but is respected by Governors all across America, who knows how to get it done in the States. Folks, on his watch as Governor the last time, the Virginia economy boomed. Two hundred million—200,000 jobs created. Unemployment went down in every single county, including rural Virginia, by nearly 50 percent. He attracted major companies to this State. Look how your State grew. And by the way, any of you who are in the business know the first thing you try to attract a company to come to your city, your State, your town—the first thing they ask is: ""What's the highway system? Will I have access to interstate? Is the port available? Tell me whether or not I have broadband. Tell me whether or not""—all the things. All the things we're going to build. You know, look, Terry worked with Republicans to invest in education, transportation, and workforce development. And by the way, Virginia has a whole bunch of veterans and Active Duty military members, more than almost any State. And guess what? The American Rescue Plan marked one of the biggest investments in veterans' health in a long, long time. It will upgrade VA hospitals that are 50 years old, reduce the shortages of doctors and nurses. No veteran—from my son who passed away on—should pick up a phone and say, or have a wife or husband call and say, ""I need help,"" and say, ""We can't see you for a while."" We owe them immediate action. Immediate. It's a sacred obligation. And I know no Governor who stood up for our veterans and military families more than this guy, helping them apply their skills to good-paying civilian jobs, fields like cybersecurity and health care. He also worked with the General Assembly to fund two new veteran care centers, including the first one in Hampton Roads region, which is hard to believe. Terry understands. He knows—he knows—also about crime prevention as a top priority. He understands how important it is to have funding—to find funding—from the American Rescue Plan to provide law enforcement personnel with more resources, not fewer resources. Look, we need to help them in a lot of ways. We need to do away with chokeholds and all those things. I agree, but the other side of this is we need them to have more social workers, more veterans, more psychological help, more psychologists. And where it happens, it works. Personnel and resources, they keep communities safe. And he has taken on the gun lobby to enact sensible gun safety measures without infringing on anybody's Second Amendment right, including keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Here's what else: Terry is going to guarantee he's going to move to get a $15 minimum wage. Think about it, folks. Just think about it. And you—maybe some of you, maybe you know people. Anybody working 40 hours a week making less than $15 an hour is, in fact, living in poverty as defined by poverty in America. It should not happen, period. Period. An amazing number of American people who are struggling have rental costs and housing costs that are at least 30 to 35 percent of their total income. How do you do that? How do you make it, especially if you have a child? Look, folks, housing that's affordable—everybody is going to be in the plan. And, like me, when Terry thinks about the climate crisis, he thinks three things: jobs, jobs, jobs. It is the reason why we're going to lead the world. Let me close with this—and I'm sorry, I'm getting kind of wrapped up in this. [Laughter] I need him. I need him. Look, in this election and in 2022, the question the American people are going to be asking is whether or not we're helping them and their families. Not giving them anything—are we giving them a shot, just giving them an even shot? Do we understand what they're going through? Can we deliver for them? As Democrats, we have to show we do understand, and we're delivering for them, and we're keeping our promises. We just have to keep making the case, just as the Republican Party today offers nothing but fear, lies, and broken promises. No, listen—I mean, think about it—turning on the television every day and seeing a replay of what happened on January 6 and saying, ""I was told there were a lot of peaceful, wonderful people."" Audience members. Boo! The President. God—no, I really mean it. Think about it. It is bizarre. We have to keep cutting through the Republican fog that government is the problem and show that ""We the People"" are the solution. We're the most unique country—think about this—we're the most unique country in the history of the world. Not a joke. Every other country is put together based on race, religion, ethnicity, background, except the United States. The United States is based on—the only country in the world based on the proposition that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We've never met the test, but we've never walked away from it like the Republicans have. We have never walked away. And we keep—every administration, we keep moving that needle further and further. Look, folks, we're going to have to go out and win: win this thing, win races up and down the ticket. We've got to protect your majority in the House of Delegates. We've got to reelect—we've got to reelect Mark as attorney general. We've got to reelect Hala as your Lieutenant Governor. We've got to elect Terry back as Governor. He's been here before. He knows what to do to. He knows how to get things done. Virginia, we did it in 2020. In the battle for the soul of America, the people voted. Democracy prevailed. The Constitution held. We have to do this again. I've said, time and again, no matter what, you can never stop the American people from voting. And they're trying like hell. We have to decide. The power must always be with the people. Fifty—I promise you this—fifty years from now—fifty years from now, our children, our grandchildren will look back and know that it was at this moment America won the 21st century again. And it starts now. Virginia, it starts with Terry. It starts with you. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.","['hello', 'virginia', 'goes', 'without', 'saying', 'appreciate', 'current', 'governor', 'ralph', 'northam', 'hard', 'weve', 'put', 'position', 'control', 'virus', 'instead',

Look, folks, just look at the hypocrisy: The same Governors who are attacking me and your Governor for COVID-19 mandates are in a—States with some of the strictest vaccine mandates for children attending school in the whole country. Talk about inconsistency: In Mississippi, children are required to be vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, and more. It's a State requirement. But now, in the midst of this pandemic that has taken over 650,000 lives, I propose a mandate for COVID-19 vaccines, and it's an ""outrage""; it's an ""infringement on freedom."" Look, folks, we don't need politics in this battle against COVID. We need science. We need courage. We need leadership. We need Gavin Newsom, a Governor who follows science, who's got the courage to do what's right and who'll lead. [The President coughed.] And I apologize for coughing. Audience member. Five more years, Gavin! The President. Last week, I laid out a six-part plan for the fall to beat this pandemic. First, vaccinate the unvaccinated with new vaccine requirements. Two, protect the vaccinated. Three, keep children safe in school. And four, increase testing and masking. And keep our economy going strong. And take care of people with COVID-19. That's what the science tells us. We have to beat the Delta variant of COVID-19. Gavin will be a Governor who will help us finish the job. Folks, send a message to the Nation: Courage matters. Leadership matters. Science matters. Vote to keep Gavin. Get vaccinated to save lives. Second, by voting no, you'll be keeping a Governor who respects women instead of someone who wrote that women know less about politics and economics than men. Audience members. Boo! The President. He hasn't met my wife. [Laughter] Look, if you have any doubt about how important it is to have Gavin, who respects women's right to—just take a look at what's happening in States like Texas. They just passed a law empowering complete strangers to become bounty hunters, going after women who exercise their right to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. A law the United States Supreme Court refused to stop. Now other States say they're looking to replicate the Texas law. If you don't think women's rights are under assault, you're not looking. California, keep Gavin Newsom and send a message to the Nation. Women are to be respected and their rights protected. Third, by voting no, you'll be protecting California from another Trump climate denier who said global warming is, quote, a ""crock"" and depicts it as a myth. Look, it's hard to believe there's any climate deniers left in America. Let me tell you something: There are. The last place you want someone like that is in the Governor's office in California. Audience member. That's right! The President. You all see what's happening: wildfires burning 2 million acres of California this year alone; 5 million acres have burned—5.9 [million]* in the region. That's bigger than the State—entire State of New Jersey, and it's a big State. The Governor and I were just in Sacramento for a briefing on the Caldor Fire—the Caldor Fire. Last week, I saw the destruction and the death caused by Hurricane Ida in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. Folks, extreme weather is here. The climate crisis isn't going away; it's getting worse. We have to deal with it, not deny it. So, California, you've got to keep Gavin Newsom as Governor and send a message to the Nation that we have to deal with the climate crisis now. We can't wait any longer. When I got elected President, I immediately rejoined the climate Paris—the Paris climate accord. Just since we put that together in our administration—in Barack's administration—just since then, everything has collapsed even further. We don't have much time. Not a joke. We're talking about 9 to 10 years before we pass the point of no return. And—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. You—our children need it. The planet needs it. Look, fourth, by voting no, you'll be standing up for a Governor who protects workers rather than one who believes there shouldn't be—I can't believe this guy—[laughter]—there shouldn't be a minimum wage? Audience members. Boo! The President. The leading Republican candidate thinks the minimum wage should be zero. Audience members. Boo! The President. Look, working people have taken it on the chin too long. We need leaders like Gavin who will respect them, hear them, fight for them. To me, it's pretty basic: If you're working a 40-hour week, you shouldn't be living in poverty. That's why I support a $15 minimum wage. Gavin is leading the way in California. I'm so tired of trickle-down economics. It's about time we build from the bottom up and the middle out. So, California, keep Gavin and send a message: It's time to give working people just a fighting chance. They have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let the country down. All they want is just an even shot. They have never let the country down. Folks, I can go on, but here's the deal. I'm going to make this a simple as I can: You either keep Gavin Newsom as your Governor, or you'll get Donald Trump. Audience members. Boo! The President. It's not a joke. A Republican Governor blocking progress on COVID-19, who is also anti-woman, anti-worker, a climate denier, who doesn't believe in choice. Audience members. Boo! The President. The choice should be absolutely clear: Gavin Newsom. You have a Governor who has the courage to lead. In Gavin, you have a Governor who shares the State's values. In Gavin, you have a Governor to make sure Donald Trump's dark, destructive, divisive politics never finds a place in California. So, please—not a joke—on behalf of the people of Delaware and Pennsylvania and Minnesota and all across America: Don't take anything for granted. If you're registered, you've got a ballot in the mail. If you haven't opened it, open it, mark ""no,"" and put it in the mailbox tonight. If you want to vote in person, make sure you know where you're going to vote in your county. Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. And if you've already voted, make sure your family and friends are voting tomorrow. California—I mean this sincerely—the eyes of the Nation are on you. I'm not joking. I'm not joking about that. You've got to vote no on the recall. Keep Gavin as Governor. The rest of America is counting on you, and so am I. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.","['hello', 'long', 'beach', 'audience', 'members', 'joe', 'joe', 'joe', 'ill', 'tell', 'audience', 'members', 'joe', 'joe', 'joe', 'standing', 'long', 'tell', 'governor', 'lot', 'common',

I'm Jill Biden's husband."", ""It's great to be with you all. I really mean that. First of all, it goes without saying how much I appreciate your current Governor, Ralph Northam. Where's Ralph? There you are, pal. Thank you. Well——"", 'Audience members. Biden, Biden—[inaudible]! Biden, Biden—[inaudible]! Biden, Biden—[inaudible]!', 'Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!', ""The President. That's all right. Let them go. Let them go. That's okay. That's all right. Why don't you hang out and talk to me after this is over, okay?"", 'Audience member. We love you!', 'The President. Well, thank you. Look—thank you, thank you, thank you.', 'Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!', ""The President. That's right. This is not a Trump rally. We let them holler. We let them holler."", ""I'd also like thank members of the congressional delegation that are here: Don Beyer—I think Don is here; Elaine Luria; Bobby Scott; Abigail Spanberger. Are they all over there? I don't—and Senator Tim Kaine and Jennifer Wexton. Folks, they've been critical in our efforts to make historic investments in our Nation and our people."", ""And of course, it's great to be here with Dorothy and Terry McAuliffe. Folks, it's time. It's time. One week to make those phone calls and knock on more doors. One week to get out the vote. And 1 more week to elect Terry McAuliffe your Governor of the State of Virginia."", ""You all know the stakes. And here are a few things I want you to remember. First, you don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be because you know what a great Governor he was. It wasn't just because of what he'd promised, it's what he delivered. On his watch, Virginia's economy boomed. Two hundred thousand jobs created. He made a record addition of $1 billion investment in education expanding preschool and resources for public schools in lower income communities and gave teachers a raise. Okay?"", ""Now, I must say, parenthetically, the real reason I'm here tonight is, my wife Jill teaches full time at Northern Virginia Community College. And Terry's going to be her boss. [Laughter]"", 'Look, Terry stood by our veterans, helping them apply their skills in good-paying civilian jobs in fields like cybersecurity and health care; funding for new veteran care centers, including the first one in the Hampton Roads region.', 'Look, he took on the gun lobby and enacted sensible gun safety measures without infringing on the Second Amendment, including helping keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.', ""Virginia, you know Terry. You know his record. He was a great Governor. If you reelect him again, he'll be another 4 years as a great Governor."", ""But look, how well do you know Terry's opponent?"", 'Audience members. No!', 'The President. Well, just remember this: I ran against Donald Trump, and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump.', ""Terry's opponent doesn't like to talk about how—very much now—but to win the Republican nomination, he embraced Donald Trump. [Laughter]"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. He started his campaign by saying the number-one issue in the race was—his called the election—he called for election integrity. Now, this guy starts, and he's calling for election integrity. Now, why did he do that? Because he wanted to hear Donald Trump? It was a price he'd have to pay for the nomination, and he paid it. But now he doesn't want to talk about Trump anymore."", 'Well, I do. Talk about an oxymoron: Donald Trump and election integrity? [Laughter] I can\'t believe he puts the words ""Trump"" and ""integrity"" in the same sentence. [Laughter]', 'Look, he\'s done a lot of lousy things. But when my friend General Colin Powell died, his integrity—a man of incredible integrity—they certainly go together with—""Colin Powell"" and ""integrity."" He\'s a decorated American hero, which is why the attack just leveled by Trump against General Powell was so offensive.', 'I\'d say it\'s unbelievable, but it\'s not. Trump did the same thing about John McCain. That\'s who Donald Trump is. All coming from a guy who invented the ""big lie,"" drove a mob of insurrectionists to breach the Capitol on the 6th of January. And to this day, he incites people all around the country. He said—he said the people who attended his rally and then stormed the Capitol, quote: They ""were peaceful people,"" they ""were great people.""', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. Well, God love you. I'm glad you're here."", 'Virginia, you know better. You saw it with your own eyes. Many of you were there. Some of you risked your lives. The anger. The rage. American flags turned into spears. A noose. A gallows. Police assaulted and killed. Death threats against elected officials and public servants carrying the most sacred act of a democracy: certifying a free election.', 'The breach of the Capitol; that didn\'t happen even during the Civil War. To Donald Trump, the insurrection isn\'t a violent assault that took place on January 6 at the Capitol. No. To Trump, the insurrection was the November 3 election when more Americans voted than had ever voted in all of our history. That\'s the ""big lie"" that Terry\'s opponent embraced.', 'And it prompted the Washington Post to write something about Terry\'s opponent that every Virginian should read before they vote, and I quote: ""Glenn Youngkin has failed [the] character test. . . . He . . . has indulged and encouraged Republicans who have swallowed former President Trump\'s lie that last year\'s Presidential election was stolen. . . . Mr. Youngkin chose to dignify a fundamental fiction that is subverting our system, rather than stand[ing] . . . squarely for the truth. In doing so, he proved himself unfit for office."" End of quote. I\'ve not seen many editorials written that strongly in my career.', ""Heck, just look at how he's closing his campaign. He's gone from banning a woman's right to choose to banning books written by a Pulitzer Prize- and Nobel Prize-winning author, Toni Morrison."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. My wife Jill went to Princeton to interview her, taught her book. Let's be clear: This is a guy who doesn't know much about anything."", 'A women\'s right to choose is very much at risk because of what\'s happening in Texas. If you want to protect a woman\'s right to choose in Virginia, you need a Governor absolutely committed to protecting that right. And Terry has made it clear he will be a ""brick wall"" against anyone trying to take that constitutional right away.', ""But Terry's opponent not only embraces someone with such a lack of character, he endorses Donald Trump's bad ideas and bad record. Donald Trump is the only President since Herbert Hoover in the thirties to see more jobs lost than gained the 4 years he was in office. In just 9 months of our administration, we've created more jobs than any President has in the same period of time in American history."", 'When Donald Trump left office, there were only about 2 million people fully vaccinated. In just 9 months in our first year, over 190 million Americans are now fully vaccinated.', ""Trump—I love this one—Trump likes to boast the single best measure of the economy is the stock market. I never thought that. Well, if that's true, take a look at the stock market now. It's higher than it's ever been. I guess it—[inaudible]—everything is doing well. It is. Higher than it's ever been."", ""Not only that, more people are working today than just before the pandemic started. Household wealth is up. People are buying more things. Manufacturing is up. We're on the move, but we're on the right track. We've got more to do."", ""So, if you're looking for someone who is going to keep your economy going and growing, the man behind me is the guy to get it done. He'll do it again."", ""In fact, we're taking a page from Terry's book when he was Governor and when he'd be Governor next time. We're emerging from this pandemic, and we want to expand pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, millions of pre-K students. That's what's in my Build Back Better initiative. Studies show that when you do this, you increase by 58 percent the chances of a child—will complete the rest of their education in high school and beyond."", 'And what better—we want better roads, bridges, and airports. Well, take the new bridge that will be built next to the 117-year-old Long Bridge in Arlington. This will be a dedicated corridor to passenger rail and reduce traffic bottlenecks in freight rail. It will be a game changer.', ""Right now 13 percent of Virginia households don't have the internet. As we said during this pandemic, no parent should have to park in a McDonald's parking lot to have access to their internet for remote learning. Think about that. Terry wants every single Virginian to have access to affordable high-speed internet, and I guarantee we're going to both do that."", 'Right now there are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers in America that have lead pipes, including in their water. Look, folks, in America, every American, every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water.', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', 'The President. Give that guy a drink of water, will you? [Laughter]', 'Look, let me ask you this. Why is it that, 20 years ago, a bottle of insulin for type 1 diabetes cost $32 a bottle, but today, the same exact—same exact—formula, no change, costs $280 a bottle?', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Hear me? That's not only wrong, it's immoral. Terry wants to take the drug companies—and I do—bring down the costs of prescription drugs. And we can do that."", 'There are nearly 2 million American—qualified women in America who are working—not working today because of childcare. Here in Virginia, the average two-parent home spends $14,600 a year for just one child. We want to bring those costs down so working families will not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for a child under the age of 5.', ""We're going to raise the minimum wage to—Terry is going to—we strongly support it—to $15 an hour. No one—no one—working full-time should live below the poverty line."", ""And here's what else you ought to think about. Terry's opponent has made all of his private pledges of loyalty to Donald Trump. But what's really interesting to me: He won't stand next to Donald Trump now that the campaign's on. [Laughter]"", ""Think about it. He won't allow Donald Trump to campaign for him in this State. And he's willing to pledge his loyalty to Trump in private. Why not in public? What's he trying to hide? Is there a problem with Trump being here? Is he embarrassed? Look at who has been here for Terry: my wife Jill, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, and so many more."", ""Look, let me close with this. There is a fundamental difference between Democrats and Terry McAuliffe and what's going on in today's Republican Party and Terry's opponent."", ""Number one, we stand for working people and the middle class. Trickle-down economics has never worked. We're both building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Today's Republican Party stands for nothing but just keep cutting taxes for the wealthy and the most powerful corporations."", ""Second thing to remember—here's the deal: Virginia Democrats, you've made incredible progress in this State in recent years on jobs, the economy, health care, education, on attracting new business, growing the middle class, and so much more. For more than 40 years in Virginia, it has been the Democrat and Democratic Governors who have led. You've made this progress because you've had the courage and the wisdom to reject the very extremism that has taken over the Republican Party all across America."", ""Think of it. The Republican Party, nationally, is for nothing. Not a joke. Nothing. Nothing. Just look around. Just look around—at what's happening with the Governor of Texas and Florida——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. ——the assault on a woman's right to choose. The lives lost to this pandemic could have been saved. Virginia, for the sake of your families and the country, we can't let this happen here in Virginia."", 'Extremism can come in many forms. It can come in the rage of a mob driven in an assault—driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a smile and a fleece vest. Either way, the ""big lie"" is still a big lie.', 'So, Virginia, show up. Show up like you did for Barack and me. Show up like you did for me and Kamala. And show up for a proven leader like Terry McAuliffe. Show up to protect the majority in the House of Delegates, to reelect Mark attorney general, elect Hala as Lieutenant Governor.', ""Virginia, you can't take anything for granted. So vote. Vote early. Get five of your friends and family to vote. You can drop off your ballots in drop boxes. You can mail them in. Visit iwillvote.com to find out where and how to vote early."", 'Show up for democracy, for Virginia, for the United States of America.', 'God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.', 'Vote!

First, you don't have to wonder what kind of Governor Terry will be because you know what a great Governor he was. It wasn't just because of what he'd promised, it's what he delivered. On his watch, Virginia's economy boomed. Two hundred thousand jobs created. He made a record addition of $1 billion investment in education expanding preschool and resources for public schools in lower income communities and gave teachers a raise. Okay? Now, I must say, parenthetically, the real reason I'm here tonight is, my wife Jill teaches full time at Northern Virginia Community College. And Terry's going to be her boss. [Laughter] Look, Terry stood by our veterans, helping them apply their skills in good-paying civilian jobs in fields like cybersecurity and health care; funding for new veteran care centers, including the first one in the Hampton Roads region. Look, he took on the gun lobby and enacted sensible gun safety measures without infringing on the Second Amendment, including helping keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers. Virginia, you know Terry. You know his record. He was a great Governor. If you reelect him again, he'll be another 4 years as a great Governor. But look, how well do you know Terry's opponent? Audience members. No! The President. Well, just remember this: I ran against Donald Trump, and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump. Terry's opponent doesn't like to talk about how—very much now—but to win the Republican nomination, he embraced Donald Trump. [Laughter] Audience members. Boo! The President. He started his campaign by saying the number-one issue in the race was—his called the election—he called for election integrity. Now, this guy starts, and he's calling for election integrity. Now, why did he do that? Because he wanted to hear Donald Trump? It was a price he'd have to pay for the nomination, and he paid it. But now he doesn't want to talk about Trump anymore. Well, I do. Talk about an oxymoron: Donald Trump and election integrity? [Laughter] I can't believe he puts the words ""Trump"" and ""integrity"" in the same sentence. [Laughter] Look, he's done a lot of lousy things. But when my friend General Colin Powell died, his integrity—a man of incredible integrity—they certainly go together with—""Colin Powell"" and ""integrity."" He's a decorated American hero, which is why the attack just leveled by Trump against General Powell was so offensive. I'd say it's unbelievable, but it's not. Trump did the same thing about John McCain. That's who Donald Trump is. All coming from a guy who invented the ""big lie,"" drove a mob of insurrectionists to breach the Capitol on the 6th of January. And to this day, he incites people all around the country. He said—he said the people who attended his rally and then stormed the Capitol, quote: They ""were peaceful people,"" they ""were great people."" Audience members. Boo! Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Well, God love you. I'm glad you're here. Virginia, you know better. You saw it with your own eyes. Many of you were there. Some of you risked your lives. The anger. The rage. American flags turned into spears. A noose. A gallows. Police assaulted and killed. Death threats against elected officials and public servants carrying the most sacred act of a democracy: certifying a free election. The breach of the Capitol; that didn't happen even during the Civil War. To Donald Trump, the insurrection isn't a violent assault that took place on January 6 at the Capitol. No. To Trump, the insurrection was the November 3 election when more Americans voted than had ever voted in all of our history. That's the ""big lie"" that Terry's opponent embraced. And it prompted the Washington Post to write something about Terry's opponent that every Virginian should read before they vote, and I quote: ""Glenn Youngkin has failed [the] character test. . . . He . . . has indulged and encouraged Republicans who have swallowed former President Trump's lie that last year's Presidential election was stolen. . . . Mr. Youngkin chose to dignify a fundamental fiction that is subverting our system, rather than stand[ing] . . . squarely for the truth. In doing so, he proved himself unfit for office."" End of quote. I've not seen many editorials written that strongly in my career. Heck, just look at how he's closing his campaign. He's gone from banning a woman's right to choose to banning books written by a Pulitzer Prize- and Nobel Prize-winning author, Toni Morrison. Audience members. Boo! The President. My wife Jill went to Princeton to interview her, taught her book. Let's be clear: This is a guy who doesn't know much about anything. A women's right to choose is very much at risk because of what's happening in Texas. If you want to protect a woman's right to choose in Virginia, you need a Governor absolutely committed to protecting that right. And Terry has made it clear he will be a ""brick wall"" against anyone trying to take that constitutional right away. But Terry's opponent not only embraces someone with such a lack of character, he endorses Donald Trump's bad ideas and bad record. Donald Trump is the only President since Herbert Hoover in the thirties to see more jobs lost than gained the 4 years he was in office. In just 9 months of our administration, we've created more jobs than any President has in the same period of time in American history. When Donald Trump left office, there were only about 2 million people fully vaccinated. In just 9 months in our first year, over 190 million Americans are now fully vaccinated. Trump—I love this one—Trump likes to boast the single best measure of the economy is the stock market. I never thought that. Well, if that's true, take a look at the stock market now. It's higher than it's ever been. I guess it—[inaudible]—everything is doing well. It is. Higher than it's ever been. Not only that, more people are working today than just before the pandemic started. Household wealth is up. People are buying more things. Manufacturing is up. We're on the move, but we're on the right track. We've got more to do. So, if you're looking for someone who is going to keep your economy going and growing, the man behind me is the guy to get it done. He'll do it again. In fact, we're taking a page from Terry's book when he was Governor and when he'd be Governor next time. We're emerging from this pandemic, and we want to expand pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, millions of pre-K students. That's what's in my Build Back Better initiative. Studies show that when you do this, you increase by 58 percent the chances of a child—will complete the rest of their education in high school and beyond. And what better—we want better roads, bridges, and airports. Well, take the new bridge that will be built next to the 117-year-old Long Bridge in Arlington. This will be a dedicated corridor to passenger rail and reduce traffic bottlenecks in freight rail. It will be a game changer. Right now 13 percent of Virginia households don't have the internet. As we said during this pandemic, no parent should have to park in a McDonald's parking lot to have access to their internet for remote learning. Think about that. Terry wants every single Virginian to have access to affordable high-speed internet, and I guarantee we're going to both do that. Right now there are 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers in America that have lead pipes, including in their water. Look, folks, in America, every American, every child should be able to turn on a faucet and drink clean water. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Give that guy a drink of water, will you? [Laughter] Look, let me ask you this. Why is it that, 20 years ago, a bottle of insulin for type 1 diabetes cost $32 a bottle, but today, the same exact—same exact—formula, no change, costs $280 a bottle? Audience members. Boo! The President. Hear me? That's not only wrong, it's immoral. Terry wants to take the drug companies—and I do—bring down the costs of prescription drugs. And we can do that. There are nearly 2 million American—qualified women in America who are working—not working today because of childcare. Here in Virginia, the average two-parent home spends $14,600 a year for just one child. We want to bring those costs down so working families will not have to pay more than 7 percent of their income to care for a child under the age of 5. We're going to raise the minimum wage to—Terry is going to—we strongly support it—to $15 an hour. No one—no one—working full-time should live below the poverty line. And here's what else you ought to think about. Terry's opponent has made all of his private pledges of loyalty to Donald Trump. But what's really interesting to me: He won't stand next to Donald Trump now that the campaign's on. [Laughter] Think about it. He won't allow Donald Trump to campaign for him in this State. And he's willing to pledge his loyalty to Trump in private. Why not in public? What's he trying to hide? Is there a problem with Trump being here? Is he embarrassed? Look at who has been here for Terry: my wife Jill, Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Stacey Abrams, and so many more. Look, let me close with this. There is a fundamental difference between Democrats and Terry McAuliffe and what's going on in today's Republican Party and Terry's opponent. Number one, we stand for working people and the middle class. Trickle-down economics has never worked. We're both building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Today's Republican Party stands for nothing but just keep cutting taxes for the wealthy and the most powerful corporations. Second thing to remember—here's the deal: Virginia Democrats, you've made incredible progress in this State in recent years on jobs, the economy, health care, education, on attracting new business, growing the middle class, and so much more. For more than 40 years in Virginia, it has been the Democrat and Democratic Governors who have led. You've made this progress because you've had the courage and the wisdom to reject the very extremism that has taken over the Republican Party all across America. Think of it. The Republican Party, nationally, is for nothing. Not a joke. Nothing. Nothing. Just look around. Just look around—at what's happening with the Governor of Texas and Florida—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——the assault on a woman's right to choose. The lives lost to this pandemic could have been saved. Virginia, for the sake of your families and the country, we can't let this happen here in Virginia. Extremism can come in many forms. It can come in the rage of a mob driven in an assault—driven to assault the Capitol. It can come in a smile and a fleece vest. Either way, the ""big lie"" is still a big lie. So, Virginia, show up. Show up like you did for Barack and me. Show up like you did for me and Kamala. And show up for a proven leader like Terry McAuliffe. Show up to protect the majority in the House of Delegates, to reelect Mark attorney general, elect Hala as Lieutenant Governor. Virginia, you can't take anything for granted. So vote. Vote early. Get five of your friends and family to vote. You can drop off your ballots in drop boxes. You can mail them in. Visit iwillvote.com to find out where and how to vote early. Show up for democracy, for Virginia, for the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote!","The President. Hello, Virginia!

It took a plan that we stuck to, even in the face of unrelenting attacks from the most powerful special interests in the country. And the whole notion of the ""burn it all down"" politics of MAGA Republicans continues to be a drumbeat. But—— Audience member. You stole the election! The President. But—— Audience member. You stole it! You stole it, guy! You stole it! Audience members. Boo! The President. That's all right. No, no, no—let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. That's okay. Folks—folks—folks, ignorance knows no boundaries. But we never gave up. We never gave in. And we're delivering for the American people now. And now, even our critics have been forced to acknowledge real progress. A record of big accomplishments matched by few administrations in history: 10 million new jobs, more than we've ever created before at this point in anyone's Presidency; 3.5 percent unemployment rate, a near record low in the history of this country. A 15-percent drop in child poverty compared to 2 years ago, and more than 220 million Americans vaccinated. Record—record small-business creation. A big reason for all this is the American Rescue Plan that I signed into law shortly after I took office with the help of your Members of Congress. That plan took America from an economic crisis to an economic recovery. And not a single Republican—not one single one—voted for it. Not one. Audience members. Boo! The President. Not a single Republican. We also passed the once-in-a-generation investments in our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, clean water systems, high-speed rail, internet, the biggest investment in America since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Act. We got a little help. We did get some help from some Republicans who passed the bill, and I'm thankful for that. But the truth is, there's a lot more Republicans taking credit for a bill that they actually voted against. [Laughter] You see it all over America. Right here in Maryland, you've got a Republican Congressman named Andy Harris. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, ole Andy is out there touting funding for a key dredging project in his district that he voted against. Audience members. Boo! The President. It's happening all over. Maybe he'll—as we say in Southern Delaware, ""Maybe the boy will get some religion."" [Laughter] Look, folks, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act, a groundbreaking law. We're going to once again manufacture semiconductors—that we invented—that power everything in our lives, right here in America. This law will create tens of thousands of construction jobs, bring billions of dollars in investment to America, and revitalize American manufacturing. Look, folks, it means we're going to build the future in America, with American workers, in American factories, producing American-made products. We took on the NRA. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. We took on the NRA, and we beat them. We just passed the first significant gun safety legislation in 30 years in this country. And I promise you, we're not stopping here. I'm determined to ban assault weapons in this country. I did it once before, and we will do it again. We're going to do it for those families in Buffalo, Uvalde, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando. I've been almost every one of those places to meet with those parents. We've all got to do it. We're going to do it for all our kids gunned down on our streets every single day—every day that never make the national news. Folks, we're going to do it for your kids who are learning how to read and write in school instead of learning how to duck and cover. So this November—this November, you have to ask every candidate, ""Are you for banning assault weapons or not?"" And if you're not, we're not going to vote for you. Period. In my State of the Union Address, I put forward a unity agenda that included taking care of our veterans. Especially our veterans who had been exposed to burn pits like my son, who got the Conspicuous Service medal as well as—well, I don't want to start talking about my son, but he spent a year in Iraq. He was only about 200 yards from one of the burn pits. These pits the size of football fields—8, 9, or 10 feet deep—in Afghanistan and Iraq, incinerated—that incinerates wastes of war: tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuels, and so much more. So much more. Our soldiers breathed in that toxic smoke and came home with headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer. I just signed into law the PACT Act to take care of those veterans who were exposed to those burn pits. It's the least—it's the least we could do for them. I believe a nation has many obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to equip the women and men we send to battle and take care of them and their families when they return home. Army Captain Wes Moore understands that. He saw it like my son saw it. We've done all this, but then our critics say ""inflation."" You mean the global inflation caused by the worldwide pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine? We're making progress since I took office. This year, gas prices are down more than a dollar this summer, and we're going to keep it going down. I just signed into law the historic Inflation Reduction Act. And it wasn't easy. We had to take on the big drug companies to pass this bill, and we did. For decades, Big Pharma fought to block giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices. And for decades, Big Pharma won, but not this year. The American people won, and Big Pharma lost. Medicare now has the power to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices. Seniors will see their out-of-pocket costs for drugs limited to no more than $2,000 a year no matter how many drugs they need take for cancer or other diseases. Limit. If you're on Medicare and have diabetes, your cost of insulin will be capped at $35 a month. We also included a provision that would have allowed anyone with diabetes, including those kids and their families that should get charged somewhere between $600 and $1,000 a month. How would you feel like being a parent, looking at your kid and knowing you didn't have the insurance, and knowing if they did not get that insulin, they may die. There's thousands of people in America going through that. And these Republicans rip that out of the bill, but we're coming back. Look, this law also keeps down the cost of health care. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and this new law, we're saving families of four an average of $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. They are big savings for someone making $70-, $80-, $100,000 a year as a family. It's a big deal. Some might even say it's a ""BFD."" We also had to take on the climate deniers. And guess what? We beat them. We beat them. For decades, these climate deniers blocked any meaningful progress in dealing with climate crisis, but not this year. This year, the American people won, and the climate deniers lost. And consequently, we're taking the most aggressive action to confront climate crisis ever, $368 billion. We created more than a million jobs, and it will help us triple our solar power, unleash American manufacturing to own the global market in electric cars. That's the future made in America. For decades—for decades—the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans who fought to block a fairer Tax Code. And for decade after decade, they won. That's why 55 of the largest Fortune 500 companies in America in 2020 paid zero in tax after making $40 billion. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, I'm not making this up. It's the God's truth. Forty billion dollars. But this year—this year—some of the biggest companies in America flooded Capitol Hill with lobbyists and money and campaign contributions. And they lost. The American people won. Now, corporations have to pay a minimum corporate tax, God love them, of 15 percent. Isn't that painful? [Laughter] The days of billion-dollar companies paying zero is over. And guess what? You hear—you hear Republicans always talking about the deficit—right?—about big-spending Democrats. Well, guess what? When the last guy was President, he increased the debt by $2 trillion in tax cuts, not a penny of it paid for. Okay? Well, guess what we did? We've reduced the deficit. The Inflation Reduction Act lowers the deficit by $300 billion over the next 10 years. And that's on top of the $350 billion I reduced the deficit last year and the $1.5 trillion dollars reducing it this year. You'd think if the Republicans really cared about reducing inflation, they would have voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. But every single Republican voted against it. Even I know at least a dozen of them thought they should vote for it, but they would be primaried. Every single Republican in the House, every single Republican in the Senate, every single one—hear this, America: Every single Republican voted against lowering prescription drug prices, against lower health care costs, against tackling the climate crisis, against lower energy costs, against creating good-paying jobs, against the fairer taxes. Every single one. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, that's not hyperbole. Every single American needs to return the favor when we vote. And thanks to our historic deficit reduction, we can afford to cancel $10,000 in student debt and $20,000 if you're on a Pell grant for tens of millions of Americans making under $125,000. This is a game changer. Look, every election is a choice. My dad used to have a saying. He said: ""Joey, don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" Well, the alternative to the Democrats are the MAGA Republicans. Wes knows all about MAGA Republicans. He's running against one of them. That's why Wes described him as so far outside the mainstream that it will be dangerous in the Governor's office. Well, you're absolutely right. And your current Republican Governor—your Republican Governor agrees with that. Just go check out what your Republican Governor said about Wes's opponent. So how extreme are these MAGA Republicans? Just take a look what happened since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. In red States after red State, there's a race to pass the most restrictive abortion limitations imaginable, even without exception for rape or incest. But these MAGA Republicans won't stop there. They want a national ban. They want to pass a legislative national ban in the Congress. If the MAGA Republicans win control the Congress, it won't matter where you live; women won't have the right to choose anywhere—anywhere. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me tell you something. If they take it back and they try and pass it, I will veto it. Next—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. We're going to go, all right. And by the way, as Clarence Thomas said in the opinion, he said that the right to privacy doesn't exist for the right to have—use contraception, marriage equality, the whole right to privacy. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. We can't let that happen. You've got it, kid. You can't let that happen. Not today. Not tomorrow, not ever. And I don't believe we will. The MAGA Republicans have awakened to the powerful force in America: the women of this Nation. The Court, in its opinion, used a phrase that women have a right to vote and change this. Well, guess what? MAGA Republicans don't have a clue about the power of women. Let me tell you something: They are about to find out. Oh—[applause]. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And by the way—look, I served in the Congress since I was 29 years old. I got elected—I had to wait 17 days to be eligible to be sworn in. [Laughter] I've served with a lot of great Republicans, and I mean it. A lot of great Republicans—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Thank you, man. Thank you, man. You've got it. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal: What's happened is—what's happened is, there are no—there are not many real Republicans anymore. By the way, your sitting Governor, he's a Republican you can deal with. We disagree—no, no, I'm serious. But at least he's within the mainstream of the Republican Party. I respect conservative Republicans. I don't respect these MAGA Republicans. And, folks, everybody thinks I'm exaggerating when I say this, but they're coming after your Social Security as well. And you think I'm kidding? Go read the only election-year plan the Republicans have put out. [At this point, the President pointed up at a large video screen behind the podium.] Look up on these—on these—there you go. This is the Republican plan that is about what they want to do with regard to Social Security. Flip the—go ahead to the next slide. There you go. Here's what they said: Rick Scott, the Republican chairman of the reelect committee for the Senate—Republican Senators, said Social Security and Medicare should be the chopping block—here's the—they—this is what they put out: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Translated: Your Social Security, every 5 years, will be eliminated unless it's voted back into existence. Audience member. That's our money! The President. That's your money. You paid for it. You paid for it. But I'm not joking. Think about this. Think about what they're doing. And all—it's all there in black and white. He wants to require Congress to vote on the future of Social Security every 5 years. So, every 5 years, Congress can vote to change, cut, reduce, or entirely eliminate Social Security. How's that make you feel? Audience members. Boo! The President. Do you want to put your Social Security into the hands of Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene? Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean it. But it's not just Social Security. Senator Scott wants everything in the Federal budget voted on, de novo, every 5 years or it goes out of existence. That includes Medicare, veterans' benefits, and everything else. And then comes along Ron—Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Audience members. Boo! The President. This is what—they put this in writing now. This is their plan. He thinks 5 years is too long. I'm not joking. You think I'm making this up. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year. This is the same guy who said if Republicans get control of the United States Congress, they're coming after the Affordable Care Act again, denying health insurance to anyone with a preexisting condition. Because if you don't have the Affordable Care Act, people without a preexisting—with a preexisting cannot get insurance. Again, just think of it as a parent or a brother or sister looking at a brother, sister, son, daughter, and you can't take care of them because they have a preexisting condition. These guys never stop. And we're never going to stop either. Look, my friends, we offer a starkly different version and vision of this country, a vision of a better America that's within our reach, that's within our hands if we just vote. If we elect two more Senators, we keep the House—and Democrats, we're going to get a lot of unfinished business we're going to get done. Folks, look, we'll codify Roe v. Wade. We'll ban assault weapons. We'll protect Social Security and Medicare. We'll pass universal pre-K. We'll restore the childcare tax credit. We'll protect voting rights. We'll pass election reform and make no—make sure no one—no one—ever has the opportunity to steal an election again. And we'll continue—we'll continue to build an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, an economy built from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down; an economy that rewards work, not wealth; finally stops billionaires who pay an average of 8-percent Federal tax, less tax than a teacher or a firefighter. I think they should be able to be a billionaire, but pay your fair share, damn it. Because we understand something MAGA Republicans don't: Wall Street did not build this country, you did. Working people. Middle class built this Nation. And unions built the middle class. And we're not going to let anyone or anything tear America apart. I'll close with this: We're at a serious moment in our Nation's history. The MAGA Republicans don't just threaten our personal rights and economic security, they're a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace—embrace—political violence. They don't believe in democracy. This is why, in this moment, those of you who love this country—Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans—we must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving America than the MAGA Republicans are to destroying America. ""We the People"" are the first words of our Constitution, and ""We the People"" will still determine the destiny of America. If ""We the People"" stand together, we will prevail as ""We the People."" We just have to keep the faith. We just have to persevere. We just have to vote. Vote. Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. Folks, we just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together, so let's get it done. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Hello, Maryland. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. Wes, thank you for that introduction. And Wes is the real deal. The real deal. Folks, he's a combat veteran. Only drawback is, he's a Rhodes Scholar. [Laughter] Former CEO of one of the biggest antipoverty organizations in America. And if we all do our part, the next Governor of Maryland! It's been said many times before and been said here today—and excuse my back, my mother would kill me, with my back to you all. But excuse my back. The fact of the matter is, you have literally two of the best Senators in the United States Senate: Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. As a matter of fact, were it not Chris being my debate partner, getting me prepared in the general election for President, I wouldn't be standing here. So, if you don't like me, blame Chris. He's up for reelection this year. And I told him, I'll come campaign for him or against him, whichever will help the most. [Laughter] Folks, look, both Ben, as well—they're strong, and they're principled. They're effective. Keep them. You need them. Hell, I need them. You've got a great congressional delegation, including Steny Hoyer, who has been a friend for a long time. And how about that Jamie Raskin? Hasn't he stepped up? The man has stepped up. He's done an incredible job. [Laughter] I like it. He's done an incredible job, coming out of a tragic circumstance with his family. You know, you've got to keep them. You need them. And as I said, heck, I need them. Folks, we're just 76 days away from the midterm election—76 days. And to state the obvious, there's a lot at stake. So I want to be crystal clear about what's on the ballot this year. Your right to choose is on the ballot this year. The Social Security you paid for from the time you had a job is on the ballot. The safety of your kids from gun violence is on the ballot. And it's not hyperbole, the very survival of our planet is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Even the democracy. Are you ready to fight for these things now? Well, then you need to do one thing: vote. Vote. Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. You've got it. In 2020, you and 81 million Americans voted to save our democracy. That's why Donald Trump isn't just a former President, he is a defeated former President. And it's not hyperbole. Now you need to vote to literally save democracy again. Look, I believe America is at a genuine inflection point that occurs every six or seven generations in world history, one of the moments—one of the moments—that changes everything. And Americans are going have to choose. You must choose. Will be it—will we be a country that moves forward or backward? Will we build a future or obsess over the past? Will we be a nation of unity, of hope, of optimism, not a nation of anger, violence, hatred, and division? Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans have made their choice: to go backwards, full of anger, violence, hate, and division. But we've chosen a different path: forward, the future, unity, hope, and optimism. I mean this sincerely. We choose to build a better America. This fall, there will be a choice between these two visions. And we must take our case to the American people and be crystal clear about it. There's no question it's been a hard few years. When I came to office, we were facing a once-in-a-century pandemic. A hundred—a million people died. A million people. And over 9 million people get up in the morning and sit at that breakfast table or the dinner table with an empty chair because of that. Historic joblessness. Businesses struggling to stay open. So much lost learning for our kids in school. But we've come a long way in 18 months. COVID no longer controls our lives. A record-number Americans are working, 10 million since I came to office. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open. And, folks, it just didn't happen; it took a lot of hard work. It took a plan that we stuck to, even in the face of unrelenting attacks from the most powerful special interests in the country. And the whole notion of the ""burn it all down"" politics of MAGA Republicans continues to be a drumbeat. But—— Audience member. You stole the election! The President. But—— Audience member. You stole it! You stole it, guy! You stole it! Audience members. Boo! The President. That's all right. No, no, no—let him go. Let him go. Let him go. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. That's okay. Folks—folks—folks, ignorance knows no boundaries. But we never gave up. We never gave in. And we're delivering for the American people now.

The MAGA Republicans have awakened to the powerful force in America: the women of this Nation. The Court, in its opinion, used a phrase that women have a right to vote and change this. Well, guess what? MAGA Republicans don't have a clue about the power of women. Let me tell you something: They are about to find out. Oh—[applause]. Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And by the way—look, I served in the Congress since I was 29 years old. I got elected—I had to wait 17 days to be eligible to be sworn in. [Laughter] I've served with a lot of great Republicans, and I mean it. A lot of great Republicans—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Thank you, man. Thank you, man. You've got it. Well, here's the deal. Here's the deal: What's happened is—what's happened is, there are no—there are not many real Republicans anymore. By the way, your sitting Governor, he's a Republican you can deal with. We disagree—no, no, I'm serious. But at least he's within the mainstream of the Republican Party. I respect conservative Republicans. I don't respect these MAGA Republicans. And, folks, everybody thinks I'm exaggerating when I say this, but they're coming after your Social Security as well. And you think I'm kidding? Go read the only election-year plan the Republicans have put out. [At this point, the President pointed up at a large video screen behind the podium.] Look up on these—on these—there you go. This is the Republican plan that is about what they want to do with regard to Social Security. Flip the—go ahead to the next slide. There you go. Here's what they said: Rick Scott, the Republican chairman of the reelect committee for the Senate—Republican Senators, said Social Security and Medicare should be the chopping block—here's the—they—this is what they put out: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Translated: Your Social Security, every 5 years, will be eliminated unless it's voted back into existence. Audience member. That's our money! The President. That's your money. You paid for it. You paid for it. But I'm not joking. Think about this. Think about what they're doing. And all—it's all there in black and white. He wants to require Congress to vote on the future of Social Security every 5 years. So, every 5 years, Congress can vote to change, cut, reduce, or entirely eliminate Social Security. How's that make you feel? Audience members. Boo! The President. Do you want to put your Social Security into the hands of Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Greene? Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean it. But it's not just Social Security. Senator Scott wants everything in the Federal budget voted on, de novo, every 5 years or it goes out of existence. That includes Medicare, veterans' benefits, and everything else. And then comes along Ron—Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Audience members. Boo! The President. This is what—they put this in writing now. This is their plan. He thinks 5 years is too long. I'm not joking. You think I'm making this up. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year. This is the same guy who said if Republicans get control of the United States Congress, they're coming after the Affordable Care Act again, denying health insurance to anyone with a preexisting condition. Because if you don't have the Affordable Care Act, people without a preexisting—with a preexisting cannot get insurance. Again, just think of it as a parent or a brother or sister looking at a brother, sister, son, daughter, and you can't take care of them because they have a preexisting condition. These guys never stop. And we're never going to stop either. Look, my friends, we offer a starkly different version and vision of this country, a vision of a better America that's within our reach, that's within our hands if we just vote. If we elect two more Senators, we keep the House—and Democrats, we're going to get a lot of unfinished business we're going to get done. Folks, look, we'll codify Roe v. Wade. We'll ban assault weapons. We'll protect Social Security and Medicare. We'll pass universal pre-K. We'll restore the childcare tax credit. We'll protect voting rights. We'll pass election reform and make no—make sure no one—no one—ever has the opportunity to steal an election again. And we'll continue—we'll continue to build an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, an economy built from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down; an economy that rewards work, not wealth; finally stops billionaires who pay an average of 8-percent Federal tax, less tax than a teacher or a firefighter. I think they should be able to be a billionaire, but pay your fair share, damn it. Because we understand something MAGA Republicans don't: Wall Street did not build this country, you did. Working people. Middle class built this Nation. And unions built the middle class. And we're not going to let anyone or anything tear America apart. I'll close with this: We're at a serious moment in our Nation's history. The MAGA Republicans don't just threaten our personal rights and economic security, they're a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace—embrace—political violence. They don't believe in democracy. This is why, in this moment, those of you who love this country—Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans—we must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving America than the MAGA Republicans are to destroying America. ""We the People"" are the first words of our Constitution, and ""We the People"" will still determine the destiny of America. If ""We the People"" stand together, we will prevail as ""We the People."" We just have to keep the faith. We just have to persevere. We just have to vote. Vote. Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. Folks, we just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together, so let's get it done. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['hello', 'maryland', 'audience', 'members', 'u', 'u', 'u', 'wes', 'introduction', 'wes', 'real', 'deal', 'real', 'deal', 'folks', 'hes', 'combat', 'veteran',

[Applause] Talk about being home and the fact you've got the president of the union standing out there with other unions—I'll tell you what, man. I was going to say, if you have a seat, take one, but you don't have any seats. [Laughter]"", 'Look, Dajsha, that was—that was a great—she\'s pretty good for someone in the last year in college, you know? Dajsha, just remember me. When you\'re President and they say, ""Joe Biden is in the outer office,"" promise you won\'t say, ""Joe who?"" when I come in. [Laughter]', '[At this point, the President addressed audience members positioned above the dais.]', ""Hey, folks, how are you all? I'm going to talk about more than just the NEA today because—and I want to—I've told your president I want to come back and just talk pure education as well. But I want to talk a little—much broader. And, Becky, thanks for hosting us. I appreciate it very much."", ""Forty-six days to the midterms. We need to be crystal clear about what we're—what's on the ballot, because there's a heck of a lot at stake that's on the ballot. Right now—right now—on the ballot, there's Social Security. It's on the ballot. You all have paid every single—and of every paycheck you got, you paid into it——"", ""[The President's microphone malfunctioned. He tapped it on the podium to restore proper functioning and continued his remarks as follows.]"", '——you paid into. Holy mackerel. [Laughter]', 'Audience member. All right!', 'The President. Anyway, but there\'s a lot really—truly, there\'s a lot on the ballot. There\'s—this is—my dad used to have an expression. He\'d say: ""Joey, don\'t compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" [Laughter] And we have a real alternative here that—this is not a—this is not going to be an election that isn\'t of significant consequence.', ""Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be."", 'And, folks, look, the of survival our planet is on the ballot. And that sounds like hyperbole, but it genuinely is.', 'Audience member. We need EPA!', ""The President. Well, I tell you what, the thing that we found out and everybody found out: There's not a lot of total climate deniers anymore after they've seen what happened this year. But guess what? We've got a lot to do."", '[The President addressed an audience member as follows.]', ""You've got to say hi to me. [Laughter] We go back a long way. She was 12; I was 30. But anyway—[laughter]—this woman helped me get an awful lot done. Anyway."", ""But right now—and it's not hyperbole to suggest right now democracy itself is on the ballot as well. Folks, I believe America is at an inflection point. And I apologize to—I'm a labor guy. I've spent a lot of time with all of you—not all of you, but with labor movements—since I got elected and my whole career.

When it actually comes to actually doing something about inflation, Republicans said no.

And, Becky, thanks for hosting us. I appreciate it very much. Forty-six days to the midterms. We need to be crystal clear about what we're—what's on the ballot, because there's a heck of a lot at stake that's on the ballot. Right now—right now—on the ballot, there's Social Security. It's on the ballot. You all have paid every single—and of every paycheck you got, you paid into it—— [The President's microphone malfunctioned. He tapped it on the podium to restore proper functioning and continued his remarks as follows.] ——you paid into. Holy mackerel. [Laughter] Audience member. All right! The President. Anyway, but there's a lot really—truly, there's a lot on the ballot. There's—this is—my dad used to have an expression. He'd say: ""Joey, don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" [Laughter] And we have a real alternative here that—this is not a—this is not going to be an election that isn't of significant consequence. Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be. And, folks, look, the of survival our planet is on the ballot. And that sounds like hyperbole, but it genuinely is. Audience member. We need EPA! The President. Well, I tell you what, the thing that we found out and everybody found out: There's not a lot of total climate deniers anymore after they've seen what happened this year. But guess what? We've got a lot to do. [The President addressed an audience member as follows.] You've got to say hi to me. [Laughter] We go back a long way. She was 12; I was 30. But anyway—[laughter]—this woman helped me get an awful lot done. Anyway. But right now—and it's not hyperbole to suggest right now democracy itself is on the ballot as well. Folks, I believe America is at an inflection point. And I apologize to—I'm a labor guy. I've spent a lot of time with all of you—not all of you, but with labor movements—since I got elected and my whole career. But—and I apologize if I repeat some things. But I think we're really at an inflection point. It occurs every three, four, five generations. It doesn't occur every election. And by ""inflection point,"" I mean that these moments—these are going to determine the shape of everything that's going to come after, what we do now. What we do in the next several years is going to determine what this country looks like in 25 and 30 years. It's that consequential. Now, 46 days to choose—46 days. And the path offered by Democrats is contrasted with the one offered by the MAGA Republicans. And by the way, not all Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Audience members. That's right! The President. So I want to make that clear. And for years and years, I had a reputation—I remember I got beat up in the campaign by saying that I wanted to unify the country and unify the parties. You used to be able to do that. But things have changed a whole bunch. The MAGA Republicans control the Republican Party right now, and that's self-evident. That's self-evident. So there's a lot at stake here. And I'm going to talk a little bit about that right now. Earlier today, after opposing and obstructing everything we tried to do to stop progress for the last 2 years, the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to Pennsylvania and unveiled what he calls a ""Commitment to America."" That's a thin series of policy goals, with little or no detail, that he says Republicans are going to pursue if they regain control of the Congress.

But if you give me two more Democratic Senators in the United States Senate, I promise you—I promise you—we're going to codify Roe. We'll once again make Roe the law of the land. And we'll once again protect a woman's right to choose. And the power to get this done is in the hands of the American people, especially the women of America. Audience member. Thank you!

An awful lot of mayors and Governors and county executives, they don't have—they didn't have the tax base, because I was left with an economy that was in distress. So we said: ""Here you go. We're going to give you this money so you can make sure you can keep your schools open, you can make sure you keep police departments open, make sure you keep your hospitals open, make sure you keep the fire departments open."" And guess what? Every single Republican in the Congress voted against that. Every single Republican voted against it. Now, look, we're in a situation where now the MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding. They're—they're defunding—defunding the FBI. Now, let me tell you something: I don't think—and I know some of you weren't happy with me—I didn't think we should defund the police; I never believed that and said so at the time. But I sure in hell don't think we should be defunding the FBI either. And then there's the—then there's the day we'll never forget, on January 6. What happened on the 6th? Law enforcement was attacked, assaulted, brutalized, and stomped on, and later, several died. Some lost their lives because of that day. The MAGA Republicans didn't side with law enforcement; they sided with the insurrectionists. And they still do. Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you can't condemn what happened on January the 6th. Don't tell me that. You can't—you can't be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can't claim to be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 ""patriots."" That's what they're called. And you can't claim to be for a safe America if you take orders from the NRA. Look, we just passed the most meaningful gun safety law in 30 years in this country, but most Republicans voted against it. Some, thank God, joined us, and we passed it, and sided—but most sided with the NRA. After Buffalo, Uvalde, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando—I went to every one of those places. I spent hours and hours and hours with those families—not a joke. Not a joke. Hours with them. I know what it's like, under different circumstances, to lose children. But lose children like they lost their children? Enough. We've had enough. It's time to pass the assault weapons ban. Look, I support the Second Amendment. I have two shotguns, and I'm not—I—the only thing I really do is really target practice. I haven't done that in a long time. [Laughter] But here's the thing: There's no justification for a weapon of war. None. The speed of that bullet is five times that that comes out of the muzzle of most weapons. It can penetrate your vests. And by the way, as I pointed out when I was—got a pass the first time as a Senator—in Delaware, we're a big gun-owning State. A lot of duck hunters, a lot of hunters. And I'd be going—and I literally went up and down the streams campaigning and going to the people who were part—who belonged to the NRA and others. And I'd say, ""How many deer out here are wearing Kevlar vests?"" [Laughter] You know? No, but I'm—seriously, think about it. What in God's name do you need an assault weapon for? It's an assault weapon designed to kill people, to defend America, to defend people. But, folks, look, it's just—we're just—it's way out of hand. I've taken on the RNA [NRA]* and I beat them before, and I plan on doing it again. And, folks, we can do it again. Our children—our children—should be in a situation of learning how, as I said, to read and write, not duck and cover. So, in 46 days, if you want a safer America, America faces a choice. Republicans will once again side with the NRA and put American families and children at risk. And, I mean, some Democrats as well, and there are some Republicans who support us. It's not down the line, but it's the—part of their platform. Democrats will ban assault weapons once and for all, God willing. Kevin McCarthy also talks about their being for a strong economy. But look what the Republicans have done. When I came to office, the economy was flat on its back. Millions out of work. Food lines that stretched—remember seeing all those food lines? People in nice-looking automobiles waiting for an hour, hour and a half just to have a bucket of—a box of food put in their trunk. In the United States of America—in the United States of America—that was happening—all across America. The most anemic job performance since Herbert Hoover was in place. And that's not hyperbole; that's a fact. So we acted quickly. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which lifted this Nation from economic crisis to economic recovery. And every single Republican voted for it. Nearly 10 million more jobs have been created since I've been President, the highest number of jobs in that period of time of any President of the United States of America. We have a 3.7-percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 50—more than 50 years; a record number of new—record number of new small businesses created; and over 668,000 new manufacturing jobs in America. The American Rescue Plan helped keep teachers, police officers, firefighters, first responders on the job. It provided the money needed to get schools open. And it was a big reason we've been able to vaccinate over 220 million Americans. More to do. With the infrastructure law we passed, we did get some Republican help for that. Well, that infrastructure law is the most significant investment in America since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Now—some Republicans voted for it, and some were critical. But the truth is, there's a lot more Republicans out there taking credit for the new bridges and those—[inaudible]—that are collapsing than actually voted for it. I love going by, and they're, you know—""And this is great thing. I voted against it, but this is a great thing."" [Laughter] But, folks, in addition to inheriting a failed MAGA Republican economy, we also confronted a global pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine, and that's driven the global inflation we see today. That's why it's so important that we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which I proposed from the beginning, but didn't get passed until this summer. This law will cut costs for families, help reduce inflation at the kitchen table. The way we always measured inflation—and my dad was a graceful, hard-working guy. He worked—he worked a lot, his whole life. And my dad used to say—he used to talk about whether inflation or—the situation of a family to have breathing room is: At the end of the month, when you paid all your bills, did you have a little bit left—just a little bit left? So there's more than one way—more than one way—to deal with the inflation to a family: to lower the price of the things they have to deal with, because that's what folks at home think about. How much of their monthly bills—how much do they have to pay for the necessities? This law is going to give them just a little more breathing room, as my dad would say. We pay more for our prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Well, for years, so many of us for a long time, and many of the unions in here—every one of the unions here—have been trying to fix this problem. For years, Big Pharma has blocked us in Medicare from negotiating drug prices. But not this year. We beat Big Pharma. We finally beat them, first time. Big Pharma lost. And, folks, now Medicare will have the power to do what so many Democrats and many Republicans in the past talked about doing: lowering prescription drug prices. They pay billions of dollars. They can negotiate lower prices like other countries do. And the seniors—we passed a law saying: Beginning in January, no senior, no matter what the cost of prescription drugs—cancer drugs, whatever drugs they have; and some of them can be $60-, $70-, $80,000 a year—no senior will have to pay, no matter what the cost of their drugs, more than $2,000 a year beginning in January. And if you're a—if you're on Medicare and you have diabetes, the cost of your insulin—instead of being 30 to 40 to 50 times more than the cost to make the insulin, it costs 10 bucks to make that insulin—10—and package it. But now you cannot charge any senior—and we should make it for everybody. They voted down the other piece. But every senior will not have to pay more than $35 a month for the cost of their insulin. We wanted to cut the cost of insulin for everyone—for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children who have type 1 diabetes. But look, folks, imagine being the parent of a child who had type 1 diabetes; you had no insurance, and you had no coverage. You have to look at that child and know—and know—that if he or she does not have access to that insulin, it will fundamentally affect their lives in ways that are going to be damaging for the rest of their lives. Imagine the feeling. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect."" And he'd always end by saying, ""It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" Well, guess what? The Republicans blocked limiting that cost to 35 bucks for kids. As I said, it only costs 10 bucks for that prescription that he made and packaged. Drug companies are charging families more than 30 times as much for that drug on a monthly basis. And a lot of people just can't do it. Imagine, as I said, being that mom and dad needing that insulin. It has to be—I was down in Virginia at a function. I met a mom who said they have to ration the insulin, be able—I mean, it's wrong. It's not who we are. We're going to fix that as well, I promise you. Folks, the bottom line: This law is going to lower energy costs as well. Gas prices—I know I got criticized for going into the stockpile. But guess what? Gas prices are down $1.30 a gallon. And in 41 States, plus the District of Columbia, the average gasoline price is less than $2.99. Look, the law makes the biggest investment ever. We invest in climate crisis, $369 billion to deal with the climate crisis. And it makes the Tax Code fairer. In 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations in the country paid zero dollars in Federal income taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. And they made $40 billion. It's not right. So we put a stop to it by enacting a corporate minimum tax of only—but only 15 percent. Today, the days of big, profitable corporations paying nothing in Federal income tax is over. And guess what? Every single Republican voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. When it actually comes to actually doing something about inflation, Republicans said no. And they said, time and again, that the first chance they get, they're going to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. And here's what else Republicans are, in terms of their fiscal recklessness. Donald Trump and the Republicans had no problem—— Audience member. Boo! ——had no problem enacting, in his 4 years, a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the top 1 percent. And they didn't pay for a penny of it. And it massively increased the Federal deficit. Meanwhile—you know, we always say the Democrats are the big spenders? We brought down the deficit—$350 billion the first year and nearly $1.5 trillion this year. And the Inflation Reduction Act is going to reduce it another $300 billion because—over the next 10 years, because Medicare can reduce—can pay less for the drugs they have to buy for the seniors. So I don't want to hear it from Republicans. They're the ones who blew up the deficit. They're the ones—and we're the ones bringing it down. And now, thanks to the historic deficit reduction, we can afford to cancel $10,000 in student debt and $20,000 if you have a Pell grant for tens of millions of Americans making under $125,000. It's a gamechanger. And Republicans are already looking for their hand-picked judges to deny relief to those hard-working Americans. They will not succeed, in my view, but that's who they're looking for. And finally, with a straight face, Kevin McCarthy says that MAGA Republicans will restore faith in our elections. [Laughter] As we say in my faith, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" [Laughter] Restore—restore—faith in our elections? MAGA Republicans refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and the will of the people. Eighty-one million people voted Democrat for President last time. Even though they lost court case after court case after court case after court case after court case, even in front of Trump-appointed judges. And recount after recount proved the results were accurate. It's become a litmus test in their party to pledge loyalty to Donald Trump by buying into the ""big lie."" Now, I'm serious. You all see it on—all on television. Look, the fact is that a lot of them—I've had six Republican Senators who I've known for some time come to me—and I gave them my word I'd never mention names, and I never will—separately, telling me that they agree with this, that, or the other thing that I was proposing, but if I voted for it, it would cost them their election because they'd lose a primary. Well, you see what's happening. You see the MAGA Republican program being adapted by all these folks in the primary. And then once they get out of the primary, they're trying like hell to figure out how to get out from under that. [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. You can't let the integrity of our elections be undermined. Democracy can't survive. It cannot survive. Not a joke. It can't survive when one side believes there's only two outcomes to an election: Either they win, or they were cheated. [Laughter] That's not democracy. And that's where the vast majority of MAGA Republicans are today. They don't understand what every patriotic American knows: You can't love your country only when you win. Only when you win. So, folks, in just 46 days, democracy will be on the ballot. Americans will have to choose between the MAGA Republican platform who have embraced extremism and the ""big lie""; Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans who believe in the rule of law. Rejecting [respecting]* the will of the people and accepting the results of a fair and free election is what we're about, not what they're about. Let me close with this. As I said earlier, my dad used to say: ""Don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" This November, you have to choose to be a nation of hope, unity, and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and darkness. I believe America will move forward to the future—a future of possibilities; a future in which we can build, dream, and hope. I know we can, because I know this nation like you do. I know the American people. I know their courage. I know their hearts. I know our history. That's why—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. And those of you who know me, no one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I've never been more optimistic. We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into it. It's not just about building back to what it was before. We have a chance to build back in a way to make it better for everybody. Everybody. And I want to get back to the time when I'm debating Republicans or conservatives, heck, but believe in the institutions—believe in the institutions; have a fair and square fight about what we're doing; think the Court and the—and the Congress and the Presidency are independent branches of government and should be treated with respect. That's what I'm looking forward to. We've just got to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—there's nothing—beyond our capacity, not a single thing we can't do when we do it together. And the way to do that is start with the unions, to do it together, together, together. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. [The President turned to face audience members standing behind him and addressed them as follows.] And I should have started off by saying, ""Excuse my back when I'm speaking."" [Laughter] I apologize. Thank you all very much. And God bless you all. Let's keep this going. Thank you.","The President. Well, I tell you what, I think I like this crowd. [Applause] Talk about being home and the fact you've got the president of the union standing out there with other unions—I'll tell you what, man. I was going to say, if you have a seat, take one, but you don't have any seats. [Laughter] Look, Dajsha, that was—that was a great—she's pretty good for someone in the last year in college, you know? Dajsha, just remember me. When you're President and they say, ""Joe Biden is in the outer office,"" promise you won't say, ""Joe who?"" when I come in. [Laughter] [At this point, the President addressed audience members positioned above the dais.] Hey, folks, how are you all? I'm going to talk about more than just the NEA today because—and I want to—I've told your president I want to come back and just talk pure education as well. But I want to talk a little—much broader. And, Becky, thanks for hosting us. I appreciate it very much. Forty-six days to the midterms. We need to be crystal clear about what we're—what's on the ballot, because there's a heck of a lot at stake that's on the ballot. Right now—right now—on the ballot, there's Social Security. It's on the ballot. You all have paid every single—and of every paycheck you got, you paid into it—— [The President's microphone malfunctioned. He tapped it on the podium to restore proper functioning and continued his remarks as follows.] ——you paid into. Holy mackerel. [Laughter] Audience member. All right! The President. Anyway, but there's a lot really—truly, there's a lot on the ballot. There's—this is—my dad used to have an expression. He'd say: ""Joey, don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" [Laughter] And we have a real alternative here that—this is not a—this is not going to be an election that isn't of significant consequence. Gun safety for our kids and gun violence are on the ballot. The idea that you start school this year and kids in many parts of the country learn how to duck and cover rather than—no, I'm serious; think about it—rather than talking about reading, writing, and arithmetic is a very different circumstance. It's not right. It's not who we are. It's not who we should be. And, folks, look, the of survival our planet is on the ballot. And that sounds like hyperbole, but it genuinely is. Audience member. We need EPA! The President. Well, I tell you what, the thing that we found out and everybody found out: There's not a lot of total climate deniers anymore after they've seen what happened this year. But guess what? We've got a lot to do. [The President addressed an audience member as follows.] You've got to say hi to me. [Laughter] We go back a long way. She was 12; I was 30. But anyway—[laughter]—this woman helped me get an awful lot done. Anyway. But right now—and it's not hyperbole to suggest right now democracy itself is on the ballot as well. Folks, I believe America is at an inflection point. And I apologize to—I'm a labor guy. I've spent a lot of time with all of you—not all of you, but with labor movements—since I got elected and my whole career. But—and I apologize if I repeat some things. But I think we're really at an inflection point. It occurs every three, four, five generations. It doesn't occur every election. And by ""inflection point,"" I mean that these moments—these are going to determine the shape of everything that's going to come after, what we do now. What we do in the next several years is going to determine what this country looks like in 25 and 30 years. It's that consequential. Now, 46 days to choose—46 days. And the path offered by Democrats is contrasted with the one offered by the MAGA Republicans. And by the way, not all Republicans are MAGA Republicans. Audience members. That's right! The President. So I want to make that clear. And for years and years, I had a reputation—I remember I got beat up in the campaign by saying that I wanted to unify the country and unify the parties. You used to be able to do that. But things have changed a whole bunch. The MAGA Republicans control the Republican Party right now, and that's self-evident. That's self-evident. So there's a lot at stake here. And I'm going to talk a little bit about that right now. Earlier today, after opposing and obstructing everything we tried to do to stop progress for the last 2 years, the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy went to Pennsylvania and unveiled what he calls a ""Commitment to America."" That's a thin series of policy goals, with little or no detail, that he says Republicans are going to pursue if they regain control of the Congress. In the course of nearly an hour, here's a few of the things we didn't hear. We didn't hear him mention the right to choose. We didn't hear him mention Medicare. We didn't hear him mention Social Security. So let's take a look at what Kevin said today. He said Republicans want to, quote, ""preserve our constitutional freedom."" That sounds great. I'm for doing that as well; we all are. But look at what they've actually done. The MAGA Republicans just cheered and embraced the first Supreme Court decision in our entire history—the first one in our entire history—that just didn't fail to preserve a constitutional freedom, it actually took away a fundamental right that had been granted by the same Court to so many Americans: the constitutional right to choose. And now nearly half the States in the United States of America have either passed a ban on abortion or will shortly. And in many States, abortion is already banned even in cases of rape and incest, a fundamental change. Already, 166 House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide. And the senior Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, has proposed a national ban on abortion with criminal penalties put on doctors and put them in jail if they, in fact, violate the ban. So, in 46 days, America is going to choose: If Republicans win control of the Congress, abortion will be banned. And by the way, it will be initially banned, but if they win Congress, I will veto it. But think what's happening. They're banning in the case of—in the case of rape and incest in many States. No exceptions. And they're going to be—they're trying to criminalize it nationwide. But if you give me two more Democratic Senators in the United States Senate, I promise you—I promise you—we're going to codify Roe. We'll once again make Roe the law of the land. And we'll once again protect a woman's right to choose. And the power to get this done is in the hands of the American people, especially the women of America. Audience member. Thank you! The President. And—no, no, it really is. Justice Alito said that women can decide the outcome of this election—paraphrasing some quote in the actual decision. Well, he ain't seen nothing yet. I don't believe that MAGA Republicans have a clue about the power of American women. Let me tell you something: They're about to find out. And, folks, Kevin McCarthy also talked about, quote, ""longer, healthier lives for Americans."" Again, it sounds great. Who's not for that? Well, just look at what the Republicans are doing. Already, 158 House Republicans have signed on to a Republican budget that will cut Medicare and Social Security—already. Audience members. Boo! The President. The man in charge of electing Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, has proposed a plan to put Social Security on the chopping block every 5 years. De novo. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not—I know this sounds like—but I really mean it. Look, go on the internet, and check it out. They've laid out the platform. It means every 5 years, according to—if they succeed in the Senate—the Congress will vote to either cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security, or bring it back exactly as it is. What do you think the prospects of it coming back exactly as it is? You've been paying into Social Security ever since you got your first paycheck. Well, then there's Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Audience members. Boo! The President. As my mother would say, ""God bless his soul."" [Laughter] Look, he thinks waiting 5 years is too long. He wants to put—no, he wants to put Social Security on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. An affirmative requirement to vote to keep it. Now, think of that. It's not just Social Security he wants to put up; he wants Medicare, Medicaid benefits, every Federal budget, every federal benefit gets up and has to be voted on every year. De novo. Just from the—from scratch. So, in 46 days, America is going to face a choice. If Republicans control the Congress, Social Security will be on the chopping block. But if you support the Democrats—I promise you this—Social Security will be protected. Period. And I won't let any MAGA Republican take it away. Leader McCarthy talked about waiting—wanting a nation that's safe. Well, let's look at what Republicans have done to make it safe. They voted against virtually everything we've done to reduce crime and keep communities safe. The American Rescue Plan, it was the—when we first got into office, we passed it. You know what it was designed to do? An awful lot of mayors and Governors and county executives, they don't have—they didn't have the tax base, because I was left with an economy that was in distress. So we said: ""Here you go. We're going to give you this money so you can make sure you can keep your schools open, you can make sure you keep police departments open, make sure you keep your hospitals open, make sure you keep the fire departments open."" And guess what? Every single Republican in the Congress voted against that. Every single Republican voted against it. Now, look, we're in a situation where now the MAGA Republicans are calling for defunding. They're—they're defunding—defunding the FBI. Now, let me tell you something: I don't think—and I know some of you weren't happy with me—I didn't think we should defund the police; I never believed that and said so at the time. But I sure in hell don't think we should be defunding the FBI either. And then there's the—then there's the day we'll never forget, on January 6. What happened on the 6th? Law enforcement was attacked, assaulted, brutalized, and stomped on, and later, several died. Some lost their lives because of that day. The MAGA Republicans didn't side with law enforcement; they sided with the insurrectionists. And they still do. Don't tell me you support law enforcement if you can't condemn what happened on January the 6th. Don't tell me that. You can't—you can't be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can't claim to be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 ""patriots."" That's what they're called. And you can't claim to be for a safe America if you take orders from the NRA. Look, we just passed the most meaningful gun safety law in 30 years in this country, but most Republicans voted against it. Some, thank God, joined us, and we passed it, and sided—but most sided with the NRA. After Buffalo, Uvalde, Newtown, El Paso, Parkland, Charleston, Las Vegas, Orlando—I went to every one of those places. I spent hours and hours and hours with those families—not a joke. Not a joke. Hours with them. I know what it's like, under different circumstances, to lose children. But lose children like they lost their children? Enough. We've had enough. It's time to pass the assault weapons ban. Look, I support the Second Amendment. I have two shotguns, and I'm not—I—the only thing I really do is really target practice. I haven't done that in a long time. [Laughter] But here's the thing: There's no justification for a weapon of war. None. The speed of that bullet is five times that that comes out of the muzzle of most weapons. It can penetrate your vests. And by the way, as I pointed out when I was—got a pass the first time as a Senator—in Delaware, we're a big gun-owning State. A lot of duck hunters, a lot of hunters. And I'd be going—and I literally went up and down the streams campaigning and going to the people who were part—who belonged to the NRA and others. And I'd say, ""How many deer out here are wearing Kevlar vests?"" [Laughter] You know? No, but I'm—seriously, think about it. What in God's name do you need an assault weapon for? It's an assault weapon designed to kill people, to defend America, to defend people. But, folks, look, it's just—we're just—it's way out of hand. I've taken on the RNA [NRA]* and I beat them before, and I plan on doing it again. And, folks, we can do it again. Our children—our children—should be in a situation of learning how, as I said, to read and write, not duck and cover. So, in 46 days, if you want a safer America, America faces a choice. Republicans will once again side with the NRA and put American families and children at risk. And, I mean, some Democrats as well, and there are some Republicans who support us. It's not down the line, but it's the—part of their platform. Democrats will ban assault weapons once and for all, God willing. Kevin McCarthy also talks about their being for a strong economy. But look what the Republicans have done. When I came to office, the economy was flat on its back. Millions out of work. Food lines that stretched—remember seeing all those food lines? People in nice-looking automobiles waiting for an hour, hour and a half just to have a bucket of—a box of food put in their trunk. In the United States of America—in the United States of America—that was happening—all across America. The most anemic job performance since Herbert Hoover was in place. And that's not hyperbole; that's a fact. So we acted quickly. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which lifted this Nation from economic crisis to economic recovery. And every single Republican voted for it. Nearly 10 million more jobs have been created since I've been President, the highest number of jobs in that period of time of any President of the United States of America. We have a 3.7-percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 50—more than 50 years; a record number of new—record number of new small businesses created; and over 668,000 new manufacturing jobs in America. The American Rescue Plan helped keep teachers, police officers, firefighters, first responders on the job. It provided the money needed to get schools open. And it was a big reason we've been able to vaccinate over 220 million Americans. More to do. With the infrastructure law we passed, we did get some Republican help for that. Well, that infrastructure law is the most significant investment in America since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Now—some Republicans voted for it, and some were critical. But the truth is, there's a lot more Republicans out there taking credit for the new bridges and those—[inaudible]—that are collapsing than actually voted for it. I love going by, and they're, you know—""And this is great thing. I voted against it, but this is a great thing."" [Laughter] But, folks, in addition to inheriting a failed MAGA Republican economy, we also confronted a global pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine, and that's driven the global inflation we see today. That's why it's so important that we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which I proposed from the beginning, but didn't get passed until this summer. This law will cut costs for families, help reduce inflation at the kitchen table. The way we always measured inflation—and my dad was a graceful, hard-working guy. He worked—he worked a lot, his whole life. And my dad used to say—he used to talk about whether inflation or—the situation of a family to have breathing room is: At the end of the month, when you paid all your bills, did you have a little bit left—just a little bit left? So there's more than one way—more than one way—to deal with the inflation to a family: to lower the price of the things they have to deal with, because that's what folks at home think about. How much of their monthly bills—how much do they have to pay for the necessities? This law is going to give them just a little more breathing room, as my dad would say. We pay more for our prescription drugs than any nation in the world. Well, for years, so many of us for a long time, and many of the unions in here—every one of the unions here—have been trying to fix this problem. For years, Big Pharma has blocked us in Medicare from negotiating drug prices. But not this year. We beat Big Pharma. We finally beat them, first time. Big Pharma lost. And, folks, now Medicare will have the power to do what so many Democrats and many Republicans in the past talked about doing: lowering prescription drug prices. They pay billions of dollars. They can negotiate lower prices like other countries do. And the seniors—we passed a law saying: Beginning in January, no senior, no matter what the cost of prescription drugs—cancer drugs, whatever drugs they have; and some of them can be $60-, $70-, $80,000 a year—no senior will have to pay, no matter what the cost of their drugs, more than $2,000 a year beginning in January. And if you're a—if you're on Medicare and you have diabetes, the cost of your insulin—instead of being 30 to 40 to 50 times more than the cost to make the insulin, it costs 10 bucks to make that insulin—10—and package it. But now you cannot charge any senior—and we should make it for everybody. They voted down the other piece. But every senior will not have to pay more than $35 a month for the cost of their insulin. We wanted to cut the cost of insulin for everyone—for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children who have type 1 diabetes. But look, folks, imagine being the parent of a child who had type 1 diabetes; you had no insurance, and you had no coverage. You have to look at that child and know—and know—that if he or she does not have access to that insulin, it will fundamentally affect their lives in ways that are going to be damaging for the rest of their lives. Imagine the feeling. My dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect."" And he'd always end by saying, ""It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" Well, guess what? The Republicans blocked limiting that cost to 35 bucks for kids. As I said, it only costs 10 bucks for that prescription that he made and packaged. Drug companies are charging families more than 30 times as much for that drug on a monthly basis. And a lot of people just can't do it. Imagine, as I said, being that mom and dad needing that insulin. It has to be—I was down in Virginia at a function. I met a mom who said they have to ration the insulin, be able—I mean, it's wrong. It's not who we are. We're going to fix that as well, I promise you. Folks, the bottom line: This law is going to lower energy costs as well. Gas prices—I know I got criticized for going into the stockpile. But guess what? Gas prices are down $1.30 a gallon. And in 41 States, plus the District of Columbia, the average gasoline price is less than $2.99. Look, the law makes the biggest investment ever. We invest in climate crisis, $369 billion to deal with the climate crisis. And it makes the Tax Code fairer. In 2020, 55 of the biggest corporations in the country paid zero dollars in Federal income taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. And they made $40 billion. It's not right. So we put a stop to it by enacting a corporate minimum tax of only—but only 15 percent. Today, the days of big, profitable corporations paying nothing in Federal income tax is over. And guess what? Every single Republican voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. When it actually comes to actually doing something about inflation, Republicans said no. And they said, time and again, that the first chance they get, they're going to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. And here's what else Republicans are, in terms of their fiscal recklessness. Donald Trump and the Republicans had no problem—— Audience member. Boo! ——had no problem enacting, in his 4 years, a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefitted the top 1 percent. And they didn't pay for a penny of it. And it massively increased the Federal deficit. Meanwhile—you know, we always say the Democrats are the big spenders? We brought down the deficit—$350 billion the first year and nearly $1.5 trillion this year. And the Inflation Reduction Act is going to reduce it another $300 billion because—over the next 10 years, because Medicare can reduce—can pay less for the drugs they have to buy for the seniors. So I don't want to hear it from Republicans. They're the ones who blew up the deficit. They're the ones—and we're the ones bringing it down. And now, thanks to the historic deficit reduction, we can afford to cancel $10,000 in student debt and $20,000 if you have a Pell grant for tens of millions of Americans making under $125,000. It's a gamechanger. And Republicans are already looking for their hand-picked judges to deny relief to those hard-working Americans. They will not succeed, in my view, but that's who they're looking for. And finally, with a straight face, Kevin McCarthy says that MAGA Republicans will restore faith in our elections. [Laughter] As we say in my faith, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" [Laughter] Restore—restore—faith in our elections? MAGA Republicans refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and the will of the people. Eighty-one million people voted Democrat for President last time. Even though they lost court case after court case after court case after court case after court case, even in front of Trump-appointed judges. And recount after recount proved the results were accurate. It's become a litmus test in their party to pledge loyalty to Donald Trump by buying into the ""big lie."" Now, I'm serious. You all see it on—all on television. Look, the fact is that a lot of them—I've had six Republican Senators who I've known for some time come to me—and I gave them my word I'd never mention names, and I never will—separately, telling me that they agree with this, that, or the other thing that I was proposing, but if I voted for it, it would cost them their election because they'd lose a primary. Well, you see what's happening. You see the MAGA Republican program being adapted by all these folks in the primary. And then once they get out of the primary, they're trying like hell to figure out how to get out from under that. [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. You can't let the integrity of our elections be undermined. Democracy can't survive. It cannot survive. Not a joke. It can't survive when one side believes there's only two outcomes to an election: Either they win, or they were cheated. [Laughter] That's not democracy. And that's where the vast majority of MAGA Republicans are today. They don't understand what every patriotic American knows: You can't love your country only when you win. Only when you win. So, folks, in just 46 days, democracy will be on the ballot. Americans will have to choose between the MAGA Republican platform who have embraced extremism and the ""big lie""; Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans who believe in the rule of law. Rejecting [respecting]* the will of the people and accepting the results of a fair and free election is what we're about, not what they're about. Let me close with this. As I said earlier, my dad used to say: ""Don't compare me to the Almighty. Compare me to the alternative."" This November, you have to choose to be a nation of hope, unity, and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and darkness. I believe America will move forward to the future—a future of possibilities; a future in which we can build, dream, and hope. I know we can, because I know this nation like you do. I know the American people. I know their courage. I know their hearts. I know our history. That's why—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. And those of you who know me, no one ever doubts I mean what I say; the problem is, I sometimes say all that I mean. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, I've never been more optimistic. We're the only country in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into it. It's not just about building back to what it was before. We have a chance to build back in a way to make it better for everybody. Everybody. And I want to get back to the time when I'm debating Republicans or conservatives, heck, but believe in the institutions—believe in the institutions; have a fair and square fight about what we're doing; think the Court and the—and the Congress and the Presidency are independent branches of government and should be treated with respect. That's what I'm looking forward to. We've just got to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—there's nothing—beyond our capacity, not a single thing we can't do when we do it together. And the way to do that is start with the unions, to do it together, together, together. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. [The President turned to face audience members standing behind him and addressed them as follows.] And I should have started off by saying, ""Excuse my back when I'm speaking."" [Laughter] I apologize. Thank you all very much. And God bless you all. Let's keep this going. Thank you.","['tell', 'crowd', 'talk', 'home', 'fact', 'youve', 'got', 'union', 'standing', 'unions', 'ill', 'tell', 'man', 'seat', 'seats', 'look', 'dajsha', 'shes', 'pretty', 'someone', 'college',

Everybody wants to make it a referendum, but it's a choice between two vastly different visions for America—significantly different."", 'Democrats are building a better America for everyone with an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out, where everyone does well. Republicans are doubling down on their mega MAGA trickle-down economics that benefits the very wealthy, failed the country before, and will fail it again if they win.', ""Democrats are lowering your everyday costs like prescription drugs, health care premiums, energy bills, and gas prices. Folks, Republicans have made it clear—at least they're being honest around this time; they're telling exactly what they want to do if they win—they're going to increase everyday cost."", ""Democrats are making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay not their fair share, but at least a bigger share than they've been paying. Fifteen percent is not a fair share, but it's a bigger share.

Let's get that straight now, okay? We're investing in all of America, reducing everyday costs while also lowering the deficit at the same time. Republicans are fiscally reckless, pushing tax cuts for the very wealthy that aren't paid for, and exploiting [exploding]* the deficit that is making inflation worse."", ""Look, folks, Democrats are going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Republicans have been very clear: They've stated boldly that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare and to the point that they'll shut down the Government, they say, and send the Nation into default, which raises prices for everyone, if we do not cut Social Security and Medicare. I ain't gonna do it."", ""We're going to protect—[applause].

We inherited a nation in crisis, the pandemic with no end, an economy on the brink, a national debt that increased—they increased in their short time by $8 trillion [$2 trillion],* and because of the inaction of incompetence of—the COVID was running and—ruining American lives."", ""Look at how far we've come. Twenty months ago, COVID ruled our lives. Today, infections are down 80 percent from when we took office; deaths are down 90 percent.

We went from 2 million to 633 million shots administered in people's arms."", ""And something that's going unnoticed, but I'm going to keep reminding people: Republicans in Congress are still preventing funding we need to stay vigilant and ahead of the next virus. They've refused the funding. But we not—we're not going to relent. We're not going to relent. We haven't relented. We won't do it."", 'Together, we carried out one of the biggest public health efforts in the history of this country. Twenty months ago, the economy was in ruins. Trump is the first President since Herbert Hoover—this is a fact—since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the course of his Presidency. Fewer jobs when he left than when he came to office. We created, with your help, 10 million new jobs so far.', 'When Trump and the Republicans left office, unemployment was 6.4 percent. We got it down to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low.', 'On his watch, literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses were closing. They make up 50 percent of the economy, these small businesses. Today, we have the highest number of people applying to start small businesses than ever during an economic recovery—ever, ever, ever.', ""And you all know I was determined, with your help, to bring back manufacturing, back to the United States, instead of companies going overseas for cheaper labor. On Trump's watch, American manufacturing was hollowed out."", 'On my watch, ""Made in America"" isn\'t just a slogan, it\'s a reality. A reality.

And we're just getting started."", ""You know, we had—we had Infrastructure Week, and it kept—kept having it and having it, and nothing happened. [Laughter] Now we've got Infrastructure Decade. We've got enough money to do this for a decade.

It's a little solace, but we have a lower inflation rate than most any nation in the—any other nation in the world. That's why I'm determined to reduce the burden on working and middle class folks by bringing down the costs of everyday things they have to work their families through."", ""It's not just food and energy, which is critical—and we brought down the cost of energy—but prescription drugs, health care costs, and so much more. We finally did something with these things, even without receiving a single, solitary Republican vote. Not one. Not one."", ""After decades of trying, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate for lower drug prices. In the United States, we pay more—we pay more—for prescription drugs than any advanced nation in the world for the exact same prescription made by the same company. For years, many of us have been trying to get this done, but Big Pharma had scores of lobbyists and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block us. We tried and tried, but finally we beat Big Pharma. We beat them. And that's a big deal. I've been trying to do that since your age. [Laughter] Finally."", ""And the results are consequential. We're putting—for example, some of you have grandpops and grandmoms and moms and dads who have serious health care problems and need prescriptions that cost a lot of money. Well, guess what? We're placing a $2,000 cap—this is for Medicare—anybody on Medicare. You're not going to ever have to pay—even if your bills are $20,000 for prescription drugs—you don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year. And some of the—some of the cancer drugs—as much as $14,000."", ""And you know, no one—no one on Medicare—no one on Medicare is going to have to pay more than $2,000, no matter what their expense is, no matter how much their prescriptions cost. Look, $2,000 is a limit you're going to have to pay. Imagine what burden that takes off of people. Imagine the people who are rationing what they have to do because they have family obligations."", ""And our—for our seniors on Medicare with diabetes, we've capped the cost of insulin—get this—at $35 a month instead of 30 times that amount. There are tens of thousands of Americans with diabetes struggling to pay for the insulin and badly need it to stay alive and to stay healthy, including hundreds of thousands of young children with type 2 diabetes."", ""But you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—T-E-N—dollars. Ten. It's outrageous. So we wanted to cap it for everyone, including—not just for those on Medicare, for everyone."", ""I'll hold up a second here. I was in Virginia not long ago, talking about the—capping the costs. And a lady stood up and said she had two children; both had type 2 diabetes. They had to share their insulin. They couldn't afford it because it was costing—I forget the number they had; I think it was 600 bucks a month. She had no insurance."", 'How do you look at your child—not a joke. My dad used to say, ""Everybody is entitled to have dignity."" How do you look at your child knowing you can\'t afford—can\'t afford—something that\'s basic to their health because it costs so much money?', ""We wanted to cap that cost for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children with type 1 [type 2]* diabetes, but Republicans blocked it. We got the Medicare piece through, but they blocked it for everybody else. But guess what? We're going to get it next time out. No, we are."", ""We also locked in savings on health insurance premiums for the Affordable Care Act. Because of what we did earlier, in the first piece of legislation we passed, a family of four—it would reduce their costs to $2,400 a year if they were on Medicare—excuse me, on the—Obamacare. Well, guess what? We were able to only do it for 800 bucks a family now, but it's still a lot of money. That's the limit. That's gone as well if Republicans get their way."", ""As a matter of fact, they wanted to get rid of the entire Affordable Care Act. They're making it again. And by the way, anyone with a preexisting condition who can't afford expensive insurance, the only reason you have coverage is because of the Affordable Care Act. Only reason."", ""You know, I know it doesn't matter to an audience—a young audience like you all, but we passed the biggest investment in climate ever to save the environment. And by the way—[applause]—because of your talking. I really mean it. Not only are we going to save homeowners thousands of dollars a year because they're going to get these tax credits for what they're doing and weatherizing their homes and a whole range of other things, but more efficient appliances, more efficient vehicles, working with utility companies to produce more low-cost, home-grown energy, like solar, wind, and clean hydrogen, which will mean lower utility bills for tens of millions of Americans."", 'Look, folks, let me say it again: We\'re doing all of this in a fiscally responsible way. Every time I talk about the cost of these things, they—""There goes that big-spendin\' Democrat Biden again."" [Laughter] Well, guess what the big-spendin\' Democrat Biden did? The deficit fell by $1.4 trillion this year. Cut the deficit in half. And that follows a drop last year of $350 billion.', ""And by the way—and because we're finally ensuring corporations begin to pay their fair share, we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, we're going to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years by another $250 billion."", ""Look, folks, a big part of that is because we're finally making the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share."", ""In 2020, 55 of the wealthiest corporations in the Fortune 500 paid zero in Federal taxes, and they made $40 billion. Well, thanks to Democrats in Congress, I signed into law a 15-percent corporate minimum tax. Just 15 percent. And by the way, I'm keeping my campaign commitment I made when I ran. No one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in Federal taxes. And they haven't."", ""And because of the number of actions I've taken, we've taken—and it's going to take too long to go into detail—but guess what? Gas prices are coming down despite the—despite Putin's invasion of Ukraine. They're down $1.20 since this summer, and just this week, they fell another 10 cents. And we're going to continue to insist the oil companies pass on the savings from lower price of a barrel of oil to a lower price for consumers at the pump."", ""Folks, I've said from the beginning that my objective is to build an economy from the bottom up, giving everyone a fair chance. When we do that, everybody does well. The poor have a ladder up, the middle class gets ahead, and the wealthy still do very, very well."", 'Now, ask what\'s the Republican plan. Not a joke. When you\'re on—if you\'re with a friend who has a different point of view, say: ""Okay, you don\'t like what we\'re for. Tell me what the Republicans are for. What\'s their platform?"" Not a joke. What are they running on? If they win, what do they say they\'ll do?', ""Well, I have to hand it to it. As I said, they're saying it out loud. They're so confident they're going to win they're saying this without an ounce of shame. Just listen to—and let's name names. Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader of the House, and fellow—and his fellow MAGA Republicans say their number-one priority if they win control of the Congress will do the following: give the power we just gave to Medicare for lower drug packs—for lower drug prices back to Big Pharma and raise drug prices."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No—by the way, I know this sounds like it—it's almost like they're making it up. But this is what they're saying. This is what will happen: the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs for seniors—gone. Gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors that we passed in the Inflation Reduction Act—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 a year for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act—gone."", ""And of course, they're still determined to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. That means an end to the protections for tens of millions of people who can't afford health insurance because they have a preexisting condition. That's gone as well if the Republicans get their way. The most aggressive action to deal with global warming—gone. The corporate minimum tax I just signed into law—gone."", 'Look, you know Republicans love to call Democrats ""big spenders"" and claim that we are—we are for—and they claim they\'re for less Government spending. Well, give me a little break here. Just look at the facts. The Federal deficit went up every single, solitary year in the Trump administration. Went up every year. It went up before the pandemic. It went up during the pandemic. It went up every single year on his watch.', 'And one big reason for that is, he—they voted for a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans. And it racked up significant deficit because not a penny was paid for.', ""Now Republicans in Congress are doubling down on their mega-MAGA commitment to implode the deficit again. Just last week, Republicans' leaders said if they get their way, they're going to extend the Trump tax cuts, which go out of existence in 2 years."", ""Folks, put the entire Republican plan all together and they would add $3 trillion to the deficit. Three trillion. That's their plan. Massive deficits are reckless and irresponsible."", 'The Republican plan is to make inflation—will make inflation worse, not reduce it.', ""Let's talk about Senator Rick Scott, the Senator from Florida——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', '[At this point, the President raised his eyebrows and smirked at the audience.]', ""The President. ——[laughter]—who's in charge of electing Republicans to take control of the United States Senate. His plan is to put—and he put it out in writing—Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. That means every 5 years, Congress will have to vote to cut, reduce, completely eliminate, or make no changes in Social Security and Medicare. But they're going to have to vote every 5 years."", 'Then along came—there used to be a song. Anyway. [Laughter] Then along came Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. Not a joke. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep the program, it goes away. It goes away. Not just Social Security and Medicare; he wants to put veterans' benefits and everything else on the same budget at risk."", 'Hear this closely: The Republicans have made it clear that if they win control of the Congress, they will shut down the Government, refuse to pay our bills, and it will be the first time in our history America will default unless I yield and cut Social Security and Medicare. Flat-out saying that.', ""In order to cut Social Security and Medicare, they're threatening to default on the Federal debt. There's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos, more inflation, and more damage to the American economy than this."", ""Think about it: Republicans are determined to hold the economy hostage. Either give in to their demands on Social Security and Medicare, which millions of Americans rely on and earned and paid for, or Republicans are going to crash the economy. Let me be clear: I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare. No matter how hard they—I'm never going to give in. It's outrageous."", ""And by the way, I know from experience, in our last administration, even when they threatened—even though I was asked to settle on New Year's Eve day—settle this—a similar deal with the last Republican leader, we were able to succeed and not default. But guess what? Our credit rating went down anyway because we were risking and playing with the debt. It's irresponsible."", ""Here's one more thing: I kept my commitment to help ease the burden on student debt for working and middle class families—exactly 1 year ago. And 1 week ago, we launched applications where folks could apply. Twenty-two million of you applied for this lifesaving—22 million in 1 week. In 1 week."", 'And the Republican response? ""Sue the Federal Government and block that relief.""', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, that's what they've done. I mean, think about this. That's mega MAGA trickle-down politics in the extreme."", ""I'll never apologize for helping working- and middle-class folks and Americans as they recover from the pandemic, especially not the same Republicans officials who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthy that wasn't paid for. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it from these guys."", 'Look, folks—and by the way, if I can divert for another second, the same people in the Congress who are really hollering at me, saying I\'m wasting money allowing you, if you had a student—if you had a Pell grant, to get another, you know, debt relief from your—debt up to—and by the way, the average person getting this debt relief makes less than 75 grand a year, okay? They say that\'s ""outrageous.""', ""But you know the program where you allowed people—the PPP program—to get money back if their business were in trouble? Well, you have—I think it's four or five Republicans who are published in the print, in the paper, who ranged—got from $2.1 million of relief to $187 million—I forget the exact number—for—and they made no apologies for that. They thought it's okay for them to get that relief for their business, but you breaking your neck and getting caught in the middle of crisis, you can't get any relief for the debt. And guess who's going to grow the economy more? An educated public or those guys? [Laughter]"", ""Folks, look, I don't know who they think they are. You know, that's the whole mega-MAGA trickle-down policies: Give Big Pharma the power to increase drug prices.

Threaten the very foundation of the American economy—that if we don't meet their demands, they're going to shut the place down. And then, they talk about inflation. Everything they'll do is going to make inflation worse."", ""Folks, 15 days. Fifteen days. The choice couldn't be clearer. The stakes couldn't be higher.

Not a joke."", ""But your generation is not going to be ignored. You're not going to be shunned. You're not going to be silent. Just look at what happens when you speak out.

Biden,2024,0.0,"Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Thank you. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Please have a—take a seat, if you have one. I came today for two reasons. The first, and maybe most important, to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. If we get people out to vote, we win. If we get people out to vote, we win. And you're getting them out to vote. There's a little babe over there who's not so sure about all this. [Laughter] But she seems okay so far. [Laughter] Any rate—and what I want to talk about—I want to make what I think is the most important closing argument to make: I've been in to about 30, 31 districts—or 31 places, going to a bunch between now and the election day. And you know, I can't think of a more consequential election that I've been involved in and we've been involved in. You know, whether we maintain control of the Senate and the House is a big deal. And so far, we're running against the tide, and we're beating the tide. But we just have 15 days until one of the most important elections in our lifetime. And it's going to shape the way this country looks like for the coming decade, for real. Now the polls have been all over the place. First of all, if you speak to most pollsters, they're not sure anymore—not about the outcome, but about polling. [Laughter] No, I'm not being facetious. It's awful hard to do it these days. It's awful hard to do it these days. ""Republicans ahead."" ""Democrats ahead."" ""Republicans ahead."" But it's going to close, I think, with seeing one more shift: ""Democrats ahead"" in the closing days. So, look, the last couple weeks—I don't pay attention to anything having to do with the polls, I just pay attention to what's happening on the phone, and we're knocking on doors. I'm here to deliver what I believe is a closing argument about what we need to do in the next 15 days to make a victory assured and make it clear that this election is a referendum—it's not a referendum, I should say; it's a choice. Everybody wants to make it a referendum, but it's a choice between two vastly different visions for America—significantly different. Democrats are building a better America for everyone with an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out, where everyone does well. Republicans are doubling down on their mega MAGA trickle-down economics that benefits the very wealthy, failed the country before, and will fail it again if they win. Democrats are lowering your everyday costs like prescription drugs, health care premiums, energy bills, and gas prices. Folks, Republicans have made it clear—at least they're being honest around this time; they're telling exactly what they want to do if they win—they're going to increase everyday cost. Democrats are making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay not their fair share, but at least a bigger share than they've been paying. Fifteen percent is not a fair share, but it's a bigger share. And Republicans will allow some of the biggest corporations to go back to paying zero—zero—in Federal taxes, after having made $40 billion, leaving the burden to teachers, nurses, firefighters, working folks to pay more of their fair share to keep things going. We, the Democrats, are the ones that are fiscally responsible. Let's get that straight now, okay? We're investing in all of America, reducing everyday costs while also lowering the deficit at the same time. Republicans are fiscally reckless, pushing tax cuts for the very wealthy that aren't paid for, and exploiting [exploding]* the deficit that is making inflation worse. Look, folks, Democrats are going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Republicans have been very clear: They've stated boldly that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare and to the point that they'll shut down the Government, they say, and send the Nation into default, which raises prices for everyone, if we do not cut Social Security and Medicare. I ain't gonna do it. We're going to protect—[applause]. Democrats are going to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms like the right to choose, the right to privacy, the right to vote—our very democracy. Republicans have already introduced legislation that will ban abortion with no exceptions to rape or incest or the life of the mother, in many places. At the same time, Republicans are threatening to take away the constitutional right to marry the person you love. Just look at the facts. You don't need to imagine anything this time around. Look at what they're saying. And they're saying it out loud, for everybody to hear. Now, let's go back and see what we inherited from Trump and the MAGA Republicans when we won the election that—when we came to office. We inherited a nation in crisis, the pandemic with no end, an economy on the brink, a national debt that increased—they increased in their short time by $8 trillion [$2 trillion],* and because of the inaction of incompetence of—the COVID was running and—ruining American lives. Look at how far we've come. Twenty months ago, COVID ruled our lives. Today, infections are down 80 percent from when we took office; deaths are down 90 percent. And we did it together, one of the biggest public health efforts ever undertaken in the United States of America. We went from 2 million to 633 million shots administered in people's arms. And something that's going unnoticed, but I'm going to keep reminding people: Republicans in Congress are still preventing funding we need to stay vigilant and ahead of the next virus. They've refused the funding. But we not—we're not going to relent. We're not going to relent. We haven't relented. We won't do it. Together, we carried out one of the biggest public health efforts in the history of this country. Twenty months ago, the economy was in ruins. Trump is the first President since Herbert Hoover—this is a fact—since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the course of his Presidency. Fewer jobs when he left than when he came to office. We created, with your help, 10 million new jobs so far. When Trump and the Republicans left office, unemployment was 6.4 percent. We got it down to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low. On his watch, literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses were closing. They make up 50 percent of the economy, these small businesses. Today, we have the highest number of people applying to start small businesses than ever during an economic recovery—ever, ever, ever. And you all know I was determined, with your help, to bring back manufacturing, back to the United States, instead of companies going overseas for cheaper labor. On Trump's watch, American manufacturing was hollowed out. On my watch, ""Made in America"" isn't just a slogan, it's a reality. A reality. Seven hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in advanced technologies, with companies like IBM and Intel investing billions of dollars to build industries of the future here in America. Later this week, I'm going up to Syracuse, New York, where I went to graduate school and my deceased wife was from; you know, where the little company called Micron is investing $100 billion to build semiconductors, the biggest investment of its kind in our history. We passed the most consequential infrastructure bill since Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. We're building our roads, bridges, ports, airports; delivering clean water, high-speed internet to every American. And we're just getting started. You know, we had—we had Infrastructure Week, and it kept—kept having it and having it, and nothing happened. [Laughter] Now we've got Infrastructure Decade. We've got enough money to do this for a decade. We're going to create tens of thousands of jobs and making our companies more competitive worldwide. At the same time, we know—we know—a lot of folks are struggling with inflation driven by Putin's war in Ukraine and the global pandemic. It's a little solace, but we have a lower inflation rate than most any nation in the—any other nation in the world. That's why I'm determined to reduce the burden on working and middle class folks by bringing down the costs of everyday things they have to work their families through. It's not just food and energy, which is critical—and we brought down the cost of energy—but prescription drugs, health care costs, and so much more. We finally did something with these things, even without receiving a single, solitary Republican vote. Not one. Not one. After decades of trying, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate for lower drug prices. In the United States, we pay more—we pay more—for prescription drugs than any advanced nation in the world for the exact same prescription made by the same company. For years, many of us have been trying to get this done, but Big Pharma had scores of lobbyists and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block us. We tried and tried, but finally we beat Big Pharma. We beat them. And that's a big deal. I've been trying to do that since your age. [Laughter] Finally. And the results are consequential. We're putting—for example, some of you have grandpops and grandmoms and moms and dads who have serious health care problems and need prescriptions that cost a lot of money. Well, guess what? We're placing a $2,000 cap—this is for Medicare—anybody on Medicare. You're not going to ever have to pay—even if your bills are $20,000 for prescription drugs—you don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year. And some of the—some of the cancer drugs—as much as $14,000. And you know, no one—no one on Medicare—no one on Medicare is going to have to pay more than $2,000, no matter what their expense is, no matter how much their prescriptions cost. Look, $2,000 is a limit you're going to have to pay. Imagine what burden that takes off of people. Imagine the people who are rationing what they have to do because they have family obligations. And our—for our seniors on Medicare with diabetes, we've capped the cost of insulin—get this—at $35 a month instead of 30 times that amount. There are tens of thousands of Americans with diabetes struggling to pay for the insulin and badly need it to stay alive and to stay healthy, including hundreds of thousands of young children with type 2 diabetes. But you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—T-E-N—dollars. Ten. It's outrageous. So we wanted to cap it for everyone, including—not just for those on Medicare, for everyone. I'll hold up a second here. I was in Virginia not long ago, talking about the—capping the costs. And a lady stood up and said she had two children; both had type 2 diabetes. They had to share their insulin. They couldn't afford it because it was costing—I forget the number they had; I think it was 600 bucks a month. She had no insurance. How do you look at your child—not a joke. My dad used to say, ""Everybody is entitled to have dignity."" How do you look at your child knowing you can't afford—can't afford—something that's basic to their health because it costs so much money? We wanted to cap that cost for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children with type 1 [type 2]* diabetes, but Republicans blocked it. We got the Medicare piece through, but they blocked it for everybody else. But guess what? We're going to get it next time out. No, we are. We also locked in savings on health insurance premiums for the Affordable Care Act. Because of what we did earlier, in the first piece of legislation we passed, a family of four—it would reduce their costs to $2,400 a year if they were on Medicare—excuse me, on the—Obamacare. Well, guess what? We were able to only do it for 800 bucks a family now, but it's still a lot of money. That's the limit. That's gone as well if Republicans get their way. As a matter of fact, they wanted to get rid of the entire Affordable Care Act. They're making it again. And by the way, anyone with a preexisting condition who can't afford expensive insurance, the only reason you have coverage is because of the Affordable Care Act. Only reason. You know, I know it doesn't matter to an audience—a young audience like you all, but we passed the biggest investment in climate ever to save the environment. And by the way—[applause]—because of your talking. I really mean it. Not only are we going to save homeowners thousands of dollars a year because they're going to get these tax credits for what they're doing and weatherizing their homes and a whole range of other things, but more efficient appliances, more efficient vehicles, working with utility companies to produce more low-cost, home-grown energy, like solar, wind, and clean hydrogen, which will mean lower utility bills for tens of millions of Americans. Look, folks, let me say it again: We're doing all of this in a fiscally responsible way. Every time I talk about the cost of these things, they—""There goes that big-spendin' Democrat Biden again."" [Laughter] Well, guess what the big-spendin' Democrat Biden did? The deficit fell by $1.4 trillion this year. Cut the deficit in half. And that follows a drop last year of $350 billion. And by the way—and because we're finally ensuring corporations begin to pay their fair share, we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, we're going to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years by another $250 billion. Look, folks, a big part of that is because we're finally making the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. In 2020, 55 of the wealthiest corporations in the Fortune 500 paid zero in Federal taxes, and they made $40 billion. Well, thanks to Democrats in Congress, I signed into law a 15-percent corporate minimum tax. Just 15 percent. And by the way, I'm keeping my campaign commitment I made when I ran. No one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in Federal taxes. And they haven't. And because of the number of actions I've taken, we've taken—and it's going to take too long to go into detail—but guess what? Gas prices are coming down despite the—despite Putin's invasion of Ukraine. They're down $1.20 since this summer, and just this week, they fell another 10 cents. And we're going to continue to insist the oil companies pass on the savings from lower price of a barrel of oil to a lower price for consumers at the pump. Folks, I've said from the beginning that my objective is to build an economy from the bottom up, giving everyone a fair chance. When we do that, everybody does well. The poor have a ladder up, the middle class gets ahead, and the wealthy still do very, very well. Now, ask what's the Republican plan. Not a joke. When you're on—if you're with a friend who has a different point of view, say: ""Okay, you don't like what we're for. Tell me what the Republicans are for. What's their platform?"" Not a joke. What are they running on? If they win, what do they say they'll do? Well, I have to hand it to it. As I said, they're saying it out loud. They're so confident they're going to win they're saying this without an ounce of shame. Just listen to—and let's name names. Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader of the House, and fellow—and his fellow MAGA Republicans say their number-one priority if they win control of the Congress will do the following: give the power we just gave to Medicare for lower drug packs—for lower drug prices back to Big Pharma and raise drug prices. Audience members. Boo! The President. No—by the way, I know this sounds like it—it's almost like they're making it up. But this is what they're saying. This is what will happen: the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs for seniors—gone. Gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors that we passed in the Inflation Reduction Act—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 a year for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they're still determined to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. That means an end to the protections for tens of millions of people who can't afford health insurance because they have a preexisting condition. That's gone as well if the Republicans get their way. The most aggressive action to deal with global warming—gone. The corporate minimum tax I just signed into law—gone. Look, you know Republicans love to call Democrats ""big spenders"" and claim that we are—we are for—and they claim they're for less Government spending. Well, give me a little break here. Just look at the facts. The Federal deficit went up every single, solitary year in the Trump administration. Went up every year. It went up before the pandemic. It went up during the pandemic. It went up every single year on his watch. And one big reason for that is, he—they voted for a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans. And it racked up significant deficit because not a penny was paid for. Now Republicans in Congress are doubling down on their mega-MAGA commitment to implode the deficit again. Just last week, Republicans' leaders said if they get their way, they're going to extend the Trump tax cuts, which go out of existence in 2 years. Folks, put the entire Republican plan all together and they would add $3 trillion to the deficit. Three trillion. That's their plan. Massive deficits are reckless and irresponsible. The Republican plan is to make inflation—will make inflation worse, not reduce it. Let's talk about Senator Rick Scott, the Senator from Florida—— Audience members. Boo! [At this point, the President raised his eyebrows and smirked at the audience.] The President. ——[laughter]—who's in charge of electing Republicans to take control of the United States Senate. His plan is to put—and he put it out in writing—Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. That means every 5 years, Congress will have to vote to cut, reduce, completely eliminate, or make no changes in Social Security and Medicare. But they're going to have to vote every 5 years. Then along came—there used to be a song. Anyway. [Laughter] Then along came Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Audience members. Boo! The President. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. Not a joke. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep the program, it goes away. It goes away. Not just Social Security and Medicare; he wants to put veterans' benefits and everything else on the same budget at risk. Hear this closely: The Republicans have made it clear that if they win control of the Congress, they will shut down the Government, refuse to pay our bills, and it will be the first time in our history America will default unless I yield and cut Social Security and Medicare. Flat-out saying that. In order to cut Social Security and Medicare, they're threatening to default on the Federal debt. There's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos, more inflation, and more damage to the American economy than this. Think about it: Republicans are determined to hold the economy hostage. Either give in to their demands on Social Security and Medicare, which millions of Americans rely on and earned and paid for, or Republicans are going to crash the economy. Let me be clear: I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare. No matter how hard they—I'm never going to give in. It's outrageous. And by the way, I know from experience, in our last administration, even when they threatened—even though I was asked to settle on New Year's Eve day—settle this—a similar deal with the last Republican leader, we were able to succeed and not default. But guess what? Our credit rating went down anyway because we were risking and playing with the debt. It's irresponsible. Here's one more thing: I kept my commitment to help ease the burden on student debt for working and middle class families—exactly 1 year ago. And 1 week ago, we launched applications where folks could apply. Twenty-two million of you applied for this lifesaving—22 million in 1 week. In 1 week. And the Republican response? ""Sue the Federal Government and block that relief."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, that's what they've done. I mean, think about this. That's mega MAGA trickle-down politics in the extreme. I'll never apologize for helping working- and middle-class folks and Americans as they recover from the pandemic, especially not the same Republicans officials who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthy that wasn't paid for. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it from these guys. Look, folks—and by the way, if I can divert for another second, the same people in the Congress who are really hollering at me, saying I'm wasting money allowing you, if you had a student—if you had a Pell grant, to get another, you know, debt relief from your—debt up to—and by the way, the average person getting this debt relief makes less than 75 grand a year, okay? They say that's ""outrageous."" But you know the program where you allowed people—the PPP program—to get money back if their business were in trouble? Well, you have—I think it's four or five Republicans who are published in the print, in the paper, who ranged—got from $2.1 million of relief to $187 million—I forget the exact number—for—and they made no apologies for that. They thought it's okay for them to get that relief for their business, but you breaking your neck and getting caught in the middle of crisis, you can't get any relief for the debt. And guess who's going to grow the economy more? An educated public or those guys? [Laughter] Folks, look, I don't know who they think they are. You know, that's the whole mega-MAGA trickle-down policies: Give Big Pharma the power to increase drug prices. Cut taxes for the wealthy, but cut Social Security—I mean, and cut Social Security and Medicare for seniors. That's—[inaudible]—trade on cuts. Threaten the very foundation of the American economy—that if we don't meet their demands, they're going to shut the place down. And then, they talk about inflation. Everything they'll do is going to make inflation worse. Folks, 15 days. Fifteen days. The choice couldn't be clearer. The stakes couldn't be higher. I know we can meet the moment. And on—the young people of this Nation, all of you in this room, let me say: I've always believed your generation—and I've said this from the beginning, and the reason I ran—represent the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in American history; and that we face an inflection point, one of those moments that comes along everywhere from two to six generations, where there is so much change happening technologically, politically, socially, environmentally that the decisions we make today are going to determine the future of our Nation and the future of your generation for the next 30 years. Not a joke. But your generation is not going to be ignored. You're not going to be shunned. You're not going to be silent. Just look at what happens when you speak out. Two years ago, perhaps many of you voted for the first election ever in your life. You understand the choice and the stakes. And because you exercised your vote, Donald Trump was the defeated former President of the United States. And you elected the highest ranking Black, Indian—with Indian background—woman in American history to be Vice President. And since then, with your help, you've delivered enormous progress to the Nation. The most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And by the way, I'm coming back; I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I mean it. Because of you all, we confirmed the first Black woman to ever serve on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. We've confirmed more appellate Federal judges who are Black women than all other Presidents combined. Let me be clear: Republicans are going to pass a national ban on abortion if they control the Congress. I'll veto it right away, but—but—if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January for all the Nation. You have that power with your vote. Let me close with this. Over the last few years, we've faced some of the most difficult challenge in our history, and we're making real progress, despite opposition from powerful special interests and extreme Republicans. And by the way, I served a long time in the Senate with a lot of conservative, decent, honorable Republicans who played by the rules. Sometimes they won; sometimes they lost. But they're decent, honorable people. And there's still some of them there. But this is a different breed of cat, this mega-MAGA Republican group. I really mean it. Fifteen days—15 days, we're going to make a choice about whether we go forward or backwards. It's that practical. The power is in your hands. I mean, you—it really is. You can do this. We just need to vote. Get out the vote. And if we do, I truly believe we're just getting started. And that's because I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today, and that's not hyperbole. I give you my word, I believe that. We have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we set out mind to it. Not a joke. You know, I was with Xi Jinping in the Tibetan Plateau—I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other leader in the world—over 78 hours' worth on the—8 or 10 of those on the phone and the rest in person over the last 12 years. And he looked at me and just had a simultaneous interpreter; he had one, and I had one. By the way, I turned in all my notes, by the way. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, he looked at me and he said—and I give you my word to this—he said, ""Can you explain America to me?"" I said, ""Yes, I can."" And I meant it, what I said. I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities."" It's the reason why we're sort of the—viewed as the ""ugly Americans."" We believe anything is possible when we do it together. Not a joke. Think about it. Anything is possible for us. There's nothing we've ever said, ""No, no, no, we can't do that."" We're the only nation in the last 400 years that's come out of crises stronger than we went into the crisis. And our diversity is one of those reasons. Folks, look, I really mean it: There's nothing beyond our capacity. And one of the things that I'm—worry about—and that's why I'm so counting on your generation, and I mean it from the bottom my heart; I give you my word as a Biden, I believe it—is that a lot of Americans began to wonder whether we can still do anything, whether we're still who we've always been. We are. And everybody thought I was nuts when I—when I had asked the question, if I could do one thing, what would you do? I'd do something that didn't answer any of the real questions we just had, but just demonstrate we can still do anything. If I could wave a wand, I'd cure cancer. Why? Because no one believes it can be done. But we're starting to do it. There's nothing beyond our capacity. I mean it. Not a joke. Not a joke. So, folks, look, you are the key, not just in what you're doing here on the phones, but your whole generation. You're the key whether we're going to get through all this. And if we get through it, we're going to be owing you for a long, long time. You will be able to tell your grandkids you did it. [Laughter] Y'all think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter] More is going to change in the next 10 years than changed in the last 50 years because of technology, because of a whole range of things. Things are moving so rapidly. So, every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And another voice would come out of the house—my grandma—who said, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Go spread the faith. Let's get this done. Vote. Vote. Vote.","Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Thank you. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Please have a—take a seat, if you have one. I came today for two reasons. The first, and maybe most important, to say thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. If we get people out to vote, we win. If we get people out to vote, we win. And you're getting them out to vote. There's a little babe over there who's not so sure about all this. [Laughter] But she seems okay so far. [Laughter] Any rate—and what I want to talk about—I want to make what I think is the most important closing argument to make: I've been in to about 30, 31 districts—or 31 places, going to a bunch between now and the election day. And you know, I can't think of a more consequential election that I've been involved in and we've been involved in. You know, whether we maintain control of the Senate and the House is a big deal. And so far, we're running against the tide, and we're beating the tide. But we just have 15 days until one of the most important elections in our lifetime. And it's going to shape the way this country looks like for the coming decade, for real. Now the polls have been all over the place. First of all, if you speak to most pollsters, they're not sure anymore—not about the outcome, but about polling. [Laughter] No, I'm not being facetious. It's awful hard to do it these days. It's awful hard to do it these days. ""Republicans ahead."" ""Democrats ahead."" ""Republicans ahead."" But it's going to close, I think, with seeing one more shift: ""Democrats ahead"" in the closing days. So, look, the last couple weeks—I don't pay attention to anything having to do with the polls, I just pay attention to what's happening on the phone, and we're knocking on doors. I'm here to deliver what I believe is a closing argument about what we need to do in the next 15 days to make a victory assured and make it clear that this election is a referendum—it's not a referendum, I should say; it's a choice. Everybody wants to make it a referendum, but it's a choice between two vastly different visions for America—significantly different. Democrats are building a better America for everyone with an economy that grows from the bottom up and the middle out, where everyone does well. Republicans are doubling down on their mega MAGA trickle-down economics that benefits the very wealthy, failed the country before, and will fail it again if they win. Democrats are lowering your everyday costs like prescription drugs, health care premiums, energy bills, and gas prices. Folks, Republicans have made it clear—at least they're being honest around this time; they're telling exactly what they want to do if they win—they're going to increase everyday cost. Democrats are making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay not their fair share, but at least a bigger share than they've been paying. Fifteen percent is not a fair share, but it's a bigger share. And Republicans will allow some of the biggest corporations to go back to paying zero—zero—in Federal taxes, after having made $40 billion, leaving the burden to teachers, nurses, firefighters, working folks to pay more of their fair share to keep things going. We, the Democrats, are the ones that are fiscally responsible. Let's get that straight now, okay? We're investing in all of America, reducing everyday costs while also lowering the deficit at the same time. Republicans are fiscally reckless, pushing tax cuts for the very wealthy that aren't paid for, and exploiting [exploding]* the deficit that is making inflation worse. Look, folks, Democrats are going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Republicans have been very clear: They've stated boldly that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare and to the point that they'll shut down the Government, they say, and send the Nation into default, which raises prices for everyone, if we do not cut Social Security and Medicare. I ain't gonna do it. We're going to protect—[applause]. Democrats are going to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms like the right to choose, the right to privacy, the right to vote—our very democracy. Republicans have already introduced legislation that will ban abortion with no exceptions to rape or incest or the life of the mother, in many places. At the same time, Republicans are threatening to take away the constitutional right to marry the person you love. Just look at the facts. You don't need to imagine anything this time around. Look at what they're saying. And they're saying it out loud, for everybody to hear. Now, let's go back and see what we inherited from Trump and the MAGA Republicans when we won the election that—when we came to office. We inherited a nation in crisis, the pandemic with no end, an economy on the brink, a national debt that increased—they increased in their short time by $8 trillion [$2 trillion],* and because of the inaction of incompetence of—the COVID was running and—ruining American lives. Look at how far we've come. Twenty months ago, COVID ruled our lives. Today, infections are down 80 percent from when we took office; deaths are down 90 percent. And we did it together, one of the biggest public health efforts ever undertaken in the United States of America. We went from 2 million to 633 million shots administered in people's arms. And something that's going unnoticed, but I'm going to keep reminding people: Republicans in Congress are still preventing funding we need to stay vigilant and ahead of the next virus. They've refused the funding. But we not—we're not going to relent. We're not going to relent. We haven't relented. We won't do it. Together, we carried out one of the biggest public health efforts in the history of this country. Twenty months ago, the economy was in ruins. Trump is the first President since Herbert Hoover—this is a fact—since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the course of his Presidency. Fewer jobs when he left than when he came to office. We created, with your help, 10 million new jobs so far. When Trump and the Republicans left office, unemployment was 6.4 percent. We got it down to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low. On his watch, literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses were closing. They make up 50 percent of the economy, these small businesses. Today, we have the highest number of people applying to start small businesses than ever during an economic recovery—ever, ever, ever. And you all know I was determined, with your help, to bring back manufacturing, back to the United States, instead of companies going overseas for cheaper labor. On Trump's watch, American manufacturing was hollowed out. On my watch, ""Made in America"" isn't just a slogan, it's a reality. A reality. Seven hundred thousand manufacturing jobs in advanced technologies, with companies like IBM and Intel investing billions of dollars to build industries of the future here in America. Later this week, I'm going up to Syracuse, New York, where I went to graduate school and my deceased wife was from; you know, where the little company called Micron is investing $100 billion to build semiconductors, the biggest investment of its kind in our history. We passed the most consequential infrastructure bill since Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. We're building our roads, bridges, ports, airports; delivering clean water, high-speed internet to every American. And we're just getting started. You know, we had—we had Infrastructure Week, and it kept—kept having it and having it, and nothing happened. [Laughter] Now we've got Infrastructure Decade. We've got enough money to do this for a decade. We're going to create tens of thousands of jobs and making our companies more competitive worldwide. At the same time, we know—we know—a lot of folks are struggling with inflation driven by Putin's war in Ukraine and the global pandemic. It's a little solace, but we have a lower inflation rate than most any nation in the—any other nation in the world. That's why I'm determined to reduce the burden on working and middle class folks by bringing down the costs of everyday things they have to work their families through. It's not just food and energy, which is critical—and we brought down the cost of energy—but prescription drugs, health care costs, and so much more. We finally did something with these things, even without receiving a single, solitary Republican vote. Not one. Not one. After decades of trying, we finally gave Medicare the power to negotiate for lower drug prices. In the United States, we pay more—we pay more—for prescription drugs than any advanced nation in the world for the exact same prescription made by the same company. For years, many of us have been trying to get this done, but Big Pharma had scores of lobbyists and spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block us. We tried and tried, but finally we beat Big Pharma. We beat them. And that's a big deal. I've been trying to do that since your age. [Laughter] Finally. And the results are consequential. We're putting—for example, some of you have grandpops and grandmoms and moms and dads who have serious health care problems and need prescriptions that cost a lot of money. Well, guess what? We're placing a $2,000 cap—this is for Medicare—anybody on Medicare. You're not going to ever have to pay—even if your bills are $20,000 for prescription drugs—you don't have to pay more than $2,000 a year. And some of the—some of the cancer drugs—as much as $14,000. And you know, no one—no one on Medicare—no one on Medicare is going to have to pay more than $2,000, no matter what their expense is, no matter how much their prescriptions cost. Look, $2,000 is a limit you're going to have to pay. Imagine what burden that takes off of people. Imagine the people who are rationing what they have to do because they have family obligations. And our—for our seniors on Medicare with diabetes, we've capped the cost of insulin—get this—at $35 a month instead of 30 times that amount. There are tens of thousands of Americans with diabetes struggling to pay for the insulin and badly need it to stay alive and to stay healthy, including hundreds of thousands of young children with type 2 diabetes. But you know how much it costs to make that insulin? Ten—T-E-N—dollars. Ten. It's outrageous. So we wanted to cap it for everyone, including—not just for those on Medicare, for everyone. I'll hold up a second here. I was in Virginia not long ago, talking about the—capping the costs. And a lady stood up and said she had two children; both had type 2 diabetes. They had to share their insulin. They couldn't afford it because it was costing—I forget the number they had; I think it was 600 bucks a month. She had no insurance. How do you look at your child—not a joke. My dad used to say, ""Everybody is entitled to have dignity."" How do you look at your child knowing you can't afford—can't afford—something that's basic to their health because it costs so much money? We wanted to cap that cost for everyone, including the hundreds of thousands of children with type 1 [type 2]* diabetes, but Republicans blocked it. We got the Medicare piece through, but they blocked it for everybody else. But guess what? We're going to get it next time out. No, we are. We also locked in savings on health insurance premiums for the Affordable Care Act. Because of what we did earlier, in the first piece of legislation we passed, a family of four—it would reduce their costs to $2,400 a year if they were on Medicare—excuse me, on the—Obamacare. Well, guess what? We were able to only do it for 800 bucks a family now, but it's still a lot of money. That's the limit. That's gone as well if Republicans get their way. As a matter of fact, they wanted to get rid of the entire Affordable Care Act. They're making it again. And by the way, anyone with a preexisting condition who can't afford expensive insurance, the only reason you have coverage is because of the Affordable Care Act. Only reason. You know, I know it doesn't matter to an audience—a young audience like you all, but we passed the biggest investment in climate ever to save the environment. And by the way—[applause]—because of your talking. I really mean it. Not only are we going to save homeowners thousands of dollars a year because they're going to get these tax credits for what they're doing and weatherizing their homes and a whole range of other things, but more efficient appliances, more efficient vehicles, working with utility companies to produce more low-cost, home-grown energy, like solar, wind, and clean hydrogen, which will mean lower utility bills for tens of millions of Americans. Look, folks, let me say it again: We're doing all of this in a fiscally responsible way. Every time I talk about the cost of these things, they—""There goes that big-spendin' Democrat Biden again."" [Laughter] Well, guess what the big-spendin' Democrat Biden did? The deficit fell by $1.4 trillion this year. Cut the deficit in half. And that follows a drop last year of $350 billion. And by the way—and because we're finally ensuring corporations begin to pay their fair share, we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices, we're going to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years by another $250 billion. Look, folks, a big part of that is because we're finally making the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. In 2020, 55 of the wealthiest corporations in the Fortune 500 paid zero in Federal taxes, and they made $40 billion. Well, thanks to Democrats in Congress, I signed into law a 15-percent corporate minimum tax. Just 15 percent. And by the way, I'm keeping my campaign commitment I made when I ran. No one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay a single additional penny in Federal taxes. And they haven't. And because of the number of actions I've taken, we've taken—and it's going to take too long to go into detail—but guess what? Gas prices are coming down despite the—despite Putin's invasion of Ukraine. They're down $1.20 since this summer, and just this week, they fell another 10 cents. And we're going to continue to insist the oil companies pass on the savings from lower price of a barrel of oil to a lower price for consumers at the pump. Folks, I've said from the beginning that my objective is to build an economy from the bottom up, giving everyone a fair chance. When we do that, everybody does well. The poor have a ladder up, the middle class gets ahead, and the wealthy still do very, very well. Now, ask what's the Republican plan. Not a joke. When you're on—if you're with a friend who has a different point of view, say: ""Okay, you don't like what we're for. Tell me what the Republicans are for. What's their platform?"" Not a joke. What are they running on? If they win, what do they say they'll do? Well, I have to hand it to it. As I said, they're saying it out loud. They're so confident they're going to win they're saying this without an ounce of shame. Just listen to—and let's name names. Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader of the House, and fellow—and his fellow MAGA Republicans say their number-one priority if they win control of the Congress will do the following: give the power we just gave to Medicare for lower drug packs—for lower drug prices back to Big Pharma and raise drug prices. Audience members. Boo! The President. No—by the way, I know this sounds like it—it's almost like they're making it up. But this is what they're saying. This is what will happen: the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs for seniors—gone. Gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors that we passed in the Inflation Reduction Act—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 a year for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they're still determined to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. That means an end to the protections for tens of millions of people who can't afford health insurance because they have a preexisting condition. That's gone as well if the Republicans get their way. The most aggressive action to deal with global warming—gone. The corporate minimum tax I just signed into law—gone. Look, you know Republicans love to call Democrats ""big spenders"" and claim that we are—we are for—and they claim they're for less Government spending. Well, give me a little break here. Just look at the facts. The Federal deficit went up every single, solitary year in the Trump administration. Went up every year. It went up before the pandemic. It went up during the pandemic. It went up every single year on his watch. And one big reason for that is, he—they voted for a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited the biggest corporations and the wealthiest Americans. And it racked up significant deficit because not a penny was paid for. Now Republicans in Congress are doubling down on their mega-MAGA commitment to implode the deficit again. Just last week, Republicans' leaders said if they get their way, they're going to extend the Trump tax cuts, which go out of existence in 2 years. Folks, put the entire Republican plan all together and they would add $3 trillion to the deficit. Three trillion. That's their plan. Massive deficits are reckless and irresponsible. The Republican plan is to make inflation—will make inflation worse, not reduce it. Let's talk about Senator Rick Scott, the Senator from Florida—— Audience members. Boo! [At this point, the President raised his eyebrows and smirked at the audience.] The President. ——[laughter]—who's in charge of electing Republicans to take control of the United States Senate. His plan is to put—and he put it out in writing—Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. That means every 5 years, Congress will have to vote to cut, reduce, completely eliminate, or make no changes in Social Security and Medicare. But they're going to have to vote every 5 years. Then along came—there used to be a song. Anyway. [Laughter] Then along came Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Audience members. Boo! The President. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. Not a joke. He wants to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep the program, it goes away. It goes away. Not just Social Security and Medicare; he wants to put veterans' benefits and everything else on the same budget at risk. Hear this closely: The Republicans have made it clear that if they win control of the Congress, they will shut down the Government, refuse to pay our bills, and it will be the first time in our history America will default unless I yield and cut Social Security and Medicare. Flat-out saying that. In order to cut Social Security and Medicare, they're threatening to default on the Federal debt. There's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos, more inflation, and more damage to the American economy than this. Think about it: Republicans are determined to hold the economy hostage. Either give in to their demands on Social Security and Medicare, which millions of Americans rely on and earned and paid for, or Republicans are going to crash the economy. Let me be clear: I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare. No matter how hard they—I'm never going to give in. It's outrageous. And by the way, I know from experience, in our last administration, even when they threatened—even though I was asked to settle on New Year's Eve day—settle this—a similar deal with the last Republican leader, we were able to succeed and not default. But guess what? Our credit rating went down anyway because we were risking and playing with the debt. It's irresponsible. Here's one more thing: I kept my commitment to help ease the burden on student debt for working and middle class families—exactly 1 year ago. And 1 week ago, we launched applications where folks could apply. Twenty-two million of you applied for this lifesaving—22 million in 1 week. In 1 week. And the Republican response? ""Sue the Federal Government and block that relief."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, that's what they've done. I mean, think about this. That's mega MAGA trickle-down politics in the extreme. I'll never apologize for helping working- and middle-class folks and Americans as they recover from the pandemic, especially not the same Republicans officials who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthy that wasn't paid for. I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it from these guys. Look, folks—and by the way, if I can divert for another second, the same people in the Congress who are really hollering at me, saying I'm wasting money allowing you, if you had a student—if you had a Pell grant, to get another, you know, debt relief from your—debt up to—and by the way, the average person getting this debt relief makes less than 75 grand a year, okay? They say that's ""outrageous."" But you know the program where you allowed people—the PPP program—to get money back if their business were in trouble? Well, you have—I think it's four or five Republicans who are published in the print, in the paper, who ranged—got from $2.1 million of relief to $187 million—I forget the exact number—for—and they made no apologies for that. They thought it's okay for them to get that relief for their business, but you breaking your neck and getting caught in the middle of crisis, you can't get any relief for the debt. And guess who's going to grow the economy more? An educated public or those guys? [Laughter] Folks, look, I don't know who they think they are. You know, that's the whole mega-MAGA trickle-down policies: Give Big Pharma the power to increase drug prices. Cut taxes for the wealthy, but cut Social Security—I mean, and cut Social Security and Medicare for seniors. That's—[inaudible]—trade on cuts. Threaten the very foundation of the American economy—that if we don't meet their demands, they're going to shut the place down. And then, they talk about inflation. Everything they'll do is going to make inflation worse. Folks, 15 days. Fifteen days. The choice couldn't be clearer. The stakes couldn't be higher. I know we can meet the moment. And on—the young people of this Nation, all of you in this room, let me say: I've always believed your generation—and I've said this from the beginning, and the reason I ran—represent the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in American history; and that we face an inflection point, one of those moments that comes along everywhere from two to six generations, where there is so much change happening technologically, politically, socially, environmentally that the decisions we make today are going to determine the future of our Nation and the future of your generation for the next 30 years. Not a joke. But your generation is not going to be ignored. You're not going to be shunned. You're not going to be silent. Just look at what happens when you speak out. Two years ago, perhaps many of you voted for the first election ever in your life. You understand the choice and the stakes. And because you exercised your vote, Donald Trump was the defeated former President of the United States. And you elected the highest ranking Black, Indian—with Indian background—woman in American history to be Vice President. And since then, with your help, you've delivered enormous progress to the Nation. The most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. And by the way, I'm coming back; I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I mean it. Because of you all, we confirmed the first Black woman to ever serve on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. We've confirmed more appellate Federal judges who are Black women than all other Presidents combined. Let me be clear: Republicans are going to pass a national ban on abortion if they control the Congress. I'll veto it right away, but—but—if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January for all the Nation. You have that power with your vote. Let me close with this. Over the last few years, we've faced some of the most difficult challenge in our history, and we're making real progress, despite opposition from powerful special interests and extreme Republicans. And by the way, I served a long time in the Senate with a lot of conservative, decent, honorable Republicans who played by the rules. Sometimes they won; sometimes they lost. But they're decent, honorable people. And there's still some of them there. But this is a different breed of cat, this mega-MAGA Republican group. I really mean it. Fifteen days—15 days, we're going to make a choice about whether we go forward or backwards. It's that practical. The power is in your hands. I mean, you—it really is. You can do this. We just need to vote. Get out the vote. And if we do, I truly believe we're just getting started. And that's because I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today, and that's not hyperbole. I give you my word, I believe that. We have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we set out mind to it. Not a joke. You know, I was with Xi Jinping in the Tibetan Plateau—I spent more time with Xi Jinping than any other leader in the world—over 78 hours' worth on the—8 or 10 of those on the phone and the rest in person over the last 12 years. And he looked at me and just had a simultaneous interpreter; he had one, and I had one. By the way, I turned in all my notes, by the way. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, he looked at me and he said—and I give you my word to this—he said, ""Can you explain America to me?"" I said, ""Yes, I can."" And I meant it, what I said. I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities."" It's the reason why we're sort of the—viewed as the ""ugly Americans."" We believe anything is possible when we do it together. Not a joke. Think about it. Anything is possible for us. There's nothing we've ever said, ""No, no, no, we can't do that."" We're the only nation in the last 400 years that's come out of crises stronger than we went into the crisis. And our diversity is one of those reasons. Folks, look, I really mean it: There's nothing beyond our capacity. And one of the things that I'm—worry about—and that's why I'm so counting on your generation, and I mean it from the bottom my heart; I give you my word as a Biden, I believe it—is that a lot of Americans began to wonder whether we can still do anything, whether we're still who we've always been. We are. And everybody thought I was nuts when I—when I had asked the question, if I could do one thing, what would you do? I'd do something that didn't answer any of the real questions we just had, but just demonstrate we can still do anything. If I could wave a wand, I'd cure cancer. Why? Because no one believes it can be done. But we're starting to do it. There's nothing beyond our capacity. I mean it. Not a joke. Not a joke. So, folks, look, you are the key, not just in what you're doing here on the phones, but your whole generation. You're the key whether we're going to get through all this. And if we get through it, we're going to be owing you for a long, long time. You will be able to tell your grandkids you did it. [Laughter] Y'all think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter] More is going to change in the next 10 years than changed in the last 50 years because of technology, because of a whole range of things. Things are moving so rapidly. So, every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And another voice would come out of the house—my grandma—who said, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Go spread the faith. Let's get this done. Vote. Vote. Vote.","['audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'whoa', 'whoa', 'whoa', 'audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'audience', 'members', 'lets',

Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. And you\'ve been—[laughter]. Well, as my mother would say, ""God love you all."" You got caught in the front pew. No way to stand, huh? Well, God love you. Well, thank you very much.', ""Look, Macarena, thanks for that introduction. It's great to be at Florida Memorial University, one of the Nation's great HBCUs. I'm a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University. Okay—it's pretty good, man."", 'Audience members. [Inaudible]', ""The President. Anyway. [Laughter] Anyway, look, you know, talking to students about my administration's plan to provide student loan relief for working and middle class folks. Talking about my historic commitment to HBCUs that included $5.8 billion in investment at HBCUs."", ""Well, let me tell you: One of the great ways to honor HBCUs' legacy is to vote, vote, vote. Look——"", 'Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! [Laughter]', ""The President. You can do it. I'm telling you, you can make the difference."", ""Last time in Florida—I was in Florida was almost a month ago, just after Hurricane Ian hit. We surveyed the damage on the ground in Fort Myers and the surrounding community areas by helicopter. The damage and destruction was historic and horrific. It was almost unimaginable. And I said then that it's going to take not weeks and months, but years to fully recover and rebuild."", ""But I gave the people of Florida my commitment to—this country's commitment that you will not go through this alone. We ain't going home. My administration has been following through on those commitments to get the people of Florida what they need as fast as we can and help you rebuild."", ""So far, $1.7 billion in assistance has gone to this State. We've set up 23 disaster recovery centers where survivors can register for help. And FEMA has performed over 180,000 home inspections."", ""The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved another $460 million for low-interest loans to business owners, renters, and homeowners. And like I said, this is just the beginning of our effort. We'll be with you every step of the way. We're not going home."", ""Folks, it's great to be with the next Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist. And great to be with the next U.S. Senator, Val Demings. I know them both really well."", ""Charlie—Charlie is a guy you know and trust. He's always, always working for you, fighting for working families like yours. It was great—he was a great Governor before, and he'd make an even greater Governor again because of who he's going to be replacing."", ""Folks, whether it's building an economy that works for everyone or keeping communities safe and protections and right to choose, Val—Chief Val Demings, she's the real deal, defined by one word: commitment. Commitment. She does what she says."", ""And, folks, she's fighting for seniors to protect their Social Security and Medicare. She literally put her life on the line to serve and protect the people of this State. And when it comes to public safety, she knows what it takes."", ""Folks, imagine Chief Demings on the beat in the United States Senate. I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. [Laughter] They ain't seen nothing yet. They haven't seen nothing yet. Oh, man, you've got a hell of a delegation."", 'And, folks, we need to elect Charlie and Val, and we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, including your outstanding Members of Congress, Debbie and Frederica and Sheila. If we do that, Florida is not going to be only a better place, so will America be.', ""Look, on a very serious note, that's why we're all here. That's why we're all here. Seven days. Seven days until the most important election in our lifetime. You've heard me say it before: We're at in inflection point in history. It comes about every five of six generations. So much has changed in America and around the world that the decisions we make—the decisions you make—over the next 2 to 3 years are going to determine the fate of this country—not a joke—for the next decade to two decades."", ""There's a lot at stake—a lot. But so much opportunity."", '[At this point, an audience member waved a piece of paper.]', ""Put the paper down. I'm not coming and getting it. Okay? All right? She's holding up a paper for—she wants to send me a letter here. [Laughter]"", ""Well, look, let's be real clear about one important thing: This election is not a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two vastly different visions for America."", ""I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out; an economy that rework—rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so poor folks have a chance, the middle class does better. And if they do that, the wealthy will still do very well. It's a fundamental shift in—that's what's working now."", ""Compared to the MAGA—mega MAGA, I call them—trickle-down economics that the Republicans offer these days. Folks, this ain't your father's Republican Party. This a different breed of cat."", ""Just look at the facts. When I took office, the economy was in ruins. My—this is not because of me; it's because of what I inherited. My predecessor was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs. He had fewer jobs when he left office than when he came to office. Last President that happened to was literally Herbert Hoover. And look, here's the deal: Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses had gone out of business, closed, bankrupt."", ""But today, we're in a better place: Ten million jobs created since I took office. A record in any administration. And over 700,000 manufacturing jobs with good pay."", ""Where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? I mean it. Think about it. Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5 percent, the lowest in 50 years. Black, Latino, and Asian by—communities, unemployment is way down; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses just since I've been in—5.4 million, the highest ever in American history."", ""Look, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the actions we've taken, gas prices are coming down here at home. They're down $1.25. I just passed a gas station on the way: $3.25 when it was 5 bucks when it took off this summer."", ""Ladies and gentleman, here's the deal: It's a difficult time. Americans across the country have stepped up and are doing the right thing, but not everyone. The oil industry is not doing the right thing. They haven't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people."", ""One by one, major oil companies have reported their profits for the last two quarters, I mean profits so high it's hard to believe. Last week, Shell Oil announced that it made $9.5 billion in profit in 3 months—the third quarter——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. ——9.5. That's almost twice as much as they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third quarter profits were $18.7 billion——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. ——nearly triple what Exxon made last year. The most it's made in its entire 152-year history. In the last 6 months, while the rest of the country is going through hell, six of the largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profits. A hundred billion dollars in less than 200 days. It's outrageous."", ""And these companies are taking the average profits they've been making by refining oil over the last 20 years. If they were doing that instead of the outrageous profits they're making today, it could pass on the rest of us—the consumers—the price of gas would be down another 50 cents. They're the facts. Instead, they're buying back their own stock because that's how the CEOs get paid. They're giving the profits to shareholders—outrageous profits—and the windfalls of war."", 'Yesterday I made it clear the industry has a choice: Either begin to invest in America or pay higher taxes on your excessive profits and face other restrictions.', ""You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession—the last week's GDP report came out. You know what it shows? The economy is, in fact, growing. In fact, the economy grew 2.6 percent last quarter. And although it may not feel that way, people's incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation."", ""Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down. But here's the best, most important thing to me: Exports—what we make and export from America—are up, meaning we're making things again here in America. And today—today—we're shipping products overseas instead of shipping jobs overseas, like we've been doing for much too long."", 'Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!', 'The President. You\'ve got it. There\'s nothing we can\'t do. And here\'s another thing: My—[inaudible]—my predecessor, he promised in—he promised to have an ""Infrastructure Week."" For 4 years, he promised infrastructure. It became a laugh line.', 'Well, guess what? We\'re creating ""Infrastructure Decade."" We\'re going to build America the way it should be built. Create once-in-a-generation investments in our Nation\'s roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water systems, high-speed internet.', ""And by the way, that includes a $16 million grant to the Port of Miami, which I'm sure your Governor will take credit for it somewhere along the line—[laughter]—to expand and upgrade its rail and cargo gates to make the port more efficient. Val Demings voted for it. Her opponent voted against it."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. And the American people are beginning to see the benefits of an economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than they did before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills, than before the pandemic. And importantly, more Americans have health insurance than before the pandemic.', ""And you know, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any country in the world. Same manufacturer, same drug, you buy it in Miami and you buy it in Paris, and it costs considerably less if you're buying it in Paris—buy the same exact drug, the same manufacturer."", ""And, ladies and gentlemen, so without a single Republican vote in Congress, guess what? We Democrats took on and beat Big Pharma for the first time. I've been trying for a year—we beat them. We flat beat Big Pharma. They spent millions of dollars trying to prevent it. I'm serious. I've been fighting these guys for a long time, man. Finally. Finally."", ""With every single Democrat vote—and by the way, you know what one of the results is? We're capping out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions for seniors to $2,000 a year. Guess what? No matter whether they're paying $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year, as they are for some cancer drugs, they are not going to have to pay a single penny more than $2,000 a year. Period."", ""And by the way, one more thing. If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, guess what?

Look, Macarena, thanks for that introduction. It's great to be at Florida Memorial University, one of the Nation's great HBCUs. I'm a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University. Okay—it's pretty good, man. Audience members. [Inaudible] The President. Anyway. [Laughter] Anyway, look, you know, talking to students about my administration's plan to provide student loan relief for working and middle class folks. Talking about my historic commitment to HBCUs that included $5.8 billion in investment at HBCUs. Well, let me tell you: One of the great ways to honor HBCUs' legacy is to vote, vote, vote. Look—— Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! [Laughter] The President. You can do it. I'm telling you, you can make the difference. Last time in Florida—I was in Florida was almost a month ago, just after Hurricane Ian hit. We surveyed the damage on the ground in Fort Myers and the surrounding community areas by helicopter. The damage and destruction was historic and horrific. It was almost unimaginable. And I said then that it's going to take not weeks and months, but years to fully recover and rebuild. But I gave the people of Florida my commitment to—this country's commitment that you will not go through this alone. We ain't going home. My administration has been following through on those commitments to get the people of Florida what they need as fast as we can and help you rebuild. So far, $1.7 billion in assistance has gone to this State. We've set up 23 disaster recovery centers where survivors can register for help. And FEMA has performed over 180,000 home inspections. The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved another $460 million for low-interest loans to business owners, renters, and homeowners. And like I said, this is just the beginning of our effort. We'll be with you every step of the way. We're not going home. Folks, it's great to be with the next Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist. And great to be with the next U.S. Senator, Val Demings. I know them both really well. Charlie—Charlie is a guy you know and trust. He's always, always working for you, fighting for working families like yours. It was great—he was a great Governor before, and he'd make an even greater Governor again because of who he's going to be replacing. Folks, whether it's building an economy that works for everyone or keeping communities safe and protections and right to choose, Val—Chief Val Demings, she's the real deal, defined by one word: commitment. Commitment. She does what she says. And, folks, she's fighting for seniors to protect their Social Security and Medicare. She literally put her life on the line to serve and protect the people of this State. And when it comes to public safety, she knows what it takes. Folks, imagine Chief Demings on the beat in the United States Senate. I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. [Laughter] They ain't seen nothing yet. They haven't seen nothing yet. Oh, man, you've got a hell of a delegation. And, folks, we need to elect Charlie and Val, and we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, including your outstanding Members of Congress, Debbie and Frederica and Sheila. If we do that, Florida is not going to be only a better place, so will America be. Look, on a very serious note, that's why we're all here. That's why we're all here. Seven days. Seven days until the most important election in our lifetime. You've heard me say it before: We're at in inflection point in history. It comes about every five of six generations. So much has changed in America and around the world that the decisions we make—the decisions you make—over the next 2 to 3 years are going to determine the fate of this country—not a joke—for the next decade to two decades. There's a lot at stake—a lot. But so much opportunity. [At this point, an audience member waved a piece of paper.] Put the paper down. I'm not coming and getting it. Okay? All right? She's holding up a paper for—she wants to send me a letter here. [Laughter] Well, look, let's be real clear about one important thing: This election is not a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two vastly different visions for America. I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out; an economy that rework—rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so poor folks have a chance, the middle class does better. And if they do that, the wealthy will still do very well. It's a fundamental shift in—that's what's working now. Compared to the MAGA—mega MAGA, I call them—trickle-down economics that the Republicans offer these days. Folks, this ain't your father's Republican Party. This a different breed of cat. Just look at the facts. When I took office, the economy was in ruins. My—this is not because of me; it's because of what I inherited. My predecessor was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs. He had fewer jobs when he left office than when he came to office. Last President that happened to was literally Herbert Hoover. And look, here's the deal: Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses had gone out of business, closed, bankrupt. But today, we're in a better place: Ten million jobs created since I took office. A record in any administration. And over 700,000 manufacturing jobs with good pay. Where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? I mean it. Think about it. Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5 percent, the lowest in 50 years. Black, Latino, and Asian by—communities, unemployment is way down; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses just since I've been in—5.4 million, the highest ever in American history. Look, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the actions we've taken, gas prices are coming down here at home. They're down $1.25. I just passed a gas station on the way: $3.25 when it was 5 bucks when it took off this summer. Ladies and gentleman, here's the deal: It's a difficult time. Americans across the country have stepped up and are doing the right thing, but not everyone. The oil industry is not doing the right thing. They haven't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people. One by one, major oil companies have reported their profits for the last two quarters, I mean profits so high it's hard to believe. Last week, Shell Oil announced that it made $9.5 billion in profit in 3 months—the third quarter—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——9.5. That's almost twice as much as they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third quarter profits were $18.7 billion—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——nearly triple what Exxon made last year. The most it's made in its entire 152-year history. In the last 6 months, while the rest of the country is going through hell, six of the largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profits. A hundred billion dollars in less than 200 days. It's outrageous. And these companies are taking the average profits they've been making by refining oil over the last 20 years. If they were doing that instead of the outrageous profits they're making today, it could pass on the rest of us—the consumers—the price of gas would be down another 50 cents. They're the facts. Instead, they're buying back their own stock because that's how the CEOs get paid. They're giving the profits to shareholders—outrageous profits—and the windfalls of war. Yesterday I made it clear the industry has a choice: Either begin to invest in America or pay higher taxes on your excessive profits and face other restrictions. You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession—the last week's GDP report came out. You know what it shows? The economy is, in fact, growing. In fact, the economy grew 2.6 percent last quarter. And although it may not feel that way, people's incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down. But here's the best, most important thing to me: Exports—what we make and export from America—are up, meaning we're making things again here in America. And today—today—we're shipping products overseas instead of shipping jobs overseas, like we've been doing for much too long. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. You've got it. There's nothing we can't do. And here's another thing: My—[inaudible]—my predecessor, he promised in—he promised to have an ""Infrastructure Week."" For 4 years, he promised infrastructure. It became a laugh line. Well, guess what? We're creating ""Infrastructure Decade."" We're going to build America the way it should be built. Create once-in-a-generation investments in our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water systems, high-speed internet. And by the way, that includes a $16 million grant to the Port of Miami, which I'm sure your Governor will take credit for it somewhere along the line—[laughter]—to expand and upgrade its rail and cargo gates to make the port more efficient. Val Demings voted for it. Her opponent voted against it. Audience members. Boo! The President. And the American people are beginning to see the benefits of an economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than they did before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills, than before the pandemic. And importantly, more Americans have health insurance than before the pandemic. And you know, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any country in the world. Same manufacturer, same drug, you buy it in Miami and you buy it in Paris, and it costs considerably less if you're buying it in Paris—buy the same exact drug, the same manufacturer. And, ladies and gentlemen, so without a single Republican vote in Congress, guess what? We Democrats took on and beat Big Pharma for the first time. I've been trying for a year—we beat them. We flat beat Big Pharma. They spent millions of dollars trying to prevent it. I'm serious. I've been fighting these guys for a long time, man. Finally. Finally. With every single Democrat vote—and by the way, you know what one of the results is? We're capping out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions for seniors to $2,000 a year. Guess what? No matter whether they're paying $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year, as they are for some cancer drugs, they are not going to have to pay a single penny more than $2,000 a year. Period. And by the way, one more thing. If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, guess what? They're going to have to write a check to Medicare to cover the difference. No, that's the law. That's the law. And by the way, last year, Big Pharma raised the price of 1,200 drugs they manufactured faster than the rate of inflation, and they didn't do a damn thing to make the product better. Same exact product. We're going to put a stop to that, I promise you. And one more significant change we just made: We're capping the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare. You know how much it costs to make that insulin? The guy who invented it didn't patent it because he wanted it available for everybody. It costs $10 to produce it. And you know what the average price they're paying for it? Four hundred dollars. Well, guess what? They can't pay any more than—they can't get any more than $35 now. Thirty—they'll make a good profit. No more—instead of paying $400 a month. Folks, this is going to be a lifesaver for people. And I'm going back to make sure it's $35 a month for not just people on Medicare, but for every single American. I promise you, not a joke. Audience member. Give them hell! The President. I'm going to give them more than hell. [Laughter] And on top of these actions, earlier this month, I—we lowered the cost of hearing aids. You know what? We made them available over the counter at places like Walgreens and Walmart, saving $3,000 a pair—hear me?—for millions of Americans with hearing loss. If I don't stop talking so loud, you all are going to have hearing loss. [Laughter] And on top of that, I'm going to do away with hidden, unfair fees known as junk fees, like surprise banking overdraft. You overdraft, and you get another bill for 35 bucks—no more. Excessive credit card rate fees you didn't know about, at 50 bucks—no more. And the Department of Transportation is working on rules to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all their fees up front. So when you're booking travel for the holidays, you know what extra amount you're going to have to pay for things like sitting next to your kid or checking a bag or changing your ticket or even if you can't change your ticket without additional costs. Folks, these add up. These are big numbers for people, and they don't know it's even coming. While Republicans want to pass tax breaks for the wealthy and corporate America, we're passing tax credits to help the American people weatherize their homes. For real. To buy energy-efficient appliances, get a tax credit, put solar panels on your home, help you buy an electric vehicle, weatherize your home, things that they say will save the average family another 500 bucks a year and help save the environment. And one of these things I promised to do, because I understand the high cost of college: I took action to ease the burden of student debt for millions of working and middle class America. Over 90 percent who learn [earn]* less than 75 grand, they're now given up to $20,000 of relief on student debt—10 for most folks, another 10 if you had a Pell grant. It's a game changer. I had to borrow to get to college. I had to work through college, like my sons and daughters did. We have—what have Republicans done about this? Well, guess what? They moaned and groaned about it, and they challenged it in court, which they're going to lose. And I'm not going to apologize for 1 second for helping working and middle class families recover and reduce their student debt so we can be—position to buy a home, start a business, and so much more. And by the way, I usually don't do this, but take a look who's complaining: the same Republican officials who voted for the unpaid $2 trillion tax giveaway that mainly benefited wealthy Americans and the biggest corporations. I don't want to hear it from MAGA Republicans who sit in Congress today. And by the way, those same folks who are complaining in Congress, they had hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in the pandemic relief forgiveness loans, but they took it. They didn't attack it. Working and middle class Americans and student debt relief. For example, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, guess what? She took $180,000 in business loan forgiven. One of your Congressmen right here in Florida, Vern Buchanan, said our plan was reckless. Guess how much he got: $2.3 million for losses. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, look, how in the heck can they complain about that when we're trying to give students a break to be able to get under—out from under college debt? Look, folks, who in the hell do they think they are? And by the way, I already heard from my colleagues today how Republicans want to make permanent the Dobbs decision denying a woman the right to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. But I've got news for them. We're going to elect a couple more U.S. Senators who are Democrats, and we're going to codify Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. Fact. And by the way, if somehow they were able to pass this, I will veto it—[applause]—the Republicans. Look, you know, you can hear it from Republicans: ""My God, that big-spending Democrat Biden. Man, he's taken us in debt."" Well, guess what? I reduced the Federal deficit this year by 1 trillion, 400 billion dollars. One trillion 400 billion dollars. The most in all American history. No one has ever reduced the debt that much. We cut the Federal debt in half. And by the way, last year, I reduced the deficit by $350 billion. Well, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear—they're going to—look, and we're going to go further to reduce the deficit over the next decade by another $250 billion. A big part of that is because corporations are finally having to pay a minimum tax. ""Oh, and we're hurting them."" Fifteen percent. You pay more than 15 percent. But guess what? One more thing. On our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting the biggest increase in Social Security checks, period. Their checks are going to go up and their Medicare premiums are going to go down at the same time. And I promise you, I'll protect Social Security, I'll protect Medicare, I'll protect you. And all of this is in stark contrast to the stated Republican agenda. They're all—all—after what Charlie and Val and—but their opponents are just the exact opposite of what they're for. And by the way, if I can note for just a second: I made a promise to you that I'd make my administration and the Cabinet look like America. Audience member. Thank you! The President. I have more African Americans, more Hispanic Americans, more women than men—more women than men—in my Cabinet. Not a joke. And guess what? I promised you I'd have a Black woman on the Supreme Court. She's on the Supreme Court! And she's smarter than the rest of them. Look, I have appointed more Black women to the appeals court—— Audience member. Woo! The President. No, hear me out—[laughter]—more Black women to the appeals court of the Federal courts than every other President combined in American history. It's about time. It's about time. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. And, folks, it goes across the board, for Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, all—look, we have to have—and I've been arguing this for a long time—we have to have my administration and this Government look like America—— Audience member. Yes! The President. ——look like America. That's why we're so strong. That's why we're who we are. And, folks, by the way, I might note parenthetically that more valedictorians in the major universities in America are women than men. That's a little thing. I went to the same university as my sister. I graduated. She graduated with honors, you know? [Laughter] Oh, you think I'm kidding. I'm not. [Laughter] Look, folks, Kevin McCarthy—he's the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. Audience members. Boo! The President. Okay? The Republicans have their—you know, they're saying it out loud now. They're saying what their—they want to do. Thank God for small favors. [Laughter] And here's what they say. He says their number-one priority is to do the following: deny Medicare the right to negotiate drug prices. Audience members. Boo! The President. Oh, I'm—no, I'm serious. He wants to give the power back to Big Pharma so they can continue to rip us off with prescription drug prices. He wants to end the cap on prescription drug costs at $2,000 for—on Medicare. Gone. Gone. Thirty-five-dollar-a-month cap on insulin for seniors—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 for millions of Americans on the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they still are determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act overall, which means that anyone with a preexisting condition would lose any access to health care. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, these protections are gone as well if Republicans get their way. And look, tax credits for lower energy bills—gone. And the corporate minimum tax of 15 percent I signed into law—gone. Under the Republican plan, many of the biggest corporations will go back to paying zero taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, you think I'm making this up? It's a fact. In 2020, 55 of the Fortune 500 largest corporations made $40 billion in profit, and they paid zero in Federal tax. Audience members. Boo! The President. That's their plan. It's reckless. It's irresponsible. It will make inflation worse, and it will badly hurt working class and middle class Americans. But that's not all. They're coming after your Social Security and Medicare, and they're saying it out loud. Your great Senator, Rick Scott, here in Florida—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——he's in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. He laid out their plan clearly. He put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. This means—— Audience member. No! The President. No, this is serious. Listen closely to this, because it's deadly earnest. It means every 5 years, Congress will vote to cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security or Medicare. If they do nothing, it goes out of existence. Not a joke. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the Senator. He wants to do Scott one better. The argument among the Republicans is: Should it be every 5 years or every single year? He thinks waiting 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it—the program goes away. This is not a joke. It's not just Social Security and Medicare. He wants to put veterans benefits, everything—everything in the Federal budget—on the line. You know, to digress just a second, I lost my son not long ago. He was the attorney general. He was a major in the United States Army. He won the—[inaudible]—won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal. And because his hooch, where he lived in Baghdad, was next to a burn pit—just like those folks in 9/11, you know, that were exposed to all that toxic smoke—well, guess what? They burned everything in those burn pits, from oil to human feces to all—everything. Everything. And he breathed that in for a year, and he died. And more people are coming home with brain cancer, glioblastoma—it's a death sentence. He made it for 19 months when he got home, but that was it. And guess what? We had a thing that was to make sure I made a commitment in my State of the Union that we'd take care of our veterans. The only truly—[applause]—and by the way, we have a lot of obligations, but it's the only truly sacred obligation we have: to equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. And guess what? We had to fight like hell to get it passed, and not all Republicans voted for it. It provided for health care for those veterans who were going through it just like Agent Orange. And it also said those who died, their families could get financial help for that. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we're doing. And now they're saying—these guys—they're saying they're not going to cooperate. They're not going to cooperate if I don't agree to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other things. They're going to shut down the Government, they say. At the end of the year—I know this is complicated stuff—but at the end of the year, every year, we have obligations of debt around the world. And we have—we've never missed a payment, never once. Not once. If we did, it would send the economy into a tailspin and a gigantic recession. Never once in all our history. You know what they're telling me? Unless I vote to reduce the benefits of Medicare and Social Security, they're going to threaten to take the country bankrupt. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, think about this. I mean—no, no, just think how totally irresponsible this is. The last time that happened, remember, McConnell tried to do it when Barack was President and I was Vice President. I had negotiated with him until late New Year's Eve day—late that day—before we got to a place where he finally gave in and we didn't renege on the debt. But guess what happened? We came so close—remember, they reduced our standing—they reduced our credit standing in the world? And we had real problems. Even just the threat makes the rest of the world look at us like, ""What in God's name is that country doing?"" So, folks, they're being completely, thoroughly, totally irresponsible. And here's the deal: Nothing—nothing—will create more chaos and more damage to the American economy than this. And, folks—but their extremism isn't limited to social programs and the economy. They're coming after your right to vote and who gets to count the vote. No, for real. You've got three hundred or fifty-so election deniers on the ballot, on the Republican ticket. No, this is really deadly earnest, man. Democracy is on the ballot this year, along with your right to choose and the right to privacy. The bottom line is this: If Republicans gain control the Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I'll veto it. But—[applause]—if Val Demings and more Senate Democrats get elected to keep control of the Senate and the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January. Make it the law of the land. Look, let me close with this. You've been a very patient audience, especially standing there all this time. It's been a rough 4 or 5 years for hard-working Americans. For a lot of families, things are still tough. When things like this happened when I was growing up—we weren't poor. My dad—his greatest regret: He didn't have a college education, but he was a sophisticated man who read well, and he was really informed. But we lived in a three-bedroom home with—a split-level home in a new development with four kids and a grandpop and mom and dad. So it wasn't—but when—so when prices went up, it affected us. We had discussions at the kitchen table. I mean, for real. We weren't poor, but we knew what it was like. For—by the way, I was talking with one of my colleagues here today. And when they came out, I got a phone call from my wife when she was up trying to help Patrick Leahy way back, years ago, campaigning—or I was up doing that call for her. And she's a teacher, so I called her early in the morning. Like when your husbands and wives are away, you call your family. And I called and said, ""How are things going?"" And she said, ""Fine."" [Laughter] I knew something was—she said, ""Did you read today's paper?"" And I said, ""They don't get the Wilmington News Journal up here in Burlington, Vermont, honey."" She said, ""Headline, top of the fold: 'Biden Poorest Man in Congress.' Is that true?"" [Laughter] I said, ""I don't know what the hell""—but I was all those years, but I had a good salary. I was still making more than most people because I had a Senator's salary. I didn't think you were supposed to make money when you're in the Senate. I thought you were just supposed to take a salary. But, folks, so like many of you, I come from a normal, middle class family. And guess what? We know what it's like when hard times hit. We get it. We get it. And right now think about it. Look what we're doing on education for our kids. One of the reasons I came up with that $5.6 billion for HBCUs is, we've got to make sure they have the same laboratories, the same research capacities as everybody else has, because they can do anything anybody else can do. They just don't have—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. And, folks, one of the reasons why we led the world for so long, we were the first nation in the world to provide universal education, grades 1 through 12. Well, if anybody think if we were doing it for the first time now in the 20—21st century—going into the 20th—from the 20th century going into the second quarter of the 21st century, that we'd say 12 years is enough, do you think 12 years is enough going into 2030, '40, '50? I don't think so. That's why we should have free early education at age 3. And that's why we should have 2 years of community college free. It makes—these things make us stronger. So look, folks, there are bright spots where America is reasserting itself. We made enormous progress in just 20 months. We have so much more to do. Everything is at stake in just 7 days, God willing, for the State and this country that we love. So I call on Democrats and mainstream Republicans and Independents to come together. We can meet the moment together. I truly believe we're just getting started. I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. So vote. Get out the vote, and win! Vote, vote, vote! May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. God love you all. I mean it. Let's go. Let's do it! No excuses. Thank you.","The President. Hello, Florida! Hello, hello, hello. Well, hello, Florida! Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. And you've been—[laughter]. Well, as my mother would say, ""God love you all."" You got caught in the front pew. No way to stand, huh? Well, God love you. Well, thank you very much. Look, Macarena, thanks for that introduction. It's great to be at Florida Memorial University, one of the Nation's great HBCUs. I'm a big fan of HBCUs. I got my start at one of those other HBCUs, Delaware State University. Okay—it's pretty good, man. Audience members. [Inaudible] The President. Anyway. [Laughter] Anyway, look, you know, talking to students about my administration's plan to provide student loan relief for working and middle class folks. Talking about my historic commitment to HBCUs that included $5.8 billion in investment at HBCUs. Well, let me tell you: One of the great ways to honor HBCUs' legacy is to vote, vote, vote. Look—— Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! [Laughter] The President. You can do it. I'm telling you, you can make the difference. Last time in Florida—I was in Florida was almost a month ago, just after Hurricane Ian hit. We surveyed the damage on the ground in Fort Myers and the surrounding community areas by helicopter. The damage and destruction was historic and horrific. It was almost unimaginable. And I said then that it's going to take not weeks and months, but years to fully recover and rebuild. But I gave the people of Florida my commitment to—this country's commitment that you will not go through this alone. We ain't going home. My administration has been following through on those commitments to get the people of Florida what they need as fast as we can and help you rebuild. So far, $1.7 billion in assistance has gone to this State. We've set up 23 disaster recovery centers where survivors can register for help. And FEMA has performed over 180,000 home inspections. The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved another $460 million for low-interest loans to business owners, renters, and homeowners. And like I said, this is just the beginning of our effort. We'll be with you every step of the way. We're not going home. Folks, it's great to be with the next Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist. And great to be with the next U.S. Senator, Val Demings. I know them both really well. Charlie—Charlie is a guy you know and trust. He's always, always working for you, fighting for working families like yours. It was great—he was a great Governor before, and he'd make an even greater Governor again because of who he's going to be replacing. Folks, whether it's building an economy that works for everyone or keeping communities safe and protections and right to choose, Val—Chief Val Demings, she's the real deal, defined by one word: commitment. Commitment. She does what she says. And, folks, she's fighting for seniors to protect their Social Security and Medicare. She literally put her life on the line to serve and protect the people of this State. And when it comes to public safety, she knows what it takes. Folks, imagine Chief Demings on the beat in the United States Senate. I can hardly wait. I can hardly wait. [Laughter] They ain't seen nothing yet. They haven't seen nothing yet. Oh, man, you've got a hell of a delegation. And, folks, we need to elect Charlie and Val, and we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot, including your outstanding Members of Congress, Debbie and Frederica and Sheila. If we do that, Florida is not going to be only a better place, so will America be. Look, on a very serious note, that's why we're all here. That's why we're all here. Seven days. Seven days until the most important election in our lifetime. You've heard me say it before: We're at in inflection point in history. It comes about every five of six generations. So much has changed in America and around the world that the decisions we make—the decisions you make—over the next 2 to 3 years are going to determine the fate of this country—not a joke—for the next decade to two decades. There's a lot at stake—a lot. But so much opportunity. [At this point, an audience member waved a piece of paper.] Put the paper down. I'm not coming and getting it. Okay? All right? She's holding up a paper for—she wants to send me a letter here. [Laughter] Well, look, let's be real clear about one important thing: This election is not a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two vastly different visions for America. I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out; an economy that rework—rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so poor folks have a chance, the middle class does better. And if they do that, the wealthy will still do very well. It's a fundamental shift in—that's what's working now. Compared to the MAGA—mega MAGA, I call them—trickle-down economics that the Republicans offer these days. Folks, this ain't your father's Republican Party. This a different breed of cat. Just look at the facts. When I took office, the economy was in ruins. My—this is not because of me; it's because of what I inherited. My predecessor was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs. He had fewer jobs when he left office than when he came to office. Last President that happened to was literally Herbert Hoover. And look, here's the deal: Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses had gone out of business, closed, bankrupt. But today, we're in a better place: Ten million jobs created since I took office. A record in any administration. And over 700,000 manufacturing jobs with good pay. Where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world? I mean it. Think about it. Unemployment is down from 6.5 to 3.5 percent, the lowest in 50 years. Black, Latino, and Asian by—communities, unemployment is way down; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses just since I've been in—5.4 million, the highest ever in American history. Look, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the actions we've taken, gas prices are coming down here at home. They're down $1.25. I just passed a gas station on the way: $3.25 when it was 5 bucks when it took off this summer. Ladies and gentleman, here's the deal: It's a difficult time. Americans across the country have stepped up and are doing the right thing, but not everyone. The oil industry is not doing the right thing. They haven't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people. One by one, major oil companies have reported their profits for the last two quarters, I mean profits so high it's hard to believe. Last week, Shell Oil announced that it made $9.5 billion in profit in 3 months—the third quarter—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——9.5. That's almost twice as much as they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third quarter profits were $18.7 billion—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——nearly triple what Exxon made last year. The most it's made in its entire 152-year history. In the last 6 months, while the rest of the country is going through hell, six of the largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profits. A hundred billion dollars in less than 200 days. It's outrageous. And these companies are taking the average profits they've been making by refining oil over the last 20 years. If they were doing that instead of the outrageous profits they're making today, it could pass on the rest of us—the consumers—the price of gas would be down another 50 cents. They're the facts. Instead, they're buying back their own stock because that's how the CEOs get paid. They're giving the profits to shareholders—outrageous profits—and the windfalls of war. Yesterday I made it clear the industry has a choice: Either begin to invest in America or pay higher taxes on your excessive profits and face other restrictions. You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession—the last week's GDP report came out. You know what it shows? The economy is, in fact, growing. In fact, the economy grew 2.6 percent last quarter. And although it may not feel that way, people's incomes went up the last quarter more than inflation. Economic growth is up, price inflation is down, real incomes are up, and gas prices are down. But here's the best, most important thing to me: Exports—what we make and export from America—are up, meaning we're making things again here in America. And today—today—we're shipping products overseas instead of shipping jobs overseas, like we've been doing for much too long. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. You've got it. There's nothing we can't do. And here's another thing: My—[inaudible]—my predecessor, he promised in—he promised to have an ""Infrastructure Week."" For 4 years, he promised infrastructure. It became a laugh line. Well, guess what? We're creating ""Infrastructure Decade."" We're going to build America the way it should be built. Create once-in-a-generation investments in our Nation's roads, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water systems, high-speed internet. And by the way, that includes a $16 million grant to the Port of Miami, which I'm sure your Governor will take credit for it somewhere along the line—[laughter]—to expand and upgrade its rail and cargo gates to make the port more efficient. Val Demings voted for it. Her opponent voted against it. Audience members. Boo! The President. And the American people are beginning to see the benefits of an economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than they did before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills, than before the pandemic. And importantly, more Americans have health insurance than before the pandemic. And you know, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of any country in the world. Same manufacturer, same drug, you buy it in Miami and you buy it in Paris, and it costs considerably less if you're buying it in Paris—buy the same exact drug, the same manufacturer. And, ladies and gentlemen, so without a single Republican vote in Congress, guess what? We Democrats took on and beat Big Pharma for the first time. I've been trying for a year—we beat them. We flat beat Big Pharma. They spent millions of dollars trying to prevent it. I'm serious. I've been fighting these guys for a long time, man. Finally. Finally. With every single Democrat vote—and by the way, you know what one of the results is? We're capping out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions for seniors to $2,000 a year. Guess what? No matter whether they're paying $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year, as they are for some cancer drugs, they are not going to have to pay a single penny more than $2,000 a year. Period. And by the way, one more thing. If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, guess what? They're going to have to write a check to Medicare to cover the difference. No, that's the law. That's the law. And by the way, last year, Big Pharma raised the price of 1,200 drugs they manufactured faster than the rate of inflation, and they didn't do a damn thing to make the product better. Same exact product. We're going to put a stop to that, I promise you. And one more significant change we just made: We're capping the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare. You know how much it costs to make that insulin? The guy who invented it didn't patent it because he wanted it available for everybody. It costs $10 to produce it. And you know what the average price they're paying for it? Four hundred dollars. Well, guess what? They can't pay any more than—they can't get any more than $35 now. Thirty—they'll make a good profit. No more—instead of paying $400 a month. Folks, this is going to be a lifesaver for people. And I'm going back to make sure it's $35 a month for not just people on Medicare, but for every single American. I promise you, not a joke. Audience member. Give them hell! The President. I'm going to give them more than hell. [Laughter] And on top of these actions, earlier this month, I—we lowered the cost of hearing aids. You know what? We made them available over the counter at places like Walgreens and Walmart, saving $3,000 a pair—hear me?—for millions of Americans with hearing loss. If I don't stop talking so loud, you all are going to have hearing loss. [Laughter] And on top of that, I'm going to do away with hidden, unfair fees known as junk fees, like surprise banking overdraft. You overdraft, and you get another bill for 35 bucks—no more. Excessive credit card rate fees you didn't know about, at 50 bucks—no more. And the Department of Transportation is working on rules to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all their fees up front. So when you're booking travel for the holidays, you know what extra amount you're going to have to pay for things like sitting next to your kid or checking a bag or changing your ticket or even if you can't change your ticket without additional costs. Folks, these add up. These are big numbers for people, and they don't know it's even coming. While Republicans want to pass tax breaks for the wealthy and corporate America, we're passing tax credits to help the American people weatherize their homes. For real. To buy energy-efficient appliances, get a tax credit, put solar panels on your home, help you buy an electric vehicle, weatherize your home, things that they say will save the average family another 500 bucks a year and help save the environment. And one of these things I promised to do, because I understand the high cost of college: I took action to ease the burden of student debt for millions of working and middle class America. Over 90 percent who learn [earn]* less than 75 grand, they're now given up to $20,000 of relief on student debt—10 for most folks, another 10 if you had a Pell grant. It's a game changer. I had to borrow to get to college. I had to work through college, like my sons and daughters did. We have—what have Republicans done about this? Well, guess what? They moaned and groaned about it, and they challenged it in court, which they're going to lose. And I'm not going to apologize for 1 second for helping working and middle class families recover and reduce their student debt so we can be—position to buy a home, start a business, and so much more. And by the way, I usually don't do this, but take a look who's complaining: the same Republican officials who voted for the unpaid $2 trillion tax giveaway that mainly benefited wealthy Americans and the biggest corporations. I don't want to hear it from MAGA Republicans who sit in Congress today. And by the way, those same folks who are complaining in Congress, they had hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in the pandemic relief forgiveness loans, but they took it. They didn't attack it. Working and middle class Americans and student debt relief. For example, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, guess what? She took $180,000 in business loan forgiven. One of your Congressmen right here in Florida, Vern Buchanan, said our plan was reckless. Guess how much he got: $2.3 million for losses. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, look, how in the heck can they complain about that when we're trying to give students a break to be able to get under—out from under college debt? Look, folks, who in the hell do they think they are? And by the way, I already heard from my colleagues today how Republicans want to make permanent the Dobbs decision denying a woman the right to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. But I've got news for them. We're going to elect a couple more U.S. Senators who are Democrats, and we're going to codify Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose. Fact. And by the way, if somehow they were able to pass this, I will veto it—[applause]—the Republicans. Look, you know, you can hear it from Republicans: ""My God, that big-spending Democrat Biden. Man, he's taken us in debt."" Well, guess what? I reduced the Federal deficit this year by 1 trillion, 400 billion dollars. One trillion 400 billion dollars. The most in all American history. No one has ever reduced the debt that much. We cut the Federal debt in half. And by the way, last year, I reduced the deficit by $350 billion. Well, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear—they're going to—look, and we're going to go further to reduce the deficit over the next decade by another $250 billion. A big part of that is because corporations are finally having to pay a minimum tax. ""Oh, and we're hurting them."" Fifteen percent. You pay more than 15 percent. But guess what? One more thing. On our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting the biggest increase in Social Security checks, period. Their checks are going to go up and their Medicare premiums are going to go down at the same time. And I promise you, I'll protect Social Security, I'll protect Medicare, I'll protect you. And all of this is in stark contrast to the stated Republican agenda. They're all—all—after what Charlie and Val and—but their opponents are just the exact opposite of what they're for. And by the way, if I can note for just a second: I made a promise to you that I'd make my administration and the Cabinet look like America. Audience member. Thank you! The President. I have more African Americans, more Hispanic Americans, more women than men—more women than men—in my Cabinet. Not a joke. And guess what? I promised you I'd have a Black woman on the Supreme Court. She's on the Supreme Court! And she's smarter than the rest of them. Look, I have appointed more Black women to the appeals court—— Audience member. Woo! The President. No, hear me out—[laughter]—more Black women to the appeals court of the Federal courts than every other President combined in American history. It's about time. It's about time. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. And, folks, it goes across the board, for Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, all—look, we have to have—and I've been arguing this for a long time—we have to have my administration and this Government look like America—— Audience member. Yes! The President. ——look like America. That's why we're so strong. That's why we're who we are. And, folks, by the way, I might note parenthetically that more valedictorians in the major universities in America are women than men. That's a little thing. I went to the same university as my sister. I graduated. She graduated with honors, you know? [Laughter] Oh, you think I'm kidding. I'm not. [Laughter] Look, folks, Kevin McCarthy—he's the leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives. Audience members. Boo! The President. Okay? The Republicans have their—you know, they're saying it out loud now. They're saying what their—they want to do. Thank God for small favors. [Laughter] And here's what they say. He says their number-one priority is to do the following: deny Medicare the right to negotiate drug prices. Audience members. Boo! The President. Oh, I'm—no, I'm serious. He wants to give the power back to Big Pharma so they can continue to rip us off with prescription drug prices. He wants to end the cap on prescription drug costs at $2,000 for—on Medicare. Gone. Gone. Thirty-five-dollar-a-month cap on insulin for seniors—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 for millions of Americans on the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they still are determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act overall, which means that anyone with a preexisting condition would lose any access to health care. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, these protections are gone as well if Republicans get their way. And look, tax credits for lower energy bills—gone. And the corporate minimum tax of 15 percent I signed into law—gone. Under the Republican plan, many of the biggest corporations will go back to paying zero taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, you think I'm making this up? It's a fact. In 2020, 55 of the Fortune 500 largest corporations made $40 billion in profit, and they paid zero in Federal tax. Audience members. Boo! The President. That's their plan. It's reckless. It's irresponsible. It will make inflation worse, and it will badly hurt working class and middle class Americans. But that's not all. They're coming after your Social Security and Medicare, and they're saying it out loud. Your great Senator, Rick Scott, here in Florida—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——he's in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. He laid out their plan clearly. He put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. This means—— Audience member. No! The President. No, this is serious. Listen closely to this, because it's deadly earnest. It means every 5 years, Congress will vote to cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security or Medicare. If they do nothing, it goes out of existence. Not a joke. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the Senator. He wants to do Scott one better. The argument among the Republicans is: Should it be every 5 years or every single year? He thinks waiting 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it—the program goes away. This is not a joke. It's not just Social Security and Medicare. He wants to put veterans benefits, everything—everything in the Federal budget—on the line. You know, to digress just a second, I lost my son not long ago. He was the attorney general. He was a major in the United States Army. He won the—[inaudible]—won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal. And because his hooch, where he lived in Baghdad, was next to a burn pit—just like those folks in 9/11, you know, that were exposed to all that toxic smoke—well, guess what? They burned everything in those burn pits, from oil to human feces to all—everything. Everything. And he breathed that in for a year, and he died. And more people are coming home with brain cancer, glioblastoma—it's a death sentence. He made it for 19 months when he got home, but that was it. And guess what? We had a thing that was to make sure I made a commitment in my State of the Union that we'd take care of our veterans. The only truly—[applause]—and by the way, we have a lot of obligations, but it's the only truly sacred obligation we have: to equip those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home. And guess what? We had to fight like hell to get it passed, and not all Republicans voted for it. It provided for health care for those veterans who were going through it just like Agent Orange. And it also said those who died, their families could get financial help for that. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we're doing. And now they're saying—these guys—they're saying they're not going to cooperate. They're not going to cooperate if I don't agree to cut Social Security, Medicare, and other things. They're going to shut down the Government, they say. At the end of the year—I know this is complicated stuff—but at the end of the year, every year, we have obligations of debt around the world. And we have—we've never missed a payment, never once. Not once. If we did, it would send the economy into a tailspin and a gigantic recession. Never once in all our history. You know what they're telling me? Unless I vote to reduce the benefits of Medicare and Social Security, they're going to threaten to take the country bankrupt. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, think about this. I mean—no, no, just think how totally irresponsible this is. The last time that happened, remember, McConnell tried to do it when Barack was President and I was Vice President. I had negotiated with him until late New Year's Eve day—late that day—before we got to a place where he finally gave in and we didn't renege on the debt. But guess what happened? We came so close—remember, they reduced our standing—they reduced our credit standing in the world? And we had real problems. Even just the threat makes the rest of the world look at us like, ""What in God's name is that country doing?"" So, folks, they're being completely, thoroughly, totally irresponsible. And here's the deal: Nothing—nothing—will create more chaos and more damage to the American economy than this. And, folks—but their extremism isn't limited to social programs and the economy. They're coming after your right to vote and who gets to count the vote. No, for real. You've got three hundred or fifty-so election deniers on the ballot, on the Republican ticket. No, this is really deadly earnest, man. Democracy is on the ballot this year, along with your right to choose and the right to privacy. The bottom line is this: If Republicans gain control the Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I'll veto it. But—[applause]—if Val Demings and more Senate Democrats get elected to keep control of the Senate and the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January. Make it the law of the land. Look, let me close with this. You've been a very patient audience, especially standing there all this time. It's been a rough 4 or 5 years for hard-working Americans. For a lot of families, things are still tough. When things like this happened when I was growing up—we weren't poor. My dad—his greatest regret: He didn't have a college education, but he was a sophisticated man who read well, and he was really informed. But we lived in a three-bedroom home with—a split-level home in a new development with four kids and a grandpop and mom and dad. So it wasn't—but when—so when prices went up, it affected us. We had discussions at the kitchen table. I mean, for real. We weren't poor, but we knew what it was like. For—by the way, I was talking with one of my colleagues here today. And when they came out, I got a phone call from my wife when she was up trying to help Patrick Leahy way back, years ago, campaigning—or I was up doing that call for her. And she's a teacher, so I called her early in the morning. Like when your husbands and wives are away, you call your family. And I called and said, ""How are things going?"" And she said, ""Fine."" [Laughter] I knew something was—she said, ""Did you read today's paper?"" And I said, ""They don't get the Wilmington News Journal up here in Burlington, Vermont, honey."" She said, ""Headline, top of the fold: 'Biden Poorest Man in Congress.' Is that true?"" [Laughter] I said, ""I don't know what the hell""—but I was all those years, but I had a good salary. I was still making more than most people because I had a Senator's salary. I didn't think you were supposed to make money when you're in the Senate. I thought you were just supposed to take a salary. But, folks, so like many of you, I come from a normal, middle class family. And guess what? We know what it's like when hard times hit. We get it. We get it. And right now think about it. Look what we're doing on education for our kids. One of the reasons I came up with that $5.6 billion for HBCUs is, we've got to make sure they have the same laboratories, the same research capacities as everybody else has, because they can do anything anybody else can do. They just don't have—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. And, folks, one of the reasons why we led the world for so long, we were the first nation in the world to provide universal education, grades 1 through 12. Well, if anybody think if we were doing it for the first time now in the 20—21st century—going into the 20th—from the 20th century going into the second quarter of the 21st century, that we'd say 12 years is enough, do you think 12 years is enough going into 2030, '40, '50? I don't think so. That's why we should have free early education at age 3. And that's why we should have 2 years of community college free. It makes—these things make us stronger. So look, folks, there are bright spots where America is reasserting itself. We made enormous progress in just 20 months. We have so much more to do. Everything is at stake in just 7 days, God willing, for the State and this country that we love. So I call on Democrats and mainstream Republicans and Independents to come together. We can meet the moment together. I truly believe we're just getting started. I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity. So vote. Get out the vote, and win! Vote, vote, vote! May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. God love you all. I mean it. Let's go. Let's do it! No excuses. Thank you.","['hello', 'florida', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'florida', 'audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'youve', 'mother', 'god', 'love', 'got', 'caught',

As my mother would say, ""God love you.""', 'Well, look, folks, I want to—Silvia, thank you for that introduction. I really appreciate it. I really do.', 'And by the way—by the way—Roslynn, who spoke about her battle with cancer, I just want you to know that every one of you—raise your hand if you have any family members who suffer from cancer. Every single audience I speak to.', 'I not long ago lost my son to cancer. He was an attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one standing talking to you, not me. And he was—he volunteered to go to Iraq for a year.', 'Thanks for waving, big guy. [Laughter]', ""And he—unfortunately, his hooch was right next to one of those burn pits. And he came home with stage four glioblastoma, and he passed away. And here's what I decided to do. I decided to make sure we defeat cancer. No, no, no, I'm not joking."", ""Now, here's the deal. What we did was we have a thing in the—I didn't plan—just going to keep you a little longer; I apologize. But what happened was that there's a thing in the Defense Department that has a special agency that does nothing but deal with those things that are needed to keep us safe, like, for example, everything they invented. They're the ones that came up with the internet. They're the ones that came up with a whole range of things that make us much safer."", ""And I decided to set up the same thing at the Department of Health and Human Services that focuses on one thing: defeating cancer—defeating cancer. And we provided an additional $5 billion grant for—to do that. And so we're going to defeat cancer. We really are. There's nothing beyond our capacity."", ""One of the things that bothers me the most about, sort of, what's happened under the other guy's control is that we've sort of lost confidence in ourselves. We—you know, there's nothing we cannot do when we set our mind do it, when we do it together. I mean nothing. Nothing. And so, folks—folks, we are going to beat cancer. And I promise you that."", 'Look, the other thing is that—you know, I tell you what, that Governor of yours, she\'s something else, isn\'t she? She talks about being the shortest Governor. She\'s the tallest Governor I know. She\'s the tallest Governor I know. She\'s the real deal. I mean, she\'s really the real deal. Again, ""God love her,"" as my mom would say.', ""Look, 12 generations at a minimum here in New Mexico. Well, that's only outdone by my Secretary of Interior. But, folks, no one is going fight harder for this State. It's in her DNA."", ""And it's great to be with some Members of Congress. Ben Ray Luján, the Senator, he's a good friend of mine. Done great work. I don't know where Ben is. He's out there somewhere."", ""And you know, the—that woman, what's her name? Stansbury, yes? [Laughter] She's pretty darn good, isn't she? She can really get it done. And now we have a great shot at electing Gabe Vasquez, your Congressman from the second district. And you know—[laughter]—you know, between the two of them, I'm going to—I'll badly need their votes in Congress."", ""I also want to recognize the Cabinet Secretary Deb Haaland. She's the best. She's the best. She's doing an incredible job—an incredible job leading the Department of Interior. A family of 35 generations in New Mexico. [Laughter] First Native American to be serving the United States Cabinet. First one."", ""And I want to thank all the Tribal leaders here today. I look forward to them coming to the White House to the Tribal Nations Summit we're having in a few weeks."", ""Look, folks, in New Mexico, we need to reelect your Governor, to state the obvious. We need to elect the ballot up and down. We've got—look, that's why we're here. We're here for simple reason: 5 days—5 days to go and—until the most important elections in our lifetime. And I—that's not hyperbole. It's going to shape what the next two generations look like. Not a joke. Because so much is changing—so much."", ""It's clear this is not a referendum, this is the choice—a choice—between two vastly different visions of America. I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, an economy that rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well. And when that happens, the wealthy still do very well, man. They don't need our help."", ""And look, it's a fundamental shift, and it's working compared to the MAGA Republican trickle-down economics that Republicans offer. Let's take a look at the facts. When I took office, this economy was in ruins. My predecessor is the first President—the first President—since Herbert Hoover who actually lost more jobs in 4—he had fewer jobs when he left than when he came in. Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. People were really hurting. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses in your State and all across America, they had closed."", ""Today, we're in a much better place, although people are still hurting. We've got more to do, but 10 million jobs created since I've taken office. That's more than any time, with the help of your administration."", ""Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, the lowest it's been in 50 years; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses last year, the highest ever in American history. Thanks to Michelle, there are small businesses in New Mexico—there are more of them now than before the pandemic. And look, guys, New Mexico added 32,000 jobs this past year alone in this State."", ""And by the way—and by the way, you know, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the action we've taken, gas prices are coming down. Here in America at home, they're down to $1.25 since the summer peak of $5. And look, back in June—back in June—they were $5 average price across America. It's a difficult time across America. The country stepped up and did the right thing."", ""But not everyone. I know we have a lot of leases out here in New Mexico for oil companies. And we haven't slowed them down at all. They should be drilling more than they're doing now. If they were drilling more, we'd have more relief at the pump. But the oil industry hasn't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people."", ""One by one, major oil companies reported their record profits this last quarter. Shell—Shell Oil—Shell Oil—they deserve a hard return on their profit. Shell Oil made $9.5 billion in 90 days in the last quarter—the last quarter. Well, guess what? That's been a long—that's twice what they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third-quarter profits this year—this quarter, $18.7 billion. That's more than they made in their 152-year history."", ""Now, look, I want them to make money. That's fine by me. But the last 6 months, the six largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profit, in 200 days."", ""Well, here's the deal: These companies are taking advantage. The average profits they're making—if they did the average profits they've made for the last 20 years, guess what? Your gasoline prices would be down 50 cents a gallon. No, I'm serious. If we're investing in profits that are at a historic rate, prices would come down even further. But instead, they're buying back their own stock, primarily the way executives get paid, and giving their profits to shareholders. But these outrageous profits are the windfalls of war."", 'Look, earlier this week, I made clear that the industry has a choice: either invest in America or pay higher taxes for your excess profits and face restrictions.', ""You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession, last week's GDP report shows the economy is, in fact, still growing. My guess is, the report at the end of this week is going to show that as well."", ""The fact is, the economy grew at 2.6 percent last quarter, although in many—it not feel that way, but business income is up. And guess what? We have created in the United States, just since I've become President, 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Brandnew, 700,000."", ""So the economy is up. Price inflation is down. Real incomes are up. Gas prices are down and need to come down further. Exports are—also up, which means a simple thing: We're making a lot of money in the—in America because of that. Guess what? We're exporting products we made rather than jobs."", ""No, I'm serious. That's why it's up. We're building it in America and exporting it overseas. Not sending the jobs overseas to pay less and bringing it back home."", 'So, folks, here\'s one thing: My predecessor promised—remember he promised ""Infrastructure Week""—you know, ""We\'re going to rebuild the country""? Well, ""Infrastructure Week"" lasted for 4 years—never came. It became a punchline. On my watch—on my watch—with the help of the folks in this room, we turned infrastructure into a decade, a headline.', ""We passed the largest infrastructure bill since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Look, we've invested in our road, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water system, clean water, high-speed internet."", ""Look, folks—and by the way, that includes—for example, I landed in your airport—$7 million at the Albuquerque airport already going in the ground. Look, you know, your Governor is going to make sure that the money—and it will be billions of dollars, not a joke—but billions of dollars are coming for infrastructure here in this State. And she's going to be making sure it's getting out the door right away to projects all across this State."", 'And, folks, look, the American people are beginning to see the benefit of the economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills than before the pandemic. A lot of families are still in trouble. More important, Americans have health insurance more than they had before the pandemic.', ""You know, we pay the highest prescription drug costs of anywhere in the world. The same exact manufacturer of the same exact drug—if you sell it here in Albuquerque or in Washington, DC, it costs more than if you sell it in Paris or London or anywhere else. Not a joke. Not a joke. And it's wrong."", ""Without a single Republican vote in Congress, congressional Democrats, we finally beat Big Pharma. And here's the result. Beginning January 1, seniors on Medicare—their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs can—no matter what it costs, no matter how much it costs, it cannot be higher than $2,000 a year, even if it's a $10,000 cancer drug or $12,000."", ""Look—and one more thing: If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, beginning next year, because of the bill we passed, they're going to have to write a check to Medicare for the difference between what they charge and what—[applause]. I've been trying this for 22 years. Finally beat them."", ""And by the way, last year, they raised the price of 1,200 drugs they manufacture faster than the rate of inflation. But guess what? It's stopping now, man."", ""One more significant change. We're capping the cost of insulin. For those of you who know somebody who has diabetes and had to take insulin, well, guess what? It only costs them 10 bucks to make it. They're not going to be able to charge more than $35 for it, instead of $400. That's the law. That's not a joke. And I'm going to make sure that 35-buck limit is for everybody who needs it; it's not just seniors."", ""And, folks, on top of these actions, earlier this month we lowered the cost of hearing aids. You know, it costs—you know what we're saving people? You go into Walgreens or Walmarts—this is what it's going to save. It's going to save $3,000 for a pair. No, I'm not joking. Three thousand bucks. Because you go straight and then get it at the counter."", 'And look—and on top of that, I\'m doing away with unfair hidden fees, known as ""junk fees,"" like surprise banking overdraft. All of a sudden, you find you\'ve got—I just did it. You bounce a check; you have to pay 35 bucks or 50 bucks. You have an excess credit card fee of 50 bucks if you\'re late on your payment. Ending those. They\'re gone.', ""And by the way, those of you who are going to be, you know, making trips to see your relatives back East or out West, further out west, you buy a plane ticket, and you find out after the fact your cost of your baggage, the cost of having your kid sitting next to you, the cost of being—having to reschedule is out of this world. No more. No more. No hidden fees. They've got to state what it is."", 'The Department of Transportation is working on rules that are going to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all the fees upfront. A little truth in spending, you know?', ""Now, look, Republicans want to pass a tax break for the wealthy. They're very upset. You know, I mean, guess what I did? I actually signed a law that said those 55 corporations that in 2020 and beyond made $40 billion and paid zero in taxes, my God, they now have to pay 15 percent. That's less than you make. You pay more than that. And they're whining. They're whining."", ""We're passing tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on their home, do a whole range of things to weatherize, saving on average, experts say, at least $500 per family. But guess what? These things we've promised, well, it's to ease the burden—ease the burden on people."", 'And one of the burden—how many of you have any student debt?', 'Audience member. Right here!', 'The President. Say goodbye. Say goodbye.', ""I promised that we'd lower $10,000 minimum if you have a—if you had a loan. And by the way, 90 percent people who earn less than 75 grand will get this. That's what—that's where it's going."", ""But here's the deal. Here's the deal: Thanks to her in New Mexico, this is the first State in the nation to make it so every citizen of the State can go to college or trade school tuition-free."", ""I took action on the Federal level.

I really appreciate it. I really do. And by the way—by the way—Roslynn, who spoke about her battle with cancer, I just want you to know that every one of you—raise your hand if you have any family members who suffer from cancer. Every single audience I speak to. I not long ago lost my son to cancer. He was an attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one standing talking to you, not me. And he was—he volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Thanks for waving, big guy. [Laughter] And he—unfortunately, his hooch was right next to one of those burn pits. And he came home with stage four glioblastoma, and he passed away. And here's what I decided to do. I decided to make sure we defeat cancer. No, no, no, I'm not joking. Now, here's the deal. What we did was we have a thing in the—I didn't plan—just going to keep you a little longer; I apologize. But what happened was that there's a thing in the Defense Department that has a special agency that does nothing but deal with those things that are needed to keep us safe, like, for example, everything they invented. They're the ones that came up with the internet. They're the ones that came up with a whole range of things that make us much safer. And I decided to set up the same thing at the Department of Health and Human Services that focuses on one thing: defeating cancer—defeating cancer. And we provided an additional $5 billion grant for—to do that. And so we're going to defeat cancer. We really are. There's nothing beyond our capacity. One of the things that bothers me the most about, sort of, what's happened under the other guy's control is that we've sort of lost confidence in ourselves. We—you know, there's nothing we cannot do when we set our mind do it, when we do it together. I mean nothing. Nothing. And so, folks—folks, we are going to beat cancer. And I promise you that. Look, the other thing is that—you know, I tell you what, that Governor of yours, she's something else, isn't she? She talks about being the shortest Governor. She's the tallest Governor I know. She's the tallest Governor I know. She's the real deal. I mean, she's really the real deal. Again, ""God love her,"" as my mom would say. Look, 12 generations at a minimum here in New Mexico. Well, that's only outdone by my Secretary of Interior. But, folks, no one is going fight harder for this State. It's in her DNA. And it's great to be with some Members of Congress. Ben Ray Luján, the Senator, he's a good friend of mine. Done great work. I don't know where Ben is. He's out there somewhere. And you know, the—that woman, what's her name? Stansbury, yes? [Laughter] She's pretty darn good, isn't she? She can really get it done. And now we have a great shot at electing Gabe Vasquez, your Congressman from the second district. And you know—[laughter]—you know, between the two of them, I'm going to—I'll badly need their votes in Congress. I also want to recognize the Cabinet Secretary Deb Haaland. She's the best. She's the best. She's doing an incredible job—an incredible job leading the Department of Interior. A family of 35 generations in New Mexico. [Laughter] First Native American to be serving the United States Cabinet. First one. And I want to thank all the Tribal leaders here today. I look forward to them coming to the White House to the Tribal Nations Summit we're having in a few weeks. Look, folks, in New Mexico, we need to reelect your Governor, to state the obvious. We need to elect the ballot up and down. We've got—look, that's why we're here. We're here for simple reason: 5 days—5 days to go and—until the most important elections in our lifetime. And I—that's not hyperbole. It's going to shape what the next two generations look like. Not a joke. Because so much is changing—so much. It's clear this is not a referendum, this is the choice—a choice—between two vastly different visions of America. I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, an economy that rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well. And when that happens, the wealthy still do very well, man. They don't need our help. And look, it's a fundamental shift, and it's working compared to the MAGA Republican trickle-down economics that Republicans offer. Let's take a look at the facts. When I took office, this economy was in ruins. My predecessor is the first President—the first President—since Herbert Hoover who actually lost more jobs in 4—he had fewer jobs when he left than when he came in. Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. People were really hurting. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses in your State and all across America, they had closed. Today, we're in a much better place, although people are still hurting. We've got more to do, but 10 million jobs created since I've taken office. That's more than any time, with the help of your administration. Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, the lowest it's been in 50 years; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses last year, the highest ever in American history. Thanks to Michelle, there are small businesses in New Mexico—there are more of them now than before the pandemic. And look, guys, New Mexico added 32,000 jobs this past year alone in this State. And by the way—and by the way, you know, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the action we've taken, gas prices are coming down. Here in America at home, they're down to $1.25 since the summer peak of $5. And look, back in June—back in June—they were $5 average price across America. It's a difficult time across America. The country stepped up and did the right thing. But not everyone. I know we have a lot of leases out here in New Mexico for oil companies. And we haven't slowed them down at all. They should be drilling more than they're doing now. If they were drilling more, we'd have more relief at the pump. But the oil industry hasn't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people. One by one, major oil companies reported their record profits this last quarter. Shell—Shell Oil—Shell Oil—they deserve a hard return on their profit. Shell Oil made $9.5 billion in 90 days in the last quarter—the last quarter. Well, guess what? That's been a long—that's twice what they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third-quarter profits this year—this quarter, $18.7 billion. That's more than they made in their 152-year history. Now, look, I want them to make money. That's fine by me. But the last 6 months, the six largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profit, in 200 days. Well, here's the deal: These companies are taking advantage. The average profits they're making—if they did the average profits they've made for the last 20 years, guess what? Your gasoline prices would be down 50 cents a gallon. No, I'm serious. If we're investing in profits that are at a historic rate, prices would come down even further. But instead, they're buying back their own stock, primarily the way executives get paid, and giving their profits to shareholders. But these outrageous profits are the windfalls of war. Look, earlier this week, I made clear that the industry has a choice: either invest in America or pay higher taxes for your excess profits and face restrictions. You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession, last week's GDP report shows the economy is, in fact, still growing. My guess is, the report at the end of this week is going to show that as well. The fact is, the economy grew at 2.6 percent last quarter, although in many—it not feel that way, but business income is up. And guess what? We have created in the United States, just since I've become President, 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Brandnew, 700,000. So the economy is up. Price inflation is down. Real incomes are up. Gas prices are down and need to come down further. Exports are—also up, which means a simple thing: We're making a lot of money in the—in America because of that. Guess what? We're exporting products we made rather than jobs. No, I'm serious. That's why it's up. We're building it in America and exporting it overseas. Not sending the jobs overseas to pay less and bringing it back home. So, folks, here's one thing: My predecessor promised—remember he promised ""Infrastructure Week""—you know, ""We're going to rebuild the country""? Well, ""Infrastructure Week"" lasted for 4 years—never came. It became a punchline. On my watch—on my watch—with the help of the folks in this room, we turned infrastructure into a decade, a headline. We passed the largest infrastructure bill since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Look, we've invested in our road, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water system, clean water, high-speed internet. Look, folks—and by the way, that includes—for example, I landed in your airport—$7 million at the Albuquerque airport already going in the ground. Look, you know, your Governor is going to make sure that the money—and it will be billions of dollars, not a joke—but billions of dollars are coming for infrastructure here in this State. And she's going to be making sure it's getting out the door right away to projects all across this State. And, folks, look, the American people are beginning to see the benefit of the economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills than before the pandemic. A lot of families are still in trouble. More important, Americans have health insurance more than they had before the pandemic. You know, we pay the highest prescription drug costs of anywhere in the world. The same exact manufacturer of the same exact drug—if you sell it here in Albuquerque or in Washington, DC, it costs more than if you sell it in Paris or London or anywhere else. Not a joke. Not a joke. And it's wrong. Without a single Republican vote in Congress, congressional Democrats, we finally beat Big Pharma. And here's the result. Beginning January 1, seniors on Medicare—their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs can—no matter what it costs, no matter how much it costs, it cannot be higher than $2,000 a year, even if it's a $10,000 cancer drug or $12,000. Look—and one more thing: If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, beginning next year, because of the bill we passed, they're going to have to write a check to Medicare for the difference between what they charge and what—[applause]. I've been trying this for 22 years. Finally beat them. And by the way, last year, they raised the price of 1,200 drugs they manufacture faster than the rate of inflation. But guess what? It's stopping now, man. One more significant change. We're capping the cost of insulin. For those of you who know somebody who has diabetes and had to take insulin, well, guess what? It only costs them 10 bucks to make it. They're not going to be able to charge more than $35 for it, instead of $400. That's the law. That's not a joke. And I'm going to make sure that 35-buck limit is for everybody who needs it; it's not just seniors. And, folks, on top of these actions, earlier this month we lowered the cost of hearing aids. You know, it costs—you know what we're saving people? You go into Walgreens or Walmarts—this is what it's going to save. It's going to save $3,000 for a pair. No, I'm not joking. Three thousand bucks. Because you go straight and then get it at the counter. And look—and on top of that, I'm doing away with unfair hidden fees, known as ""junk fees,"" like surprise banking overdraft. All of a sudden, you find you've got—I just did it. You bounce a check; you have to pay 35 bucks or 50 bucks. You have an excess credit card fee of 50 bucks if you're late on your payment. Ending those. They're gone. And by the way, those of you who are going to be, you know, making trips to see your relatives back East or out West, further out west, you buy a plane ticket, and you find out after the fact your cost of your baggage, the cost of having your kid sitting next to you, the cost of being—having to reschedule is out of this world. No more. No more. No hidden fees. They've got to state what it is. The Department of Transportation is working on rules that are going to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all the fees upfront. A little truth in spending, you know? Now, look, Republicans want to pass a tax break for the wealthy. They're very upset. You know, I mean, guess what I did? I actually signed a law that said those 55 corporations that in 2020 and beyond made $40 billion and paid zero in taxes, my God, they now have to pay 15 percent. That's less than you make. You pay more than that. And they're whining. They're whining. We're passing tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on their home, do a whole range of things to weatherize, saving on average, experts say, at least $500 per family. But guess what? These things we've promised, well, it's to ease the burden—ease the burden on people. And one of the burden—how many of you have any student debt? Audience member. Right here! The President. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. I promised that we'd lower $10,000 minimum if you have a—if you had a loan. And by the way, 90 percent people who earn less than 75 grand will get this. That's what—that's where it's going. But here's the deal. Here's the deal: Thanks to her in New Mexico, this is the first State in the nation to make it so every citizen of the State can go to college or trade school tuition-free. I took action on the Federal level. We're giving up 20 billion—$20,000 of relief for people with student debt, $10,000 for most folks, and another 10 [10,000]* if you had a Pell grant. Look, what have the Republicans done? They moaned about it. They challenged it in court. Republican Governors are trying to stop it, and they're going to put a lot of people in a position—buy a home, start a business, and so much more when that debt's relieved. Folks, take a look at who's complaining. This I find fascinating. This I find fascinating. The people who are complaining—the MAGA Republicans who sit in Congress—had hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief forgiven. But they're now attacking middle class Americans and student relief programs. Who the hell do they think they are? Look—and by the way, you know, you have one Member from South Florida. He got a—he had $1.2 million forgiven—$2.1 million forgiven. You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene and the—— Audience members. Boo! The President. She had $178,000 forgiven. Look, I've been able to do all this by reducing the Federal deficit, the very deficit the Republicans voted against—voted against—every single one, when I passed the Inflation—when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Last year alone, under our leadership, the Democrats in Congress—the Democrats in Congress now, without any Republican vote—reduced the deficit by $1 trillion, 400 billion. One year. More than any time in American history. We cut the Federal debt in half. A fact. All of this, last year, follows a historic drop the year before, when I was first-year President: $350 billion reduced. And we're going to do—further reduce the deficit over the next decade by another $250 billion. And a big part of this because of—corporations are finally having to pay a tax. And one more thing. For the first time in a decade, seniors—seniors on Social Security checks are—they're going to go up, and Medicare is going to go down. And I'll protect your Social Security. I'll protect Medicare, protect you. [At this point, the President took a newspaper from the podium and held it up to read as follows.] Headline, New York Times—arrived, flying out here—headline: ""GOP signals plan to shrink Social Security."" They're saying it out loud.

Audience members. Boo! The President. They're just saying; they're not even hiding it. They're not even hiding it. And by the way—and by the way, they passed a—under that fellow Trump, they passed a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for and affected only the top 1 percent of the American public. Come on. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, God bless his soul—[laughter]—and his fellow MAGA Republicans say their number-one priority—these guys are saying it out loud; they're telling you what they're going to do—number-one priority is deny Medicare the right to negotiate drug prices, which we just passed; give the power back to Big Pharma so they can continue to rip us off with prescription drugs. The $2,000 cap on prescriptions for seniors—max—gone. A $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 a year for millions of you who are under the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they're still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean anyone with a preexisting condition would lose their insurance. Folks, the protections are gone as well.

He puts Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. Here's what that means: Every 5 years, if they gain control and pass it—I'll veto it, but if they somehow were able to do it—Congress will have to vote either to cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security and Medicare. If they don't do anything, it goes. No, not a joke. It's no longer an entitlement program. It means it's on the block every year. Then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the United States Senator. Audience members. Boo! The President. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. No, I'm serious. He says every single year, Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block. Every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. That's what they're—that's the law they're introducing. And it's not just Social Security and Medicare. He wants veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget to be put at risk. You know, they're saying if we can't cooperate in cutting Social Security and Medicare, one more thing, they're going to shut down the Government. Now, some of you would remember when I was Vice President and Barack was President, the leader of the Republicans did that in the Senate. I negotiated Christmas Eve—I mean, New Year's Eve day, and we finally settled it, and they backed down.

And they go far as threatening that default, that alone has consequences. There's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos and more damage to the economy than this. And folks, look, we heard Republicans say they want to make permanent the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court's decision on abortion. Audience members. Boo! The President. Denying a woman's right to choose. Well, no matter what, by the way, whether it's rape, incest—anyway, you know it all. The Republican Congress already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose. Michelle's opponent has promised to do the same thing here in New Mexico, saying he'll pass a Statewide ban. Instead, Michelle repealed the 1969 law on the books that criminalized abortion. Look, the bottom line is this: If Michelle's opponent wins, the right to choose here in New Mexico is going to go away. And then if Republicans gain control of the Congress and pass a nationwide ban, as the Senator from South Carolina wants to do, the ban on abortion, I will veto it. It won't happen. But if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to be able to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Look, we passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years without any help from them. The NRA fought us tooth and nail. Your Governor is committed to protecting public safety so she got gun legislation passed here in New Mexico: universal background checks—as if that's a problem; ""red flag"" laws, as my son who was attorney general, was the first one to get passed in the State of Delaware, keeping the guns out of the hands of those who harm themselves. She doubled State spending for public safety and raised salaries for state police, which I provided billions of dollars for people to be able to do. Many of her opponents—meanwhile, her opponents have the highest possible rating from the NRA and is against a simple measure to get dangerous weapons off the street. And one more thing, I'm coming back and—I got it done once; I'm going to do it again—eliminate assault weapons. Look, folks, they travel—that bullet travels five times as fast as something coming out of a muzzle of a gun. And guess what? Guess what? I don't know a whole lot of deer running around wearing Kevlar vests. And what the hell are we talking about here? What are we talking about? But Republican extremist isn't—extremism is not limited to social programs and the economy. They're going after your right to vote and how we—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, not a joke. Mark my words. They're going after your right to vote and who's going to count the vote. Folks, as I spoke about this last night, democracy is on the ballot this year in America. It is. It genuinely is. It's literally on the ballot, folks. You know, you have over 350 Republican candidates for everything from state auditor all the way to secretary of state to Governor who are election deniers, who say that they, in fact, do not believe the last election was fair, even—all—every single appeal that took place was—they ruled against them. Well, guess what? Guess what? Let me close with this: It's been a rough 4 or 5 years for hard-working Americans. A lot of families, things are still pretty darn tough. But there are bright spots, where America is reasserting itself. We've made enormous progress in just 20 months, but we have more to do. Everything is literally at state and just—at stake, and it's just 5 days, in this country that we love so dearly. You know, when I got elected, I went to the first G-7 meeting, which is the largest democratic economies in the world, in London. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" I know all these people because I've been involved for years, I'd been chairman of Foreign Relations, and I did a lot of foreign policy for Barack. And one of them turned to me and said, ""For how long?"" Not a joke. Macron said, ""For how long?"" Then another head of state said to me: ""What would you say, Mr. President—what would you say, Joe, if you picked up the paper tomorrow morning after this meeting and found out that a crazy mob stormed the British Parliament, broke down the doors of the House of the Parliament, and killed two cops in the process to overturn an election? What would you say?"" Imagine if we read that in the paper tomorrow, that that happened in Germany or France or England. We'd really wonder about it. Well, we're scaring the living hell out of the rest of the world by the way things are acting. They look to us. No, no, no, not—not a joke. They look to us. And guess what? The Democrats and mainstream Republicans and Independents, if we come together, we can meet this moment together. It's not all Republicans. It's not all of them. And I truly believe we're just getting started, because I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America! And there's nothing, nothing, nothing we—beyond our capacity if we do it together. Together. So vote! Get out the vote. Vote, vote, vote, vote. And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Do you all have—do you have chairs to sit in? You've been standing all this time? As my mother would say, ""God love you."" Well, look, folks, I want to—Silvia, thank you for that introduction. I really appreciate it. I really do. And by the way—by the way—Roslynn, who spoke about her battle with cancer, I just want you to know that every one of you—raise your hand if you have any family members who suffer from cancer. Every single audience I speak to. I not long ago lost my son to cancer. He was an attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one standing talking to you, not me. And he was—he volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Thanks for waving, big guy. [Laughter] And he—unfortunately, his hooch was right next to one of those burn pits. And he came home with stage four glioblastoma, and he passed away. And here's what I decided to do. I decided to make sure we defeat cancer. No, no, no, I'm not joking. Now, here's the deal. What we did was we have a thing in the—I didn't plan—just going to keep you a little longer; I apologize. But what happened was that there's a thing in the Defense Department that has a special agency that does nothing but deal with those things that are needed to keep us safe, like, for example, everything they invented. They're the ones that came up with the internet. They're the ones that came up with a whole range of things that make us much safer. And I decided to set up the same thing at the Department of Health and Human Services that focuses on one thing: defeating cancer—defeating cancer. And we provided an additional $5 billion grant for—to do that. And so we're going to defeat cancer. We really are. There's nothing beyond our capacity. One of the things that bothers me the most about, sort of, what's happened under the other guy's control is that we've sort of lost confidence in ourselves. We—you know, there's nothing we cannot do when we set our mind do it, when we do it together. I mean nothing. Nothing. And so, folks—folks, we are going to beat cancer. And I promise you that. Look, the other thing is that—you know, I tell you what, that Governor of yours, she's something else, isn't she? She talks about being the shortest Governor. She's the tallest Governor I know. She's the tallest Governor I know. She's the real deal. I mean, she's really the real deal. Again, ""God love her,"" as my mom would say. Look, 12 generations at a minimum here in New Mexico. Well, that's only outdone by my Secretary of Interior. But, folks, no one is going fight harder for this State. It's in her DNA. And it's great to be with some Members of Congress. Ben Ray Luján, the Senator, he's a good friend of mine. Done great work. I don't know where Ben is. He's out there somewhere. And you know, the—that woman, what's her name? Stansbury, yes? [Laughter] She's pretty darn good, isn't she? She can really get it done. And now we have a great shot at electing Gabe Vasquez, your Congressman from the second district. And you know—[laughter]—you know, between the two of them, I'm going to—I'll badly need their votes in Congress. I also want to recognize the Cabinet Secretary Deb Haaland. She's the best. She's the best. She's doing an incredible job—an incredible job leading the Department of Interior. A family of 35 generations in New Mexico. [Laughter] First Native American to be serving the United States Cabinet. First one. And I want to thank all the Tribal leaders here today. I look forward to them coming to the White House to the Tribal Nations Summit we're having in a few weeks. Look, folks, in New Mexico, we need to reelect your Governor, to state the obvious. We need to elect the ballot up and down. We've got—look, that's why we're here. We're here for simple reason: 5 days—5 days to go and—until the most important elections in our lifetime. And I—that's not hyperbole. It's going to shape what the next two generations look like. Not a joke. Because so much is changing—so much. It's clear this is not a referendum, this is the choice—a choice—between two vastly different visions of America. I've said from the beginning that my objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, an economy that rewards work, not just wealth; an economy that works for everybody so the poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well. And when that happens, the wealthy still do very well, man. They don't need our help. And look, it's a fundamental shift, and it's working compared to the MAGA Republican trickle-down economics that Republicans offer. Let's take a look at the facts. When I took office, this economy was in ruins. My predecessor is the first President—the first President—since Herbert Hoover who actually lost more jobs in 4—he had fewer jobs when he left than when he came in. Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. People were really hurting. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses in your State and all across America, they had closed. Today, we're in a much better place, although people are still hurting. We've got more to do, but 10 million jobs created since I've taken office. That's more than any time, with the help of your administration. Unemployment rate is 3.5 percent, the lowest it's been in 50 years; 5.4 million Americans applied to start new businesses last year, the highest ever in American history. Thanks to Michelle, there are small businesses in New Mexico—there are more of them now than before the pandemic. And look, guys, New Mexico added 32,000 jobs this past year alone in this State. And by the way—and by the way, you know, Putin's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring around the world. But because of the action we've taken, gas prices are coming down. Here in America at home, they're down to $1.25 since the summer peak of $5. And look, back in June—back in June—they were $5 average price across America. It's a difficult time across America. The country stepped up and did the right thing. But not everyone. I know we have a lot of leases out here in New Mexico for oil companies. And we haven't slowed them down at all. They should be drilling more than they're doing now. If they were drilling more, we'd have more relief at the pump. But the oil industry hasn't met their commitment to invest in America and support the American people. One by one, major oil companies reported their record profits this last quarter. Shell—Shell Oil—Shell Oil—they deserve a hard return on their profit. Shell Oil made $9.5 billion in 90 days in the last quarter—the last quarter. Well, guess what? That's been a long—that's twice what they made in the third quarter of last year. Exxon's third-quarter profits this year—this quarter, $18.7 billion. That's more than they made in their 152-year history. Now, look, I want them to make money. That's fine by me. But the last 6 months, the six largest oil companies made more than $100 billion in profit, in 200 days. Well, here's the deal: These companies are taking advantage. The average profits they're making—if they did the average profits they've made for the last 20 years, guess what? Your gasoline prices would be down 50 cents a gallon. No, I'm serious. If we're investing in profits that are at a historic rate, prices would come down even further. But instead, they're buying back their own stock, primarily the way executives get paid, and giving their profits to shareholders. But these outrageous profits are the windfalls of war. Look, earlier this week, I made clear that the industry has a choice: either invest in America or pay higher taxes for your excess profits and face restrictions. You know, it's amazing. Even though my Republican friends in Congress seem to be hoping for a recession, last week's GDP report shows the economy is, in fact, still growing. My guess is, the report at the end of this week is going to show that as well. The fact is, the economy grew at 2.6 percent last quarter, although in many—it not feel that way, but business income is up. And guess what? We have created in the United States, just since I've become President, 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Brandnew, 700,000. So the economy is up. Price inflation is down. Real incomes are up. Gas prices are down and need to come down further. Exports are—also up, which means a simple thing: We're making a lot of money in the—in America because of that. Guess what? We're exporting products we made rather than jobs. No, I'm serious. That's why it's up. We're building it in America and exporting it overseas. Not sending the jobs overseas to pay less and bringing it back home. So, folks, here's one thing: My predecessor promised—remember he promised ""Infrastructure Week""—you know, ""We're going to rebuild the country""? Well, ""Infrastructure Week"" lasted for 4 years—never came. It became a punchline. On my watch—on my watch—with the help of the folks in this room, we turned infrastructure into a decade, a headline. We passed the largest infrastructure bill since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. Look, we've invested in our road, highways, bridges, railroads, ports, airports, water system, clean water, high-speed internet. Look, folks—and by the way, that includes—for example, I landed in your airport—$7 million at the Albuquerque airport already going in the ground. Look, you know, your Governor is going to make sure that the money—and it will be billions of dollars, not a joke—but billions of dollars are coming for infrastructure here in this State. And she's going to be making sure it's getting out the door right away to projects all across this State. And, folks, look, the American people are beginning to see the benefit of the economy that works for them. Families have more net worth than before the pandemic. Fewer families are behind on their mortgages, their credit card bills than before the pandemic. A lot of families are still in trouble. More important, Americans have health insurance more than they had before the pandemic. You know, we pay the highest prescription drug costs of anywhere in the world. The same exact manufacturer of the same exact drug—if you sell it here in Albuquerque or in Washington, DC, it costs more than if you sell it in Paris or London or anywhere else. Not a joke. Not a joke. And it's wrong. Without a single Republican vote in Congress, congressional Democrats, we finally beat Big Pharma. And here's the result. Beginning January 1, seniors on Medicare—their out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs can—no matter what it costs, no matter how much it costs, it cannot be higher than $2,000 a year, even if it's a $10,000 cancer drug or $12,000. Look—and one more thing: If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, beginning next year, because of the bill we passed, they're going to have to write a check to Medicare for the difference between what they charge and what—[applause]. I've been trying this for 22 years. Finally beat them. And by the way, last year, they raised the price of 1,200 drugs they manufacture faster than the rate of inflation. But guess what? It's stopping now, man. One more significant change. We're capping the cost of insulin. For those of you who know somebody who has diabetes and had to take insulin, well, guess what? It only costs them 10 bucks to make it. They're not going to be able to charge more than $35 for it, instead of $400. That's the law. That's not a joke. And I'm going to make sure that 35-buck limit is for everybody who needs it; it's not just seniors. And, folks, on top of these actions, earlier this month we lowered the cost of hearing aids. You know, it costs—you know what we're saving people? You go into Walgreens or Walmarts—this is what it's going to save. It's going to save $3,000 for a pair. No, I'm not joking. Three thousand bucks. Because you go straight and then get it at the counter. And look—and on top of that, I'm doing away with unfair hidden fees, known as ""junk fees,"" like surprise banking overdraft. All of a sudden, you find you've got—I just did it. You bounce a check; you have to pay 35 bucks or 50 bucks. You have an excess credit card fee of 50 bucks if you're late on your payment. Ending those. They're gone. And by the way, those of you who are going to be, you know, making trips to see your relatives back East or out West, further out west, you buy a plane ticket, and you find out after the fact your cost of your baggage, the cost of having your kid sitting next to you, the cost of being—having to reschedule is out of this world. No more. No more. No hidden fees. They've got to state what it is. The Department of Transportation is working on rules that are going to require airlines and travel sites to disclose all the fees upfront. A little truth in spending, you know? Now, look, Republicans want to pass a tax break for the wealthy. They're very upset. You know, I mean, guess what I did? I actually signed a law that said those 55 corporations that in 2020 and beyond made $40 billion and paid zero in taxes, my God, they now have to pay 15 percent. That's less than you make. You pay more than that. And they're whining. They're whining. We're passing tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on their home, do a whole range of things to weatherize, saving on average, experts say, at least $500 per family. But guess what? These things we've promised, well, it's to ease the burden—ease the burden on people. And one of the burden—how many of you have any student debt? Audience member. Right here! The President. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. I promised that we'd lower $10,000 minimum if you have a—if you had a loan. And by the way, 90 percent people who earn less than 75 grand will get this. That's what—that's where it's going. But here's the deal. Here's the deal: Thanks to her in New Mexico, this is the first State in the nation to make it so every citizen of the State can go to college or trade school tuition-free. I took action on the Federal level. We're giving up 20 billion—$20,000 of relief for people with student debt, $10,000 for most folks, and another 10 [10,000]* if you had a Pell grant. Look, what have the Republicans done? They moaned about it. They challenged it in court. Republican Governors are trying to stop it, and they're going to put a lot of people in a position—buy a home, start a business, and so much more when that debt's relieved. Folks, take a look at who's complaining. This I find fascinating. This I find fascinating. The people who are complaining—the MAGA Republicans who sit in Congress—had hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief forgiven. But they're now attacking middle class Americans and student relief programs. Who the hell do they think they are? Look—and by the way, you know, you have one Member from South Florida. He got a—he had $1.2 million forgiven—$2.1 million forgiven. You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene and the—— Audience members. Boo! The President. She had $178,000 forgiven. Look, I've been able to do all this by reducing the Federal deficit, the very deficit the Republicans voted against—voted against—every single one, when I passed the Inflation—when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. Last year alone, under our leadership, the Democrats in Congress—the Democrats in Congress now, without any Republican vote—reduced the deficit by $1 trillion, 400 billion. One year. More than any time in American history. We cut the Federal debt in half. A fact. All of this, last year, follows a historic drop the year before, when I was first-year President: $350 billion reduced. And we're going to do—further reduce the deficit over the next decade by another $250 billion. And a big part of this because of—corporations are finally having to pay a tax. And one more thing. For the first time in a decade, seniors—seniors on Social Security checks are—they're going to go up, and Medicare is going to go down. And I'll protect your Social Security. I'll protect Medicare, protect you. [At this point, the President took a newspaper from the podium and held it up to read as follows.] Headline, New York Times—arrived, flying out here—headline: ""GOP signals plan to shrink Social Security."" They're saying it out loud. Congress—""congressional Republicans eyeing midterm election victory that could hand them control the House and Senate have embraced plans to reduce Federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, including cutting benefits for retirees and raising the retirement age."" Audience members. Boo! The President. They're just saying; they're not even hiding it. They're not even hiding it. And by the way—and by the way, they passed a—under that fellow Trump, they passed a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for and affected only the top 1 percent of the American public. Come on. Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, God bless his soul—[laughter]—and his fellow MAGA Republicans say their number-one priority—these guys are saying it out loud; they're telling you what they're going to do—number-one priority is deny Medicare the right to negotiate drug prices, which we just passed; give the power back to Big Pharma so they can continue to rip us off with prescription drugs. The $2,000 cap on prescriptions for seniors—max—gone. A $35-a-month cap on insulin for seniors—gone. Savings on health care premiums of $800 a year for millions of you who are under the Affordable Care Act—gone. And of course, they're still determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would mean anyone with a preexisting condition would lose their insurance. Folks, the protections are gone as well. Tax credits for lower energy bills—gone. Corporate minimum tax of 15 percent—gone. Under the Republican plan, many of the biggest corporations are going to go back to paying zero in taxes, as they did, as I told you earlier, 55 of them paying—making $40 billion, paid nothing. Look, folks, that's their plan. It's reckless, and it's irresponsible. It would make inflation considerably worse, badly hurt working class and middle class Americans. That's not all. Now, I'm told by the Republicans that unless I support, between election day and the end of the year—unless I support reducing Social Security and Medicare—guess what? Audience member. No! The President. Oh, I guarantee you. I guarantee you, not a shot. Look, Senator Rick Scott, who is in charge of elected Republicans, the distinguished Senator from Florida, he has a plan. He puts Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. Here's what that means: Every 5 years, if they gain control and pass it—I'll veto it, but if they somehow were able to do it—Congress will have to vote either to cut, reduce, or completely eliminate Social Security and Medicare. If they don't do anything, it goes. No, not a joke. It's no longer an entitlement program. It means it's on the block every year. Then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the United States Senator. Audience members. Boo! The President. He thinks 5 years is too long to wait. No, I'm serious. He says every single year, Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block. Every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. That's what they're—that's the law they're introducing. And it's not just Social Security and Medicare. He wants veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget to be put at risk. You know, they're saying if we can't cooperate in cutting Social Security and Medicare, one more thing, they're going to shut down the Government. Now, some of you would remember when I was Vice President and Barack was President, the leader of the Republicans did that in the Senate. I negotiated Christmas Eve—I mean, New Year's Eve day, and we finally settled it, and they backed down. But even though it didn't happen, our credit rating as a nation dropped, plummeted, and we got hurt badly. So, you know, going to let us to default on a debt—that's totally irresponsible. And they go far as threatening that default, that alone has consequences. There's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos and more damage to the economy than this. And folks, look, we heard Republicans say they want to make permanent the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court's decision on abortion. Audience members. Boo! The President. Denying a woman's right to choose. Well, no matter what, by the way, whether it's rape, incest—anyway, you know it all. The Republican Congress already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose. Michelle's opponent has promised to do the same thing here in New Mexico, saying he'll pass a Statewide ban. Instead, Michelle repealed the 1969 law on the books that criminalized abortion. Look, the bottom line is this: If Michelle's opponent wins, the right to choose here in New Mexico is going to go away. And then if Republicans gain control of the Congress and pass a nationwide ban, as the Senator from South Carolina wants to do, the ban on abortion, I will veto it. It won't happen. But if we elect more Senate Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to be able to codify Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Look, we passed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years without any help from them. The NRA fought us tooth and nail. Your Governor is committed to protecting public safety so she got gun legislation passed here in New Mexico: universal background checks—as if that's a problem; ""red flag"" laws, as my son who was attorney general, was the first one to get passed in the State of Delaware, keeping the guns out of the hands of those who harm themselves. She doubled State spending for public safety and raised salaries for state police, which I provided billions of dollars for people to be able to do. Many of her opponents—meanwhile, her opponents have the highest possible rating from the NRA and is against a simple measure to get dangerous weapons off the street. And one more thing, I'm coming back and—I got it done once; I'm going to do it again—eliminate assault weapons. Look, folks, they travel—that bullet travels five times as fast as something coming out of a muzzle of a gun. And guess what? Guess what? I don't know a whole lot of deer running around wearing Kevlar vests. And what the hell are we talking about here? What are we talking about? But Republican extremist isn't—extremism is not limited to social programs and the economy. They're going after your right to vote and how we—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, not a joke. Mark my words. They're going after your right to vote and who's going to count the vote. Folks, as I spoke about this last night, democracy is on the ballot this year in America. It is. It genuinely is. It's literally on the ballot, folks.

10,"November 03, 2022","['The President. Thank you. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you.', 'Now, I have to start off—my mother would be very upset if I had my—you never have your back to someone when you speak. I apologize. My back is going to be to you. [Laughter] I apologize.', 'Audience members. We love you.', ""The President. But thank you. Now, you can take care of all this, right, you guys? You're going to take care of it all? All right."", ""Well, folks, I tell you what, it's great to see such a wonderful crowd. Hello, Oceanside! Hello, hello, hello."", ""Well—[laughter]—it's great to be with Congressman Levin. And you know, they told me there were something like four or five hundred people who couldn't get in."", '[At this point, the President noticed an audience member wearing an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers T-shirt.]', 'IBEW, yes. [Applause]', ""They couldn't get in, and they had to go home. And now I understand why there wasn't any room. [Laughter]"", 'Well, thank you very much. You know—you know, the fact of the matter is that——', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. It's great to be with Congressman Mike. You know, this guy delivers. He delivers. He lowers costs for families, caring for our veterans, protecting the environment. These are big deals. Rebuilding our infrastructure, protecting Social Security and Medicare. And he's fighting to protect democracy."", 'Look, we need to reelect Mike, and we need to reelect all the Democrats who were mentioned for statehouse—a Philly girl huh?', 'Audience member. Yeah!', 'The President. She has her sign saying, ""Philly Girl."" [Laughter] That\'s right.', ""And—but all kidding aside, you know, all the State legislative races, all the local races, they are critically, critically, critically important. Not a joke. They're going to determine whether our democracy is sustained. The other team is looking to do some things that don't allow for the way in which we count our votes. They—things are different these days. And——"", 'Audience member. Bring Brittney Griner home!', ""The President. I'm trying to bring her home. And I've been talking to—[applause]—by the way, I've been talking with Brittney's wife, and we're in constant contact. We're not giving up. I think Mr. Putin—well, it's a long story. But I—[laughter]."", 'Well, look—look—by the way, our friends in Los Angeles, we need to elect Karen Bass, by the way, mayor.', 'Five days! Five days until one of the most important elections in our lifetime. It\'s going to shape our country for decades to come. And that\'s not hyperbole. The fact of the matter—we always say, ""This is the most important election,"" but the truth of the matter is: This election—this off-year election is going to matter a great deal. It\'s going to determine not what happens just next year and the next couple years; it\'s going to determine the direction of the country for at least a decade or more. Not a joke.', ""So much is changing, from technology to politics—across the board—the environment, everything. It's all at stake. And, folks, look, this is a choice between—you know, they say—everybody talks about a referendum. It's not a referendum. This is a choice. A choice between two fundamentally different versions of America."", ""I said from the beginning of my campaign, my objective when I ran was to build—build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And the fundamental shift—it's working to compare this—you know, compared to the MAGA trickle-down economics."", ""You saw what we got when that happened last, under my predecessor. No, I—no, I really mean it. It's important to remind ourselves of the detail. The fact of the matter is, we were at 6.4-percent unemployment when I came to office. Our country was in a pandemic with no plan to get us out of it. Two million people had been vaccinated, period."", ""So we moved. And with Mike's help, we signed the American Rescue Plan. We delivered immediate—we did deliver immediate—immediate relief for folks who need it to get those vaccination shots in their arms. We got over 655 million of those shots so far."", 'And, folks—and you know, one of the reasons why the Governor here—and the Governor of all the States—was able to havekeep police on the force, keep firefighters on the force, keep teachers in the classroom is because of the legislation we passed without one single Republican vote. It was all Federal money that came to the States to allow that to happen. And Mike helped make that happen.', ""He also helped—he also helped—when I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure. The most significant since the Interstate Highway System that Eisenhower came up with."", ""And I'll caution you for just a minute. Look, folks, we used to have—we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've moved all the way to number 28 in the world. No, I'm serious. Think about it. It's the means by which everything works, everything moves: our economy, our health, our services, across the board."", ""You know, how many States do you know where there's no water to drink that's—that you can—States—cities and places where you have lead pipes? How many kids are drinking out of fountains? Four hundred thousand of them—places. And so, look, this is what it did; it did more than just build roads and highways and bridges."", 'You know, I was with the Indian Nations earlier today in the State of New Mexico. They came up to me and said: ""Look, thank you very much. We are going to have broadband for the first time ever.""', 'And look, it also is going to fundamentally improve the environment. One of the things Mike has really, really worked on is the environment. And one of the things we did, we came up with $66 billion to deal with rail.', ""Here's the deal: You know, if people can move from one spot to another on rail faster or as fast as they can do in their automobile, they stop using their automobile. It's going to save literally tens of millions of tons—tens of millions of tons of pollution that aren't going to go up in the air because we're going to build—and by the way, I know a thing or two about rail. I traveled 250 miles—58 miles a day. You think I'm crazy. No, I'm not nuts."", ""But you know, what happened was, I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. I was down in Washington. I couldn't be sworn in yet, but I was down in Washington hiring a staff when I got a phone call saying that a tractor-trailer broadsided my wife and three kids Christmas shopping and killed my wife and killed my daughter."", ""And I didn't want to go to Washington, DC. I didn't want any part of it. And we had a Democratic Governor. And I thought we could find—I asked my brother, who ran my campaign with my sister, to find somebody who would be a progressive Democrat, because we were a pretty conservative State at the time in Delaware."", 'And what happened was I got talked into—I remember Teddy Kennedy and a few others came to me and said: ""Look, Joe, just come and stay 6 months. We need your help."" We had 58 Democrats. They didn\'t need me for anything. [Laughter] And we had a Democratic Governor. So I started to take Amtrak back and forth to Washington.

So let's not—you know, let's be honest with one another."", ""But the point is, I still believe the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents still believe in the institutions.

Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, I have to start off—my mother would be very upset if I had my—you never have your back to someone when you speak. I apologize. My back is going to be to you. [Laughter] I apologize. Audience members. We love you. The President. But thank you. Now, you can take care of all this, right, you guys? You're going to take care of it all? All right. Well, folks, I tell you what, it's great to see such a wonderful crowd. Hello, Oceanside! Hello, hello, hello. Well—[laughter]—it's great to be with Congressman Levin. And you know, they told me there were something like four or five hundred people who couldn't get in. [At this point, the President noticed an audience member wearing an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers T-shirt.] IBEW, yes. [Applause] They couldn't get in, and they had to go home. And now I understand why there wasn't any room. [Laughter] Well, thank you very much. You know—you know, the fact of the matter is that—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. It's great to be with Congressman Mike. You know, this guy delivers. He delivers. He lowers costs for families, caring for our veterans, protecting the environment. These are big deals. Rebuilding our infrastructure, protecting Social Security and Medicare. And he's fighting to protect democracy. Look, we need to reelect Mike, and we need to reelect all the Democrats who were mentioned for statehouse—a Philly girl huh? Audience member. Yeah! The President. She has her sign saying, ""Philly Girl."" [Laughter] That's right. And—but all kidding aside, you know, all the State legislative races, all the local races, they are critically, critically, critically important. Not a joke. They're going to determine whether our democracy is sustained. The other team is looking to do some things that don't allow for the way in which we count our votes. They—things are different these days. And—— Audience member. Bring Brittney Griner home! The President. I'm trying to bring her home. And I've been talking to—[applause]—by the way, I've been talking with Brittney's wife, and we're in constant contact. We're not giving up. I think Mr. Putin—well, it's a long story. But I—[laughter]. Well, look—look—by the way, our friends in Los Angeles, we need to elect Karen Bass, by the way, mayor. Five days! Five days until one of the most important elections in our lifetime. It's going to shape our country for decades to come. And that's not hyperbole. The fact of the matter—we always say, ""This is the most important election,"" but the truth of the matter is: This election—this off-year election is going to matter a great deal. It's going to determine not what happens just next year and the next couple years; it's going to determine the direction of the country for at least a decade or more. Not a joke. So much is changing, from technology to politics—across the board—the environment, everything. It's all at stake. And, folks, look, this is a choice between—you know, they say—everybody talks about a referendum. It's not a referendum. This is a choice. A choice between two fundamentally different versions of America. I said from the beginning of my campaign, my objective when I ran was to build—build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And the fundamental shift—it's working to compare this—you know, compared to the MAGA trickle-down economics. You saw what we got when that happened last, under my predecessor. No, I—no, I really mean it. It's important to remind ourselves of the detail. The fact of the matter is, we were at 6.4-percent unemployment when I came to office. Our country was in a pandemic with no plan to get us out of it. Two million people had been vaccinated, period. So we moved. And with Mike's help, we signed the American Rescue Plan. We delivered immediate—we did deliver immediate—immediate relief for folks who need it to get those vaccination shots in their arms. We got over 655 million of those shots so far. And, folks—and you know, one of the reasons why the Governor here—and the Governor of all the States—was able to havekeep police on the force, keep firefighters on the force, keep teachers in the classroom is because of the legislation we passed without one single Republican vote. It was all Federal money that came to the States to allow that to happen. And Mike helped make that happen. He also helped—he also helped—when I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure. The most significant since the Interstate Highway System that Eisenhower came up with. And I'll caution you for just a minute. Look, folks, we used to have—we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've moved all the way to number 28 in the world. No, I'm serious. Think about it. It's the means by which everything works, everything moves: our economy, our health, our services, across the board. You know, how many States do you know where there's no water to drink that's—that you can—States—cities and places where you have lead pipes? How many kids are drinking out of fountains? Four hundred thousand of them—places. And so, look, this is what it did; it did more than just build roads and highways and bridges. You know, I was with the Indian Nations earlier today in the State of New Mexico. They came up to me and said: ""Look, thank you very much. We are going to have broadband for the first time ever."" And look, it also is going to fundamentally improve the environment. One of the things Mike has really, really worked on is the environment. And one of the things we did, we came up with $66 billion to deal with rail. Here's the deal: You know, if people can move from one spot to another on rail faster or as fast as they can do in their automobile, they stop using their automobile. It's going to save literally tens of millions of tons—tens of millions of tons of pollution that aren't going to go up in the air because we're going to build—and by the way, I know a thing or two about rail. I traveled 250 miles—58 miles a day. You think I'm crazy. No, I'm not nuts. But you know, what happened was, I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. I was down in Washington. I couldn't be sworn in yet, but I was down in Washington hiring a staff when I got a phone call saying that a tractor-trailer broadsided my wife and three kids Christmas shopping and killed my wife and killed my daughter. And I didn't want to go to Washington, DC. I didn't want any part of it. And we had a Democratic Governor. And I thought we could find—I asked my brother, who ran my campaign with my sister, to find somebody who would be a progressive Democrat, because we were a pretty conservative State at the time in Delaware. And what happened was I got talked into—I remember Teddy Kennedy and a few others came to me and said: ""Look, Joe, just come and stay 6 months. We need your help."" We had 58 Democrats. They didn't need me for anything. [Laughter] And we had a Democratic Governor. So I started to take Amtrak back and forth to Washington. And over a million miles later, I was still taking Amtrak. So I know a few things—I know a few things about rail and high-speed rail. The second busiest corridor in America after the Northeast rail system is out here from San Diego to L.A. And because of the billions of dollars for rail and the law, and because of Mike's leadership, we're going to make sure that the second busiest corridor in America connecting those two cities is going to be open and running for the long term—for the long term. The law also includes $60 million that Mike got for the district to replace a 100-year-old bridge, invest in water projects, address droughts, improve water supplies in the area. There's so much in this. This is a bill that has a billion—excuse me, ""a billion."" Yes, it does. Poor lady is blocking her ears. Am I too loud? [Laughter] And—but you know, what we're talking about is, we have, literally, a great deal of money to make ours a more modern infrastructure. Tomorrow Mike and I are going to be talking about how the groundbreaking CHIPS and Science Act is going to help build industries of the future. You know, America invented semiconductors. They're now part of everything from automobiles to quantum computing. That law has already attracted, literally, several hundred billion dollars here in America. Already, tens of thousands of people to build these chips here in America. As I said, we invented them, and then we walked away. We used to be—we used to have a—you know, we are—we were the ones that did all the advanced studies on it. In fact, Mike worked to get a million dollars for training for technical jobs, including at this college for these jobs. I just came down from Syracuse, New York, where I went to graduate school and where my first wife—my deceased wife—lived. And Micron is investing $100 billion, the biggest investment of its kind ever in America. Because you're going to create tens of thousands—and you know—you know what the average job is going to be in these factories? The average job—$122,000 a year. And you don't need a college degree to do it. Just outside of Columbus, Ohio, we have—went and announced the $20 billion to build a semiconductor factory on a thousand acres in a ""field of dreams."" The vast majority of these jobs, as I said, pay between 120- and 130,000 dollars. With Mike's help, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act to bring down the cost of everything you talk about around the kitchen table, without a single, solitary Republican vote in the House or the Senate. Not one single Republican supported it. In Congress, we took on Big Pharma, and we beat them. We beat them. They spent millions of dollars trying to lobby us. I'm not joking. I've been in this fight for over 30 years trying to take them on. Folks, look, the fact of the matter is, we're capping seniors' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, beginning January 1, at $2,000 a year. Even if it costs them $20,000 a year, they're not going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year. And some of these cancer drugs are 10-, 12-, $14,000. If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, guess what? They're going to have to write a check for—to Medicare for the difference. No, not a joke. They raised the price of 1,200 drugs last year—1,200 without a single change in the makeup of the drug. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, look, we spend more money on prescription drug—the same prescription drug, made by the same company sold in San Diego; Washington, DC; Paris; or in Berlin—they pay significantly less in Paris and Berlin for the same exact drug, same company. And, folks, look, we're going to put a stop to that. We're also capping—[applause]—I'll bet an awful lot of you know people who need insulin for diabetes. Well, guess what? You're paying, depending on where you live, somewhere between 400 bucks a month and $1,000 a month. Well, guess what? They're not going to be able to charge you more than $35 a month. And you know why? It costs them $10 to make that drug. Ten! They make a significant profit. And by the way, you know, we're in a situation where we're making the biggest investment ever to deal with climate crisis. Audience member. I know that's right! The President. That's right. You've got it, man. And this is one of the leaders right—where—where the hell is he? [Laughter] He was right there. Anyway. But all kidding aside, $398 billion. And, hey, guess what? It's going to make a big difference, a gigantic difference. Look, it includes tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on your home, help you buy—help you buy electric vehicles, weatherize your home. Things that will save, the experts say, an average of $500 a year, according to experts. By the way, I—my dad used to run an automobile agency. He never owned it. We were—I got the dubious distinction—I—we—I grew up in a nice neighborhood. And—but it was, you know, a three-bedroom house, split-level home, four kids and a grandpop living with us and very thin walls. God bless my parents. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, my dad ran an automobile agency. He was the general manager for a long time. And you know what? The idea I—so I asked all the CEOs of the major American—major American automobile companies come to the White House. And this is the time that, you may remember, the chairman of the board of General Motors, Mary Barra, was suing the State of California for having a standard higher for emissions than the rest of the country and saying it was not—we had a long talk. And a week later she called me, and she said: ""I'm—we're dropping the suit. And guess what? We're going to go all electric, and we're going to give 50—all electric."" And by the way, I could go on. There's so many things that Mike helped me get done, help us get done. I'm not just being solicitous. It's a fact. He did. We're doing all this while we're doing—you know, the Republicans talk about ""big-spendin' Democrats""? Well, give me a break. [Laughter] We're spending a lot of money on good things. But guess what? We brought down the deficit this year $1 trillion, 400 billion. We cut it in half. We cut it in half. And by the way, the first year in office, I cut it $350 billion. And these are the guys, you recall, that passed the $2 trillion tax cut. They didn't pay a penny of it for anything. And guess what? It went to 2 percent of the public. Folks, look, I'm tired—I've had it up to here with hearing them. And we're going to further reduce the deficit by over—in the next decade—over $250 billion more. A big part of that is because we're making the biggest corporations begin to pay a little bit. You know, I love this. I love it. You know, in the year 2000, there were 55 of the Fortune 500 companies that made $40 billion. You know how much they paid in tax? Audience member. Zero. The President. Zero. Zero. So I imposed they had to—I passed a law that said they had to pay 15 percent. If you're a schoolteacher, you pay more than 15 percent. Just 15 percent. Just 15 percent. And they're whining. They're squealing like you know what. Give me a break. [Laughter] Folks, and because of this deficit reduction, we're able to ease the burden on student debt. I promised when I ran, I'd help student debt—hard-working folks. Well, guess what? We've—you get $10,000 relief and another $10,000 if you went to college on a Pell grant for folks—[applause]—for folks making under 125 grand a year. And on top of all that, I'm going to—with—going away with unfair—doing away with unfair hidden fees. All of a sudden, you're finding out—you're—we call them ""junk fees."" Okay? Well, guess what? You know, you've got a—you bounce a check, you get a $35 cost. You're not told that ahead of time. You were late on your credit card payment—50 bucks penalty. You go—you're going to fly to meet your parents back East or wherever they may live, and you have to get in a plane and you take along your kid. You're going to find out you've got a hell of a charge to have your child sit next to you. Not a joke. Your baggage cost is going to be significant. And by the way, if the plane is late and you have to get a new ticket, you're not going to get paid for it. So these are all—these are all—hidden fees. No more. No more. And by the way, you know, in the process—in the process of all—— [The President briefly addressed an audience member as follows.] I can't read what you're saying, kid; I'll look at you later. Okay? [Laughter] I have no idea what it says. He's holding up a paper that has small print on it. I'm pretty good, but I—— Audience member. ""Thank you for having a stutter."" Audience member. ""Thank you for having a stutter."" The President. Oh, God love you. Well, let me tell you: You know, one of the things that I found: When I was a kid up until, quite frankly, I was in college, I used to stutter. And a stutter is a really debilitating thing because people make—it's the only—if I told you I grew up and I had a cleft palate and it was fixed, no one would laugh. If I told you that I grew up and I had a clubfoot and was fixed, and no one would laugh. But when I say, which is true, I used to ta-ta-ta-talk—talk like that wh-wh- wh-when I w-wa-was a kid. It's awful hard to ask the girl, ""Will you go to the p-pr-pr-prom with me?"" Audience members. Aww. The President. And it sounds funny, but guess what? It makes you feel like an idiot. And it's—— Audience member. I love you, Mr. President! Audience member. You're not, Joe! The President. And by the way—by the way—I say to any stutterer: It cannot define you. It will not define you. Period. There's 35 kids that I keep in contact with. Remember the young man at my—who nominated me? What courage it took for him. He's a serious stutterer. You know, did you ever see the movie, ""The King's Speech""? Audience members. Yes! The President. Well, the guy who actually managed that, he got a copy of the speech that the King used when he made that famous speech about World War II—about the Germans. And he showed me. And he did exactly what I do. If you look at my speeches, there's hashmarks along. You learn—if you notice, people who can sing, they—some of them are terrible stutterers, because you've got to get something down before you can begin to work on it. And so they sent me a copy of the speech after it was all over—that. And so, look, folks, I don't want to get off on this, but the truth of the matter is, there's a lot of people—a lot of people in America—not just stutterers—who need some confidence-building measures, need to be able to—across the board. And what's that? That's even more important, in my view now, as a consequence of what happened during the entire COVID crisis. There's more need for—how can I say it?—for mental assistance than any time in American history. Audience member. Yes! The President. But look, here's the deal: Economic growth is up. Price inflation is down. Real incomes are up. Gas prices are down. We've got to get them down further here in California. And experts are all—exports are also up. The reason why exports are up is—guess what?—we made 700,000 manufacturing jobs here in America just since I've been President. And guess what? Instead of us—instead of us—sending overseas workers to get paid less—sending jobs overseas, so they'd pay less, we're sending product overseas. [Applause] No, I'm serious. It's that basic. It's that basic. Where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Where is that written? And, folks, one more thing: I know folks here understand, as a nation, we have many obligations, but I've been saying this since I decided to run for President—excuse me, decided to run for the Senate when I was 29—we only have one truly sacred obligation: prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Well, up until now, we haven't been meeting that obligation. Up until now, families—you—we used to pick up the phone. More people—more military, retired and/or Active Duty military, dying of suicide than any other reason. More. More, more. Well, if they pick up the phone and call the VA and say: ""I need help. I need help."" And they say, ""Well, in about 4 days, you can come on in."" Guess what? We, in fact, decided to fix that. We are fully funding the VA now. And look—look, you know, we have an obligation to those mothers, fathers, children of the veterans out there. Audience member. Oorah! The President. They're—no, I mean it. You're the very backbone and sinew of this Nation. One percent of America defends the other 99 percent of us. One percent. And we owe them. And so, you know, we found out that a lot of—a lot of our soldiers—more people are coming back from Iraq, Afghanistan with serious brain injuries and tumors than any other war in American history. Other than the Civil War, more amputees are coming back than in any wars in American history. And those burn pits—those burn pits—— [Audience members held up cell phones displaying the message ""Free Iran"" on the screens.] Don't worry, we're going to free Iran. They're going to free themselves pretty soon—[applause]—I see that. But here's the deal—[applause]—here's the deal: A burn pit is larger than the size of a football field, a big rectangle, between 8 to 10 feet deep. And everything is poured in that, from jet fuel to waste to everything else, and it's burned. It's burned. And just like all those folks in 9/11 that were in that—putting out those fires, so many died—so many because of what they inhaled. Well, we finally came up with a—you know, a—and Mike knows this well; he chairs the Veterans Affairs Committee. Mike helped—Mike helped me pass—and I signed the—it's called the PACT Act, the most significant law in our Nation's history, to help millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, like these burn pits that incinerate wastes of war, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel. But let me tell you something: I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 38 times as a Senator and as a Vice President. My son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. My son was National Guard. My son had to give up his job as attorney general—because you could either work for the State or the Federal Government—to go with his unit to Iraq. He spent a year in Iraq. But his hooch was only about 300 yards from a burn pit. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma. He made it about 9 months longer than—[inaudible]—but there was no cure, and he died. Well, guess what? Up until this law passed, for my son's family and for those who come home who need help still physically—no help at all—finally—finally, finally, finally they're entitled to have full medical care, and the children of those veterans who died are going to get help to go to school; going to get help for life insurance to be able to be taken care of. And that—and Mike did so much to get that passed. We got very little help from other places. But he stood up with me, and he got it done. This guy knows what he's doing. Because that PACT Act empowers the Department of Veterans Affairs to determine more quickly if a veteran's illness is related to toxic exposure. And for families of veterans who died from that exposure, it means monthly stipends, life insurance, tuition benefits. And by the way, the American Rescue Plan invested $17 billion in veterans health care and mental care, suicide prevention, to deal with the fact that more veterans die by suicide than in battle. And, folks, one more thing we did together: We passed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. When I was a Senator, I wrote and got passed the assault weapons ban. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it again. Look, the bottom line is this: We made a lot of progress over the last 20 months, but it wouldn't have been made without Mike's leadership. The vast majority of progress made without a single vote from a single Republican. Some bipartisan. We got some help on the—look, by the way, there's a great article that was printed back East, and it was that—and it said all those guys who voted against the infrastructure bill, standing there with a shovel saying, ""We've got this bridge being built here,"" they voted against it. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Not a joke. Not a joke. But you know—but I said when I ran and I got elected President, I'd be the Senator—excuse me—the—go from being a Senator to a President for all the people. And so just because they got a horse's tail for a Congressman, I'm not going to deny them the ability to get the help. Look, there's more to do and more we can get done. But ask yourself, ""What is the Republican platform?"" Not a joke. Audience member. Nothing! The President. Well, guess what? The truth is, you don't have to—you don't have to ask. They're saying it out loud. Audience member. I love you, Mr. President! The President. [Laughter] No, well—I want to say—[laughter]—they're not bad. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, in the House is—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——and his fellow MAGA Republicans said his number-one priority is to give the power back to Big Pharma. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, he wants to do away with all things we did. Over. He wants to make sure that they continue to rip us off. Everything we just talked about. The $2,000 cap, the $35 cap on insulin, tax credits for lower energy bills, 15-percent corporate tax—all gone. They're saying it up front. Instead of helping millions of working and middle class people with—and with student debt, by the way, they're suing me, trying to block relief. [Laughter] No, not a joke. Who the hell do they think they are? Look, by the way, an article published—the very people who are saying things like—and I won't go into all the—I'm keeping you too long because you're standing. I apologize. But look, you have a whole lot of folks out there who are talking about how this is a waste of money. And you have Ted Cruz saying, ""This is an outrage."" All this stuff. Well, guess what? They said they're—we're giving it to people who don't deserve it, et cetera—in the student relief. But guess what? They have a number of these Members of the Congress that got significant payment from the PPP program—the program that said when they lost their business in the—you know. One of them—one of them—got back 2,100,000 bucks. The same guy that's beaten the hell out of me because I'm trying to help people with their student debt. Another one, you know, what's that woman's name that—— Audience members. Marjorie Taylor Greene! The President. Yes, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. Her husband got 170,000 bucks back. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm serious. And they have the gall and audacity. Ugh, anyway. [Laughter] Look, I just want to—yesterday, or I guess it's—yes—today, the 3d. [The President pulled a newspaper from the podium.] GOP—the front page in New York Times: ""GOP Signals Plans To Shrink Social Security."" Audience members. Boo! The President. This is real stuff now. Not a joke. It says, ""Risk to the safety net energizes Democrats."" Well, we sure are energized. And it's by Jim Tankersley. He says Congress—""Congressional Republicans eyeing the midterm election victory that could hand them control of the House and Senate have embraced plans to reduce Federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, including cutting benefits for some of the retirees and raising retirement age"" for the nets for both programs. And it goes on. And then you have the guy who heads up the campaign committee for—reelect Republican Senators, a guy named Tim Scott, of Florida. [The President took a brochure from the podium.] Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, Rick Scott. Excuse me. Rick Scott. I blew up—it says—this is their program. One of the programs says: All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again. So, every 5 years, if they win—not a joke; they're saying it out loud—every 5 years, if they win, every one of these so-called entitlement programs—and by the way, you paid for your Social Security, okay? Okay? If you don't vote it into law again, it goes away. No, not a joke. Every 5 years it will completely eliminate the system if they don't vote for it, if they have the votes not to vote for it. In other words, if it goes out of existence, if Congress doesn't vote to keep it. Isn't that wonderful? And then along came a Senator from Wisconsin named Ron Johnson. Audience members. Boo! [The President made the sign of the cross.] The President. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. [Laughter] He thinks—not a joke—he thinks 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year, which means—I'm not making this up—if Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. But he doesn't want just Social Security and Medicare gone, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk. So you have to vote for it again, every program, or the program is gone. It's amazing. Now Republicans are saying if we won't cooperate, if I won't vote, if I won't help them cut Social Security and Medicare between the time we go back in session after the election and the end of the year, guess what? They're threatening to renege on the national debt. No, I'm not joking. That's what they've said. As my youngest granddaughter would say, ""Google it."" [Laughter] You may remember, when I was Vice President, I was asked to settle this same thing that was going on with Mitch McConnell at the time. So I spent the entire day and evening, New Year's Eve day. We finally reached an agreement, and they backed off and didn't do it. But guess what? The credit rating of the United States was diminished, being though we didn't do it, because we just talked about it. Folks, look, there's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos and more damage to the American economy than this. Look, folks, it's not just the economy. The Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right of a woman to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. States are already considering bans, have already voted for some of them. Notwithstanding, it's a consequence of rape, incest, or the life of the mother is at stake. Not a joke. You know what's happening. In 17 States, I think, so far. And if they gain control of the Congress, they plan on passing a national—nationwide ban on abortion across the board, because now the Supreme Court says there's no right to privacy in the Constitution; it's up to the States, which means it's up to the Congress and affect all the States. But guess what? If they do it, I'm going to veto the sucker. But—[applause]. But if we elect—if we elect more Democrats to the Senate and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade as the law, make it the law of the land. Well, folks, look, last night—I spoke last night on national television about democracy. I said democracy is on the ballot. A lot of the press asked the legitimate question, ""Why am I talking about democracy?"" Why—no, I'm—not a joke. ""Why is that an issue?"" Well, the reason I'm talking about it is, it's 70 percent of the American people in one poll think democracy is at risk right now. There's too much political violence. There's too much intimidation. There are more than 300 election deniers on the Republican tickets this year for State, Federal, and local government. Audience members. Boo! The President. And—no, no. I mean—I mean, this is really serious stuff. If a Republican nominee for—in Congress—for Governor in the State of Wisconsin wins, here's what he said. He said, ""If I win, my party will never lose another election in Wisconsin."" [Laughter] Now, he's either a prophet or he plans on doing something about election law. No, they're trying to suppress the right to vote and subvert entire elections. We can't let that happen. Look, folks, it's real simple. You can't call yourself a democracy or supporting democratic principles if you say, ""The only election that is fair is the one I win."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. That's what's being said. You can't do that. And how can you call yourself a democracy when you have a group of a thousand people storm the United States Capitol, break the windows and doors down, two policemen die as a consequence of it, break through the House and Senate doors and Chambers, have people cowering on the floor, threatening to kill people? You saw what happened to Paul Pelosi and the effort to get to Nancy. Well, guess what? What do they call these guys? What does Trump and all his Trumpies call it? No, he—he said they're ""patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. Not a joke. These are patriots. You know, my whole career I've worked in foreign policy, and I've known every major head of state for the last 25 years. When I was Vice President, the President and asked me to do an awful lot of the foreign policy and travel around the world. And when I became President and I went to the first, what they call, G-7 meeting, the seven largest democracies in the world—economies—and I sat down, and I said, ""America is back,"" and one of the Presidents—[applause]. Well, by the way, one of the Presidents said to me, I think it was Macron, looked at me and he said, ""For how long?"" And then I got—I think it was Scholz—I'm not positive who the second one—says: ""Imagine, Joe, if in fact you went to bed tonight here in England, woke up in the morning and found out that the British Parliament was attacked and they killed two cops, broke down the doors of the Parliament, went into the House of Representatives and stopped—the House and to stop an election outcome. What would you think? What would you think?"" What do you think we'd think? We'd think, ""Oh my God, what's going on?"" And then, if that—those folks were called ""patriots,"" what does that say? I'm not joking. This is deadly earnest. The reason I made that speech last night is, we're going into an election. And you have all these people saying they don't accept the outcome of the last one, and they're not guaranteeing they'll accept the outcome of this one. How does that—how does that—represent anything remotely approaching a democracy? Well, look, folks, let me close with this. I said this election is not a referendum, it's a choice—a basic choice. So I call on Democrats, when everything is at stake, and mainstream Republicans and Independents to come together to meet this moment. I truly believe—[applause]—I really mean it. I think, because of the fundamental changes that have taken place in technology, communications—I mean, think of it: When Gutenberg invented the printing press, it changed politics internationally, in Europe—going all the way through the telephone, the telegraph, television, radio—how it changed things. Well, look what's happened. Look what's happened now. Where are the editors? Where are the editors of anything that's on what you get—and where do most people get their news these days? They get it on the internet. And so, folks, look, we've got to work it out. We've got to work it out. And the fact of the matter is that we're just getting started, but we can do so much—so much good thing that we can do. We can make this Nation a better place than it's been. We can make sure it's guaranteed for the next two, three, four generations. But if we don't—if we don't—ask yourself the rhetorical question: What happens if, figuratively speaking, there's another event like what happened in the Capitol in response to an election? What does that do? But I'm optimistic, because we're on the verge of so much significant change. And by the way, I believe the vast majority—[applause]—I'm not talking about all Republicans. There's some really—look, I—for the longest time—remember, I got criticized when I was running for the President, because I said I was running for three reasons: One, to restore the soul of this country and decency, honor. Two, to rebuild the backbone of this country, which is the middle class and hard-working folks. And three, to unite the country. Well, the press legitimately pointed out that the days when Biden was known as the guy who was a bigger uniter in the United States Congress, they're gone. He doesn't understand. They're gone. They're over. You can't do it anymore. Well, folks, if we can't unite this country, we've got a gigantic problem. No democracy can be sustained without the informed consent of the people and everybody joining. Not a joke. And we used to—in the old days, when I was a United States Senator, we'd argue like hell with one another, disagree fundamentally, and go down to the Senate dining room and have lunch together. Because we disagreed on the issues, but we agreed on the notion that the institutions matter. Well, the institutions are under full-blown attack from the—I'm already being told, if they win back the House and Senate, they're going to impeach me. I don't know what the hell they'll impeach me for. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. And then—no, no—and then, recently they said, ""We should stop talking about that until we win."" [Laughter] Well, all kidding aside, think about it. So much is at stake, but there's so—I've never been more optimistic in my life about the prospects of this country. Never, never, never, never. I mean it. I promised—I promised—I would never mention their names, and I'll keep my word. I never will. But six different Republican Senators who I used to serve with came to me—this is now 5 months ago almost—to tell me they agreed with me, but they're afraid to vote with me because they knew they'd lose a primary; the Trumpies would go after them. Audience member. Chickens! [Laughter] The President. Well, by the way, you know, it's a reality. And by the way, there's some Democrats like that too. Don't get—there's a lot of Democrats who wouldn't—who would cave if in fact they thought they're going to lose their job. So let's not—you know, let's be honest with one another. But the point is, I still believe the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents still believe in the institutions. I really do. And one of the reasons I do is because all those voters between the ages of 18 and 30 years of age, they're the best educated, they're the most informed—not a joke—they're the most informed, they're the most generous, and they're the most engaged. And I'm counting on them showing up and voting. We've got to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America, for God's sake. There's nothing—not a single thing in the world—we can't do if we do it together. Not one single thing. Folks, I spent a lot of time—more time with Xi Jinping than any other head of state. Over 68 hours with him, either in person or on the telephone—excuse me, 78 hours; 68 of them in person—over the last 10 years. I've traveled 17,000 miles with him. We're on the Tibetan Plateau and he turned to me, and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities. Possibilities."" We believe anything is possible. We really do. So, folks, let's make sure we win this election. Get out the vote! We've got to win. Vote, vote, vote! May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Thank you. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, I have to start off—my mother would be very upset if I had my—you never have your back to someone when you speak. I apologize. My back is going to be to you. [Laughter] I apologize. Audience members. We love you. The President. But thank you. Now, you can take care of all this, right, you guys? You're going to take care of it all? All right. Well, folks, I tell you what, it's great to see such a wonderful crowd. Hello, Oceanside! Hello, hello, hello. Well—[laughter]—it's great to be with Congressman Levin. And you know, they told me there were something like four or five hundred people who couldn't get in. [At this point, the President noticed an audience member wearing an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers T-shirt.] IBEW, yes. [Applause] They couldn't get in, and they had to go home. And now I understand why there wasn't any room. [Laughter] Well, thank you very much. You know—you know, the fact of the matter is that—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. It's great to be with Congressman Mike. You know, this guy delivers. He delivers. He lowers costs for families, caring for our veterans, protecting the environment. These are big deals. Rebuilding our infrastructure, protecting Social Security and Medicare. And he's fighting to protect democracy. Look, we need to reelect Mike, and we need to reelect all the Democrats who were mentioned for statehouse—a Philly girl huh? Audience member. Yeah! The President. She has her sign saying, ""Philly Girl."" [Laughter] That's right. And—but all kidding aside, you know, all the State legislative races, all the local races, they are critically, critically, critically important. Not a joke. They're going to determine whether our democracy is sustained. The other team is looking to do some things that don't allow for the way in which we count our votes. They—things are different these days. And—— Audience member. Bring Brittney Griner home! The President. I'm trying to bring her home. And I've been talking to—[applause]—by the way, I've been talking with Brittney's wife, and we're in constant contact. We're not giving up. I think Mr. Putin—well, it's a long story. But I—[laughter]. Well, look—look—by the way, our friends in Los Angeles, we need to elect Karen Bass, by the way, mayor. Five days! Five days until one of the most important elections in our lifetime. It's going to shape our country for decades to come. And that's not hyperbole. The fact of the matter—we always say, ""This is the most important election,"" but the truth of the matter is: This election—this off-year election is going to matter a great deal. It's going to determine not what happens just next year and the next couple years; it's going to determine the direction of the country for at least a decade or more. Not a joke. So much is changing, from technology to politics—across the board—the environment, everything. It's all at stake. And, folks, look, this is a choice between—you know, they say—everybody talks about a referendum. It's not a referendum. This is a choice. A choice between two fundamentally different versions of America. I said from the beginning of my campaign, my objective when I ran was to build—build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And the fundamental shift—it's working to compare this—you know, compared to the MAGA trickle-down economics. You saw what we got when that happened last, under my predecessor. No, I—no, I really mean it. It's important to remind ourselves of the detail. The fact of the matter is, we were at 6.4-percent unemployment when I came to office. Our country was in a pandemic with no plan to get us out of it. Two million people had been vaccinated, period. So we moved. And with Mike's help, we signed the American Rescue Plan. We delivered immediate—we did deliver immediate—immediate relief for folks who need it to get those vaccination shots in their arms. We got over 655 million of those shots so far. And, folks—and you know, one of the reasons why the Governor here—and the Governor of all the States—was able to havekeep police on the force, keep firefighters on the force, keep teachers in the classroom is because of the legislation we passed without one single Republican vote. It was all Federal money that came to the States to allow that to happen. And Mike helped make that happen. He also helped—he also helped—when I signed the bipartisan infrastructure law, the most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure. The most significant since the Interstate Highway System that Eisenhower came up with. And I'll caution you for just a minute. Look, folks, we used to have—we used to be number one in the world in infrastructure. We've moved all the way to number 28 in the world. No, I'm serious. Think about it. It's the means by which everything works, everything moves: our economy, our health, our services, across the board. You know, how many States do you know where there's no water to drink that's—that you can—States—cities and places where you have lead pipes? How many kids are drinking out of fountains? Four hundred thousand of them—places. And so, look, this is what it did; it did more than just build roads and highways and bridges. You know, I was with the Indian Nations earlier today in the State of New Mexico. They came up to me and said: ""Look, thank you very much. We are going to have broadband for the first time ever."" And look, it also is going to fundamentally improve the environment. One of the things Mike has really, really worked on is the environment. And one of the things we did, we came up with $66 billion to deal with rail. Here's the deal: You know, if people can move from one spot to another on rail faster or as fast as they can do in their automobile, they stop using their automobile. It's going to save literally tens of millions of tons—tens of millions of tons of pollution that aren't going to go up in the air because we're going to build—and by the way, I know a thing or two about rail. I traveled 250 miles—58 miles a day. You think I'm crazy. No, I'm not nuts. But you know, what happened was, I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. I was down in Washington. I couldn't be sworn in yet, but I was down in Washington hiring a staff when I got a phone call saying that a tractor-trailer broadsided my wife and three kids Christmas shopping and killed my wife and killed my daughter. And I didn't want to go to Washington, DC. I didn't want any part of it. And we had a Democratic Governor. And I thought we could find—I asked my brother, who ran my campaign with my sister, to find somebody who would be a progressive Democrat, because we were a pretty conservative State at the time in Delaware. And what happened was I got talked into—I remember Teddy Kennedy and a few others came to me and said: ""Look, Joe, just come and stay 6 months. We need your help."" We had 58 Democrats. They didn't need me for anything. [Laughter] And we had a Democratic Governor. So I started to take Amtrak back and forth to Washington. And over a million miles later, I was still taking Amtrak. So I know a few things—I know a few things about rail and high-speed rail. The second busiest corridor in America after the Northeast rail system is out here from San Diego to L.A. And because of the billions of dollars for rail and the law, and because of Mike's leadership, we're going to make sure that the second busiest corridor in America connecting those two cities is going to be open and running for the long term—for the long term. The law also includes $60 million that Mike got for the district to replace a 100-year-old bridge, invest in water projects, address droughts, improve water supplies in the area. There's so much in this. This is a bill that has a billion—excuse me, ""a billion."" Yes, it does. Poor lady is blocking her ears. Am I too loud? [Laughter] And—but you know, what we're talking about is, we have, literally, a great deal of money to make ours a more modern infrastructure. Tomorrow Mike and I are going to be talking about how the groundbreaking CHIPS and Science Act is going to help build industries of the future. You know, America invented semiconductors. They're now part of everything from automobiles to quantum computing. That law has already attracted, literally, several hundred billion dollars here in America. Already, tens of thousands of people to build these chips here in America. As I said, we invented them, and then we walked away. We used to be—we used to have a—you know, we are—we were the ones that did all the advanced studies on it. In fact, Mike worked to get a million dollars for training for technical jobs, including at this college for these jobs. I just came down from Syracuse, New York, where I went to graduate school and where my first wife—my deceased wife—lived. And Micron is investing $100 billion, the biggest investment of its kind ever in America. Because you're going to create tens of thousands—and you know—you know what the average job is going to be in these factories? The average job—$122,000 a year. And you don't need a college degree to do it. Just outside of Columbus, Ohio, we have—went and announced the $20 billion to build a semiconductor factory on a thousand acres in a ""field of dreams."" The vast majority of these jobs, as I said, pay between 120- and 130,000 dollars. With Mike's help, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act to bring down the cost of everything you talk about around the kitchen table, without a single, solitary Republican vote in the House or the Senate. Not one single Republican supported it. In Congress, we took on Big Pharma, and we beat them. We beat them. They spent millions of dollars trying to lobby us. I'm not joking. I've been in this fight for over 30 years trying to take them on. Folks, look, the fact of the matter is, we're capping seniors' out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs, beginning January 1, at $2,000 a year. Even if it costs them $20,000 a year, they're not going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year. And some of these cancer drugs are 10-, 12-, $14,000. If Big Pharma continues to raise drug prices faster than inflation, guess what? They're going to have to write a check for—to Medicare for the difference. No, not a joke. They raised the price of 1,200 drugs last year—1,200 without a single change in the makeup of the drug. Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, look, we spend more money on prescription drug—the same prescription drug, made by the same company sold in San Diego; Washington, DC; Paris; or in Berlin—they pay significantly less in Paris and Berlin for the same exact drug, same company. And, folks, look, we're going to put a stop to that. We're also capping—[applause]—I'll bet an awful lot of you know people who need insulin for diabetes. Well, guess what? You're paying, depending on where you live, somewhere between 400 bucks a month and $1,000 a month. Well, guess what? They're not going to be able to charge you more than $35 a month. And you know why? It costs them $10 to make that drug. Ten! They make a significant profit. And by the way, you know, we're in a situation where we're making the biggest investment ever to deal with climate crisis. Audience member. I know that's right! The President. That's right. You've got it, man. And this is one of the leaders right—where—where the hell is he? [Laughter] He was right there. Anyway. But all kidding aside, $398 billion. And, hey, guess what? It's going to make a big difference, a gigantic difference. Look, it includes tax credits to help families buy energy-efficient appliances, put solar panels on your home, help you buy—help you buy electric vehicles, weatherize your home. Things that will save, the experts say, an average of $500 a year, according to experts. By the way, I—my dad used to run an automobile agency. He never owned it. We were—I got the dubious distinction—I—we—I grew up in a nice neighborhood. And—but it was, you know, a three-bedroom house, split-level home, four kids and a grandpop living with us and very thin walls. God bless my parents. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, my dad ran an automobile agency. He was the general manager for a long time. And you know what? The idea I—so I asked all the CEOs of the major American—major American automobile companies come to the White House. And this is the time that, you may remember, the chairman of the board of General Motors, Mary Barra, was suing the State of California for having a standard higher for emissions than the rest of the country and saying it was not—we had a long talk. And a week later she called me, and she said: ""I'm—we're dropping the suit. And guess what? We're going to go all electric, and we're going to give 50—all electric."" And by the way, I could go on. There's so many things that Mike helped me get done, help us get done. I'm not just being solicitous. It's a fact. He did. We're doing all this while we're doing—you know, the Republicans talk about ""big-spendin' Democrats""? Well, give me a break. [Laughter] We're spending a lot of money on good things. But guess what? We brought down the deficit this year $1 trillion, 400 billion. We cut it in half. We cut it in half. And by the way, the first year in office, I cut it $350 billion. And these are the guys, you recall, that passed the $2 trillion tax cut. They didn't pay a penny of it for anything. And guess what? It went to 2 percent of the public. Folks, look, I'm tired—I've had it up to here with hearing them. And we're going to further reduce the deficit by over—in the next decade—over $250 billion more. A big part of that is because we're making the biggest corporations begin to pay a little bit. You know, I love this. I love it. You know, in the year 2000, there were 55 of the Fortune 500 companies that made $40 billion. You know how much they paid in tax? Audience member. Zero. The President. Zero. Zero. So I imposed they had to—I passed a law that said they had to pay 15 percent. If you're a schoolteacher, you pay more than 15 percent. Just 15 percent. Just 15 percent. And they're whining. They're squealing like you know what. Give me a break. [Laughter] Folks, and because of this deficit reduction, we're able to ease the burden on student debt. I promised when I ran, I'd help student debt—hard-working folks. Well, guess what? We've—you get $10,000 relief and another $10,000 if you went to college on a Pell grant for folks—[applause]—for folks making under 125 grand a year. And on top of all that, I'm going to—with—going away with unfair—doing away with unfair hidden fees. All of a sudden, you're finding out—you're—we call them ""junk fees."" Okay? Well, guess what? You know, you've got a—you bounce a check, you get a $35 cost. You're not told that ahead of time. You were late on your credit card payment—50 bucks penalty. You go—you're going to fly to meet your parents back East or wherever they may live, and you have to get in a plane and you take along your kid. You're going to find out you've got a hell of a charge to have your child sit next to you. Not a joke. Your baggage cost is going to be significant. And by the way, if the plane is late and you have to get a new ticket, you're not going to get paid for it. So these are all—these are all—hidden fees. No more. No more. And by the way, you know, in the process—in the process of all—— [The President briefly addressed an audience member as follows.] I can't read what you're saying, kid; I'll look at you later. Okay? [Laughter] I have no idea what it says. He's holding up a paper that has small print on it. I'm pretty good, but I—— Audience member. ""Thank you for having a stutter."" Audience member. ""Thank you for having a stutter."" The President. Oh, God love you. Well, let me tell you: You know, one of the things that I found: When I was a kid up until, quite frankly, I was in college, I used to stutter. And a stutter is a really debilitating thing because people make—it's the only—if I told you I grew up and I had a cleft palate and it was fixed, no one would laugh. If I told you that I grew up and I had a clubfoot and was fixed, and no one would laugh. But when I say, which is true, I used to ta-ta-ta-talk—talk like that wh-wh- wh-when I w-wa-was a kid. It's awful hard to ask the girl, ""Will you go to the p-pr-pr-prom with me?"" Audience members. Aww. The President. And it sounds funny, but guess what? It makes you feel like an idiot. And it's—— Audience member. I love you, Mr. President! Audience member. You're not, Joe! The President. And by the way—by the way—I say to any stutterer: It cannot define you. It will not define you. Period. There's 35 kids that I keep in contact with. Remember the young man at my—who nominated me? What courage it took for him. He's a serious stutterer. You know, did you ever see the movie, ""The King's Speech""? Audience members. Yes! The President. Well, the guy who actually managed that, he got a copy of the speech that the King used when he made that famous speech about World War II—about the Germans. And he showed me. And he did exactly what I do. If you look at my speeches, there's hashmarks along. You learn—if you notice, people who can sing, they—some of them are terrible stutterers, because you've got to get something down before you can begin to work on it. And so they sent me a copy of the speech after it was all over—that. And so, look, folks, I don't want to get off on this, but the truth of the matter is, there's a lot of people—a lot of people in America—not just stutterers—who need some confidence-building measures, need to be able to—across the board. And what's that? That's even more important, in my view now, as a consequence of what happened during the entire COVID crisis. There's more need for—how can I say it?—for mental assistance than any time in American history. Audience member. Yes! The President. But look, here's the deal: Economic growth is up. Price inflation is down. Real incomes are up. Gas prices are down. We've got to get them down further here in California. And experts are all—exports are also up. The reason why exports are up is—guess what?—we made 700,000 manufacturing jobs here in America just since I've been President. And guess what? Instead of us—instead of us—sending overseas workers to get paid less—sending jobs overseas, so they'd pay less, we're sending product overseas. [Applause] No, I'm serious. It's that basic. It's that basic. Where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Where is that written? And, folks, one more thing: I know folks here understand, as a nation, we have many obligations, but I've been saying this since I decided to run for President—excuse me, decided to run for the Senate when I was 29—we only have one truly sacred obligation: prepare those we send into harm's way and care for them and their families when they come home. Well, up until now, we haven't been meeting that obligation. Up until now, families—you—we used to pick up the phone. More people—more military, retired and/or Active Duty military, dying of suicide than any other reason. More. More, more. Well, if they pick up the phone and call the VA and say: ""I need help. I need help."" And they say, ""Well, in about 4 days, you can come on in."" Guess what? We, in fact, decided to fix that. We are fully funding the VA now. And look—look, you know, we have an obligation to those mothers, fathers, children of the veterans out there. Audience member. Oorah! The President. They're—no, I mean it. You're the very backbone and sinew of this Nation. One percent of America defends the other 99 percent of us. One percent. And we owe them. And so, you know, we found out that a lot of—a lot of our soldiers—more people are coming back from Iraq, Afghanistan with serious brain injuries and tumors than any other war in American history. Other than the Civil War, more amputees are coming back than in any wars in American history. And those burn pits—those burn pits—— [Audience members held up cell phones displaying the message ""Free Iran"" on the screens.] Don't worry, we're going to free Iran. They're going to free themselves pretty soon—[applause]—I see that. But here's the deal—[applause]—here's the deal: A burn pit is larger than the size of a football field, a big rectangle, between 8 to 10 feet deep. And everything is poured in that, from jet fuel to waste to everything else, and it's burned. It's burned. And just like all those folks in 9/11 that were in that—putting out those fires, so many died—so many because of what they inhaled. Well, we finally came up with a—you know, a—and Mike knows this well; he chairs the Veterans Affairs Committee. Mike helped—Mike helped me pass—and I signed the—it's called the PACT Act, the most significant law in our Nation's history, to help millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, like these burn pits that incinerate wastes of war, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel. But let me tell you something: I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 38 times as a Senator and as a Vice President. My son was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. My son was National Guard. My son had to give up his job as attorney general—because you could either work for the State or the Federal Government—to go with his unit to Iraq. He spent a year in Iraq. But his hooch was only about 300 yards from a burn pit. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma. He made it about 9 months longer than—[inaudible]—but there was no cure, and he died. Well, guess what? Up until this law passed, for my son's family and for those who come home who need help still physically—no help at all—finally—finally, finally, finally they're entitled to have full medical care, and the children of those veterans who died are going to get help to go to school; going to get help for life insurance to be able to be taken care of. And that—and Mike did so much to get that passed. We got very little help from other places. But he stood up with me, and he got it done. This guy knows what he's doing. Because that PACT Act empowers the Department of Veterans Affairs to determine more quickly if a veteran's illness is related to toxic exposure. And for families of veterans who died from that exposure, it means monthly stipends, life insurance, tuition benefits. And by the way, the American Rescue Plan invested $17 billion in veterans health care and mental care, suicide prevention, to deal with the fact that more veterans die by suicide than in battle. And, folks, one more thing we did together: We passed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. When I was a Senator, I wrote and got passed the assault weapons ban. I'm going to do it again. I'm going to do it again. Look, the bottom line is this: We made a lot of progress over the last 20 months, but it wouldn't have been made without Mike's leadership. The vast majority of progress made without a single vote from a single Republican. Some bipartisan. We got some help on the—look, by the way, there's a great article that was printed back East, and it was that—and it said all those guys who voted against the infrastructure bill, standing there with a shovel saying, ""We've got this bridge being built here,"" they voted against it. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Not a joke. Not a joke. But you know—but I said when I ran and I got elected President, I'd be the Senator—excuse me—the—go from being a Senator to a President for all the people. And so just because they got a horse's tail for a Congressman, I'm not going to deny them the ability to get the help. Look, there's more to do and more we can get done. But ask yourself, ""What is the Republican platform?"" Not a joke. Audience member. Nothing! The President. Well, guess what? The truth is, you don't have to—you don't have to ask. They're saying it out loud. Audience member. I love you, Mr. President! The President. [Laughter] No, well—I want to say—[laughter]—they're not bad. The House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, in the House is—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——and his fellow MAGA Republicans said his number-one priority is to give the power back to Big Pharma. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, he wants to do away with all things we did. Over. He wants to make sure that they continue to rip us off. Everything we just talked about. The $2,000 cap, the $35 cap on insulin, tax credits for lower energy bills, 15-percent corporate tax—all gone. They're saying it up front. Instead of helping millions of working and middle class people with—and with student debt, by the way, they're suing me, trying to block relief. [Laughter] No, not a joke. Who the hell do they think they are? Look, by the way, an article published—the very people who are saying things like—and I won't go into all the—I'm keeping you too long because you're standing. I apologize. But look, you have a whole lot of folks out there who are talking about how this is a waste of money. And you have Ted Cruz saying, ""This is an outrage."" All this stuff. Well, guess what? They said they're—we're giving it to people who don't deserve it, et cetera—in the student relief. But guess what? They have a number of these Members of the Congress that got significant payment from the PPP program—the program that said when they lost their business in the—you know. One of them—one of them—got back 2,100,000 bucks. The same guy that's beaten the hell out of me because I'm trying to help people with their student debt. Another one, you know, what's that woman's name that—— Audience members. Marjorie Taylor Greene! The President. Yes, Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. Her husband got 170,000 bucks back. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm serious. And they have the gall and audacity. Ugh, anyway. [Laughter] Look, I just want to—yesterday, or I guess it's—yes—today, the 3d. [The President pulled a newspaper from the podium.] GOP—the front page in New York Times: ""GOP Signals Plans To Shrink Social Security."" Audience members. Boo! The President. This is real stuff now. Not a joke. It says, ""Risk to the safety net energizes Democrats."" Well, we sure are energized. And it's by Jim Tankersley. He says Congress—""Congressional Republicans eyeing the midterm election victory that could hand them control of the House and Senate have embraced plans to reduce Federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, including cutting benefits for some of the retirees and raising retirement age"" for the nets for both programs. And it goes on. And then you have the guy who heads up the campaign committee for—reelect Republican Senators, a guy named Tim Scott, of Florida. [The President took a brochure from the podium.] Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, Rick Scott. Excuse me. Rick Scott. I blew up—it says—this is their program. One of the programs says: All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again. So, every 5 years, if they win—not a joke; they're saying it out loud—every 5 years, if they win, every one of these so-called entitlement programs—and by the way, you paid for your Social Security, okay? Okay? If you don't vote it into law again, it goes away. No, not a joke. Every 5 years it will completely eliminate the system if they don't vote for it, if they have the votes not to vote for it. In other words, if it goes out of existence, if Congress doesn't vote to keep it. Isn't that wonderful? And then along came a Senator from Wisconsin named Ron Johnson. Audience members. Boo! [The President made the sign of the cross.] The President. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. [Laughter] He thinks—not a joke—he thinks 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year, which means—I'm not making this up—if Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. But he doesn't want just Social Security and Medicare gone, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk. So you have to vote for it again, every program, or the program is gone. It's amazing. Now Republicans are saying if we won't cooperate, if I won't vote, if I won't help them cut Social Security and Medicare between the time we go back in session after the election and the end of the year, guess what? They're threatening to renege on the national debt. No, I'm not joking. That's what they've said. As my youngest granddaughter would say, ""Google it."" [Laughter] You may remember, when I was Vice President, I was asked to settle this same thing that was going on with Mitch McConnell at the time. So I spent the entire day and evening, New Year's Eve day. We finally reached an agreement, and they backed off and didn't do it. But guess what? The credit rating of the United States was diminished, being though we didn't do it, because we just talked about it. Folks, look, there's nothing—nothing—that will create more chaos and more damage to the American economy than this. Look, folks, it's not just the economy. The Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right of a woman to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. States are already considering bans, have already voted for some of them. Notwithstanding, it's a consequence of rape, incest, or the life of the mother is at stake. Not a joke. You know what's happening. In 17 States, I think, so far. And if they gain control of the Congress, they plan on passing a national—nationwide ban on abortion across the board, because now the Supreme Court says there's no right to privacy in the Constitution; it's up to the States, which means it's up to the Congress and affect all the States. But guess what? If they do it, I'm going to veto the sucker. But—[applause]. But if we elect—if we elect more Democrats to the Senate and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade as the law, make it the law of the land. Well, folks, look, last night—I spoke last night on national television about democracy. I said democracy is on the ballot. A lot of the press asked the legitimate question, ""Why am I talking about democracy?"" Why—no, I'm—not a joke. ""Why is that an issue?"" Well, the reason I'm talking about it is, it's 70 percent of the American people in one poll think democracy is at risk right now. There's too much political violence. There's too much intimidation. There are more than 300 election deniers on the Republican tickets this year for State, Federal, and local government. Audience members. Boo! The President. And—no, no. I mean—I mean, this is really serious stuff. If a Republican nominee for—in Congress—for Governor in the State of Wisconsin wins, here's what he said. He said, ""If I win, my party will never lose another election in Wisconsin."" [Laughter] Now, he's either a prophet or he plans on doing something about election law. No, they're trying to suppress the right to vote and subvert entire elections. We can't let that happen. Look, folks, it's real simple. You can't call yourself a democracy or supporting democratic principles if you say, ""The only election that is fair is the one I win."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. That's what's being said. You can't do that. And how can you call yourself a democracy when you have a group of a thousand people storm the United States Capitol, break the windows and doors down, two policemen die as a consequence of it, break through the House and Senate doors and Chambers, have people cowering on the floor, threatening to kill people? You saw what happened to Paul Pelosi and the effort to get to Nancy. Well, guess what? What do they call these guys? What does Trump and all his Trumpies call it? No, he—he said they're ""patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. Not a joke. These are patriots. You know, my whole career I've worked in foreign policy, and I've known every major head of state for the last 25 years. When I was Vice President, the President and asked me to do an awful lot of the foreign policy and travel around the world. And when I became President and I went to the first, what they call, G-7 meeting, the seven largest democracies in the world—economies—and I sat down, and I said, ""America is back,"" and one of the Presidents—[applause]. Well, by the way, one of the Presidents said to me, I think it was Macron, looked at me and he said, ""For how long?"" And then I got—I think it was Scholz—I'm not positive who the second one—says: ""Imagine, Joe, if in fact you went to bed tonight here in England, woke up in the morning and found out that the British Parliament was attacked and they killed two cops, broke down the doors of the Parliament, went into the House of Representatives and stopped—the House and to stop an election outcome. What would you think? What would you think?"" What do you think we'd think? We'd think, ""Oh my God, what's going on?"" And then, if that—those folks were called ""patriots,"" what does that say? I'm not joking. This is deadly earnest. The reason I made that speech last night is, we're going into an election. And you have all these people saying they don't accept the outcome of the last one, and they're not guaranteeing they'll accept the outcome of this one. How does that—how does that—represent anything remotely approaching a democracy? Well, look, folks, let me close with this. I said this election is not a referendum, it's a choice—a basic choice. So I call on Democrats, when everything is at stake, and mainstream Republicans and Independents to come together to meet this moment. I truly believe—[applause]—I really mean it. I think, because of the fundamental changes that have taken place in technology, communications—I mean, think of it: When Gutenberg invented the printing press, it changed politics internationally, in Europe—going all the way through the telephone, the telegraph, television, radio—how it changed things. Well, look what's happened. Look what's happened now. Where are the editors? Where are the editors of anything that's on what you get—and where do most people get their news these days? They get it on the internet. And so, folks, look, we've got to work it out. We've got to work it out. And the fact of the matter is that we're just getting started, but we can do so much—so much good thing that we can do. We can make this Nation a better place than it's been. We can make sure it's guaranteed for the next two, three, four generations. But if we don't—if we don't—ask yourself the rhetorical question: What happens if, figuratively speaking, there's another event like what happened in the Capitol in response to an election? What does that do? But I'm optimistic, because we're on the verge of so much significant change. And by the way, I believe the vast majority—[applause]—I'm not talking about all Republicans. There's some really—look, I—for the longest time—remember, I got criticized when I was running for the President, because I said I was running for three reasons: One, to restore the soul of this country and decency, honor. Two, to rebuild the backbone of this country, which is the middle class and hard-working folks. And three, to unite the country. Well, the press legitimately pointed out that the days when Biden was known as the guy who was a bigger uniter in the United States Congress, they're gone. He doesn't understand. They're gone. They're over. You can't do it anymore. Well, folks, if we can't unite this country, we've got a gigantic problem. No democracy can be sustained without the informed consent of the people and everybody joining. Not a joke. And we used to—in the old days, when I was a United States Senator, we'd argue like hell with one another, disagree fundamentally, and go down to the Senate dining room and have lunch together. Because we disagreed on the issues, but we agreed on the notion that the institutions matter. Well, the institutions are under full-blown attack from the—I'm already being told, if they win back the House and Senate, they're going to impeach me. I don't know what the hell they'll impeach me for. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. And then—no, no—and then, recently they said, ""We should stop talking about that until we win."" [Laughter] Well, all kidding aside, think about it. So much is at stake, but there's so—I've never been more optimistic in my life about the prospects of this country. Never, never, never, never. I mean it. I promised—I promised—I would never mention their names, and I'll keep my word. I never will. But six different Republican Senators who I used to serve with came to me—this is now 5 months ago almost—to tell me they agreed with me, but they're afraid to vote with me because they knew they'd lose a primary; the Trumpies would go after them. Audience member. Chickens! [Laughter] The President. Well, by the way, you know, it's a reality. And by the way, there's some Democrats like that too. Don't get—there's a lot of Democrats who wouldn't—who would cave if in fact they thought they're going to lose their job. So let's not—you know, let's be honest with one another. But the point is, I still believe the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents still believe in the institutions. I really do. And one of the reasons I do is because all those voters between the ages of 18 and 30 years of age, they're the best educated, they're the most informed—not a joke—they're the most informed, they're the most generous, and they're the most engaged. And I'm counting on them showing up and voting. We've got to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America, for God's sake. There's nothing—not a single thing in the world—we can't do if we do it together. Not one single thing. Folks, I spent a lot of time—more time with Xi Jinping than any other head of state. Over 68 hours with him, either in person or on the telephone—excuse me, 78 hours; 68 of them in person—over the last 10 years. I've traveled 17,000 miles with him. We're on the Tibetan Plateau and he turned to me, and he said, ""Can you define America for me?"" And I said, ""Yes, one word: possibilities. Possibilities."" We believe anything is possible. We really do. So, folks, let's make sure we win this election. Get out the vote! We've got to win. Vote, vote, vote! May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['start', 'mother', 'upset', 'never', 'someone', 'speak', 'apologize', 'apologize', 'audience', 'members', 'love', 'care', 'guys', 'youre', 'care', 'folks', 'tell',

11,"November 05, 2022","['Hello, hello! Hey, Dick, how are you? Please, have a seat. Take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] I was at a big rally not long ago—last year. And I said, ""Everybody take a seat."" And the press said, ""Biden is so stupid he didn\'t know they didn\'t have any chairs."" [Laughter]', 'Well, hello, Joliet. And what a Saturday morning crowd. Thank you so very much.', ""And, Audree, thanks for that introduction. You know, there's millions—millions—of women and men like Audree all across America who are struggling and worrying every day about how they take care of themselves and take care of their needs, particularly in the area of health."", ""You know, thanks to—you have one of the best congressional delegations in America, and that's not hyperbole—including my buddy—and he is my buddy—Dick Durbin. You've been there every—every step of the way, Dick. Thank you."", ""And Senator Tammy—Tammy Duckworth, a genuine—we talk about American heroes. This is an American hero. This is an American hero. She risked her life and gave everything. If I had time, I'd spend the whole time talking about what she did—what she did—defending our Nation, a tireless fighter for her constituents, supporting families and supporting our veterans like nobody else does. And I can't thank you enough for everything you do. I really mean it. Thank you, Tammy."", ""And it's great to be with another terrific Member of Congress, Robin Kelly, a champion of women and children not only in her district, but all across America. Seriously. When I have a question, I pick up the phone and I call her—[laughter]—and ask for advice."", ""And your very own Congresswoman, Lauren Underwood. Lauren, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, I didn't know Audree's story. I didn't know what she was going to be saying when she spoke. But the one—only part of it that didn't surprise me was, you picked up the phone and called her. You picked the phone and called her. You know why? Not only are you a hell of a Congresswoman, you're a nurse. No, I'm serious. There's something special about nurses. Maybe it's because—[applause]—no, no. I genuinely mean it."", 'I, like many of you, have been a considerable consumer of health care in my family, losing family members as well as saving family members. And I spent a lot of time early on with—myself in an ICU, a long time ago.', ""And you know, docs allow you to—let you live. But you know, I often say, if there any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. No, I'm not joking. Male and female."", ""I remember being in an ICU looking at those monitors after a 9-hour operation and thinking to myself—I'm not—I wasn't hurting, I just was tired. I just wanted to just let it go. I knew the line went flat. It's—no, all kidding aside. Some of you have had a similar experience."", ""And my nurse—I'll never forget her name—Pearl Nelson, at Walter Reed, would come up and whisper in my ear, stroke my face, make me—and talk to me. Talk to me. You know, it's just amazing what nurses do."", ""And Lauren is the person you can always count on. She's always there. You know, in just her first two terms of office, she got 10 pieces of legislation passed into law. A lot of my Republican colleagues spend 10 years, and they'll get one piece passed into law. [Laughter]"", ""But all kidding aside, you know, lowering health care costs, improving care for women who serve in the Armed Forces, increase the number of veterans trained in health care jobs, protecting America's supply of critical prescription drugs and medical devices. And most of those were bipartisan efforts you put together."", 'And by the way, when Lauren does her job, it reminds me of what my dad used to say. He used to say: ""I\'m not looking to the government to solve my problems. I just want them to understand my problems."" She understands. Part of it is just understanding what your constituents need. When you can help, help. And when you can\'t, when there\'s no real answer, tell them the truth and then work like hell to try to find an answer.', ""Folks, I've come to Illinois to talk about two programs that reflect who we are as Americans, that Lauren understands to her core—to her core: Social Security and Medicare. I—quite frankly, I've been in the Congress a long time. I never thought I'd have to make this speech. Did you, Dick, ever think we'd be in this position?"", 'You know, these programs do something so basic and yet so important. You know that after working hard for decades, people deserve to retire, as my dad used to say, with some dignity, a word he most often used. Everyone is entitled be treated with dignity.', ""And the idea that a hard-working person would retire and be in real trouble, deprived of their dignity, is something beyond comprehension to most of us. That's how it should be in the United States."", ""Lauren talks about people she grew up with, with the people she represents. They are, you know, the—they're folks we all know. They're you in this auditorium; they're people I grew up with."", ""Imagine a nurse from Lauren's hometown in Naperville, who's been serving patients for decades; she's paid into the Medicare system and the Social Security system with every paycheck. She's getting ready to retire, this nurse—imaginary nurse—trying to take—make plans for a future. And she's counting on Medicare, she's counting on Social Security to be there for her; paid into it your whole life."", ""Imagine that young dad working in a warehouse in Joliet with little kids at home. It's a hard job, comes home every day; he's not thinking about retirement yet, but one day he will. And he'll be grateful for the Social Security and Medicare, paying for the—what he's paying into right now with those calloused hands and aching back will be there for he and his family. I mean, it's real."", 'If I can just pause for just a second. I remember my—I was lucky. When my mom was passing away—my mom moved in after my dad died, and moved into my house with me. And it was a great thing because my sister was nearby and my two brothers. And my mom was fiercely independent.', 'And I remember she used to go up to the local drugstore to get her prescriptions. And I—she wouldn\'t tell us, but she didn\'t have enough money to pay for some of those prescriptions. And so, to save her pride, I went up and gave them a credit card and said: ""Whatever she has, whatever prescription she has, fill it and say she has enough money and she\'s paying for it. It\'s paid for."" We didn\'t want her to know because she would have said no. Pride. Dignity. Dignity.', ""Imagine a new retiree who recently turned 65. In the past few years, he's been dealing with diabetes, heart disease; he even got a pacemaker. Takes several medicines a day, sometimes as many as 12. A hassle. A hassle. But without Social Security and Medicare, it'd be impossible for him to afford the needs—care he needs."", ""I mean, literally, you know people. Some of you fit this bill. Most folks don't know their Social Security—almost half of all seniors without it—half of all seniors lived in poverty before we had Social Security. Half of the senior population of America. Not enough money to put food on the table until Medicare came along. No health care until—they could count on."", ""And think about what it does to your sense of security. And again, back to what it does for an individual's dignity. We're proud people, especially those who busted their neck their whole life and paid into the system."", 'But then we came together as a country and said, ""No, no, we can do a hell of a lot better than this."" Social Security and Medicare are more than Government programs, they\'re a promise. They\'re a promise. Work hard and contribute, and when time comes to retire, things are going to be a little easier for you. Not guaranteed, but just a little easier. Social Security and Medicare don\'t solve it all, but there\'s a rock—and we\'ve counted on you. It\'s a rock-solid guarantee, an ironclad commitment.', 'Generations of Americans have counted on it. And it works. If we didn\'t have Social Security, the poverty rate for those over 65 would be four times what it is now. Four times. I love those signs—when I came in—""Socialism."" [Laughter] Give me a break. What idiots. [Laughter] ""Socialism."" Whoa.', ""No one ever doubts I mean what I say. Sometimes, unfortunately, I say all that I mean. [Laughter] Look, think about, in this district alone, more than 100,000 people over the age of 65 in Lauren's district.

Maybe some of you are paying 7-, 8-, 10,000 dollars a year for prescriptions because you have cancer or other serious disease.', 'Well, guess what? Because of the help of this delegation sitting in front of me, we capped that level. No senior, and starting January 1, will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their drugs.

And the press said, ""Biden is so stupid he didn't know they didn't have any chairs."" [Laughter] Well, hello, Joliet. And what a Saturday morning crowd. Thank you so very much. And, Audree, thanks for that introduction. You know, there's millions—millions—of women and men like Audree all across America who are struggling and worrying every day about how they take care of themselves and take care of their needs, particularly in the area of health. You know, thanks to—you have one of the best congressional delegations in America, and that's not hyperbole—including my buddy—and he is my buddy—Dick Durbin. You've been there every—every step of the way, Dick. Thank you. And Senator Tammy—Tammy Duckworth, a genuine—we talk about American heroes. This is an American hero. This is an American hero. She risked her life and gave everything. If I had time, I'd spend the whole time talking about what she did—what she did—defending our Nation, a tireless fighter for her constituents, supporting families and supporting our veterans like nobody else does. And I can't thank you enough for everything you do. I really mean it. Thank you, Tammy. And it's great to be with another terrific Member of Congress, Robin Kelly, a champion of women and children not only in her district, but all across America. Seriously. When I have a question, I pick up the phone and I call her—[laughter]—and ask for advice. And your very own Congresswoman, Lauren Underwood. Lauren, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, I didn't know Audree's story. I didn't know what she was going to be saying when she spoke. But the one—only part of it that didn't surprise me was, you picked up the phone and called her. You picked the phone and called her. You know why? Not only are you a hell of a Congresswoman, you're a nurse. No, I'm serious. There's something special about nurses. Maybe it's because—[applause]—no, no. I genuinely mean it. I, like many of you, have been a considerable consumer of health care in my family, losing family members as well as saving family members. And I spent a lot of time early on with—myself in an ICU, a long time ago. And you know, docs allow you to—let you live. But you know, I often say, if there any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. No, I'm not joking. Male and female. I remember being in an ICU looking at those monitors after a 9-hour operation and thinking to myself—I'm not—I wasn't hurting, I just was tired. I just wanted to just let it go. I knew the line went flat. It's—no, all kidding aside. Some of you have had a similar experience. And my nurse—I'll never forget her name—Pearl Nelson, at Walter Reed, would come up and whisper in my ear, stroke my face, make me—and talk to me. Talk to me. You know, it's just amazing what nurses do. And Lauren is the person you can always count on. She's always there. You know, in just her first two terms of office, she got 10 pieces of legislation passed into law. A lot of my Republican colleagues spend 10 years, and they'll get one piece passed into law. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, you know, lowering health care costs, improving care for women who serve in the Armed Forces, increase the number of veterans trained in health care jobs, protecting America's supply of critical prescription drugs and medical devices. And most of those were bipartisan efforts you put together. And by the way, when Lauren does her job, it reminds me of what my dad used to say. He used to say: ""I'm not looking to the government to solve my problems. I just want them to understand my problems."" She understands. Part of it is just understanding what your constituents need. When you can help, help. And when you can't, when there's no real answer, tell them the truth and then work like hell to try to find an answer. Folks, I've come to Illinois to talk about two programs that reflect who we are as Americans, that Lauren understands to her core—to her core: Social Security and Medicare. I—quite frankly, I've been in the Congress a long time. I never thought I'd have to make this speech. Did you, Dick, ever think we'd be in this position? You know, these programs do something so basic and yet so important. You know that after working hard for decades, people deserve to retire, as my dad used to say, with some dignity, a word he most often used. Everyone is entitled be treated with dignity. And the idea that a hard-working person would retire and be in real trouble, deprived of their dignity, is something beyond comprehension to most of us. That's how it should be in the United States. Lauren talks about people she grew up with, with the people she represents. They are, you know, the—they're folks we all know. They're you in this auditorium; they're people I grew up with. Imagine a nurse from Lauren's hometown in Naperville, who's been serving patients for decades; she's paid into the Medicare system and the Social Security system with every paycheck. She's getting ready to retire, this nurse—imaginary nurse—trying to take—make plans for a future. And she's counting on Medicare, she's counting on Social Security to be there for her; paid into it your whole life. Imagine that young dad working in a warehouse in Joliet with little kids at home. It's a hard job, comes home every day; he's not thinking about retirement yet, but one day he will. And he'll be grateful for the Social Security and Medicare, paying for the—what he's paying into right now with those calloused hands and aching back will be there for he and his family. I mean, it's real. If I can just pause for just a second. I remember my—I was lucky. When my mom was passing away—my mom moved in after my dad died, and moved into my house with me. And it was a great thing because my sister was nearby and my two brothers. And my mom was fiercely independent. And I remember she used to go up to the local drugstore to get her prescriptions. And I—she wouldn't tell us, but she didn't have enough money to pay for some of those prescriptions. And so, to save her pride, I went up and gave them a credit card and said: ""Whatever she has, whatever prescription she has, fill it and say she has enough money and she's paying for it. It's paid for."" We didn't want her to know because she would have said no. Pride. Dignity. Dignity. Imagine a new retiree who recently turned 65. In the past few years, he's been dealing with diabetes, heart disease; he even got a pacemaker. Takes several medicines a day, sometimes as many as 12. A hassle. A hassle. But without Social Security and Medicare, it'd be impossible for him to afford the needs—care he needs. I mean, literally, you know people. Some of you fit this bill. Most folks don't know their Social Security—almost half of all seniors without it—half of all seniors lived in poverty before we had Social Security. Half of the senior population of America. Not enough money to put food on the table until Medicare came along. No health care until—they could count on. And think about what it does to your sense of security. And again, back to what it does for an individual's dignity. We're proud people, especially those who busted their neck their whole life and paid into the system. But then we came together as a country and said, ""No, no, we can do a hell of a lot better than this."" Social Security and Medicare are more than Government programs, they're a promise. They're a promise. Work hard and contribute, and when time comes to retire, things are going to be a little easier for you. Not guaranteed, but just a little easier. Social Security and Medicare don't solve it all, but there's a rock—and we've counted on you. It's a rock-solid guarantee, an ironclad commitment. Generations of Americans have counted on it. And it works. If we didn't have Social Security, the poverty rate for those over 65 would be four times what it is now. Four times. I love those signs—when I came in—""Socialism."" [Laughter] Give me a break. What idiots. [Laughter] ""Socialism."" Whoa. No one ever doubts I mean what I say. Sometimes, unfortunately, I say all that I mean. [Laughter] Look, think about, in this district alone, more than 100,000 people over the age of 65 in Lauren's district. Some people have means; others are living day to day on Social Security and Medicare. That's why Lauren and I are going to keep protecting and strengthening these programs. I believe that hard work should be rewarded. And I believe that we should have no one—leave no one behind. No, I really mean it. No American—no American—who's worked and struggled. That's why—that's why—with the help of Lauren and members of your delegation, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, because it made Medicare stronger. Look, take prescription drugs. Folks, we pay the highest price for prescription drugs of any industrial—any developed nation in the world.

[Laughter] [The President returned to the podium, put down the hand-held microphone, and continued his remarks as follows.] With it—they don't want me to wander, I guess. [Laughter] With it packaged, maybe as much as 15. Well, some of you are paying four or five, six hundred dollars a month for that insulin. Well, guess what? You're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month, period. Thirty-five dollars for one insulin.

There's nothing—[applause]—within our power—that's beyond our power. There's nothing. I really mean it. Nothing. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than when we went in it. The only one. It's because of who we are. We're forgetting it. We've got to step up. We got to make sure we protect the American people. Basic, fundamental rights that are under—on jeopardy—in jeopardy. And right now we have 3 more days. Three more days. If you haven't already voted—and an awful lot of you have—make sure you vote. If you have voted, go knock on your neighbor's door. Take them to the polls. Help them out. Convince them to work. Convince them to show up and vote. And I'll take my chances—Democrat or Republican—if they haven't voted. I'd have them vote. Because they know what's going on. They really do. So, folks, it's been a great honor to be able to work with your delegation. I hope to God I'm able to continue to do that for at least the next 2 years, maybe beyond that. But in the meantime, keep the faith. Every time I'd walk out of my Grandpa Finnegan's home up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith!"" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" [Laughter] Let's go spread the faith! God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. One more thing. The good news for you is, I have to be in Philadelphia with Barack to campaign for some folks. And if I don't leave now, they tell me I'm going to be late. And Fetterman is a big boy. [Laughter] He's a big—I don't want to be late for him. But all kidding aside, you have been spared the idea of what I like doing best is working the rope line and saying hi to all of you. I apologize I can't do that today. But I'm like a poor relative: Invite me back; I'll show up. Thank you.","Hello, hello! Hey, Dick, how are you? Please, have a seat. Take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] I was at a big rally not long ago—last year. And I said, ""Everybody take a seat."" And the press said, ""Biden is so stupid he didn't know they didn't have any chairs."" [Laughter] Well, hello, Joliet. And what a Saturday morning crowd. Thank you so very much. And, Audree, thanks for that introduction. You know, there's millions—millions—of women and men like Audree all across America who are struggling and worrying every day about how they take care of themselves and take care of their needs, particularly in the area of health. You know, thanks to—you have one of the best congressional delegations in America, and that's not hyperbole—including my buddy—and he is my buddy—Dick Durbin. You've been there every—every step of the way, Dick. Thank you. And Senator Tammy—Tammy Duckworth, a genuine—we talk about American heroes. This is an American hero. This is an American hero. She risked her life and gave everything. If I had time, I'd spend the whole time talking about what she did—what she did—defending our Nation, a tireless fighter for her constituents, supporting families and supporting our veterans like nobody else does. And I can't thank you enough for everything you do. I really mean it. Thank you, Tammy. And it's great to be with another terrific Member of Congress, Robin Kelly, a champion of women and children not only in her district, but all across America. Seriously. When I have a question, I pick up the phone and I call her—[laughter]—and ask for advice. And your very own Congresswoman, Lauren Underwood. Lauren, thank you, thank you, thank you. You know, I didn't know Audree's story. I didn't know what she was going to be saying when she spoke. But the one—only part of it that didn't surprise me was, you picked up the phone and called her. You picked the phone and called her. You know why? Not only are you a hell of a Congresswoman, you're a nurse. No, I'm serious. There's something special about nurses. Maybe it's because—[applause]—no, no. I genuinely mean it. I, like many of you, have been a considerable consumer of health care in my family, losing family members as well as saving family members. And I spent a lot of time early on with—myself in an ICU, a long time ago. And you know, docs allow you to—let you live. But you know, I often say, if there any angels in heaven, they're all nurses, male and female. Doctors let you live; nurses make you want to live. No, I'm not joking. Male and female. I remember being in an ICU looking at those monitors after a 9-hour operation and thinking to myself—I'm not—I wasn't hurting, I just was tired. I just wanted to just let it go. I knew the line went flat. It's—no, all kidding aside. Some of you have had a similar experience. And my nurse—I'll never forget her name—Pearl Nelson, at Walter Reed, would come up and whisper in my ear, stroke my face, make me—and talk to me. Talk to me. You know, it's just amazing what nurses do. And Lauren is the person you can always count on. She's always there. You know, in just her first two terms of office, she got 10 pieces of legislation passed into law. A lot of my Republican colleagues spend 10 years, and they'll get one piece passed into law. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, you know, lowering health care costs, improving care for women who serve in the Armed Forces, increase the number of veterans trained in health care jobs, protecting America's supply of critical prescription drugs and medical devices. And most of those were bipartisan efforts you put together. And by the way, when Lauren does her job, it reminds me of what my dad used to say. He used to say: ""I'm not looking to the government to solve my problems. I just want them to understand my problems."" She understands. Part of it is just understanding what your constituents need. When you can help, help. And when you can't, when there's no real answer, tell them the truth and then work like hell to try to find an answer. Folks, I've come to Illinois to talk about two programs that reflect who we are as Americans, that Lauren understands to her core—to her core: Social Security and Medicare. I—quite frankly, I've been in the Congress a long time. I never thought I'd have to make this speech. Did you, Dick, ever think we'd be in this position? You know, these programs do something so basic and yet so important. You know that after working hard for decades, people deserve to retire, as my dad used to say, with some dignity, a word he most often used. Everyone is entitled be treated with dignity. And the idea that a hard-working person would retire and be in real trouble, deprived of their dignity, is something beyond comprehension to most of us. That's how it should be in the United States. Lauren talks about people she grew up with, with the people she represents. They are, you know, the—they're folks we all know. They're you in this auditorium; they're people I grew up with. Imagine a nurse from Lauren's hometown in Naperville, who's been serving patients for decades; she's paid into the Medicare system and the Social Security system with every paycheck. She's getting ready to retire, this nurse—imaginary nurse—trying to take—make plans for a future. And she's counting on Medicare, she's counting on Social Security to be there for her; paid into it your whole life. Imagine that young dad working in a warehouse in Joliet with little kids at home. It's a hard job, comes home every day; he's not thinking about retirement yet, but one day he will. And he'll be grateful for the Social Security and Medicare, paying for the—what he's paying into right now with those calloused hands and aching back will be there for he and his family. I mean, it's real. If I can just pause for just a second. I remember my—I was lucky. When my mom was passing away—my mom moved in after my dad died, and moved into my house with me. And it was a great thing because my sister was nearby and my two brothers. And my mom was fiercely independent. And I remember she used to go up to the local drugstore to get her prescriptions. And I—she wouldn't tell us, but she didn't have enough money to pay for some of those prescriptions. And so, to save her pride, I went up and gave them a credit card and said: ""Whatever she has, whatever prescription she has, fill it and say she has enough money and she's paying for it. It's paid for."" We didn't want her to know because she would have said no. Pride. Dignity. Dignity. Imagine a new retiree who recently turned 65. In the past few years, he's been dealing with diabetes, heart disease; he even got a pacemaker. Takes several medicines a day, sometimes as many as 12. A hassle. A hassle. But without Social Security and Medicare, it'd be impossible for him to afford the needs—care he needs. I mean, literally, you know people. Some of you fit this bill. Most folks don't know their Social Security—almost half of all seniors without it—half of all seniors lived in poverty before we had Social Security. Half of the senior population of America. Not enough money to put food on the table until Medicare came along. No health care until—they could count on. And think about what it does to your sense of security. And again, back to what it does for an individual's dignity. We're proud people, especially those who busted their neck their whole life and paid into the system. But then we came together as a country and said, ""No, no, we can do a hell of a lot better than this."" Social Security and Medicare are more than Government programs, they're a promise. They're a promise. Work hard and contribute, and when time comes to retire, things are going to be a little easier for you. Not guaranteed, but just a little easier. Social Security and Medicare don't solve it all, but there's a rock—and we've counted on you. It's a rock-solid guarantee, an ironclad commitment. Generations of Americans have counted on it. And it works. If we didn't have Social Security, the poverty rate for those over 65 would be four times what it is now. Four times. I love those signs—when I came in—""Socialism."" [Laughter] Give me a break. What idiots. [Laughter] ""Socialism."" Whoa. No one ever doubts I mean what I say. Sometimes, unfortunately, I say all that I mean. [Laughter] Look, think about, in this district alone, more than 100,000 people over the age of 65 in Lauren's district. Some people have means; others are living day to day on Social Security and Medicare. That's why Lauren and I are going to keep protecting and strengthening these programs. I believe that hard work should be rewarded. And I believe that we should have no one—leave no one behind. No, I really mean it. No American—no American—who's worked and struggled. That's why—that's why—with the help of Lauren and members of your delegation, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, because it made Medicare stronger. Look, take prescription drugs. Folks, we pay the highest price for prescription drugs of any industrial—any developed nation in the world. Same, same drug—same exact one—made by the same company, sold in Chicago and sold in Paris, it's cheaper in Paris. Not a joke. No rationale for it. None. And many of these drugs, as a—they come up with are a consequence of Government research. I'm glad they came up with them. For years, we fought to give Medicare the power to negotiate what they pay for prescription drugs, just like we do for the Veterans Administration. The VA has been able to, as they should. So you want to sell us, figuratively speaking—I mean it literally—aspirin a penny apiece? We're only going to pay half a penny. You don't want to sell it to us? We don't—we'll go somewhere else. But for years, Big Pharma has blocked us from being able to negotiate that. They were the only exception out there. But not this year. We finally beat Big Pharma. Finally, finally, finally. Medicare will finally have the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, just like VA. Additionally, seniors will see their out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs capped. You know people. Maybe some of you are paying 7-, 8-, 10,000 dollars a year for prescriptions because you have cancer or other serious disease. Well, guess what? Because of the help of this delegation sitting in front of me, we capped that level. No senior, and starting January 1, will have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their drugs. [Inaudible]—go back. Whether their bills are now 7-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 14,000 dollars a year, no more than $2,000 a year. And the companies will still make a lot of money. Starting in January, we're capping the cost of insulin for seniors with diabetes. How many of you know somebody that needs insulin for their diabetes? Raise your hand. Every audience—see that, Dick? Almost everybody—I would say at least half of this audience raised their hand. You know how much it costs to make that particular—that insulin? It costs $10. T-E-N. [At this point, the President picked up a hand-held microphone, moved away from the podium, and continued his remarks as follows.]  Ten dollars to make it. That's it—10. With it packaged—— [The microphone malfunctioned.] This isn't working, I guess. [Laughter] [The President returned to the podium, put down the hand-held microphone, and continued his remarks as follows.] With it—they don't want me to wander, I guess. [Laughter] With it packaged, maybe as much as 15. Well, some of you are paying four or five, six hundred dollars a month for that insulin. Well, guess what? You're not going to have to pay more than $35 a month, period. Thirty-five dollars for one insulin. So, starting in January—one other thing we changed—starting in January, if Big Pharma raises drug prices faster than inflation, they're going to have to write a check for the difference to Medicare. What's the rationale? This past year, drug companies raised the price on more than one—middle of this ""recession,"" quote, unquote, as Republicans say. It's not a recession. But the middle of this, really, turn-down here in terms of expenses that people are paying at the kitchen table. They raised the price of 1,200 drugs higher than the rate of inflation, just last year. We're putting an end to that. Plus, for seniors on Medicare Part D, recommended vaccines like shingles vaccines is going to be available for free. No copay. Last year—last year—more than 2 million seniors got that shingles vaccine at an average price of $100 for it, but some had to pay as much as $200. And you wonder how many seniors skipped the shot because they couldn't afford it. You know, we don't have to make that choice anymore. And we're making hearing aids affordable, finally, for over the counter—[applause]—so people—so you don't have to pay for those expensive visits. The FDA estimates this is going to save as much as $3,000 per pair of hearing aids. And one more thing. For the first time in a decade, seniors' Social Security checks are going to go up, and Medicare is going to come down. First time. Folks, all this hard-won progress is because of your delegation. Not a joke. I wish I could say our Republicans in Congress helped make it happen. But the truth is, every single solitary Democrat in Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction Act. Every single Republican voted against it. Every single one. Not one supported it. And now Republicans are calling to tell us their number-one priority to repeal—is to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act. Everything I just talked about—$2,000 cap on—$2,000 cap on prescription drugs; $35-a-month cap on insulin; more power for Medicare to lower drug prices—all gone. All gone if they succeed. Well, they're not going to succeed, at least for the next 2, because I'll veto it. But—[laughter]. But you know, savings in health care premiums—$800 a month for Americans on the Affordable Care Act, which Lauren worked so hard to get done—will be gone. And of course, there's still the repeal of the Affordable Care Act they're trying to do. The Affordable Care Act is the only reason why tens of millions of people have any coverage because of a preexisting condition. They can't get insurance other than through the Affordable Care Act. And, folks, they're also coming for your Social Security and Medicare. Rick Scott, a Senator from Florida, is in charge of electing Republicans in the Senate, put out a plan that replaces—places Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every 5 years. Every 5 years. And that means, every 5 years, Congress is going to have to vote to cut, completely eliminate, or keep it as it is. This is their little—this is Scott's Republican platform they put out. [The President pulled a brochure from the podium.] Let me read from it: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" So every 5 years, you're going to have to vote on whether we're going to have Social Security anymore—you're—or cut it, whatever. Every 5 years. I mean, what is with these guys? Same with Medicare. In other words, it goes out of existence if we don't vote to keep it. Isn't that wonderful? And then along came Ron Johnson—[laughter]—Senator Johnson from the State of Wisconsin. He thinks waiting every 5 years to try to eliminate Social Security is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year, along with veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It's gone. You've been paying for this your whole life. Now these guys want to take it away. Who in the hell do they think they are? I really mean it. Think about it. I mean, they're saying it out loud. Did you ever hear, Dick—you think, anybody, that they'd be saying this? We knew where their heart was, but the idea. And what do Republicans want to spend that money on instead? Well, what they want to do—they're really upset with Dick and all of us for making sure that the 55 Fortune 500 companies that paid zero in tax now have to pay a horrible 15 percent in tax. Well, I want to go back—I want to go back here. Look, think about it. Think of what these guys—they want to—they want to make the tax cut that they voted under the last President, that they didn't pay for a penny of it—not a penny of it—they want to make it permanent. They want to continue—they want to slash the number of agents that are out there at IRS to look at their forms. They'd allow some of the largest, most profitable companies in America to go back to paying zero. Like I said, that $2 trillion tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited major corporations and the wealthiest among us, they want to make sure it's—and by the way, when I ran, I promised you that no one making less than $400,000 a year would have a single penny in their taxes increased. And I've kept that promise. Not a single penny. And, folks, many of us are focused on inflation right now, but if you want to raise the cost of living on seniors, go ahead and give free rein to drug companies. Imagine what that's going to do if we see these prices continue to go up, skyrocket. It's called inflation. And that affects ordinary people every single day. Go ahead and reduce Social Security or Medicare, and watch what happens to the cost of living for hard-working people in Illinois. That's inflation. My dad used to say that when you—if you take a look, at the end of the month, do you have enough money to pay for all your regular bills and have a little breathing room, just a little breathing, a little left over? Well, these guys don't want there to be any breathing room. Now Republicans in Congress are saying they're not going to cooperate in cutting—unless I agree to cooperate in cutting Social Security and Medicare, or they'll shut down the Government. [The President took a newspaper from the podium.] The New York Times front page, top of the—says, ""GOP signals plan to shrink Social Security and social""—and it goes on and says, ""Congressional Republicans, eyeing the midterm elections victory . . . could hand them control of the House and Senate, have embraced plans to reduce Federal spending on Social Security and Medicare, including cutting benefits for some retirees and raising the retirement age for both . . . programs."" It goes on. Folks, look, we're not making this stuff up. But the real thing—the idea they'd threaten to default on the Federal debt if we didn't do—we didn't go along with them, nothing—nothing—would create more chaos or do more damage to the American economy than that. Let me close with this: Over the last year, we faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history. We're making real progress thanks to people like Lauren and the rest of your delegation. As I said, she's a nurse at heart. She'll protect Social Security and Medicare, take on Big Pharma and lower drug prices, make Americans' health care a right, just not [not just]* a privilege. All of you—all of you—are the reason I've never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We are the United States of America. There's nothing—[applause]—within our power—that's beyond our power. There's nothing. I really mean it. Nothing. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than when we went in it. The only one. It's because of who we are. We're forgetting it. We've got to step up. We got to make sure we protect the American people. Basic, fundamental rights that are under—on jeopardy—in jeopardy. And right now we have 3 more days. Three more days. If you haven't already voted—and an awful lot of you have—make sure you vote. If you have voted, go knock on your neighbor's door. Take them to the polls. Help them out. Convince them to work. Convince them to show up and vote. And I'll take my chances—Democrat or Republican—if they haven't voted. I'd have them vote. Because they know what's going on. They really do. So, folks, it's been a great honor to be able to work with your delegation. I hope to God I'm able to continue to do that for at least the next 2 years, maybe beyond that.

Hello, hello, hello!', '[At this point, the President briefly addressed audience members seated in the balcony as follows.]', ""Don't jump!"", ""Good to see you all. This crowd's so loud I think you can hear us in Latrobe. They're going to hear us. They're going to hear us on Tuesday."", ""Folks, I'm Jill Biden's husband—a Philly girl. She's ready for game six, like all of you. It's good to be home. It's good to be with family. And that includes someone we all love, Barack Obama, a great President, historic President, and, I'm proud to say, a dear friend."", ""Well, folks, 3 days. Three days until one of the most important elections. One of the most important elections in our lifetime. It's going to shape—the outcome is going to shape our country for decades to come. And the power to shape that outcome is in your hands."", 'Two years ago—[applause]—2 years ago, you used that power to make Donald Trump not only a former President, but you made him a defeated President. And this year, you have the power to make John Fetterman your next United States Senator and Josh Shapiro your next Governor.', ""Look, folks, I want to be very clear, and I mean this sincerely, about what's on the ballot this year: Your right to choose is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Social Security and Medicare is on the ballot. There's something else on the ballot: character. Character is on the ballot."", 'When I think of character, I think of John Fetterman. You know, in its endorsement of him, the Philadelphia Inquirer today said, ""John knows what""—he—""his values are.""', ""Well, my—I've been saying it for a long time: I'm a Pennsylvania boy born and raised in Scranton and—[applause]—but for the longest time, Delaware, like many other small places, did not have a television station. So Philadelphia TV had to cover me the same as they covered all the Pennsylvania Senators. I was known as Pennsylvania's third Senator."", 'My point is, I know Pennsylvania well. And John Fetterman is Pennsylvania. He is Pennsylvania.', 'And Oz—and Pennsylvania?', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Look, I've lived—I lived in Pennsylvania longer than Oz has lived in Pennsylvania. And I moved away when I was 10 years old. [Laughter]"", ""Look, like a lot of us, John has gotten knocked down, but he gets back up. He's gotten up quickly. John has character, integrity, and he's going to be a hell of a good Senator—United States Senator for Pennsylvania."", 'And the other thing is——', '[Several audience members held signs reading ""Free Iran,"" and the President addressed them as follows.]', ""Don't worry, we're going to talk about Iran."", ""Courage. Courage is also on the ballot. When I think of courage, I think of Josh Shapiro. This guy will take on anyone and back down to no one, and we saw that in 2020. He stood up for the Constitution. He stood up for the rule of law. He stood up for the people of this State. And he's going to be one hell of a fantastic Governor. He really is."", 'But it\'s not just John and Josh; we\'ve got a great Democratic lineup on the ballot here in this State. You heard from a lot of them today. You heard from a lot of them. We have some—we have one of the best delegations in Congress—""we""—I keep making myself a Pennsylvanian again. [Laughter]', 'But, really, Democrats up and down the ballot. We need to elect them all. We need it badly.', ""Pennsylvania, this isn't a referendum this year, it's a choice, a choice between two vastly different visions of America. Vastly different."", ""Maybe it's in our blood, but John and I believe that all—it's all about fighting for working and middle class people, the way I've said from the beginning of my—my objective when I ran for President was to build an economy from the bottom up and the—bottom up and the middle out. It's a fundamental shift compared to the Oz and the mega MAGA Republican trickle-down economics."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, really. This ain't your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. I really mean it. I really mean it."", ""Look, they're all about the wealthier getting wealth and the wealthier staying wealthy. The middle class gets stiffed and the poor get poorer under their policy. You saw what happened last time, under my predecessor. The economy was in ruins. He was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs in the course of his Presidency. Unemployment rate—the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. He lost manufacturing jobs and hundreds of small businesses here in this State and 100,000 nationwide."", 'Look, folks, the country was in a pandemic with no plan how to get out. The day I was sworn in, only 2 million people had been vaccinated. Now more than 220 [million]* Americans are fully vaccinated. So we moved. And our approach is working.', ""Since I came to office, we've created 10 million new good-paying jobs. Ten million. Because of you all. Ten million. The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near-record 50-year low."", ""John and I understand we need to make things in America the first time in a long time, and we are. That means instead of shipping jobs overseas, we're shipping product overseas. I'm serious. We've created, so far, 700,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last 20 months. Seven hundred thousand."", ""But for all our progress—and by the way, where the hell is it—heck is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Because we will be. We will be. And, folks, look—but a lot of families are still struggling. A lot of families are struggling. That's why I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act that's going to reduce the cost of everyday things in families in Pennsylvania. Things you have to pay for every month and you have to have enough in your paycheck to do it."", 'We gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs, the same power the Veterans Administration has to cut drug prices in half. We tried to get that done for years when I was in the Senate and Vice President. But Big Pharma spent a lot of money, and folks—and supported a lot of folks. Well, guess what? Not this year. We beat Big Pharma. And the American people won.', 'We put a cap of $2,000 a year on prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare no matter what their drug costs were, and some of them pay $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year for a cancer drug. But now, beginning January 1, they will not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, period. Period.', ""And we put a cap on insulin to deal with their diabetes. Instead of paying $400 a month like they're paying now, they're going to pay no more than $35 a month."", ""And with John Fetterman in the Senate, with that one more vote I need, we're going to make sure we cap those prices for every single person, every—all that—[inaudible]—because they blocked—we had it in the original bill, but it only stayed in for Medicare recipients."", ""But, everyone, how many of you know somebody who has to take insulin for diabetes? Look around. And it's incredibly costly. No matter what your age, it is badly needed."", ""And, folks, look, we made the biggest investment to deal with the climate crisis ever. We're lowering energy costs for families. And by the way, Josh and John know that we can cap oil and gas price wells, abandoned mines. We can do that in Western Pennsylvania. We can create thousands of good-paying jobs for the same people who dug those mines in the first place. That's why we're investing $350 million here in this part of the country to do just that."", ""We're not just talking it, we're doing it. And we're going to do this while reducing the Federal deficit. You know, because of the help I had from the Senators in the Democratic Congress, we literally cut the Federal debt in half by $1.4 trillion—[applause]—$1.4 trillion just this year and last year by $350 billion. And another $250 billion over the next decade."", ""Look, I don't want to hear from the MAGA Republicans who blew up the debt. We're the ones bringing it down. They'd shot it up. And by such a massive reduction in debt, we're able to help working and middle class families in America."", ""Look—and we're finally making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, for God's sake. One of the reasons they're so upset with me is, we just passed a minimum 15-percent tax. Look, folks, if you're a schoolteacher, you pay more than that. If you're a cop, you pay more than that 15 percent. But the days are over where corporations are paying zero Federal tax."", 'And by the way, in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion, and they paid not one single penny in Federal tax. Not one.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Because we reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help millions of working and middle class folks caught in the crossfire of the pandemic and the—and what happened with the Russians moving into Ukraine."", 'Because I acted, we provided $10,000 in student debt relief and another—another—10,000 bucks if you got a Pell grant. No one under 20—you have to be making less than 125 [125,000]* a year. And 90 percent of that money goes to people earning less than $75,000 a year.', ""And look, it's an incredible burden to carry. So now they're going to be able to buy a home, start a business, just get a little bit of breathing room."", ""And what are MAGA Republicans like Oz and Mastriano is talking about? They're trying to stop me. Their hypocrisy is unbelievable. The same MAGA Republicans who took hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even millions of dollars, in the pandemic relief loans—had their loans forgiven—are trying now to block student loans."", 'Marjorie Taylor Greene.', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. God bless her soul. [Laughter] She and her husband had $183,000 in PP loans forgiven. Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida, he got over $2 million forgiven. Who the hell do they think they are complaining about helping out students? Who do they think? I really mean it.', ""And what the students are going to—the people getting debt relief are going to be spending the money on growing the economy. For God's sake, Oz and MAGA Republicans don't think we should give working and middle class Americans a break. But here's what they do think instead: They want to make permanent the $2 trillion tax cut that they passed when Trump was President."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. That tax cut is—not a penny of it is paid for. And it goes to the biggest corporations. And it will explode the deficit by trillions of dollars.', ""They think—they think—the biggest oil companies that just—the sixth largest oil companies in the middle of this crisis we're in, you know how much money they made in the third and fourth quarter? I mean, the second and third quarter? One hundred billion dollars."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. One hundred billion. No—it's outrageous."", ""Look, they should have used that money, what they're supposed to do, to lower gas prices at the pump for the American people. If they did, the price at the pump nationally would be 50 cents lower than it is today per gallon."", ""It gets worse. Do you know what their number-one priority is if they win? They made it—look, they're saying it out loud. They want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs—gone. The $35 cap on insulin—gone. The tax credit for lower energy costs—gone. Fifteen-percent corporate tax—gone. And the $800 savings in health care premiums we just got for families in the Affordable Care Act—gone."", ""In fact, they want to do away with the Affordable Care Act. And that means millions of people with preexisting conditions would lose their insurance completely. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I'm never going to let it happen. And John Fetterman will not let it happen either."", ""But, folks, these guys and women never cease to amaze me, man. They never cease to amaze me. Now it gets worse. They're literally coming after Social Security and Medicare."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, no, no. Look, I know—I know that the only thing you ever—all you younger people in here—and thank God there's so many of you—I know the thing you know is, from the time you're 16, you have money taken out to pay for Social Security. But guess what? There's somebody out there busting their neck, or you just lost your husband or your wife, you're 66, 68 years old, and they want to take away your Medicare and your health—and your Social Security."", ""Now, you think I'm exaggerating. First—front page of the New York Times talks about it. I want to show you what—there's a guy out there—you know, they're telling us what they're going to do. They're saying it straight out loud. At least I give them credit for that."", ""And look, here's what they're going to do—they want to do. There is a guy named Senator Rick Scott of Florida——"", '[The President took a brochure from the podium.]', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. ——who's in charge of electing the Republicans in the Senate. He's the guy pushing Oz. Okay?"", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Well, let me show you.', 'I read from—they listed in a program—listed all their proposals. This is too small to be able to read. I just circled the one and brought it out here, and I\'m going to quote what they say about Social Security. It says: ""All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" It means the law literally goes out of existence unless it\'s affirmatively voted back into existence.', 'And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin—Senator.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. And by the way, he thinks 5 years is too long. Not a joke. I mean, this almost is so surreal sounding. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it for the first time, it goes away. Not a joke. It goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare, he also wants to put veterans benefits on the line."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Look, they'd put everything at risk. Elect John Fetterman to the Senate, please. He'll protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and will guarantee that veterans are always cared for—always, always, always."", ""I used to get criticized, when I first got elected years ago, when I'd say we have a lot of obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home. That's a sacred obligation. A sacred obligation."", ""Well, folks, that's why I pushed and signed a thing called the PACT Act. The PACT Act guarantees health care for servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. [Inaudible]—these burn pits are literally the size of a football field and range in depth from 8 to 10 feet. There's everything in them from jet fuel and human—just everything is burned in there."", ""You know, remember all the thing—all the fight about the cancer and the brain cancer so many firefighters were getting from the 9/11—the toxic exposure? Well, it's the same kind of thing."", ""I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 30 times. I had a son who spent a year in Iraq. He—his hooch was literally—literally—less than 200 yards from one of these burn pits."", ""Well, this new proposal guarantees health care for the servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. Because here's what it does: Like my son, so many went incredibly fit and came home dizzy and having trouble, and so many had brain cancer. My son came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, and he passed away."", ""But here's what we did. Up to now, we don't pay any attention to this. We haven't done anything for it. And we had to fight to get it done, and now for thousands and thousands of people coming home. More people coming home from these wars with brain cancer than any other war in American history, and other cancers. But guess what? Now, if they come home and you're still alive, you get full benefits for the health care to try to fight it. And the families and the children are getting monthly stipends for their families and tuition help for the children."", ""Look, folks, it's not just the—about the economy. Let's talk a little bit about crime and keeping communities safe. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. I proposed over 100,000 new police officers."", ""But here's the deal: Public safety is why John got into public service in the first place. Oz won't do a thing about guns. But John Fetterman vetoes—but, with your votes, John Fetterman will be in the Senate and be able to help me add one more thing—what I got done when I was a Senator: ban assault weapons. Ban them! Ban them. Ban them. They have no place in America."", ""But if Republicans take control of the Congress, they're going to pass another ban. They want to have a national ban on abortion."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. The overturning of Roe wasn't the end for them, it was just the beginning. States are already passing bans without exception for rape or incest or the life of the mother. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, he's going to make sure that if Oz is elected and other Republicans, they're going to ban choice completely."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Let me tell you something. If they get enough States to do that, they get the Congress to vote for that, I will veto it. It will not happen.', ""But if we elect John Fetterman to the Senate and keep control of the House, we can restore the right to choose in this country by codifying Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. And with Josh Shapiro as Governor, there'll be no ban in Pennsylvania."", ""Look, folks, I spoke a few days ago in Washington, just as I spoke a few weeks ago here in Philadelphia, about democracy being at risk. Democracy is literally on the ballot. This is a defining moment for the Nation. And we all—we all—must speak with one voice regardless of our party. There's no place in America for political violence. No place. No place for what we saw happen to Paul Pelosi, a friend of mine and Nancy's husband. No place for voter intimidation."", 'You see these guys standing there with rifles, outside of polling places? Come on. Where the hell do you think you are?', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. No, I'm—they're—well, I shouldn't get going. [Laughter] But there's no place for this. There's no place for this, period.

[At this point, the President briefly addressed audience members seated in the balcony as follows.] Don't jump! Good to see you all. This crowd's so loud I think you can hear us in Latrobe. They're going to hear us. They're going to hear us on Tuesday. Folks, I'm Jill Biden's husband—a Philly girl. She's ready for game six, like all of you. It's good to be home. It's good to be with family. And that includes someone we all love, Barack Obama, a great President, historic President, and, I'm proud to say, a dear friend. Well, folks, 3 days. Three days until one of the most important elections. One of the most important elections in our lifetime. It's going to shape—the outcome is going to shape our country for decades to come. And the power to shape that outcome is in your hands. Two years ago—[applause]—2 years ago, you used that power to make Donald Trump not only a former President, but you made him a defeated President. And this year, you have the power to make John Fetterman your next United States Senator and Josh Shapiro your next Governor. Look, folks, I want to be very clear, and I mean this sincerely, about what's on the ballot this year: Your right to choose is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Social Security and Medicare is on the ballot. There's something else on the ballot: character. Character is on the ballot. When I think of character, I think of John Fetterman. You know, in its endorsement of him, the Philadelphia Inquirer today said, ""John knows what""—he—""his values are."" Well, my—I've been saying it for a long time: I'm a Pennsylvania boy born and raised in Scranton and—[applause]—but for the longest time, Delaware, like many other small places, did not have a television station. So Philadelphia TV had to cover me the same as they covered all the Pennsylvania Senators. I was known as Pennsylvania's third Senator. My point is, I know Pennsylvania well. And John Fetterman is Pennsylvania. He is Pennsylvania. And Oz—and Pennsylvania? Audience members. Boo! The President. Look, I've lived—I lived in Pennsylvania longer than Oz has lived in Pennsylvania. And I moved away when I was 10 years old. [Laughter] Look, like a lot of us, John has gotten knocked down, but he gets back up. He's gotten up quickly. John has character, integrity, and he's going to be a hell of a good Senator—United States Senator for Pennsylvania. And the other thing is—— [Several audience members held signs reading ""Free Iran,"" and the President addressed them as follows.] Don't worry, we're going to talk about Iran. Courage. Courage is also on the ballot. When I think of courage, I think of Josh Shapiro. This guy will take on anyone and back down to no one, and we saw that in 2020. He stood up for the Constitution. He stood up for the rule of law. He stood up for the people of this State. And he's going to be one hell of a fantastic Governor. He really is. But it's not just John and Josh; we've got a great Democratic lineup on the ballot here in this State. You heard from a lot of them today. You heard from a lot of them. We have some—we have one of the best delegations in Congress—""we""—I keep making myself a Pennsylvanian again. [Laughter] But, really, Democrats up and down the ballot. We need to elect them all. We need it badly. Pennsylvania, this isn't a referendum this year, it's a choice, a choice between two vastly different visions of America. Vastly different. Maybe it's in our blood, but John and I believe that all—it's all about fighting for working and middle class people, the way I've said from the beginning of my—my objective when I ran for President was to build an economy from the bottom up and the—bottom up and the middle out. It's a fundamental shift compared to the Oz and the mega MAGA Republican trickle-down economics. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, really. This ain't your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. I really mean it. I really mean it. Look, they're all about the wealthier getting wealth and the wealthier staying wealthy. The middle class gets stiffed and the poor get poorer under their policy. You saw what happened last time, under my predecessor. The economy was in ruins. He was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs in the course of his Presidency. Unemployment rate—the unemployment rate was 6.4 percent. He lost manufacturing jobs and hundreds of small businesses here in this State and 100,000 nationwide. Look, folks, the country was in a pandemic with no plan how to get out. The day I was sworn in, only 2 million people had been vaccinated. Now more than 220 [million]* Americans are fully vaccinated. So we moved. And our approach is working. Since I came to office, we've created 10 million new good-paying jobs. Ten million. Because of you all. Ten million. The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a near-record 50-year low. John and I understand we need to make things in America the first time in a long time, and we are. That means instead of shipping jobs overseas, we're shipping product overseas. I'm serious. We've created, so far, 700,000 manufacturing jobs just in the last 20 months. Seven hundred thousand. But for all our progress—and by the way, where the hell is it—heck is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Because we will be. We will be. And, folks, look—but a lot of families are still struggling. A lot of families are struggling. That's why I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act that's going to reduce the cost of everyday things in families in Pennsylvania. Things you have to pay for every month and you have to have enough in your paycheck to do it. We gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs, the same power the Veterans Administration has to cut drug prices in half. We tried to get that done for years when I was in the Senate and Vice President. But Big Pharma spent a lot of money, and folks—and supported a lot of folks. Well, guess what? Not this year. We beat Big Pharma. And the American people won. We put a cap of $2,000 a year on prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare no matter what their drug costs were, and some of them pay $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year for a cancer drug. But now, beginning January 1, they will not have to pay more than $2,000 a year, period. Period. And we put a cap on insulin to deal with their diabetes. Instead of paying $400 a month like they're paying now, they're going to pay no more than $35 a month. And with John Fetterman in the Senate, with that one more vote I need, we're going to make sure we cap those prices for every single person, every—all that—[inaudible]—because they blocked—we had it in the original bill, but it only stayed in for Medicare recipients. But, everyone, how many of you know somebody who has to take insulin for diabetes? Look around. And it's incredibly costly. No matter what your age, it is badly needed. And, folks, look, we made the biggest investment to deal with the climate crisis ever. We're lowering energy costs for families. And by the way, Josh and John know that we can cap oil and gas price wells, abandoned mines. We can do that in Western Pennsylvania. We can create thousands of good-paying jobs for the same people who dug those mines in the first place. That's why we're investing $350 million here in this part of the country to do just that. We're not just talking it, we're doing it. And we're going to do this while reducing the Federal deficit. You know, because of the help I had from the Senators in the Democratic Congress, we literally cut the Federal debt in half by $1.4 trillion—[applause]—$1.4 trillion just this year and last year by $350 billion. And another $250 billion over the next decade. Look, I don't want to hear from the MAGA Republicans who blew up the debt. We're the ones bringing it down. They'd shot it up. And by such a massive reduction in debt, we're able to help working and middle class families in America. Look—and we're finally making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, for God's sake. One of the reasons they're so upset with me is, we just passed a minimum 15-percent tax. Look, folks, if you're a schoolteacher, you pay more than that. If you're a cop, you pay more than that 15 percent. But the days are over where corporations are paying zero Federal tax. And by the way, in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion, and they paid not one single penny in Federal tax. Not one. Audience members. Boo! The President. Because we reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help millions of working and middle class folks caught in the crossfire of the pandemic and the—and what happened with the Russians moving into Ukraine. Because I acted, we provided $10,000 in student debt relief and another—another—10,000 bucks if you got a Pell grant. No one under 20—you have to be making less than 125 [125,000]* a year. And 90 percent of that money goes to people earning less than $75,000 a year. And look, it's an incredible burden to carry. So now they're going to be able to buy a home, start a business, just get a little bit of breathing room. And what are MAGA Republicans like Oz and Mastriano is talking about? They're trying to stop me. Their hypocrisy is unbelievable. The same MAGA Republicans who took hundreds of thousands of dollars, and even millions of dollars, in the pandemic relief loans—had their loans forgiven—are trying now to block student loans. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. God bless her soul. [Laughter] She and her husband had $183,000 in PP loans forgiven. Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida, he got over $2 million forgiven. Who the hell do they think they are complaining about helping out students? Who do they think? I really mean it. And what the students are going to—the people getting debt relief are going to be spending the money on growing the economy. For God's sake, Oz and MAGA Republicans don't think we should give working and middle class Americans a break. But here's what they do think instead: They want to make permanent the $2 trillion tax cut that they passed when Trump was President. Audience members. Boo! The President. That tax cut is—not a penny of it is paid for. And it goes to the biggest corporations. And it will explode the deficit by trillions of dollars. They think—they think—the biggest oil companies that just—the sixth largest oil companies in the middle of this crisis we're in, you know how much money they made in the third and fourth quarter? I mean, the second and third quarter? One hundred billion dollars. Audience members. Boo! The President. One hundred billion. No—it's outrageous. Look, they should have used that money, what they're supposed to do, to lower gas prices at the pump for the American people. If they did, the price at the pump nationally would be 50 cents lower than it is today per gallon. It gets worse. Do you know what their number-one priority is if they win? They made it—look, they're saying it out loud. They want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs—gone. The $35 cap on insulin—gone. The tax credit for lower energy costs—gone. Fifteen-percent corporate tax—gone. And the $800 savings in health care premiums we just got for families in the Affordable Care Act—gone. In fact, they want to do away with the Affordable Care Act. And that means millions of people with preexisting conditions would lose their insurance completely. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I'm never going to let it happen. And John Fetterman will not let it happen either. But, folks, these guys and women never cease to amaze me, man. They never cease to amaze me. Now it gets worse. They're literally coming after Social Security and Medicare. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. Look, I know—I know that the only thing you ever—all you younger people in here—and thank God there's so many of you—I know the thing you know is, from the time you're 16, you have money taken out to pay for Social Security. But guess what? There's somebody out there busting their neck, or you just lost your husband or your wife, you're 66, 68 years old, and they want to take away your Medicare and your health—and your Social Security. Now, you think I'm exaggerating. First—front page of the New York Times talks about it. I want to show you what—there's a guy out there—you know, they're telling us what they're going to do. They're saying it straight out loud. At least I give them credit for that. And look, here's what they're going to do—they want to do. There is a guy named Senator Rick Scott of Florida—— [The President took a brochure from the podium.] Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who's in charge of electing the Republicans in the Senate. He's the guy pushing Oz. Okay? Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, let me show you. I read from—they listed in a program—listed all their proposals. This is too small to be able to read. I just circled the one and brought it out here, and I'm going to quote what they say about Social Security. It says: ""All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" It means the law literally goes out of existence unless it's affirmatively voted back into existence. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin—Senator. Audience members. Boo! The President. And by the way, he thinks 5 years is too long. Not a joke. I mean, this almost is so surreal sounding. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it for the first time, it goes away. Not a joke. It goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare, he also wants to put veterans benefits on the line. Audience members. Boo! The President. Look, they'd put everything at risk. Elect John Fetterman to the Senate, please. He'll protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and will guarantee that veterans are always cared for—always, always, always. I used to get criticized, when I first got elected years ago, when I'd say we have a lot of obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home. That's a sacred obligation. A sacred obligation. Well, folks, that's why I pushed and signed a thing called the PACT Act. The PACT Act guarantees health care for servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. [Inaudible]—these burn pits are literally the size of a football field and range in depth from 8 to 10 feet. There's everything in them from jet fuel and human—just everything is burned in there. You know, remember all the thing—all the fight about the cancer and the brain cancer so many firefighters were getting from the 9/11—the toxic exposure? Well, it's the same kind of thing. I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 30 times. I had a son who spent a year in Iraq. He—his hooch was literally—literally—less than 200 yards from one of these burn pits. Well, this new proposal guarantees health care for the servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. Because here's what it does: Like my son, so many went incredibly fit and came home dizzy and having trouble, and so many had brain cancer. My son came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, and he passed away. But here's what we did. Up to now, we don't pay any attention to this. We haven't done anything for it. And we had to fight to get it done, and now for thousands and thousands of people coming home. More people coming home from these wars with brain cancer than any other war in American history, and other cancers. But guess what? Now, if they come home and you're still alive, you get full benefits for the health care to try to fight it. And the families and the children are getting monthly stipends for their families and tuition help for the children. Look, folks, it's not just the—about the economy. Let's talk a little bit about crime and keeping communities safe. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. I proposed over 100,000 new police officers. But here's the deal: Public safety is why John got into public service in the first place. Oz won't do a thing about guns. But John Fetterman vetoes—but, with your votes, John Fetterman will be in the Senate and be able to help me add one more thing—what I got done when I was a Senator: ban assault weapons. Ban them! Ban them. Ban them. They have no place in America. But if Republicans take control of the Congress, they're going to pass another ban. They want to have a national ban on abortion. Audience members. Boo! The President. The overturning of Roe wasn't the end for them, it was just the beginning. States are already passing bans without exception for rape or incest or the life of the mother. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, he's going to make sure that if Oz is elected and other Republicans, they're going to ban choice completely. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me tell you something. If they get enough States to do that, they get the Congress to vote for that, I will veto it. It will not happen. But if we elect John Fetterman to the Senate and keep control of the House, we can restore the right to choose in this country by codifying Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. And with Josh Shapiro as Governor, there'll be no ban in Pennsylvania. Look, folks, I spoke a few days ago in Washington, just as I spoke a few weeks ago here in Philadelphia, about democracy being at risk. Democracy is literally on the ballot. This is a defining moment for the Nation. And we all—we all—must speak with one voice regardless of our party. There's no place in America for political violence. No place. No place for what we saw happen to Paul Pelosi, a friend of mine and Nancy's husband. No place for voter intimidation. You see these guys standing there with rifles, outside of polling places? Come on. Where the hell do you think you are? Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No, I'm—they're—well, I shouldn't get going. [Laughter] But there's no place for this. There's no place for this, period. We have to reaffirm the values that have long defined us. America—in America, the vote is sacred. The vote is to protect and be protected and counted. And, folks, let me close with this: Here in Philadelphia, a place that defines the soul of America—[applause]—today—today—I've been saying this for now years—today, we face an inflection point, one of those—one of those moments that comes along every several generations. One of those moments that you're going to look back on it years from now and know whether or not we met the moment based on the State of affairs 10, 15 years from now. I want you to know: We're going to meet that moment, just like we've done before. We are—we're going to enter those final days of this midterm election remembering that the power of America is in your hands. It really is. With—people, just remember, your vote elected Barack Obama President. Your vote elected a son from Scranton President. And your vote elected Kamala Harris the first Black woman Vice President. And with your vote, you can elect Josh Shapiro as your next Governor, and you can elect John Fetterman as your next United States Senator! Folks, I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I've never been more optimistic. Looking around this crowd, it reinforces what I think: The generation between the ages of 18 and 30 is the most involved—the most involved, the most generous, the least prejudiced, and the most engaged generation in American history. I look at America reasserting itself around the world and leading the world in the 21st century. I've traveled this country and seen this great nation, because we are good people. I know this. There's no quit in John Fetterman. There's no quit in Pennsylvania. There is no quit in America. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America! I mean it. And there's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together. So vote! Get out and vote! And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. God bless her soul. [Laughter] She and her husband had $183,000 in PP loans forgiven. Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida, he got over $2 million forgiven. Who the hell do they think they are complaining about helping out students? Who do they think? I really mean it. And what the students are going to—the people getting debt relief are going to be spending the money on growing the economy. For God's sake, Oz and MAGA Republicans don't think we should give working and middle class Americans a break. But here's what they do think instead: They want to make permanent the $2 trillion tax cut that they passed when Trump was President. Audience members. Boo! The President. That tax cut is—not a penny of it is paid for. And it goes to the biggest corporations. And it will explode the deficit by trillions of dollars. They think—they think—the biggest oil companies that just—the sixth largest oil companies in the middle of this crisis we're in, you know how much money they made in the third and fourth quarter? I mean, the second and third quarter? One hundred billion dollars. Audience members. Boo! The President. One hundred billion. No—it's outrageous. Look, they should have used that money, what they're supposed to do, to lower gas prices at the pump for the American people. If they did, the price at the pump nationally would be 50 cents lower than it is today per gallon. It gets worse. Do you know what their number-one priority is if they win? They made it—look, they're saying it out loud. They want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs—gone. The $35 cap on insulin—gone. The tax credit for lower energy costs—gone. Fifteen-percent corporate tax—gone. And the $800 savings in health care premiums we just got for families in the Affordable Care Act—gone. In fact, they want to do away with the Affordable Care Act. And that means millions of people with preexisting conditions would lose their insurance completely. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I'm never going to let it happen. And John Fetterman will not let it happen either. But, folks, these guys and women never cease to amaze me, man. They never cease to amaze me. Now it gets worse. They're literally coming after Social Security and Medicare. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. Look, I know—I know that the only thing you ever—all you younger people in here—and thank God there's so many of you—I know the thing you know is, from the time you're 16, you have money taken out to pay for Social Security. But guess what? There's somebody out there busting their neck, or you just lost your husband or your wife, you're 66, 68 years old, and they want to take away your Medicare and your health—and your Social Security. Now, you think I'm exaggerating. First—front page of the New York Times talks about it. I want to show you what—there's a guy out there—you know, they're telling us what they're going to do. They're saying it straight out loud. At least I give them credit for that. And look, here's what they're going to do—they want to do. There is a guy named Senator Rick Scott of Florida—— [The President took a brochure from the podium.] Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who's in charge of electing the Republicans in the Senate. He's the guy pushing Oz. Okay? Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, let me show you. I read from—they listed in a program—listed all their proposals. This is too small to be able to read. I just circled the one and brought it out here, and I'm going to quote what they say about Social Security. It says: ""All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" It means the law literally goes out of existence unless it's affirmatively voted back into existence. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin—Senator. Audience members. Boo! The President. And by the way, he thinks 5 years is too long. Not a joke. I mean, this almost is so surreal sounding. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single year. If Congress doesn't vote to keep it for the first time, it goes away. Not a joke. It goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare, he also wants to put veterans benefits on the line. Audience members. Boo! The President. Look, they'd put everything at risk. Elect John Fetterman to the Senate, please. He'll protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare and will guarantee that veterans are always cared for—always, always, always. I used to get criticized, when I first got elected years ago, when I'd say we have a lot of obligations, but only one truly sacred obligation: to prepare those we send to war and to care for them and their families when they come home. That's a sacred obligation. A sacred obligation. Well, folks, that's why I pushed and signed a thing called the PACT Act. The PACT Act guarantees health care for servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. [Inaudible]—these burn pits are literally the size of a football field and range in depth from 8 to 10 feet. There's everything in them from jet fuel and human—just everything is burned in there. You know, remember all the thing—all the fight about the cancer and the brain cancer so many firefighters were getting from the 9/11—the toxic exposure? Well, it's the same kind of thing. I've been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 30 times. I had a son who spent a year in Iraq. He—his hooch was literally—literally—less than 200 yards from one of these burn pits. Well, this new proposal guarantees health care for the servicemembers and veterans exposed to toxic burn pits. Because here's what it does: Like my son, so many went incredibly fit and came home dizzy and having trouble, and so many had brain cancer. My son came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, and he passed away. But here's what we did. Up to now, we don't pay any attention to this. We haven't done anything for it. And we had to fight to get it done, and now for thousands and thousands of people coming home. More people coming home from these wars with brain cancer than any other war in American history, and other cancers. But guess what? Now, if they come home and you're still alive, you get full benefits for the health care to try to fight it. And the families and the children are getting monthly stipends for their families and tuition help for the children. Look, folks, it's not just the—about the economy. Let's talk a little bit about crime and keeping communities safe. I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. I proposed over 100,000 new police officers. But here's the deal: Public safety is why John got into public service in the first place. Oz won't do a thing about guns. But John Fetterman vetoes—but, with your votes, John Fetterman will be in the Senate and be able to help me add one more thing—what I got done when I was a Senator: ban assault weapons. Ban them! Ban them. Ban them. They have no place in America. But if Republicans take control of the Congress, they're going to pass another ban. They want to have a national ban on abortion. Audience members. Boo! The President. The overturning of Roe wasn't the end for them, it was just the beginning. States are already passing bans without exception for rape or incest or the life of the mother. And Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, he's going to make sure that if Oz is elected and other Republicans, they're going to ban choice completely. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me tell you something. If they get enough States to do that, they get the Congress to vote for that, I will veto it. It will not happen. But if we elect John Fetterman to the Senate and keep control of the House, we can restore the right to choose in this country by codifying Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. And with Josh Shapiro as Governor, there'll be no ban in Pennsylvania. Look, folks, I spoke a few days ago in Washington, just as I spoke a few weeks ago here in Philadelphia, about democracy being at risk. Democracy is literally on the ballot. This is a defining moment for the Nation. And we all—we all—must speak with one voice regardless of our party. There's no place in America for political violence. No place. No place for what we saw happen to Paul Pelosi, a friend of mine and Nancy's husband. No place for voter intimidation. You see these guys standing there with rifles, outside of polling places? Come on. Where the hell do you think you are? Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No, I'm—they're—well, I shouldn't get going. [Laughter] But there's no place for this. There's no place for this, period. We have to reaffirm the values that have long defined us. America—in America, the vote is sacred. The vote is to protect and be protected and counted. And, folks, let me close with this: Here in Philadelphia, a place that defines the soul of America—[applause]—today—today—I've been saying this for now years—today, we face an inflection point, one of those—one of those moments that comes along every several generations. One of those moments that you're going to look back on it years from now and know whether or not we met the moment based on the State of affairs 10, 15 years from now. I want you to know: We're going to meet that moment, just like we've done before. We are—we're going to enter those final days of this midterm election remembering that the power of America is in your hands. It really is. With—people, just remember, your vote elected Barack Obama President. Your vote elected a son from Scranton President. And your vote elected Kamala Harris the first Black woman Vice President. And with your vote, you can elect Josh Shapiro as your next Governor, and you can elect John Fetterman as your next United States Senator! Folks, I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I've never been more optimistic. Looking around this crowd, it reinforces what I think: The generation between the ages of 18 and 30 is the most involved—the most involved, the most generous, the least prejudiced, and the most engaged generation in American history. I look at America reasserting itself around the world and leading the world in the 21st century. I've traveled this country and seen this great nation, because we are good people. I know this. There's no quit in John Fetterman. There's no quit in Pennsylvania. There is no quit in America. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America! I mean it. And there's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together. So vote! Get out and vote! And may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you.","['hello', 'philadelphia', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'jump', 'see', 'crowds', 'loud', 'hear', 'latrobe', 'theyre', 'hear', 'theyre', 'hear', 'tuesday', 'folks', 'im', 'jill', 'bidens',

I've said from the beginning: My objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out."", ""And I tell you what, it's a fundamental shift. And it's working, compared to the MAGA mega-Republican trickle-down economics."", ""You saw what happened last time under my predecessor. The economy—he left it in ruins. He's the first President in America since Herbert Hoover to lose more jobs than he got—than he had when he came to office. Fewer jobs. An unemployment rate—6.4 percent. He lost manufacturing jobs. Hundreds of small businesses closed in this State alone, let alone around the Nation—thousands."", 'And the country in a pandemic with no way out. By the time I got sworn in, only 3.5 million people had been vaccinated—fully vaccinated. Now there are 220 million we got done.', ""So we moved. Our approach is working.

We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe!', 'The President. I tell you, I love that.', 'And by the way, Zeldin voted against the CHIPS and Science Act. Chuck introduced and passed that companies are investing across America and manufacturing semiconductors at home.', ""You know, one of the reasons why inflation went up so much the first quarter last year was the cost of automobiles. Why? They could not get computer chips. Ain't nothing built these days without computer chips, including our defense establishment—microchips that are now part of everything. We invented the computer chip here in the United States of America, and then somehow we forgot about it."", ""You know, the fact is that it will create 50,000 new jobs right here in New York. And that's on top of the 700,000 we've already created"", ""Look, Governor Hochul pushed a similar law.

This is a really big deal for this State and this country."", ""And, folks, but for all our progress, we know a lot of families are still struggling. That's why, with Chuck's leadership and the help of your Members of Congress, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act. It's going reduce the costs of everything that New Yorkers pay for every month."", 'You know, Congressman Zeldin voted against that as well. It gives——', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. ——by the way, that act gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs—the same power that the VA—the Veterans Administration—has and has used it to cut drug prices in half.

Big Pharma——', '[There was a disruption in the audience.]', 'Big Pharma almost always stopped this, but not this year. This year, Big Pharma lost and the American people won!

Anyway. [Laughter]"", ""No matter what the cost. And some cancer drugs cost as much as that. They're never going to have to pay more than $2,000.

[Applause] Well, they're paying an average of 400 bucks a month now. It costs 10 bucks to make it, 15 bucks to—a total of 15 to package it, and they're charging $4- to $800. That's over now."", ""Because—and we're coming back to make sure that it not only applies to those who folks who, in fact, are on Medicare. We originally had it for everybody, but Republicans jumped in and blocked—block—got two Democrats to block it for everyone. But guess what? We're going to make sure everyone has that lifesaving insulin regardless of their age, if—when we come back,"", ""And we're making the biggest investment ever to deal with climate—ever, ever, ever—$468 billion to start with. That's going to lower energy costs for families."", 'Again, Congressman Zeldin voted against it. Voted against it.', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. We\'re doing all this while reducing—by the way, you know Republicans say those ""big-spendin\' Democrats."" Well, guess what, guys? I got handed the biggest deficit in history. Guess what? I have cut the deficit $1.4 trillion just this year, the largest in American history. Never has it happened before.', ""We also cut $350 billion in the deficit last year. And we're going to cut another $250 billion in the next decade. And we did all these things without raising a single penny in tax on anyone who made less than $400,000 a year. Not a single penny."", ""I don't want to hear it from Republicans who blew up the deficit. Remember: These are the same guys that passed a $2 trillion tax cut when Trump was President that overwhelmingly benefited the superwealthy and big corporations and didn't pay for 1 cent of it. Not one single cent of it."", ""And the ones—you know, we're the ones bringing down the debt—they're the ones who raise it—allowing us to help provide ordinary middle class citizens a shot."", ""You know, and we're finally making sure the biggest corporation begin to pay their fair share. I raised—we raised the minimum tax of—on corporate America a staggering 15 percent. Give me a break. Firefighters pay more than that. But 15 percent—again, which Congressman Zeldin voted against. He didn't think we should raise the tax on—and guess what? There were over—the corporates are paying zero in Federal—there were 55 of the Fortune 500 companies in 2020, when I got elected, that paid zero in Federal tax. It's about damn time they paid a little. They made $40 billion, and they paid zero."", ""Look, because we've reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help millions of working and middle class folks caught in the crossfire of the pandemic and an economic crisis left to us by Trump."", ""And here on this college campus—and you are one of the best universities—colleges in America. No, you really are. And it's not just because—it's not just because my Ambassador to Japan keeps pounding it in my head, but it's true. [Laughter]"", ""Look, because we've acted, we're providing $10,000 debt relief for students, and if you had a Pell grant, a total of $20,000 relief from student debt. And by the way, 95 percent of that going to people earning less than 75 grand. You know, so you can start a business, pay—make a down payment on a home, just have a little bit of breathing room. That's what it's about."", ""And what are the MAGA Republicans doing about it? They're trying to stop it."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Congressman Zeldin called it ""flat-out wrong.""', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Folks, their hypocrisy is unbelievable. The MAGA Republican Members of Congress—this is a fact; as they say, ""Check it out""—we took hundreds—they took hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars in pandemic relief loans. Remember we had, during the pandemic, we said we were going to do these PPP loans. People who—their business was under—was taken down because of COVID and the rest.', ""Well, guess what? They're trying to block—these are the ones trying to block student relief."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. And one of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene——', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. She got $183,000 in PP loans.', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida got over $2 million forgiven.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Now they forgot—they've forgiven those loans. Who in the hell do they think they are criticizing somebody getting 10 grand and struggling to get through school?"", ""Folks, that's some of the big stuff we've done. Now let's take a look at our Republican friends. Do you know what their number-one priority is? Not a joke. The interesting thing about these guys: They're accidentally being honest. [Laughter] Because they're just saying it out loud, what they're for."", 'You know, they want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs if they take back the Congress—gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin—gone. Tax credits for lower energy costs—gone. The 15-percent corporate minimum tax—gone. The $800 savings in health care premiums we just got families on the Affordable Care Act—gone. In fact, these guys still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act altogether.', ""You know what that means? It means that millions and millions of Americans who only have insurance because they have a preexisting condition because it exists—that Affordable Cart Act—is gone. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I ain't going to let it happen."", ""And, folks—and it gets worse. They're coming after Social Security and Medicare. It doesn't affect you students now except you pay into it already if you have a job."", ""You think I'm kidding? Don't listen to me. Listen to what they're telling—what they're telling us they're going to do it. Senator Rick Scott, he's the guy from Florida in charge of electing Republican Senators."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. They put out a brochure, okay? The brochure says just one thing: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years."" Continuing quote: ""If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Translation: If they don\'t vote it back into existence, it goes out of existence. No longer any major program.', 'And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. As my mother would say, ""God bless his soul."" [Laughter] He thinks 5 years is—this is real; I wouldn\'t have believed this. They\'re just saying it out loud, as I said. He thinks 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single, solitary year. Every single, solitary year.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. And if Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare he wants to do, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk. But if Democrats keep control of Congress, we'll guarantee that veterans are always cared for, folks."", ""Look—and by the way, as long as I'm in the United States Presidency, I'm going to veto it if they get it anyway."", ""Look, there's one more thing I have to mention. I signed what's called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws for our Nation's history that helps millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, like the firefighters in 9/11 were, and they all came down with cancer and other illnesses. Well, only these were veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan exposed to burn pits."", 'A burn pit is a hole in the ground literally the size of a football field, 8 to 10 feet deep. They burn, in that, everything—poisonous chemicals, tires, jet fuel, and so much other waste. And guess what? The law guarantees health care for those exposed those burn pits.', 'And on a personal note—as we used to say when I was a Senator, ""and a point of personal privilege""—my son Beau Biden—my son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one talking to you today, not me.', ""And he gave up his seat as attorney general to go with his regiment, his group from the National Guard. You either have to—you work for the President or you work for the Governor; you can't work for both. So he gave up his job. And he went with his group for a year to Iraq at Camp Liberty."", 'I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 35 times. And I saw him. And I was—went—they call the ""hooch,"" the place they live in, a little tent. And it was only about 250 yards from that burn pit. He went extremely fit and one of the most fit guys in his regiment, in his deal. And he came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, which there\'s no cure for. And he died. He died.', 'And so many others are in the same situation as he was in. And a lot of people in that situation without the kind of help that—whose families able to have with our family. But this law guarantees care—health care to those exposed to those burn pits. And if they were to pass, it guarantees tuition benefits and assistance to their families and their children to go to school.', ""That's the least we can do, it seems to me. The least we can do."", ""And, folks, there's more. Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham——"", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. ——already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Now, Governor Hochul is the first woman to serve as Governor of New York. And on Tuesday night, with your help, she'll be the first—woman elected Governor of New York."", 'And even before the Dobbs decision came down, your Governor took action to protect patients and doctors to ensure that the right to choose for a woman in New York would be protected. And her opponent, meanwhile, believes that there should be no exceptions, even for rape or incest—none.', ""His position is extreme. For example, he's been down in Washington voting over and over again to defund Planned Parenthood. He's in the—and look, here's the bottom line: If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And if we elect—they give me two more Democrats in the Senate and we keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the law of the land."", ""Folks, Governor Hochul's opponent talks a good game on crime. But it's all talk. It's all talk. I chaired the Judiciary Committee for years. I'm the guy that introduced the money for police officers and reforms. But let's look at the fact."", ""Back on March 2021, as COVID was hitting the economy hard, mayors all over the country—Democrats and Republicans—said they were going to have to lay off thousands of cops because they didn't have any budget money coming in. They didn't have taxes coming in."", 'So I came up with a plan called the American Rescue Plan. It gave States and local governments money they needed to keep cops on the beat, schoolteachers on the job, firefighters on the job. And—but when it came time to vote for this plan in Congress, not a single Republican voted for it.', ""And they talk about the reason why you were able to keep your cops and firefighters and first responders is because of that legislation. That's the reason. And they voted against it. And then they whine about how they're so tough."", ""Republican leaders decided to play politics. Governor Hochul's opponent had a choice: You can keep cops on the job or cave to his Republican leaders. I'll give you one guess what he did. He caved. He voted against keeping cops on the beat and decided to play politics instead."", ""And then in May, Governor Hochul and I were together in Buffalo—I've visited every mass shooting site—in the weeks after that senseless, evil mass shooting. We met with the families, spent 4 hours. And you could feel the anger and disgust."", ""It would have been easy to feel helpless, but Governor Hochul decided to do something about it. Less than a month after the shooting, the Governor signed a package of bills strengthening New York's gun laws."", 'Her opponent\'s plan for public safety is to put more guns on the street. He opposed ""red flag"" laws, which would take guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger to themselves and others. Look, what kind of sense does that make?', 'On the Federal level, we passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. And Zeldin opposed it.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. And we're coming back. I'm the guy that got the assault weapons ban the first and—that lasted for 10 years. And when we had that ban, mass shootings dropped precipitously. Well, I'm coming back and getting that assault weapons ban again. It makes no sense."", ""Once again, Kathy's opponent is siding with the NRA. He voted against the assault weapons ban, refused to keep these weapons of war off the streets. And as I point out all the time, what comes out of a muzzle of an assault weapon is five times quicker, faster than comes out of a muzzle of another gun. It can pierce a Kevlar vest. There are not a whole lot of deer out there wearing Kevlar vests."", ""Look, folks, this is crazy. If from a—if a politician won't stand up for his—to his party leaders and keep cops on the beat, if he won't stand up to the NRA and get assault weapons off their street, do you really think he's going to take and help your families keep safe?"", 'Audience members. No!', ""The President. Look, I'll tell you: He won't, but Kathy will."", 'Folks, as I spoke—as I spoke about a few days ago, democracy is literally on the ballot.', ""I've making this case since I ran. You know, there are more than 300 Republican candidates for State, local, and Federal office who are election deniers, who say that I did not win the election even though the hundreds of attempts to challenge that have all failed, even in Republican courts."", ""Well, Kathy's opponent is one of those election deniers. These deniers are not only trying to deny your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, I'm not joking. I'm not joking. With these election deniers, there are only two outcomes for any election: either they win, or they were cheated. No, I'm serious. Think about it."", 'But let me tell you something: You can\'t only love the country when you win. And, folks, these are the same guys, many of them, who said what happened on January the 6th, 2 years ago, the people who were engaged in that were ""patriots.""', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. No, I mean—no, all kidding aside. You're all students of history—most of you are not old enough to have lived it very much, but you're students of it. Can you think of any other time since the Civil War where anybody says things like that—where it's happened, where violence is condoned?"", ""Look what happened. My friend Paul—anyway. I shouldn't even get into it, I'll get going. [Laughter] But Nancy Pelosi's husband—look what the Republicans said. Some of them making fun of it or making excuses. There's never been a time in my career when we've glorified violence based on a political basis."", ""Let me close with this. Today, as I said earlier, we face one of those inflection points, one of those moments that not only—it only comes around every three, four, or five generations. We all know it in our bones that our democracy is at risk. The latest polls say 76 percent of American people worry about maintaining our democracy. And we know that this is a—your generation's moment to defend it, to preserve it, to choose it."", ""And I want you to know, we'll meet this moment. Remember: The power of—in America lies where it always does—with you. That's not hyperbole. With you, the votes."", ""And the reason I have been—everybody ask me, keeps asking why I'm so optimistic—and I'm not joking, I've been saying this for a year—because of you. And here's—I'm being deadly earnest. You're the best educated, you're the least prejudiced, you're the most engaged, you're the most involved generation in American history."", ""And you look at all the polling data. If you all show up and vote, democracy is sustained. Not a joke. This is not hyperbole. For the second time, not a joke. It matters. It's in your hands.

I look at America reasserting itself to lead the world in the 21st century."", ""I've traveled this country, and I've traveled the world, before and since I've been President.

What would you think?""', 'I\'m being deadly earnest now. I give you my word this was what the discussion was.

[Inaudible]—look, this election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. I've said from the beginning: My objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And I tell you what, it's a fundamental shift. And it's working, compared to the MAGA mega-Republican trickle-down economics. You saw what happened last time under my predecessor. The economy—he left it in ruins. He's the first President in America since Herbert Hoover to lose more jobs than he got—than he had when he came to office. Fewer jobs. An unemployment rate—6.4 percent. He lost manufacturing jobs. Hundreds of small businesses closed in this State alone, let alone around the Nation—thousands. And the country in a pandemic with no way out. By the time I got sworn in, only 3.5 million people had been vaccinated—fully vaccinated. Now there are 220 million we got done. So we moved. Our approach is working. Since I came to office, we've created 10 million brand new jobs. The unemployment rate is at a historic low of 3.7 percent. And we're making things here in America again. We're shipping American products overseas instead of American jobs overseas. We've created 700,000 new manufacturing jobs. And by the way, where the hell is it written to say we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? I'm not joking. Where is that written? I signed into law the bipartisan infrastructure law. By the way, the Governor's opponent, Zeldin, voted against that. Audience members. Boo! The President. But as the Governor said, she's still fixing the roads and bridges in his district, even though he's against it. But he'll probably take credit for it somewhere along the line. The most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. And your Governor is making sure all that money is coming to New York and is—billions—is getting out the door right away. She's repairing roads, bridges, building New York's electric vehicle charging stations, expanding access to high-speed internet, cleaning up the water systems. You know, she's helping New York lead—lead the way of making things in America. As you just heard, I wish your Governor—a few weeks ago—I was with her a few weeks ago in Syracuse, New York. And guess what? Before that, I was in Poughkeepsie with her. And thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, again—— [There was a disruption in the audience.] Well, let me tell you—[laughter]. Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe! The President. I tell you, I love that. And by the way, Zeldin voted against the CHIPS and Science Act. Chuck introduced and passed that companies are investing across America and manufacturing semiconductors at home. You know, one of the reasons why inflation went up so much the first quarter last year was the cost of automobiles. Why? They could not get computer chips. Ain't nothing built these days without computer chips, including our defense establishment—microchips that are now part of everything. We invented the computer chip here in the United States of America, and then somehow we forgot about it. You know, the fact is that it will create 50,000 new jobs right here in New York. And that's on top of the 700,000 we've already created Look, Governor Hochul pushed a similar law. Had we just done the CHIPS Act, we would not have—I—we—may very well have been—you know, Syracuse may have gone—the Syracuse investment may very well—Micron's investment of $100 billion may have gone to Texas. But she moved here in the State to provide help as well. Micron is going to build semiconductor factories in Syracuse. IBM making a $20 billion commitment in Poughkeepsie, where I just was. And you know, this couldn't have happened without your Governor. I mean that sincerely. This is a really big deal for this State and this country. And, folks, but for all our progress, we know a lot of families are still struggling. That's why, with Chuck's leadership and the help of your Members of Congress, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act. It's going reduce the costs of everything that New Yorkers pay for every month. You know, Congressman Zeldin voted against that as well. It gives—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——by the way, that act gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs—the same power that the VA—the Veterans Administration—has and has used it to cut drug prices in half. But they said: ""No, no, Big Pharma had too much power. You could never get Medicare to be in that position."" Well, we tried to get it done for years. Big Pharma—— [There was a disruption in the audience.] Big Pharma almost always stopped this, but not this year. This year, Big Pharma lost and the American people won! We put a cap of $2,000 a year on prescription drugs for seniors no matter what their cost—2, 10, 12, 15. [The President stumbled on a floor wire.] Oops, stepping on a—there's a—it's black. Anyway. [Laughter] No matter what the cost. And some cancer drugs cost as much as that. They're never going to have to pay more than $2,000. And we put a $35-a-month cap on insulin to deal with their diabetes. How many of you people know somebody who needs insulin for their diabetes? [Applause] Well, they're paying an average of 400 bucks a month now. It costs 10 bucks to make it, 15 bucks to—a total of 15 to package it, and they're charging $4- to $800. That's over now. Because—and we're coming back to make sure that it not only applies to those who folks who, in fact, are on Medicare. We originally had it for everybody, but Republicans jumped in and blocked—block—got two Democrats to block it for everyone. But guess what? We're going to make sure everyone has that lifesaving insulin regardless of their age, if—when we come back, And we're making the biggest investment ever to deal with climate—ever, ever, ever—$468 billion to start with. That's going to lower energy costs for families. Again, Congressman Zeldin voted against it. Voted against it. Audience members. Boo! The President. We're doing all this while reducing—by the way, you know Republicans say those ""big-spendin' Democrats."" Well, guess what, guys? I got handed the biggest deficit in history. Guess what? I have cut the deficit $1.4 trillion just this year, the largest in American history. Never has it happened before. We also cut $350 billion in the deficit last year. And we're going to cut another $250 billion in the next decade. And we did all these things without raising a single penny in tax on anyone who made less than $400,000 a year. Not a single penny. I don't want to hear it from Republicans who blew up the deficit. Remember: These are the same guys that passed a $2 trillion tax cut when Trump was President that overwhelmingly benefited the superwealthy and big corporations and didn't pay for 1 cent of it. Not one single cent of it. And the ones—you know, we're the ones bringing down the debt—they're the ones who raise it—allowing us to help provide ordinary middle class citizens a shot. You know, and we're finally making sure the biggest corporation begin to pay their fair share. I raised—we raised the minimum tax of—on corporate America a staggering 15 percent. Give me a break. Firefighters pay more than that. But 15 percent—again, which Congressman Zeldin voted against. He didn't think we should raise the tax on—and guess what? There were over—the corporates are paying zero in Federal—there were 55 of the Fortune 500 companies in 2020, when I got elected, that paid zero in Federal tax. It's about damn time they paid a little. They made $40 billion, and they paid zero. Look, because we've reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help millions of working and middle class folks caught in the crossfire of the pandemic and an economic crisis left to us by Trump. And here on this college campus—and you are one of the best universities—colleges in America. No, you really are. And it's not just because—it's not just because my Ambassador to Japan keeps pounding it in my head, but it's true. [Laughter] Look, because we've acted, we're providing $10,000 debt relief for students, and if you had a Pell grant, a total of $20,000 relief from student debt. And by the way, 95 percent of that going to people earning less than 75 grand. You know, so you can start a business, pay—make a down payment on a home, just have a little bit of breathing room. That's what it's about. And what are the MAGA Republicans doing about it? They're trying to stop it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Congressman Zeldin called it ""flat-out wrong."" Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, their hypocrisy is unbelievable. The MAGA Republican Members of Congress—this is a fact; as they say, ""Check it out""—we took hundreds—they took hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars in pandemic relief loans. Remember we had, during the pandemic, we said we were going to do these PPP loans. People who—their business was under—was taken down because of COVID and the rest. Well, guess what? They're trying to block—these are the ones trying to block student relief. Audience members. Boo! The President. And one of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene—— Audience members. Boo! The President. She got $183,000 in PP loans. Audience members. Boo! The President. Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida got over $2 million forgiven. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now they forgot—they've forgiven those loans. Who in the hell do they think they are criticizing somebody getting 10 grand and struggling to get through school? Folks, that's some of the big stuff we've done. Now let's take a look at our Republican friends. Do you know what their number-one priority is? Not a joke. The interesting thing about these guys: They're accidentally being honest. [Laughter] Because they're just saying it out loud, what they're for. You know, they want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs if they take back the Congress—gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin—gone. Tax credits for lower energy costs—gone. The 15-percent corporate minimum tax—gone. The $800 savings in health care premiums we just got families on the Affordable Care Act—gone. In fact, these guys still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act altogether. You know what that means? It means that millions and millions of Americans who only have insurance because they have a preexisting condition because it exists—that Affordable Cart Act—is gone. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I ain't going to let it happen. And, folks—and it gets worse. They're coming after Social Security and Medicare. It doesn't affect you students now except you pay into it already if you have a job. You think I'm kidding? Don't listen to me. Listen to what they're telling—what they're telling us they're going to do it. Senator Rick Scott, he's the guy from Florida in charge of electing Republican Senators. Audience members. Boo! The President. They put out a brochure, okay? The brochure says just one thing: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years."" Continuing quote: ""If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Translation: If they don't vote it back into existence, it goes out of existence. No longer any major program. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. As my mother would say, ""God bless his soul."" [Laughter] He thinks 5 years is—this is real; I wouldn't have believed this. They're just saying it out loud, as I said. He thinks 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single, solitary year. Every single, solitary year. Audience members. Boo! The President. And if Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare he wants to do, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk. But if Democrats keep control of Congress, we'll guarantee that veterans are always cared for, folks. Look—and by the way, as long as I'm in the United States Presidency, I'm going to veto it if they get it anyway. Look, there's one more thing I have to mention. I signed what's called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws for our Nation's history that helps millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, like the firefighters in 9/11 were, and they all came down with cancer and other illnesses. Well, only these were veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan exposed to burn pits. A burn pit is a hole in the ground literally the size of a football field, 8 to 10 feet deep. They burn, in that, everything—poisonous chemicals, tires, jet fuel, and so much other waste. And guess what? The law guarantees health care for those exposed those burn pits. And on a personal note—as we used to say when I was a Senator, ""and a point of personal privilege""—my son Beau Biden—my son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one talking to you today, not me. And he gave up his seat as attorney general to go with his regiment, his group from the National Guard. You either have to—you work for the President or you work for the Governor; you can't work for both. So he gave up his job. And he went with his group for a year to Iraq at Camp Liberty. I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 35 times. And I saw him. And I was—went—they call the ""hooch,"" the place they live in, a little tent. And it was only about 250 yards from that burn pit. He went extremely fit and one of the most fit guys in his regiment, in his deal. And he came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, which there's no cure for. And he died. He died. And so many others are in the same situation as he was in. And a lot of people in that situation without the kind of help that—whose families able to have with our family. But this law guarantees care—health care to those exposed to those burn pits. And if they were to pass, it guarantees tuition benefits and assistance to their families and their children to go to school. That's the least we can do, it seems to me. The least we can do. And, folks, there's more. Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, Governor Hochul is the first woman to serve as Governor of New York. And on Tuesday night, with your help, she'll be the first—woman elected Governor of New York. And even before the Dobbs decision came down, your Governor took action to protect patients and doctors to ensure that the right to choose for a woman in New York would be protected. And her opponent, meanwhile, believes that there should be no exceptions, even for rape or incest—none. His position is extreme. For example, he's been down in Washington voting over and over again to defund Planned Parenthood. He's in the—and look, here's the bottom line: If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And if we elect—they give me two more Democrats in the Senate and we keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the law of the land. Folks, Governor Hochul's opponent talks a good game on crime. But it's all talk. It's all talk. I chaired the Judiciary Committee for years. I'm the guy that introduced the money for police officers and reforms. But let's look at the fact. Back on March 2021, as COVID was hitting the economy hard, mayors all over the country—Democrats and Republicans—said they were going to have to lay off thousands of cops because they didn't have any budget money coming in. They didn't have taxes coming in. So I came up with a plan called the American Rescue Plan. It gave States and local governments money they needed to keep cops on the beat, schoolteachers on the job, firefighters on the job. And—but when it came time to vote for this plan in Congress, not a single Republican voted for it. And they talk about the reason why you were able to keep your cops and firefighters and first responders is because of that legislation. That's the reason. And they voted against it. And then they whine about how they're so tough. Republican leaders decided to play politics. Governor Hochul's opponent had a choice: You can keep cops on the job or cave to his Republican leaders. I'll give you one guess what he did. He caved. He voted against keeping cops on the beat and decided to play politics instead. And then in May, Governor Hochul and I were together in Buffalo—I've visited every mass shooting site—in the weeks after that senseless, evil mass shooting. We met with the families, spent 4 hours. And you could feel the anger and disgust. It would have been easy to feel helpless, but Governor Hochul decided to do something about it. Less than a month after the shooting, the Governor signed a package of bills strengthening New York's gun laws. Her opponent's plan for public safety is to put more guns on the street. He opposed ""red flag"" laws, which would take guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger to themselves and others. Look, what kind of sense does that make? On the Federal level, we passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. And Zeldin opposed it. Audience members. Boo! The President. And we're coming back. I'm the guy that got the assault weapons ban the first and—that lasted for 10 years. And when we had that ban, mass shootings dropped precipitously. Well, I'm coming back and getting that assault weapons ban again. It makes no sense. Once again, Kathy's opponent is siding with the NRA. He voted against the assault weapons ban, refused to keep these weapons of war off the streets. And as I point out all the time, what comes out of a muzzle of an assault weapon is five times quicker, faster than comes out of a muzzle of another gun. It can pierce a Kevlar vest. There are not a whole lot of deer out there wearing Kevlar vests. Look, folks, this is crazy. If from a—if a politician won't stand up for his—to his party leaders and keep cops on the beat, if he won't stand up to the NRA and get assault weapons off their street, do you really think he's going to take and help your families keep safe? Audience members. No! The President. Look, I'll tell you: He won't, but Kathy will. Folks, as I spoke—as I spoke about a few days ago, democracy is literally on the ballot. I've making this case since I ran. You know, there are more than 300 Republican candidates for State, local, and Federal office who are election deniers, who say that I did not win the election even though the hundreds of attempts to challenge that have all failed, even in Republican courts. Well, Kathy's opponent is one of those election deniers. These deniers are not only trying to deny your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not joking. I'm not joking. With these election deniers, there are only two outcomes for any election: either they win, or they were cheated. No, I'm serious. Think about it. But let me tell you something: You can't only love the country when you win. And, folks, these are the same guys, many of them, who said what happened on January the 6th, 2 years ago, the people who were engaged in that were ""patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I mean—no, all kidding aside. You're all students of history—most of you are not old enough to have lived it very much, but you're students of it. Can you think of any other time since the Civil War where anybody says things like that—where it's happened, where violence is condoned? Look what happened. My friend Paul—anyway. I shouldn't even get into it, I'll get going. [Laughter] But Nancy Pelosi's husband—look what the Republicans said. Some of them making fun of it or making excuses. There's never been a time in my career when we've glorified violence based on a political basis. Let me close with this. Today, as I said earlier, we face one of those inflection points, one of those moments that not only—it only comes around every three, four, or five generations. We all know it in our bones that our democracy is at risk. The latest polls say 76 percent of American people worry about maintaining our democracy. And we know that this is a—your generation's moment to defend it, to preserve it, to choose it. And I want you to know, we'll meet this moment. Remember: The power of—in America lies where it always does—with you. That's not hyperbole. With you, the votes. And the reason I have been—everybody ask me, keeps asking why I'm so optimistic—and I'm not joking, I've been saying this for a year—because of you. And here's—I'm being deadly earnest. You're the best educated, you're the least prejudiced, you're the most engaged, you're the most involved generation in American history. And you look at all the polling data. If you all show up and vote, democracy is sustained. Not a joke. This is not hyperbole. For the second time, not a joke. It matters. It's in your hands. And look, you're one of the reasons why, as I said, I've never been more optimistic about the future of this country. I look at America reasserting itself to lead the world in the 21st century. I've traveled this country, and I've traveled the world, before and since I've been President. I'll tell you one quick story. I showed up in February after I got elected in January. I got sworn in to the so-called G-7—that's the seven largest democratic economies—in London. And I sat down with the other heads of State, most of whom I had known before, because either my job as Vice President and as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I said, ""America is back."" And one of the leaders looked at me and said, ""For how long?"" No, I'm serious. Think about it now. And then I think it was—I think it was Scholz of Germany, but I can't remember for certain, but one of them said to me—he said: ""Mr. President, what would you think if you went to bed tonight here in England at this meeting and woke up and found out a mob of 1,000 people broke down the doors of the British Parliament, went down the halls, ended up killing two police officers and injuring scores of people to stop the outcome of an election? What would you think?"" I'm being deadly earnest now. I give you my word this was what the discussion was. ""Ask yourself what you think if tomorrow morning you turned on the television and found out that the Bundestag had been in fact moved, they had been raided, they had been—what would you say?"" [An audience member fainted.] The President. Okay—I—I've got it. Let's get a little bit of help here. Someone fainted. I've got it. I've got it. We'll get some help over here. Can we get some help if we have any folks out there that can help out? Raise your hands here where he or she is. Audience member. Right there. Audience members. Here. The President. Okay. Come on. You've been standing a long time. Come on. Do we have—have any medical help here or—here they come. I don't think we can get through that way. Hang on a minute. It will be okay. Coming through both ways here. Audience member. Good job, President. [Applause] The President. No, it's a lot of standing. Audience member. We're good! The President. Okay? Audience member. We've got her. The President. You've got her. Okay, thank you. Look, like I said, I look out at our country, and I see how the rest of the world looks at us. They still look at us as that shining hope. They really do look to the United States. We've got to demonstrate who we are. I see a great nation because we're a great people. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together. So vote! Get out the vote now. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No more drilling. There is no more drilling. I haven't formed any new drilling. Audience member. You released 5 more years of offshore drilling. The President. No, I—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—Atlantic or the Pacific, but in the Antarctic and off the Gulf of New Mexico—off the Gulf of Mexico. The President. That was before I was President. We're trying to work on that, get that done. Thank you. All right.","The President. Hello, New York! What a great crowd. Hello, Sarah Lawrence College! One of the great liberal arts school in America. You guys are really good. It's great to be with my good friend who spoke to you earlier today, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Chuck and I have gotten a lot done together. And one thing I can tell you: This guy never gives up—never gives up. And that's good for all of us. And by the way, Senator Gillibrand, thank you for everything you do for this State. And by the way, nobody has been a greater fighter for women's rights in the United States Congress than she. She has taken on the military. She's taken on—[applause]. No, I mean it. I mean it. She is a gamechanger. And Jamaal Bowman—lifelong educator, champion of the next generation—for welcoming us to his district. I had to get a passport from him to get in—[laughter]—to get into the district. And, folks, look—and how about that Governor of yours? She's something else. She's someone who takes action. She gets things done. New York, you've got—you've got 2 days—2 days to make sure the rest of New York knows the good that they have in Kathy Hochul. Two days until one of the most—and this is the—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a little while. [Laughter] Somebody said my birthday is coming up, and I said, ""No, that must be somebody else."" [At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.] Hey, hey—let him holler. Let him holler. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. That's a—that's more like my generation. [Laughter] All right. I'm with you. Hey—anyway. Look, 2 days until the most important election in our lifetimes. It's going to take shape in this country for decades to come. We're at one of those inflection points—I mean it sincerely, where what's going to happen the next couple of years is going to have more to do with what this country looks like 20 years from now than anything else. Audience members. [Inaudible] The President. You know, let's be clear: This—— Audience members. We want Joe! We want Joe! We want Joe! The President. ——well, let Joe talk, okay? [Inaudible]—look, this election isn't a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two fundamentally different visions of America. I've said from the beginning: My objective when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And I tell you what, it's a fundamental shift. And it's working, compared to the MAGA mega-Republican trickle-down economics. You saw what happened last time under my predecessor. The economy—he left it in ruins. He's the first President in America since Herbert Hoover to lose more jobs than he got—than he had when he came to office. Fewer jobs. An unemployment rate—6.4 percent. He lost manufacturing jobs. Hundreds of small businesses closed in this State alone, let alone around the Nation—thousands. And the country in a pandemic with no way out. By the time I got sworn in, only 3.5 million people had been vaccinated—fully vaccinated. Now there are 220 million we got done. So we moved. Our approach is working. Since I came to office, we've created 10 million brand new jobs. The unemployment rate is at a historic low of 3.7 percent. And we're making things here in America again. We're shipping American products overseas instead of American jobs overseas. We've created 700,000 new manufacturing jobs. And by the way, where the hell is it written to say we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? I'm not joking. Where is that written? I signed into law the bipartisan infrastructure law. By the way, the Governor's opponent, Zeldin, voted against that. Audience members. Boo! The President. But as the Governor said, she's still fixing the roads and bridges in his district, even though he's against it. But he'll probably take credit for it somewhere along the line. The most significant investment in our Nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System. And your Governor is making sure all that money is coming to New York and is—billions—is getting out the door right away. She's repairing roads, bridges, building New York's electric vehicle charging stations, expanding access to high-speed internet, cleaning up the water systems. You know, she's helping New York lead—lead the way of making things in America. As you just heard, I wish your Governor—a few weeks ago—I was with her a few weeks ago in Syracuse, New York. And guess what? Before that, I was in Poughkeepsie with her. And thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, again—— [There was a disruption in the audience.] Well, let me tell you—[laughter]. Audience members. We love Joe! We love Joe! We love Joe! The President. I tell you, I love that. And by the way, Zeldin voted against the CHIPS and Science Act. Chuck introduced and passed that companies are investing across America and manufacturing semiconductors at home. You know, one of the reasons why inflation went up so much the first quarter last year was the cost of automobiles. Why? They could not get computer chips. Ain't nothing built these days without computer chips, including our defense establishment—microchips that are now part of everything. We invented the computer chip here in the United States of America, and then somehow we forgot about it. You know, the fact is that it will create 50,000 new jobs right here in New York. And that's on top of the 700,000 we've already created Look, Governor Hochul pushed a similar law. Had we just done the CHIPS Act, we would not have—I—we—may very well have been—you know, Syracuse may have gone—the Syracuse investment may very well—Micron's investment of $100 billion may have gone to Texas. But she moved here in the State to provide help as well. Micron is going to build semiconductor factories in Syracuse. IBM making a $20 billion commitment in Poughkeepsie, where I just was. And you know, this couldn't have happened without your Governor. I mean that sincerely. This is a really big deal for this State and this country. And, folks, but for all our progress, we know a lot of families are still struggling. That's why, with Chuck's leadership and the help of your Members of Congress, I signed the Inflation Reduction Act. It's going reduce the costs of everything that New Yorkers pay for every month. You know, Congressman Zeldin voted against that as well. It gives—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——by the way, that act gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs—the same power that the VA—the Veterans Administration—has and has used it to cut drug prices in half. But they said: ""No, no, Big Pharma had too much power. You could never get Medicare to be in that position."" Well, we tried to get it done for years. Big Pharma—— [There was a disruption in the audience.] Big Pharma almost always stopped this, but not this year. This year, Big Pharma lost and the American people won! We put a cap of $2,000 a year on prescription drugs for seniors no matter what their cost—2, 10, 12, 15. [The President stumbled on a floor wire.] Oops, stepping on a—there's a—it's black. Anyway. [Laughter] No matter what the cost. And some cancer drugs cost as much as that. They're never going to have to pay more than $2,000. And we put a $35-a-month cap on insulin to deal with their diabetes. How many of you people know somebody who needs insulin for their diabetes? [Applause] Well, they're paying an average of 400 bucks a month now. It costs 10 bucks to make it, 15 bucks to—a total of 15 to package it, and they're charging $4- to $800. That's over now. Because—and we're coming back to make sure that it not only applies to those who folks who, in fact, are on Medicare. We originally had it for everybody, but Republicans jumped in and blocked—block—got two Democrats to block it for everyone. But guess what? We're going to make sure everyone has that lifesaving insulin regardless of their age, if—when we come back, And we're making the biggest investment ever to deal with climate—ever, ever, ever—$468 billion to start with. That's going to lower energy costs for families. Again, Congressman Zeldin voted against it. Voted against it. Audience members. Boo! The President. We're doing all this while reducing—by the way, you know Republicans say those ""big-spendin' Democrats."" Well, guess what, guys? I got handed the biggest deficit in history. Guess what? I have cut the deficit $1.4 trillion just this year, the largest in American history. Never has it happened before. We also cut $350 billion in the deficit last year. And we're going to cut another $250 billion in the next decade. And we did all these things without raising a single penny in tax on anyone who made less than $400,000 a year. Not a single penny. I don't want to hear it from Republicans who blew up the deficit. Remember: These are the same guys that passed a $2 trillion tax cut when Trump was President that overwhelmingly benefited the superwealthy and big corporations and didn't pay for 1 cent of it. Not one single cent of it. And the ones—you know, we're the ones bringing down the debt—they're the ones who raise it—allowing us to help provide ordinary middle class citizens a shot. You know, and we're finally making sure the biggest corporation begin to pay their fair share. I raised—we raised the minimum tax of—on corporate America a staggering 15 percent. Give me a break. Firefighters pay more than that. But 15 percent—again, which Congressman Zeldin voted against. He didn't think we should raise the tax on—and guess what? There were over—the corporates are paying zero in Federal—there were 55 of the Fortune 500 companies in 2020, when I got elected, that paid zero in Federal tax. It's about damn time they paid a little. They made $40 billion, and they paid zero. Look, because we've reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help millions of working and middle class folks caught in the crossfire of the pandemic and an economic crisis left to us by Trump. And here on this college campus—and you are one of the best universities—colleges in America. No, you really are. And it's not just because—it's not just because my Ambassador to Japan keeps pounding it in my head, but it's true. [Laughter] Look, because we've acted, we're providing $10,000 debt relief for students, and if you had a Pell grant, a total of $20,000 relief from student debt. And by the way, 95 percent of that going to people earning less than 75 grand. You know, so you can start a business, pay—make a down payment on a home, just have a little bit of breathing room. That's what it's about. And what are the MAGA Republicans doing about it? They're trying to stop it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Congressman Zeldin called it ""flat-out wrong."" Audience members. Boo! The President. Folks, their hypocrisy is unbelievable. The MAGA Republican Members of Congress—this is a fact; as they say, ""Check it out""—we took hundreds—they took hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars in pandemic relief loans. Remember we had, during the pandemic, we said we were going to do these PPP loans. People who—their business was under—was taken down because of COVID and the rest. Well, guess what? They're trying to block—these are the ones trying to block student relief. Audience members. Boo! The President. And one of them, Marjorie Taylor Greene—— Audience members. Boo! The President. She got $183,000 in PP loans. Audience members. Boo! The President. Republican Congressman Vern Buchanan of Florida got over $2 million forgiven. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now they forgot—they've forgiven those loans. Who in the hell do they think they are criticizing somebody getting 10 grand and struggling to get through school? Folks, that's some of the big stuff we've done. Now let's take a look at our Republican friends. Do you know what their number-one priority is? Not a joke. The interesting thing about these guys: They're accidentally being honest. [Laughter] Because they're just saying it out loud, what they're for. You know, they want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs if they take back the Congress—gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin—gone. Tax credits for lower energy costs—gone. The 15-percent corporate minimum tax—gone. The $800 savings in health care premiums we just got families on the Affordable Care Act—gone. In fact, these guys still want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act altogether. You know what that means? It means that millions and millions of Americans who only have insurance because they have a preexisting condition because it exists—that Affordable Cart Act—is gone. No matter how hard they try to get rid of Obamacare, I ain't going to let it happen. And, folks—and it gets worse. They're coming after Social Security and Medicare. It doesn't affect you students now except you pay into it already if you have a job. You think I'm kidding? Don't listen to me. Listen to what they're telling—what they're telling us they're going to do it. Senator Rick Scott, he's the guy from Florida in charge of electing Republican Senators. Audience members. Boo! The President. They put out a brochure, okay? The brochure says just one thing: ""All Federal legislation sunsets every 5 years."" Continuing quote: ""If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" Translation: If they don't vote it back into existence, it goes out of existence. No longer any major program. And then along came Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. As my mother would say, ""God bless his soul."" [Laughter] He thinks 5 years is—this is real; I wouldn't have believed this. They're just saying it out loud, as I said. He thinks 5 years is too long. He thinks Social Security and Medicare should be on the chopping block every single, solitary year. Every single, solitary year. Audience members. Boo! The President. And if Congress doesn't vote to keep it, it goes away. It's not just Social Security and Medicare he wants to do, he wants to put veterans benefits and everything else in the Federal budget at risk. But if Democrats keep control of Congress, we'll guarantee that veterans are always cared for, folks. Look—and by the way, as long as I'm in the United States Presidency, I'm going to veto it if they get it anyway. Look, there's one more thing I have to mention. I signed what's called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws for our Nation's history that helps millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, like the firefighters in 9/11 were, and they all came down with cancer and other illnesses. Well, only these were veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan exposed to burn pits. A burn pit is a hole in the ground literally the size of a football field, 8 to 10 feet deep. They burn, in that, everything—poisonous chemicals, tires, jet fuel, and so much other waste. And guess what? The law guarantees health care for those exposed those burn pits. And on a personal note—as we used to say when I was a Senator, ""and a point of personal privilege""—my son Beau Biden—my son Beau Biden was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. He should be the one talking to you today, not me. And he gave up his seat as attorney general to go with his regiment, his group from the National Guard. You either have to—you work for the President or you work for the Governor; you can't work for both. So he gave up his job. And he went with his group for a year to Iraq at Camp Liberty. I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 35 times. And I saw him. And I was—went—they call the ""hooch,"" the place they live in, a little tent. And it was only about 250 yards from that burn pit. He went extremely fit and one of the most fit guys in his regiment, in his deal. And he came home with stage-4 glioblastoma, which there's no cure for. And he died. He died. And so many others are in the same situation as he was in. And a lot of people in that situation without the kind of help that—whose families able to have with our family. But this law guarantees care—health care to those exposed to those burn pits. And if they were to pass, it guarantees tuition benefits and assistance to their families and their children to go to school. That's the least we can do, it seems to me. The least we can do. And, folks, there's more. Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——already introduced legislation for a national ban on the right to choose. Audience members. Boo! The President. Now, Governor Hochul is the first woman to serve as Governor of New York. And on Tuesday night, with your help, she'll be the first—woman elected Governor of New York. And even before the Dobbs decision came down, your Governor took action to protect patients and doctors to ensure that the right to choose for a woman in New York would be protected. And her opponent, meanwhile, believes that there should be no exceptions, even for rape or incest—none. His position is extreme. For example, he's been down in Washington voting over and over again to defund Planned Parenthood. He's in the—and look, here's the bottom line: If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And if we elect—they give me two more Democrats in the Senate and we keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the law of the land. Folks, Governor Hochul's opponent talks a good game on crime. But it's all talk. It's all talk. I chaired the Judiciary Committee for years. I'm the guy that introduced the money for police officers and reforms. But let's look at the fact. Back on March 2021, as COVID was hitting the economy hard, mayors all over the country—Democrats and Republicans—said they were going to have to lay off thousands of cops because they didn't have any budget money coming in. They didn't have taxes coming in. So I came up with a plan called the American Rescue Plan. It gave States and local governments money they needed to keep cops on the beat, schoolteachers on the job, firefighters on the job. And—but when it came time to vote for this plan in Congress, not a single Republican voted for it. And they talk about the reason why you were able to keep your cops and firefighters and first responders is because of that legislation. That's the reason. And they voted against it. And then they whine about how they're so tough. Republican leaders decided to play politics. Governor Hochul's opponent had a choice: You can keep cops on the job or cave to his Republican leaders. I'll give you one guess what he did. He caved. He voted against keeping cops on the beat and decided to play politics instead. And then in May, Governor Hochul and I were together in Buffalo—I've visited every mass shooting site—in the weeks after that senseless, evil mass shooting. We met with the families, spent 4 hours. And you could feel the anger and disgust. It would have been easy to feel helpless, but Governor Hochul decided to do something about it. Less than a month after the shooting, the Governor signed a package of bills strengthening New York's gun laws. Her opponent's plan for public safety is to put more guns on the street. He opposed ""red flag"" laws, which would take guns out of the hands of people who pose a danger to themselves and others. Look, what kind of sense does that make? On the Federal level, we passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years. And Zeldin opposed it. Audience members. Boo! The President. And we're coming back. I'm the guy that got the assault weapons ban the first and—that lasted for 10 years. And when we had that ban, mass shootings dropped precipitously. Well, I'm coming back and getting that assault weapons ban again. It makes no sense. Once again, Kathy's opponent is siding with the NRA. He voted against the assault weapons ban, refused to keep these weapons of war off the streets. And as I point out all the time, what comes out of a muzzle of an assault weapon is five times quicker, faster than comes out of a muzzle of another gun. It can pierce a Kevlar vest. There are not a whole lot of deer out there wearing Kevlar vests. Look, folks, this is crazy. If from a—if a politician won't stand up for his—to his party leaders and keep cops on the beat, if he won't stand up to the NRA and get assault weapons off their street, do you really think he's going to take and help your families keep safe? Audience members. No! The President. Look, I'll tell you: He won't, but Kathy will. Folks, as I spoke—as I spoke about a few days ago, democracy is literally on the ballot. I've making this case since I ran. You know, there are more than 300 Republican candidates for State, local, and Federal office who are election deniers, who say that I did not win the election even though the hundreds of attempts to challenge that have all failed, even in Republican courts. Well, Kathy's opponent is one of those election deniers. These deniers are not only trying to deny your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not joking. I'm not joking. With these election deniers, there are only two outcomes for any election: either they win, or they were cheated. No, I'm serious. Think about it. But let me tell you something: You can't only love the country when you win. And, folks, these are the same guys, many of them, who said what happened on January the 6th, 2 years ago, the people who were engaged in that were ""patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I mean—no, all kidding aside. You're all students of history—most of you are not old enough to have lived it very much, but you're students of it. Can you think of any other time since the Civil War where anybody says things like that—where it's happened, where violence is condoned? Look what happened. My friend Paul—anyway. I shouldn't even get into it, I'll get going. [Laughter] But Nancy Pelosi's husband—look what the Republicans said. Some of them making fun of it or making excuses. There's never been a time in my career when we've glorified violence based on a political basis. Let me close with this. Today, as I said earlier, we face one of those inflection points, one of those moments that not only—it only comes around every three, four, or five generations. We all know it in our bones that our democracy is at risk. The latest polls say 76 percent of American people worry about maintaining our democracy. And we know that this is a—your generation's moment to defend it, to preserve it, to choose it. And I want you to know, we'll meet this moment. Remember: The power of—in America lies where it always does—with you. That's not hyperbole. With you, the votes. And the reason I have been—everybody ask me, keeps asking why I'm so optimistic—and I'm not joking, I've been saying this for a year—because of you. And here's—I'm being deadly earnest. You're the best educated, you're the least prejudiced, you're the most engaged, you're the most involved generation in American history. And you look at all the polling data. If you all show up and vote, democracy is sustained. Not a joke. This is not hyperbole. For the second time, not a joke. It matters. It's in your hands. And look, you're one of the reasons why, as I said, I've never been more optimistic about the future of this country. I look at America reasserting itself to lead the world in the 21st century. I've traveled this country, and I've traveled the world, before and since I've been President. I'll tell you one quick story. I showed up in February after I got elected in January. I got sworn in to the so-called G-7—that's the seven largest democratic economies—in London. And I sat down with the other heads of State, most of whom I had known before, because either my job as Vice President and as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I said, ""America is back."" And one of the leaders looked at me and said, ""For how long?"" No, I'm serious. Think about it now. And then I think it was—I think it was Scholz of Germany, but I can't remember for certain, but one of them said to me—he said: ""Mr. President, what would you think if you went to bed tonight here in England at this meeting and woke up and found out a mob of 1,000 people broke down the doors of the British Parliament, went down the halls, ended up killing two police officers and injuring scores of people to stop the outcome of an election? What would you think?"" I'm being deadly earnest now. I give you my word this was what the discussion was. ""Ask yourself what you think if tomorrow morning you turned on the television and found out that the Bundestag had been in fact moved, they had been raided, they had been—what would you say?"" [An audience member fainted.] The President. Okay—I—I've got it. Let's get a little bit of help here. Someone fainted. I've got it. I've got it. We'll get some help over here. Can we get some help if we have any folks out there that can help out? Raise your hands here where he or she is. Audience member. Right there. Audience members. Here. The President. Okay. Come on. You've been standing a long time. Come on. Do we have—have any medical help here or—here they come. I don't think we can get through that way. Hang on a minute. It will be okay. Coming through both ways here. Audience member. Good job, President. [Applause] The President. No, it's a lot of standing. Audience member. We're good! The President. Okay? Audience member. We've got her. The President. You've got her. Okay, thank you. Look, like I said, I look out at our country, and I see how the rest of the world looks at us. They still look at us as that shining hope. They really do look to the United States. We've got to demonstrate who we are. I see a great nation because we're a great people. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we work together. So vote! Get out the vote now. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No more drilling. There is no more drilling. I haven't formed any new drilling. Audience member. You released 5 more years of offshore drilling. The President. No, I—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—Atlantic or the Pacific, but in the Antarctic and off the Gulf of New Mexico—off the Gulf of Mexico. The President. That was before I was President. We're trying to work on that, get that done. Thank you.

You have really done one incredible job. And thank you for leading in our finance effort. And the fact you had Virginia McGregor from Scranton with you, that helped a little bit too. Anyway. [Laughter] Look, I just went through the numbers. Let me say—[inaudible]—as well—I know you just said it—because I know how hard it is to raise a total of $292 million this cycle. I want you to know how grateful I am, how much it matters to everyone, how much it matters to our chances. And I want you to know that, you know, you helped get me and Kamala elected in 2020, and you raised a lot of money for us as well, but you helped generate support for our agenda during the last almost 2 years. You kept us going. You helped—you helped generate so much. We got some really big things done. And some of the most consequential things ever accomplished by the narrowest of margins, the 50/50 Senate. I told Kamala, every time she votes, she wins. And she does. And so we have a shot at keeping the Senate and increasing it. And I'm optimistic about the House as well. You know, you guys represent everything that's good about our party, the reason why we got into politics in the first place. We got involved in politics first place to help people. We helped them get through the pandemic, helped them deal with the crises they all face, helped them with their health care, helped them across the board to take on powerful special interests, particularly Pharma. You know, and we—[laughter]—I've been doing this for a long time. We finally beat Pharma because of your help. You know, we take on powerful special interests working to give the middle class just a shot, just an even chance. As my dad used to say, ""I don't expect the government to solve my problem, but I just expect them to understand my problem."" So what—here's what we did. We went out there, we took on those interests, we gave the middle class a fighting chance, we've got a lot more to do—protect the climate and American jobs and ingenuity. We passed the biggest climate bill ever, ever in American history, almost $400 billion. It matters. It matters. It's just beginning to take hold. We did everything from the—anyway—we—I won't go into a whole everything we got done. But we also—most importantly, I think—fought to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms that bring people into the political process and make sure this democracy delivers. That's what being a Democrat is all about. It's not about power for power's sake, it's about gaining power to work for people who need a little bit of help, just a shot. My dad used to say: ""Just a shot. Just a shot. Just a little bit of breathing room."" And that's what Democrats are all about. Again, not power for powers sake, but power for the good of the country. And you know, I know it's not easy—move this up. I know it's not easy.

My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Jill Biden's husband."", ""It is great to be at Bowie State, one of our Nation's great HBCU's. I was at my home HBCU, Delaware State, talking to students about our plan to relieve student debt. And by the way, you've got to forgive me, but I got my start at Delaware State. [Laughter] I don't want to hear it now. I like you all, but you know—all kidding aside, you know, my family is—my dad's looking down and smiling, because he's from Baltimore. [Laughter] And I kid your Congressman that your Eastern Shore is Delaware's western shore. [Laughter]"", ""Look, talking about my historic commitment to HBCUs, that includes the $5.8 billion I put in the budget for HBCUs. You know why? HBCUs don't have the endowments others have, but guess what? You're just as smart. You're just as bright. You're just as good as any college in America. And that money—that money is to build laboratories and other things for the future that you need to have access to. But look, folks, you know, let me tell you: One of the great ways to honor HBCUs is to vote—[laughter]—is to vote. "", ""Here in Maryland, you've got some great people to vote for. Chris Van Hollen is up for reelection this year, and he's a great Senator, a hell of a guy, and makes a great team with Ben Cardin. And they both are strong, principled, and effective. And they've got a great congressional delegation, Steny Hoyer and so many others. Look, keep them. You need them. I need them."", ""And of course, you've got that next Governor. What's his name? Wes—Wes—Wes Moore! That guy is the real deal, man. As you just heard from Jill, he's a combat veteran and a Rhodes Scholar. I've always worried about Rhodes Scholars, though, you know? [Laughter] They're so damn smart, I wonder about it, you know? [Laughter]"", ""But all kidding aside, Rhodes Scholar, antipoverty leader. Wes is a leader who will build a Maryland that leaves no one behind, and I believe that. He will be a great and historic Governor of Maryland. They'll remember him."", ""Folks, you've got one day until one of the most important elections. You heard this time and again. I almost feel guilty repeating it. Our lifetimes are going to be shaped by what happens the next year to 3 years. It's going to shape what the next couple of decades look like, for real."", ""And back in August, I came to Rockville to kick off the campaign season with Wes. And we're here at Bowie to close it out with Wes and all of you. And let's be clear: This election is not a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two very different visions of America."", ""I said from the beginning, my objective—my objective—when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not—it's a fundamental shift, and it's working, from the MAGA Republican proposals, the trickle-down economics."", 'You know, you saw what happened last time under my predecessor.', 'Audience members.

That's—hey, look—look, I—look, he was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the course of his Presidency. Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. We lost manufacturing jobs. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of small businesses closed. And the country in a pandemic with no plan out. Only 3.5 million people were vaccinated the day I got elected. Now we have fully vaccinated 220 million people. So we moved, and our approach is working."", ""Since I came to office, we've created 10 million new jobs; 3.75-percent unemployment. And, folks, Black unemployment has dropped from 9.2 to 5.9 and going down."", ""And we're making things here in America again. We're shipping American-made products overseas, instead of shipping American jobs overseas. We created 700,000 manufacturing jobs, and we'll create thousands more with the CHIPS and Science Act. Companies are investing billions of dollars, creating thousands of good-paying jobs."", ""Look, but for all the progress, we know a lot of families are still struggling. That's why, with the help of your Members of Congress, I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. Here's what it's going to do. It's going to reduce the cost of everything that folks in Maryland have to pay for every month, from—giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prescription pricing. The VA has that power, and it's cut drug prices in half. We're going to do the same with Medicare."", ""Big Pharma always, always, always stopped it. But not this year. This year, Big Pharma lost, and the American people won. Those of you who have moms and dads or grandparents, they're paying a lot of money for their prescriptions, even if they're on Medicare. Well, we set a $2,000-a-year cap. It can never charge more than that total for the year, even if their drugs cost $8-, $10-, $12-, $15,000, like a lot of cancer drugs do."", ""And by the way, how many of you know somebody who has diabetes and needs insulin? Well, guess what? They're paying $400 to $600 a month, but we're limiting the price to $35. Thirty-five dollars. Period."", ""Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!

Look, we're going to save—as experts say, we'll save an average of $500 in energy costs for people."", 'And we\'re going to do this all while reducing the Federal—you know these Republicans talk about ""big-spendin\' Democrats""? Guess what? I cut the Federal budget by 1 trillion, 400 billion dollars in 1 year—1 year. It never happened before. And last year, we cut it by $350 billion.', ""Look, we did it all without raising taxes on a single person making less than 400 grand. And I don't want you to hear from Republicans who blew up the deficit. Remember, these are the guys who passed the $2 trillion tax cut benefiting the wealthy and big corporations and didn't pay for a penny of it. And look, we're the ones bringing down the deficit, allowing us to afford to provide ordinary hard-working Americans a little break."", ""And we're finally making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. I just signed a law saying that they've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent. A lot of nurses, doctors, they pay a lot less—more than 15 percent."", ""But here, those days are over, where corporations are paying zero in taxes. You know, in 2020, 55 Fortune 500 companies paid 40—made $40 billion—$40 billion—and they didn't pay a single penny. Not a single penny."", ""Well, look, because we reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help families—working families, middle class families caught in the global crossfire of a pandemic and Putin's aggressive war in Ukraine."", ""We're here at one of the great HBCUs in America. And because I acted, I'm able to reduce your debt by $20,000—[applause]—10 for debt relief and another 10 if you had a Pell grant. And 90 percent of all the folks who get this relief earn less than 75 grand a year. And, folks—so you can have—make a downpayment on a home, you'll be able to start a business, just give you some breathing room."", ""And what are the MAGA Republicans and Wes's opponent talking about student debt? They're trying to stop it. The hypocrisy is unbelievable. MAGA Republicans who took hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief loans, had their loans forgiven, are trying to block this relief."", 'Marjorie Taylor Greene, that great American——', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. ——she and her husband received $183,000 in debt relief, cash to pay for their business. And then there's another.

Come on, man."", 'Another Republican—another Republican, Vern Buchanan of Florida, said this—my plan was reckless, yet he was forgiven $2 million in a loan.', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Two million. Federal money. Who the hell do they think they are?', ""And, folks, that's some of the big stuff we've done. Now let's look at the Republicans. Do you know what their number-one priority is if they take control of the House? They're saying it out loud."", 'They want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs—gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin—gone. Tax credits for lower energy costs—gone.', 'Audience members. Gone!', 'The President. Fifteen-percent corporate tax—minimum tax—gone.', 'Audience members. Gone!', 'The President.

Listen to what they had to say."", ""This guy—I'm reading from a plan by the Senator from Florida, Rick Scott, who is in charge of electing Republican Senators."", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. This is their plan, okay? It says: ""All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again.""', 'And along came a guy named Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. He says 4 years—5 years is too long to wait. Every single year should be on the chopping block. What do you think is going to happen?', ""You've been paying for Social Security since you've been 16 years old in your paycheck. Folks, if Congress doesn't keep—vote to keep it, it goes away. And it's not just Social Security and Medicare. They want to put veterans benefits, everything on the line."", ""But look—look—but if Democrats keep control of Congress, we're going to make sure veterans are always cared for. And you damn well know Army Captain Wes Moore will always have the back of our veterans."", ""Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe!"", ""The President. One more thing about veterans. I signed a thing called the PACT Act, the most significant law in our Nation's history. It helps millions of veterans exposed to toxic substances, like the firefighters were on 9/11, only these were those veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan exposed to burn pits the size of football fields, 8 to 10 feet deep, full of wastewater, tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more."", 'I was in and out of Iraq 30-some times and Afghanistan. And my son was there. My son was a captain—a major in the United States Army, won the Bronze Star.', '[The President addressed an audience member.]', ""I see you're waving. Hi."", 'Won the Bronze Star and a Conspicuous Service Medal. But his hooch was less than a couple hundred yards from those burn pits. He went in great shape and came home with stage 4 glioblastoma and died.', ""The law guarantees health care to expose—those exposed to the burn pits and tuition benefits for their families in their assistance. That's the least we can do. But these guys don't like it."", ""But, folks, there's more. Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Lindsey Graham, already introduced legislation to ban—to ban—the right to choose. States are already passing bans without exception for rape or incest or even the life of the mother. Wes's opponent has introduced 14 bills to limit the right to choose. Fourteen times."", 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. If you elect Wes your Governor, he's going to make sure the right to choose is protected for every woman in Maryland. If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And, folks, if we elect Chris Van Hollen and elect two more Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the rule of the land."", ""And I love how these Republicans talk about fighting crime. On a Federal level, we passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and we're coming back to do what I was able to do in the nineties. That is ban assault weapons."", ""Wes Moore is a combat veteran. He knows it's responsible—what responsible gun ownership is. He'll ban ghost guns, invest in community-based violence prevention programs. Maryland's largest police union and Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed Wes Moore because he actually has a plan to keep Maryland families safe."", ""Wes's opponent won't stand up to his own party. He won't stand up to the NRA. And he is the guy—this is the guy raffling off an AR-15 at a campaign event? Give me a break, for God's sake. He's concerned about public safety?"", ""Look, folks, as I spoke about it last week: Democracy is on the ballot. Political violence and intimidation are on the rise all across America. And you remember January 6, the angry mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, attacked law enforcement, hunted down elected officials, erected gallows to hang Vice President Pence. Well, Wes supported—Wes's opponent supported that mob. He organized buses and paid for them to go to the Capitol because he thought the election was stolen. He tweeted that Mike Pence was a traitor. Think about that."", ""For Wes Moore, patriotism meant leaving his family and putting on a country's uniform and leading his fellow soldiers in combat. His opponent: Patriotism means putting on a baseball cap, inviting people to attack the Capitol. You can't be pro-American and pro-insurrection. It's real simple."", ""And, folks, there are more than 300 election deniers running on the Republican ticket this year, and Wes's opponent is one of them. These elections deniers are not only trying to deny you your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted. With this election, these deniers—there's only two outcomes, in their view, of an election. One, either they win or they were cheated. One of the two. That's their view. But let me tell you something: You can't only love your country when you win."", ""Wes knows what patriotism means. His opponent—Wes described his opponent as far outside the mainstream and—be dangerous in the Governor's office. Well, even the current Republican Governor agrees with Wes. Look up what Larry Hogan has said about Wes's opponent."", 'Folks, this is serious stuff. Let me close with this. Today, we face an inflection point, one of those moments that comes around every three or four generations. We know in our bones that our democracy is at risk, and we know that this is your moment to defend it, preserve or protect it, choose it.', ""And I want you to know we'll meet this moment. Remember, the power in America lies where it always does: in your hands, the hands of the people, and especially with young people in this Nation, like all of you here. I mean it. I'm optimistic because I believe your generation represents the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in American history."", 'And in 2021—2020, many of you voted for the first time.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.']",Joseph R. Biden,2024,0.0,"The President. Hello, Maryland! My name—[applause]. My name is Joe Biden, and I'm Jill Biden's husband. It is great to be at Bowie State, one of our Nation's great HBCU's. I was at my home HBCU, Delaware State, talking to students about our plan to relieve student debt. And by the way, you've got to forgive me, but I got my start at Delaware State. [Laughter] I don't want to hear it now. I like you all, but you know—all kidding aside, you know, my family is—my dad's looking down and smiling, because he's from Baltimore. [Laughter] And I kid your Congressman that your Eastern Shore is Delaware's western shore. [Laughter] Look, talking about my historic commitment to HBCUs, that includes the $5.8 billion I put in the budget for HBCUs. You know why? HBCUs don't have the endowments others have, but guess what? You're just as smart. You're just as bright. You're just as good as any college in America. And that money—that money is to build laboratories and other things for the future that you need to have access to. But look, folks, you know, let me tell you: One of the great ways to honor HBCUs is to vote—[laughter]—is to vote.  Here in Maryland, you've got some great people to vote for. Chris Van Hollen is up for reelection this year, and he's a great Senator, a hell of a guy, and makes a great team with Ben Cardin. And they both are strong, principled, and effective. And they've got a great congressional delegation, Steny Hoyer and so many others. Look, keep them. You need them. I need them. And of course, you've got that next Governor. What's his name? Wes—Wes—Wes Moore! That guy is the real deal, man. As you just heard from Jill, he's a combat veteran and a Rhodes Scholar. I've always worried about Rhodes Scholars, though, you know? [Laughter] They're so damn smart, I wonder about it, you know? [Laughter] But all kidding aside, Rhodes Scholar, antipoverty leader. Wes is a leader who will build a Maryland that leaves no one behind, and I believe that. He will be a great and historic Governor of Maryland. They'll remember him. Folks, you've got one day until one of the most important elections. You heard this time and again. I almost feel guilty repeating it. Our lifetimes are going to be shaped by what happens the next year to 3 years. It's going to shape what the next couple of decades look like, for real. And back in August, I came to Rockville to kick off the campaign season with Wes. And we're here at Bowie to close it out with Wes and all of you. And let's be clear: This election is not a referendum, it's a choice. It's a choice between two very different visions of America. I said from the beginning, my objective—my objective—when I ran was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not—it's a fundamental shift, and it's working, from the MAGA Republican proposals, the trickle-down economics. You know, you saw what happened last time under my predecessor. Audience members. Boo! The President. He was the first President since Hoover—since Herbert Hoover—— [At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.] [Laughter] I tell you what, let him sing. Let the man sing. Look—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. That's—hey, look—look, I—look, he was the first President since Herbert Hoover to lose jobs over the course of his Presidency. Unemployment was at 6.4 percent. We lost manufacturing jobs. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of small businesses closed. And the country in a pandemic with no plan out. Only 3.5 million people were vaccinated the day I got elected. Now we have fully vaccinated 220 million people. So we moved, and our approach is working. Since I came to office, we've created 10 million new jobs; 3.75-percent unemployment. And, folks, Black unemployment has dropped from 9.2 to 5.9 and going down. And we're making things here in America again. We're shipping American-made products overseas, instead of shipping American jobs overseas. We created 700,000 manufacturing jobs, and we'll create thousands more with the CHIPS and Science Act. Companies are investing billions of dollars, creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Look, but for all the progress, we know a lot of families are still struggling. That's why, with the help of your Members of Congress, I signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. Here's what it's going to do. It's going to reduce the cost of everything that folks in Maryland have to pay for every month, from—giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prescription pricing. The VA has that power, and it's cut drug prices in half. We're going to do the same with Medicare. Big Pharma always, always, always stopped it. But not this year. This year, Big Pharma lost, and the American people won. Those of you who have moms and dads or grandparents, they're paying a lot of money for their prescriptions, even if they're on Medicare. Well, we set a $2,000-a-year cap. It can never charge more than that total for the year, even if their drugs cost $8-, $10-, $12-, $15,000, like a lot of cancer drugs do. And by the way, how many of you know somebody who has diabetes and needs insulin? Well, guess what? They're paying $400 to $600 a month, but we're limiting the price to $35. Thirty-five dollars. Period. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. And we passed it. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Hey—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! [The President addressed a protester in the balcony.] The President. Hey—hey, man, don't jump. You look crazy enough to jump. Don't jump. Don't jump. Look—and we're coming—and we're coming to make sure that $35 a month is for everybody. By the way, it starts in January. Look, folks, we've got to make things affordable for people. We've got to make sure we're making big investments—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. ——ever to deal with the climate crisis. You know, the MAGA Republicans and that guy up on the balcony there, threatening to jump, they don't—— [The disruption in the audience continued.] They don't understand we have a climate crisis. Look, we're going to save—as experts say, we'll save an average of $500 in energy costs for people. And we're going to do this all while reducing the Federal—you know these Republicans talk about ""big-spendin' Democrats""? Guess what? I cut the Federal budget by 1 trillion, 400 billion dollars in 1 year—1 year. It never happened before. And last year, we cut it by $350 billion. Look, we did it all without raising taxes on a single person making less than 400 grand. And I don't want you to hear from Republicans who blew up the deficit. Remember, these are the guys who passed the $2 trillion tax cut benefiting the wealthy and big corporations and didn't pay for a penny of it. And look, we're the ones bringing down the deficit, allowing us to afford to provide ordinary hard-working Americans a little break. And we're finally making sure the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share. I just signed a law saying that they've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent. A lot of nurses, doctors, they pay a lot less—more than 15 percent. But here, those days are over, where corporations are paying zero in taxes. You know, in 2020, 55 Fortune 500 companies paid 40—made $40 billion—$40 billion—and they didn't pay a single penny. Not a single penny. Well, look, because we reduced the deficit so much, we're in a position to help families—working families, middle class families caught in the global crossfire of a pandemic and Putin's aggressive war in Ukraine. We're here at one of the great HBCUs in America. And because I acted, I'm able to reduce your debt by $20,000—[applause]—10 for debt relief and another 10 if you had a Pell grant. And 90 percent of all the folks who get this relief earn less than 75 grand a year. And, folks—so you can have—make a downpayment on a home, you'll be able to start a business, just give you some breathing room. And what are the MAGA Republicans and Wes's opponent talking about student debt? They're trying to stop it. The hypocrisy is unbelievable. MAGA Republicans who took hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars, in pandemic relief loans, had their loans forgiven, are trying to block this relief. Marjorie Taylor Greene, that great American—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——she and her husband received $183,000 in debt relief, cash to pay for their business. And then there's another. She said it's completely unfair to forgive student loans for working and middle class families. Come on, man. Another Republican—another Republican, Vern Buchanan of Florida, said this—my plan was reckless, yet he was forgiven $2 million in a loan. Audience members. Boo! The President. Two million. Federal money. Who the hell do they think they are? And, folks, that's some of the big stuff we've done. Now let's look at the Republicans. Do you know what their number-one priority is if they take control of the House? They're saying it out loud. They want to get rid of everything we just did. The power we just gave Medicare to negotiate lower prices—gone. The $2,000 cap on prescription drugs—gone. The $35-a-month cap on insulin—gone. Tax credits for lower energy costs—gone. Audience members. Gone! The President. Fifteen-percent corporate tax—minimum tax—gone. Audience members. Gone! The President. The $800 savings for health premiums we got for the Affordable Care Act—gone. Audience members. Gone! The President. Look, folks, it get worse—gets worse from there. And here's what else they're doing: They're coming after your parents and, ultimately, your Social Security and Medicare. Who do you think I—you probably think I'm kidding. But don't listen to me, listen to them. Listen to what they had to say. This guy—I'm reading from a plan by the Senator from Florida, Rick Scott, who is in charge of electing Republican Senators. Audience members. Boo! The President. This is their plan, okay? It says: ""All Federal legislation sunsets in 5 years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" And along came a guy named Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. He says 4 years—5 years is too long to wait. Every single year should be on the chopping block. What do you think is going to happen? You've been paying for Social Security since you've been 16 years old in your paycheck. Folks, if Congress doesn't keep—vote to keep it, it goes away. And it's not just Social Security and Medicare. They want to put veterans benefits, everything on the line. But look—look—but if Democrats keep control of Congress, we're going to make sure veterans are always cared for. And you damn well know Army Captain Wes Moore will always have the back of our veterans. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. One more thing about veterans. I signed a thing called the PACT Act, the most significant law in our Nation's history. It helps millions of veterans exposed to toxic substances, like the firefighters were on 9/11, only these were those veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan exposed to burn pits the size of football fields, 8 to 10 feet deep, full of wastewater, tires, poisonous chemicals, jet fuel, and so much more. I was in and out of Iraq 30-some times and Afghanistan. And my son was there. My son was a captain—a major in the United States Army, won the Bronze Star. [The President addressed an audience member.] I see you're waving. Hi. Won the Bronze Star and a Conspicuous Service Medal. But his hooch was less than a couple hundred yards from those burn pits. He went in great shape and came home with stage 4 glioblastoma and died. The law guarantees health care to expose—those exposed to the burn pits and tuition benefits for their families in their assistance. That's the least we can do. But these guys don't like it. But, folks, there's more. Republicans in Congress, led by South Carolina Lindsey Graham, already introduced legislation to ban—to ban—the right to choose. States are already passing bans without exception for rape or incest or even the life of the mother. Wes's opponent has introduced 14 bills to limit the right to choose. Fourteen times. Audience members. Boo! The President. If you elect Wes your Governor, he's going to make sure the right to choose is protected for every woman in Maryland. If Republicans gain control of Congress and pass a nationwide ban on abortion, I will veto it. And, folks, if we elect Chris Van Hollen and elect two more Democrats and keep control of the House, we're going to codify Roe v. Wade in January and make it the rule of the land. And I love how these Republicans talk about fighting crime. On a Federal level, we passed the most significant gun safety legislation in nearly 30 years, and we're coming back to do what I was able to do in the nineties. That is ban assault weapons. Wes Moore is a combat veteran. He knows it's responsible—what responsible gun ownership is. He'll ban ghost guns, invest in community-based violence prevention programs. Maryland's largest police union and Fraternal Order of Police has endorsed Wes Moore because he actually has a plan to keep Maryland families safe. Wes's opponent won't stand up to his own party. He won't stand up to the NRA. And he is the guy—this is the guy raffling off an AR-15 at a campaign event? Give me a break, for God's sake. He's concerned about public safety? Look, folks, as I spoke about it last week: Democracy is on the ballot. Political violence and intimidation are on the rise all across America. And you remember January 6, the angry mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, attacked law enforcement, hunted down elected officials, erected gallows to hang Vice President Pence. Well, Wes supported—Wes's opponent supported that mob. He organized buses and paid for them to go to the Capitol because he thought the election was stolen. He tweeted that Mike Pence was a traitor. Think about that. For Wes Moore, patriotism meant leaving his family and putting on a country's uniform and leading his fellow soldiers in combat. His opponent: Patriotism means putting on a baseball cap, inviting people to attack the Capitol. You can't be pro-American and pro-insurrection. It's real simple. And, folks, there are more than 300 election deniers running on the Republican ticket this year, and Wes's opponent is one of them. These elections deniers are not only trying to deny you your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted. With this election, these deniers—there's only two outcomes, in their view, of an election. One, either they win or they were cheated. One of the two. That's their view. But let me tell you something: You can't only love your country when you win. Wes knows what patriotism means. His opponent—Wes described his opponent as far outside the mainstream and—be dangerous in the Governor's office. Well, even the current Republican Governor agrees with Wes. Look up what Larry Hogan has said about Wes's opponent. Folks, this is serious stuff. Let me close with this. Today, we face an inflection point, one of those moments that comes around every three or four generations. We know in our bones that our democracy is at risk, and we know that this is your moment to defend it, preserve or protect it, choose it. And I want you to know we'll meet this moment. Remember, the power in America lies where it always does: in your hands, the hands of the people, and especially with young people in this Nation, like all of you here. I mean it. I'm optimistic because I believe your generation represents the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in American history. And in 2021—2020, many of you voted for the first time. Voted for the first time. And guess what? Look at what you did when you exercised your power to vote. You elected Kamala Harris, the first woman Vice President. And your vote allowed me to put the first Black woman in history on the United States Supreme Court. And your—with your vote, I'm keeping the promise that—my promise: No one should be in jail for the mere possession of marijuana. And their record should be expunged. Remember, the power is in your hands. You're one of the reasons why I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Look, America is reasserting ourselves, leading the world in the 21st century. As I travel this country and the world, I see a great nation, because I know we're a good people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing, nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together. So vote! Get out the vote! God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Hello, Maryland! My name—[applause].

And you remember January 6, the angry mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol, attacked law enforcement, hunted down elected officials, erected gallows to hang Vice President Pence. Well, Wes supported—Wes's opponent supported that mob. He organized buses and paid for them to go to the Capitol because he thought the election was stolen. He tweeted that Mike Pence was a traitor. Think about that. For Wes Moore, patriotism meant leaving his family and putting on a country's uniform and leading his fellow soldiers in combat. His opponent: Patriotism means putting on a baseball cap, inviting people to attack the Capitol. You can't be pro-American and pro-insurrection. It's real simple. And, folks, there are more than 300 election deniers running on the Republican ticket this year, and Wes's opponent is one of them. These elections deniers are not only trying to deny you your right to vote, they're trying to deny your right to have your vote counted. With this election, these deniers—there's only two outcomes, in their view, of an election. One, either they win or they were cheated. One of the two. That's their view. But let me tell you something: You can't only love your country when you win. Wes knows what patriotism means. His opponent—Wes described his opponent as far outside the mainstream and—be dangerous in the Governor's office. Well, even the current Republican Governor agrees with Wes. Look up what Larry Hogan has said about Wes's opponent. Folks, this is serious stuff. Let me close with this. Today, we face an inflection point, one of those moments that comes around every three or four generations. We know in our bones that our democracy is at risk, and we know that this is your moment to defend it, preserve or protect it, choose it. And I want you to know we'll meet this moment. Remember, the power in America lies where it always does: in your hands, the hands of the people, and especially with young people in this Nation, like all of you here. I mean it. I'm optimistic because I believe your generation represents the best educated, most talented, least prejudiced generation in American history. And in 2021—2020, many of you voted for the first time. Voted for the first time. And guess what? Look at what you did when you exercised your power to vote. You elected Kamala Harris, the first woman Vice President. And your vote allowed me to put the first Black woman in history on the United States Supreme Court. And your—with your vote, I'm keeping the promise that—my promise: No one should be in jail for the mere possession of marijuana. And their record should be expunged. Remember, the power is in your hands. You're one of the reasons why I've never been more optimistic about America's future. Look, America is reasserting ourselves, leading the world in the 21st century. As I travel this country and the world, I see a great nation, because I know we're a good people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing, nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together. So vote! Get out the vote! God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['hello', 'maryland', 'name', 'name', 'joe', 'biden', 'im', 'jill', 'bidens', 'husband', 'bowie', 'nations', 'hbcus', 'home', 'hbcu', 'delaware', 'talking',

17,"December 02, 2022","[""The President. Well, first of all, I'd have done a hell of a lot better everywhere if I had her introduce me every place I go. [Laughter]"", ""Folks, look, the reason I'm here is because it's really important that we reelect a really decent, honorable man who's running for reelection in 2 years—just 2 years ago, in Georgia, and—Reverend Raphael Warnock."", 'And you know, when I got elected, I was a kid. I got elected when I was 29 years old to the U.S. Senate. And everybody—and I ran in a year when I defeated a fellow who ended up, quite frankly, endorsing me the second time I ran, but had been the longest officeholder in the State—a guy named Caleb Boggs, a decent, moderate Republican.', 'And they\'d say, ""Well, what\'s the secret?"" If I won, there had to be some special secret. [Laughter] ""And what do I have to know if I\'m going to run?""', 'And I said: ""One thing—what are you willing to lose over? Have you figured that part out? If you haven\'t figured out what\'s so important you\'re willing to lose over it rather than compromise on it or give up on it, then you shouldn\'t run. You should get involved in another line of work, because you can do a hell of a lot better financially, you can have less pressure—not necessarily less pressure, but less public opinion watching over your shoulder.""', ""And that's exactly what the woman who just introduced me is all about. She tells you what's on her mind, she knows what she speaks of, and she understands."", ""And I also want to point out that I think one of the best people I've ever worked with—and I mean this sincerely, I spent—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter]"", ""I spent 36 years in the United States Senate, and I've never worked with anybody that I respect more, that I trust more, and that is more on your side when he says it than that Senator right there. He's not a bad guy. He's hiding under that picture. I don't know what that painting is. But Ed Markey is the reason why a lot of what we've gotten done in this last 2 years has gotten done."", 'But look, why are we all working so hard?', 'And by the way, where is Peter—the new Senator from Vermont? There you are, Peter. Good to see you.', ""I remember Peter ran early in—I think it was—what?—'76—was it?—with Pat Leahy."", 'Representative Peter F. Welch. I worked with Pat Leahy.', 'The President. You worked with Pat then.', 'Rep. Welch. In the first campaign.', 'The President. In that first campaign. And I went up to New Hampshire to campaign for Pat. And the issue was: Pat was too young to be a Senator. And I was 2 years younger than Pat, campaigning for him. [Laughter] And he won in spite of it.', ""But congratulations, man. I'm really happy you're going to be in the Senate."", ""Look, you know, we have—I have nice remarks here prepared by my staff, and they're good. But the fact of the matter is that—why is it so important, since we have 50 Senators already—which means that the Vice President, every time she votes, she wins. Why is it so important?"", ""Well, you know, it's important because 51 means there's no longer 51 Presidents. When you have 50 Senators, everyone is a President. Everyone can make a judgment on what they want to do or not do and—and they can block whatever is coming up."", ""And they're all good people. They're all good people. Joe Manchin is a good person; he really is. But Joe has a different view, and he represents a different constituency than most of us do, especially on environmental issues. And the same way with the Senator from Arizona."", ""But my point is that—you know, I've tried to make a case this—I believed—as some of you know, because some of you do know, that—I believed we were going to do just fine this last election. I believed from the beginning we were going to do fine. I thought we were going to win. Matter of fact, but for the fact we had a little change in reapportionment in the State of New York, we'd be up by three, not down."", ""And the reason I did is because elections are a—not a referendum on the individual running; they're a choice—a choice, a choice. And the choices that we had to make—we were running against three hundred and, I think, fifty-some people or thirty-some people on the other team who, in fact, were election deniers—did not really respect the institutions, literally."", 'I know I got criticized very harshly for making a speech in the summer down at Independence Hall about—democracy was under siege. There was a threat to democracy on the horizon, for real. And then I did that again about 3 weeks before the general election.', ""But the fact of the matter is—because I went all over the country, and I could tell people were literally worried about whether or not the institutions would hold. You know, we have three equal branches of Government, where there was not—that's not the way our opposition thinks of it."", ""And by the way, you know, I've—when I was the United States Senator, I had a reputation for getting things done with Republicans. And I got an awful lot done."", ""But this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed, a different breed of cat, for real. There's still some really decent, honorable men and women in the United States Senate who are Republicans. But there's also those who really think the institutions are not to be respected that much, for real."", ""I'm even worried about—and I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for years and years, and voted on more Supreme Court Justices than any man that's living today. And the fact of the matter is: The Court has changed, not just in terms of its ideology, but in terms of its politics, the way it deals with things."", 'You wonder about whether or not the way in which the Republicans want to take a look at the institution of the Presidency under the last President and—the once-and-future President, in his view.', 'You also take a look at what they—the idea they have about the Congress and what their responsibilities are.', ""And so we need a little bit of insurance. We need a little bit of insurance for not only the things we've done, but so much more we have to get done."", ""Folks, look, because of the help of your two Senators—and I'm not being solicitous—we got a lot done. But the things we got done, people don't even know yet because a lot of it doesn't take effect yet."", ""For example, when you, in fact, decide you're going to rebuild America——not figuratively, literally—with a $1 trillion 200 billion infrastructure legislation—we used to have—be rated the second best infrastructure in the world. We're—now we're rated number 18 in the world, in terms of our infrastructure—trains, planes, buses, highways, internet, the whole thing, bridges."", ""I mean, we're—I went down the list of the number of bridges in your State that are in disrepair; that are—need real help; that haven't had anything done to them. Go across the country—the same way."", ""I was at Logan. We're putting millions of—tens of millions of dollars into Logan just to bring it up to snuff."", 'I remember when I was—when I was the Vice President, I landed at LaGuardia. And I walked into LaGuardia, and—in Air Force Two and—the small Air Force One. And I landed and I found myself walking in, and there was a sign going through the lobby. The escalator was down. It said, ""Will be repaired in 4 months."" [Laughter] Not a joke. The United States of America.', 'If I blindfolded you and put you in an airport in Beijing and in New York, and took the blindfold off and asked you where you were, you would say the opposite. You would think you were in America in Beijing and Beijing in America.', ""And so the generic point I'm making is, there's so much we have to get done, but we have such enormous opportunities. And it's only starting to kick in now."", ""And people don't know that when you take out that intersection that—where more people have been killed because of pedestrian crossings or more—or highways where you have bridges that are collapsing, and so on. They don't know it until you start to take them down and fix them. And we're just getting started, because we've now had only a portion of that money that has been released."", 'And those of you who are business men and women, you know that people want to build their factories and their facilities where they can get their product to market the quickest.', ""And so my point is, there's a lot to come—a lot to come. The same way with the environmental legislation. Everybody thinks it's just about generic things we're doing. Well, guess what? It's estimated the average person in America will save $1,500 a year if in fact they take advantage of the tax credits for their ability to deal with everything from putting new doors and windows on their homes, to having subsidized their solar panels."", ""And by the way, windmills don't kill people. [Laughter] They don't cause cancer, like the last guy thought."", ""But my generic point is, there's a lot coming with the legislation we passed relative to health care."", ""You know, I'll bet every one of you know somebody who has type 2 diabetes and needs insulin. Well, the average cost of insulin on a monthly basis was $400 a year—I mean, a month—sometimes as high as $18—$800 a month, depending on where you live."", ""Well, it costs—the guy who came up with the insulin didn't patent it because he wanted it available to anybody and everybody.

Biden,2024,0.0,"The President. Well, first of all, I'd have done a hell of a lot better everywhere if I had her introduce me every place I go. [Laughter] Folks, look, the reason I'm here is because it's really important that we reelect a really decent, honorable man who's running for reelection in 2 years—just 2 years ago, in Georgia, and—Reverend Raphael Warnock. And you know, when I got elected, I was a kid. I got elected when I was 29 years old to the U.S. Senate. And everybody—and I ran in a year when I defeated a fellow who ended up, quite frankly, endorsing me the second time I ran, but had been the longest officeholder in the State—a guy named Caleb Boggs, a decent, moderate Republican. And they'd say, ""Well, what's the secret?"" If I won, there had to be some special secret. [Laughter] ""And what do I have to know if I'm going to run?"" And I said: ""One thing—what are you willing to lose over? Have you figured that part out? If you haven't figured out what's so important you're willing to lose over it rather than compromise on it or give up on it, then you shouldn't run. You should get involved in another line of work, because you can do a hell of a lot better financially, you can have less pressure—not necessarily less pressure, but less public opinion watching over your shoulder."" And that's exactly what the woman who just introduced me is all about. She tells you what's on her mind, she knows what she speaks of, and she understands. And I also want to point out that I think one of the best people I've ever worked with—and I mean this sincerely, I spent—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] I spent 36 years in the United States Senate, and I've never worked with anybody that I respect more, that I trust more, and that is more on your side when he says it than that Senator right there. He's not a bad guy. He's hiding under that picture. I don't know what that painting is. But Ed Markey is the reason why a lot of what we've gotten done in this last 2 years has gotten done. But look, why are we all working so hard? And by the way, where is Peter—the new Senator from Vermont? There you are, Peter. Good to see you. I remember Peter ran early in—I think it was—what?—'76—was it?—with Pat Leahy. Representative Peter F. Welch. I worked with Pat Leahy. The President. You worked with Pat then. Rep. Welch. In the first campaign. The President. In that first campaign. And I went up to New Hampshire to campaign for Pat. And the issue was: Pat was too young to be a Senator. And I was 2 years younger than Pat, campaigning for him. [Laughter] And he won in spite of it. But congratulations, man. I'm really happy you're going to be in the Senate. Look, you know, we have—I have nice remarks here prepared by my staff, and they're good. But the fact of the matter is that—why is it so important, since we have 50 Senators already—which means that the Vice President, every time she votes, she wins. Why is it so important? Well, you know, it's important because 51 means there's no longer 51 Presidents. When you have 50 Senators, everyone is a President. Everyone can make a judgment on what they want to do or not do and—and they can block whatever is coming up. And they're all good people. They're all good people. Joe Manchin is a good person; he really is. But Joe has a different view, and he represents a different constituency than most of us do, especially on environmental issues. And the same way with the Senator from Arizona. But my point is that—you know, I've tried to make a case this—I believed—as some of you know, because some of you do know, that—I believed we were going to do just fine this last election. I believed from the beginning we were going to do fine. I thought we were going to win. Matter of fact, but for the fact we had a little change in reapportionment in the State of New York, we'd be up by three, not down. And the reason I did is because elections are a—not a referendum on the individual running; they're a choice—a choice, a choice. And the choices that we had to make—we were running against three hundred and, I think, fifty-some people or thirty-some people on the other team who, in fact, were election deniers—did not really respect the institutions, literally. I know I got criticized very harshly for making a speech in the summer down at Independence Hall about—democracy was under siege. There was a threat to democracy on the horizon, for real. And then I did that again about 3 weeks before the general election. But the fact of the matter is—because I went all over the country, and I could tell people were literally worried about whether or not the institutions would hold. You know, we have three equal branches of Government, where there was not—that's not the way our opposition thinks of it. And by the way, you know, I've—when I was the United States Senator, I had a reputation for getting things done with Republicans. And I got an awful lot done. But this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed, a different breed of cat, for real. There's still some really decent, honorable men and women in the United States Senate who are Republicans. But there's also those who really think the institutions are not to be respected that much, for real. I'm even worried about—and I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for years and years, and voted on more Supreme Court Justices than any man that's living today. And the fact of the matter is: The Court has changed, not just in terms of its ideology, but in terms of its politics, the way it deals with things. You wonder about whether or not the way in which the Republicans want to take a look at the institution of the Presidency under the last President and—the once-and-future President, in his view. You also take a look at what they—the idea they have about the Congress and what their responsibilities are. And so we need a little bit of insurance. We need a little bit of insurance for not only the things we've done, but so much more we have to get done. Folks, look, because of the help of your two Senators—and I'm not being solicitous—we got a lot done. But the things we got done, people don't even know yet because a lot of it doesn't take effect yet. For example, when you, in fact, decide you're going to rebuild America——not figuratively, literally—with a $1 trillion 200 billion infrastructure legislation—we used to have—be rated the second best infrastructure in the world. We're—now we're rated number 18 in the world, in terms of our infrastructure—trains, planes, buses, highways, internet, the whole thing, bridges. I mean, we're—I went down the list of the number of bridges in your State that are in disrepair; that are—need real help; that haven't had anything done to them. Go across the country—the same way. I was at Logan. We're putting millions of—tens of millions of dollars into Logan just to bring it up to snuff. I remember when I was—when I was the Vice President, I landed at LaGuardia. And I walked into LaGuardia, and—in Air Force Two and—the small Air Force One. And I landed and I found myself walking in, and there was a sign going through the lobby. The escalator was down. It said, ""Will be repaired in 4 months."" [Laughter] Not a joke. The United States of America. If I blindfolded you and put you in an airport in Beijing and in New York, and took the blindfold off and asked you where you were, you would say the opposite. You would think you were in America in Beijing and Beijing in America. And so the generic point I'm making is, there's so much we have to get done, but we have such enormous opportunities. And it's only starting to kick in now. And people don't know that when you take out that intersection that—where more people have been killed because of pedestrian crossings or more—or highways where you have bridges that are collapsing, and so on. They don't know it until you start to take them down and fix them. And we're just getting started, because we've now had only a portion of that money that has been released. And those of you who are business men and women, you know that people want to build their factories and their facilities where they can get their product to market the quickest. And so my point is, there's a lot to come—a lot to come. The same way with the environmental legislation. Everybody thinks it's just about generic things we're doing. Well, guess what? It's estimated the average person in America will save $1,500 a year if in fact they take advantage of the tax credits for their ability to deal with everything from putting new doors and windows on their homes, to having subsidized their solar panels. And by the way, windmills don't kill people. [Laughter] They don't cause cancer, like the last guy thought. But my generic point is, there's a lot coming with the legislation we passed relative to health care. You know, I'll bet every one of you know somebody who has type 2 diabetes and needs insulin. Well, the average cost of insulin on a monthly basis was $400 a year—I mean, a month—sometimes as high as $18—$800 a month, depending on where you live. Well, it costs—the guy who came up with the insulin didn't patent it because he wanted it available to anybody and everybody. And the total cost of manufacturing that is $10—T-E-N—$10. Package it—another $4. So it costs a maximum of 15 bucks. And—what's happening. I was in Virginia, campaigning for a candidate in the early summer. And a woman stood up and asked about insulin, and she started to cry. She said: ""I have two daughters with type 2 diabetes. And I have to split—I have to share the insulin. I don't have the money. I don't have the insurance to be able to handle it."" This—for God's sake, this is the United States of America. And so I can go down the list. And so a lot of this is just going to kick into gear now. The insulin price goes—people are going to, all of the sudden, decide: ""Oh, my God, Biden was right. I mean, he actually said it only going to cost me 35 bucks."" And they start paying it. And they're going to go, ""Whoa, I didn't realize that was really true."" I could go down the list of the other things that these folks helped us pass. The point I'm making is that elections are a choice. And this is the most—this Republican Party today is the most devoid of any serious ideas that I've ever dealt with. And I'm not—you know, I got criticized, remember, when I ran for President, saying I'm running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America, decency, and honor. Two, to rebuild the American—not trickle-down, but from the middle out and the bottom up. When the middle class does well, the wealthy do very well and never get hurt and—and the poor have a shot—and people have a little breathing room, as my dad would say. At the end of the month, they got just a little space—a little space. And so—but the third thing I said: We're going to unite the country. You remember—the press is in the room. They understandably, legitimately, beat the living hell out of me for saying that's—that's the—""Biden's the old guy here. That's how it used to be. It can't be that way anymore."" Well, if we can't unite this country, we're in real trouble, we're in desperate trouble, because democracies only can function when you gather consensus. And so what we did this last time out and what's happening down in Georgia right now is that we have to make it clear to people that—what are the other team for? Not a joke. If I asked you if—and you all—because of your generosity of helping candidates, you're all in a position to be able to do relatively well. If I said, ""I'll tell you what, I'll bet you 500 bucks you can't, in the next 15 minutes, sit down and write out a—what's the Republican platform."" [Laughter] No, I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. It's about whatever we're for, they're against. Look at what they want to repeal. They want to repeal everything. The first thing they said they want to do—the first thing—is get rid of the Affordable Care—excuse me—get rid of the legislation passed that has the environmental money in it and has the money dealing with Medicare being able to negotiate. Why is Medicare the only outfit in the world, unlike the VA and others, that cannot negotiate prices that they're going to pay for product, saving the American public? And by the way, all the stuff we did—I want to remind you—I love my Republican friends talking about—not the Republicans in the Congress talking about the ""big-spendin' Democrats."" I lowered the deficit $1 trillion 400 billion this year. This year. The largest ever occurred in American history. Three hundred and fifty billion last year, after inheriting a disaster of a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for. So I guess my point is, the reason I need, we need Raphael Warnock is we can't have this hanging on a thread every single vote we have. Every single vote we have on anything consequential hangs on a single thread. And we no longer control the House, by just a handful of votes—literally a handful of votes. But there's enough serious-moving Republicans in the House that you're going to find—they're going to have a difficulty holding them all together on serious things that we can get passed. And so, again, there's so much to—I should just hush up and let you ask me questions. But the bottom line is: There's so much we can get done. There's so much we can get done for the American people, and none of it is radical. There's no—this radical ""big-spendin' Democrats."" Like I said, the deficit was highest it's ever been under Trump and was cut the greatest of any administration in American history under the Democrats the last 2 years. And so—and look, I know we still have to worry about inflation. And it's a legitimate concern. And the possibility of some suggesting that we—the Fed may continue to put pretty harsh restrictions on interest rates or increasing them in order to bring—make sure we don't—but guess what? In the meantime, we're having—we have the most steady job creation of any administration since Johnson's administration. Unemployment is still at a 50-year low. We're in a situation where the GDP is growing—not exorbitantly but manageable. It's a debate whether or not—what we can do, how much more we can do and not have—run into a recession. But so far, a lot of folks have been preaching gloom and doom, and it hadn't happened yet. Doesn't mean it won't happen. But look at gas prices. Remember how badly I was criticized when I said—and I got the support from Warnock—saying that, ""Well, all you're going to do is going to release several million barrels of oil from a Petroleum Reserve."" Well, guess what? That—[inaudible]—million barrels of oil—what's the price of oil now—gasoline at the pump?

If you have a family with two automobiles, you're saving yourself 170 bucks a month. There's more than one way to deal with family inflation. My dad used to say, ""At the end of the day, what do you have left after you pay your—all your monthly bills?"" So, if you have a child that needs insulin, it is a significant reduction in inflation for that family if it goes from $400 to 15—to 35 bucks. If the gasoline price comes down and stays down, I don't—I can't guarantee anything, but it has to continue to come down. And guess what? The major oil industry has made more money than any time in all of history. Exxon made seven—nine—$17.9 billion in one quarter—more than they've ever made. They're not passing it on, because they're saying they're not going to, in fact, reignite their refineries because they're afraid Biden's eventually going to take us to zero—zero emissions, in terms of—but that's going to take—no matter what, that's going to take at least 5, 7, 8 years before we get there. We're going to still need energy. My generic point is, there's so much at stake in this upcoming election—this next 2 years. So much at stake. Now I can't—as was I had—well, I don't want to, with the press here, name the names, but the Republicans who came to see me—the future leadership of the House. And they were telling me what they could do, what they were going to do. And I said, ""Yes,"" and I face—I was sitting at the—at the desk in the room. And I just went like this. [At this point, the President held up a pen.] [Laughter] And they said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""A pen. Veto."" [Laughter] ""Veto."" But that not—that can stop bad things, but it can't start them. It can't generate them. And so—and if you're—if you had Raphael Warnock here, you'd see he's a man—forget whether he's a man of faith or not; he is—but he's a truly decent man. Truly decent, honorable man. And the fellow he's running against is—based on just what he's done and said—is someone who is a very different breed than he is. Doesn't deserve to be a United States Senator. Doesn't deserve to be a United States Senator. And so we're have—we have a race that's of extreme consequence. That's the best way for me to put it. I'm taking too long to talk. But look, you know, everything we've done, from passing the PACT Act—everybody says, ""What's the PACT Act?"" Well, you know, there's about 3 million military people who've been breathing that air from those burn pits. My son was one of those. It's not about my son, but my son was one of those. My son was the attorney general of Delaware, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year with his National Guard unit, and came home—went one of the—on all the tests they do, one of the fittest guys in the—in his unit, and came back with stage-4 glioblastoma. Fought like hell. Never complained. But I've visited in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 37 times. And he lived within, probably, 200 yards, in Camp Liberty, of the—one of those burn pits. A burn pit is about the size of football field, 8 to 10 feet deep. And they burn everything in there from fuel to poisonous material to rubber to—I mean, across the board. And it's just like you all learned about that from 9/11, what happened to those firefighters breathing that toxic air. And so we—we had a question of whether or not we were going to get the burn pit legislation passed. Was that going to pass? Were they going to spend the money? So all it does is say—just like we did with Agent Orange finally—it's hard to prove that the reason you have the disability you have is because of Agent Orange, but if you were exposed when it was dropped on your head, it was assumed that there was—that was the reason for your illness. Well, the same—all this does is say they're going to provide for—help the families of VA help for—this is someone who comes home having been exposed to a burn pit—have their bills—their medical bills paid for; and if they passed away, have their benefits that flowed for them from—for education, be able to flow to their children. But my point is, these are things that used to be supported by—overwhelmingly by Republicans as well as Democrats. Now they ended up having enough to vote for it. But the whole point I'm trying to make is, we have a chance—no, let me—I'll end it this way. And I apologize to my colleagues; they've heard me say this for a while. I really think we're at an inflection point in American history, not because I'm President or anybody who's in office. One of those times in history where the things that we do the previous 4 years or 3 years, the next 5 or 6 years are going to determine what the country looks like for the next 50 years, literally. And the world is changing. All across the world—the world, it's changing. And what we do matters a great deal. What we do matters a great deal. Imagine 4 more years of the last guy coming up. I can tell you, I spent most of my career dealing with foreign policy. The rest of the world doesn't understand. I'll conclude by giving an example. The first G-7 meeting of the largest democratic economies in London—in England, after I got elected, in February. And I sat down and I said, ""America is back."" And the comment was—only heads of states sitting there—""For how long? For how long?"" And then one of them pointed out, without naming him—pointed out to me: ""What would you say, Mr. President, if you went to bed tonight here in southern England, woke up the next morning and find out a couple of thousand people had stormed the British Parliament, crashed through the doors of the House of Commons, two cops were killed in the meantime, to try to overcome the outcome of an election? What would you think?"" And, really, ask yourself: What would you think, sitting here in America? What would you think about the future of England? Well, you know, a lot of people out there wonder whether or not we're going to return to what was chaos internationally before. And so I think that we have not only enormous opportunities, but enormous obligations. Obligations. And one of the things I've learned, even though I—for a long time was—I was Vice President for 8 years and did a lot of foreign policy for Barack—when the President of the United States walks in the room, everybody—everybody raises their head. Not because—I don't mean me—whoever the President is. Because as Madeleine Albright said, ""America is the indispensable nation."" It is the indispensable nation. And so we've got to continue to be able to lead and lead in a way that takes the world in a direction that is democratic—democratic values that are upheld. And I know, as I said, I got criticized for talking about the demise of democracy in front of these guys. But it matters. It matters. And we can straighten this—we can be in a position, if we continue these next 2 years and nail down what we started, we're going to be in a position for the next 10 to 20 years where America is going to be in pretty good shape. Any rate, thank you very much.","The President. Well, first of all, I'd have done a hell of a lot better everywhere if I had her introduce me every place I go. [Laughter] Folks, look, the reason I'm here is because it's really important that we reelect a really decent, honorable man who's running for reelection in 2 years—just 2 years ago, in Georgia, and—Reverend Raphael Warnock. And you know, when I got elected, I was a kid. I got elected when I was 29 years old to the U.S. Senate. And everybody—and I ran in a year when I defeated a fellow who ended up, quite frankly, endorsing me the second time I ran, but had been the longest officeholder in the State—a guy named Caleb Boggs, a decent, moderate Republican. And they'd say, ""Well, what's the secret?"" If I won, there had to be some special secret. [Laughter] ""And what do I have to know if I'm going to run?"" And I said: ""One thing—what are you willing to lose over? Have you figured that part out? If you haven't figured out what's so important you're willing to lose over it rather than compromise on it or give up on it, then you shouldn't run. You should get involved in another line of work, because you can do a hell of a lot better financially, you can have less pressure—not necessarily less pressure, but less public opinion watching over your shoulder."" And that's exactly what the woman who just introduced me is all about. She tells you what's on her mind, she knows what she speaks of, and she understands. And I also want to point out that I think one of the best people I've ever worked with—and I mean this sincerely, I spent—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long time. [Laughter] I spent 36 years in the United States Senate, and I've never worked with anybody that I respect more, that I trust more, and that is more on your side when he says it than that Senator right there. He's not a bad guy. He's hiding under that picture. I don't know what that painting is. But Ed Markey is the reason why a lot of what we've gotten done in this last 2 years has gotten done. But look, why are we all working so hard? And by the way, where is Peter—the new Senator from Vermont? There you are, Peter. Good to see you. I remember Peter ran early in—I think it was—what?—'76—was it?—with Pat Leahy. Representative Peter F. Welch. I worked with Pat Leahy. The President. You worked with Pat then. Rep. Welch. In the first campaign. The President. In that first campaign. And I went up to New Hampshire to campaign for Pat. And the issue was: Pat was too young to be a Senator. And I was 2 years younger than Pat, campaigning for him. [Laughter] And he won in spite of it. But congratulations, man. I'm really happy you're going to be in the Senate. Look, you know, we have—I have nice remarks here prepared by my staff, and they're good. But the fact of the matter is that—why is it so important, since we have 50 Senators already—which means that the Vice President, every time she votes, she wins. Why is it so important? Well, you know, it's important because 51 means there's no longer 51 Presidents. When you have 50 Senators, everyone is a President. Everyone can make a judgment on what they want to do or not do and—and they can block whatever is coming up. And they're all good people. They're all good people. Joe Manchin is a good person; he really is. But Joe has a different view, and he represents a different constituency than most of us do, especially on environmental issues. And the same way with the Senator from Arizona. But my point is that—you know, I've tried to make a case this—I believed—as some of you know, because some of you do know, that—I believed we were going to do just fine this last election. I believed from the beginning we were going to do fine. I thought we were going to win. Matter of fact, but for the fact we had a little change in reapportionment in the State of New York, we'd be up by three, not down. And the reason I did is because elections are a—not a referendum on the individual running; they're a choice—a choice, a choice. And the choices that we had to make—we were running against three hundred and, I think, fifty-some people or thirty-some people on the other team who, in fact, were election deniers—did not really respect the institutions, literally. I know I got criticized very harshly for making a speech in the summer down at Independence Hall about—democracy was under siege. There was a threat to democracy on the horizon, for real. And then I did that again about 3 weeks before the general election. But the fact of the matter is—because I went all over the country, and I could tell people were literally worried about whether or not the institutions would hold. You know, we have three equal branches of Government, where there was not—that's not the way our opposition thinks of it. And by the way, you know, I've—when I was the United States Senator, I had a reputation for getting things done with Republicans. And I got an awful lot done. But this is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed, a different breed of cat, for real. There's still some really decent, honorable men and women in the United States Senate who are Republicans. But there's also those who really think the institutions are not to be respected that much, for real. I'm even worried about—and I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for years and years, and voted on more Supreme Court Justices than any man that's living today. And the fact of the matter is: The Court has changed, not just in terms of its ideology, but in terms of its politics, the way it deals with things. You wonder about whether or not the way in which the Republicans want to take a look at the institution of the Presidency under the last President and—the once-and-future President, in his view. You also take a look at what they—the idea they have about the Congress and what their responsibilities are. And so we need a little bit of insurance. We need a little bit of insurance for not only the things we've done, but so much more we have to get done. Folks, look, because of the help of your two Senators—and I'm not being solicitous—we got a lot done. But the things we got done, people don't even know yet because a lot of it doesn't take effect yet. For example, when you, in fact, decide you're going to rebuild America——not figuratively, literally—with a $1 trillion 200 billion infrastructure legislation—we used to have—be rated the second best infrastructure in the world. We're—now we're rated number 18 in the world, in terms of our infrastructure—trains, planes, buses, highways, internet, the whole thing, bridges. I mean, we're—I went down the list of the number of bridges in your State that are in disrepair; that are—need real help; that haven't had anything done to them. Go across the country—the same way. I was at Logan. We're putting millions of—tens of millions of dollars into Logan just to bring it up to snuff. I remember when I was—when I was the Vice President, I landed at LaGuardia. And I walked into LaGuardia, and—in Air Force Two and—the small Air Force One. And I landed and I found myself walking in, and there was a sign going through the lobby. The escalator was down. It said, ""Will be repaired in 4 months."" [Laughter] Not a joke. The United States of America. If I blindfolded you and put you in an airport in Beijing and in New York, and took the blindfold off and asked you where you were, you would say the opposite. You would think you were in America in Beijing and Beijing in America. And so the generic point I'm making is, there's so much we have to get done, but we have such enormous opportunities. And it's only starting to kick in now. And people don't know that when you take out that intersection that—where more people have been killed because of pedestrian crossings or more—or highways where you have bridges that are collapsing, and so on. They don't know it until you start to take them down and fix them. And we're just getting started, because we've now had only a portion of that money that has been released. And those of you who are business men and women, you know that people want to build their factories and their facilities where they can get their product to market the quickest. And so my point is, there's a lot to come—a lot to come. The same way with the environmental legislation. Everybody thinks it's just about generic things we're doing. Well, guess what? It's estimated the average person in America will save $1,500 a year if in fact they take advantage of the tax credits for their ability to deal with everything from putting new doors and windows on their homes, to having subsidized their solar panels. And by the way, windmills don't kill people. [Laughter] They don't cause cancer, like the last guy thought. But my generic point is, there's a lot coming with the legislation we passed relative to health care. You know, I'll bet every one of you know somebody who has type 2 diabetes and needs insulin. Well, the average cost of insulin on a monthly basis was $400 a year—I mean, a month—sometimes as high as $18—$800 a month, depending on where you live. Well, it costs—the guy who came up with the insulin didn't patent it because he wanted it available to anybody and everybody. And the total cost of manufacturing that is $10—T-E-N—$10. Package it—another $4. So it costs a maximum of 15 bucks. And—what's happening. I was in Virginia, campaigning for a candidate in the early summer. And a woman stood up and asked about insulin, and she started to cry. She said: ""I have two daughters with type 2 diabetes. And I have to split—I have to share the insulin. I don't have the money. I don't have the insurance to be able to handle it."" This—for God's sake, this is the United States of America. And so I can go down the list. And so a lot of this is just going to kick into gear now. The insulin price goes—people are going to, all of the sudden, decide: ""Oh, my God, Biden was right. I mean, he actually said it only going to cost me 35 bucks."" And they start paying it. And they're going to go, ""Whoa, I didn't realize that was really true."" I could go down the list of the other things that these folks helped us pass. The point I'm making is that elections are a choice. And this is the most—this Republican Party today is the most devoid of any serious ideas that I've ever dealt with. And I'm not—you know, I got criticized, remember, when I ran for President, saying I'm running for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America, decency, and honor. Two, to rebuild the American—not trickle-down, but from the middle out and the bottom up. When the middle class does well, the wealthy do very well and never get hurt and—and the poor have a shot—and people have a little breathing room, as my dad would say. At the end of the month, they got just a little space—a little space. And so—but the third thing I said: We're going to unite the country. You remember—the press is in the room. They understandably, legitimately, beat the living hell out of me for saying that's—that's the—""Biden's the old guy here. That's how it used to be. It can't be that way anymore."" Well, if we can't unite this country, we're in real trouble, we're in desperate trouble, because democracies only can function when you gather consensus. And so what we did this last time out and what's happening down in Georgia right now is that we have to make it clear to people that—what are the other team for? Not a joke. If I asked you if—and you all—because of your generosity of helping candidates, you're all in a position to be able to do relatively well. If I said, ""I'll tell you what, I'll bet you 500 bucks you can't, in the next 15 minutes, sit down and write out a—what's the Republican platform."" [Laughter] No, I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. It's about whatever we're for, they're against. Look at what they want to repeal. They want to repeal everything. The first thing they said they want to do—the first thing—is get rid of the Affordable Care—excuse me—get rid of the legislation passed that has the environmental money in it and has the money dealing with Medicare being able to negotiate. Why is Medicare the only outfit in the world, unlike the VA and others, that cannot negotiate prices that they're going to pay for product, saving the American public? And by the way, all the stuff we did—I want to remind you—I love my Republican friends talking about—not the Republicans in the Congress talking about the ""big-spendin' Democrats."" I lowered the deficit $1 trillion 400 billion this year. This year. The largest ever occurred in American history. Three hundred and fifty billion last year, after inheriting a disaster of a $2 trillion tax cut, not a penny of which was paid for. So I guess my point is, the reason I need, we need Raphael Warnock is we can't have this hanging on a thread every single vote we have. Every single vote we have on anything consequential hangs on a single thread. And we no longer control the House, by just a handful of votes—literally a handful of votes. But there's enough serious-moving Republicans in the House that you're going to find—they're going to have a difficulty holding them all together on serious things that we can get passed. And so, again, there's so much to—I should just hush up and let you ask me questions. But the bottom line is: There's so much we can get done. There's so much we can get done for the American people, and none of it is radical. There's no—this radical ""big-spendin' Democrats."" Like I said, the deficit was highest it's ever been under Trump and was cut the greatest of any administration in American history under the Democrats the last 2 years. And so—and look, I know we still have to worry about inflation. And it's a legitimate concern. And the possibility of some suggesting that we—the Fed may continue to put pretty harsh restrictions on interest rates or increasing them in order to bring—make sure we don't—but guess what? In the meantime, we're having—we have the most steady job creation of any administration since Johnson's administration. Unemployment is still at a 50-year low. We're in a situation where the GDP is growing—not exorbitantly but manageable. It's a debate whether or not—what we can do, how much more we can do and not have—run into a recession. But so far, a lot of folks have been preaching gloom and doom, and it hadn't happened yet. Doesn't mean it won't happen. But look at gas prices. Remember how badly I was criticized when I said—and I got the support from Warnock—saying that, ""Well, all you're going to do is going to release several million barrels of oil from a Petroleum Reserve."" Well, guess what? That—[inaudible]—million barrels of oil—what's the price of oil now—gasoline at the pump? For example, down in Georgia, which we're going to be talking about this, the average family has gone from an average cost of $4.98 or $4.87—don't hold me to the exact number—I don't—I'll look—look at my notes—but the high—the high 4's to $2.88. If you have a family with two automobiles, you're saving yourself 170 bucks a month. There's more than one way to deal with family inflation. My dad used to say, ""At the end of the day, what do you have left after you pay your—all your monthly bills?"" So, if you have a child that needs insulin, it is a significant reduction in inflation for that family if it goes from $400 to 15—to 35 bucks. If the gasoline price comes down and stays down, I don't—I can't guarantee anything, but it has to continue to come down. And guess what? The major oil industry has made more money than any time in all of history. Exxon made seven—nine—$17.9 billion in one quarter—more than they've ever made. They're not passing it on, because they're saying they're not going to, in fact, reignite their refineries because they're afraid Biden's eventually going to take us to zero—zero emissions, in terms of—but that's going to take—no matter what, that's going to take at least 5, 7, 8 years before we get there. We're going to still need energy. My generic point is, there's so much at stake in this upcoming election—this next 2 years. So much at stake. Now I can't—as was I had—well, I don't want to, with the press here, name the names, but the Republicans who came to see me—the future leadership of the House. And they were telling me what they could do, what they were going to do. And I said, ""Yes,"" and I face—I was sitting at the—at the desk in the room. And I just went like this. [At this point, the President held up a pen.] [Laughter] And they said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, ""A pen. Veto."" [Laughter] ""Veto."" But that not—that can stop bad things, but it can't start them. It can't generate them. And so—and if you're—if you had Raphael Warnock here, you'd see he's a man—forget whether he's a man of faith or not; he is—but he's a truly decent man. Truly decent, honorable man. And the fellow he's running against is—based on just what he's done and said—is someone who is a very different breed than he is. Doesn't deserve to be a United States Senator. Doesn't deserve to be a United States Senator. And so we're have—we have a race that's of extreme consequence. That's the best way for me to put it. I'm taking too long to talk. But look, you know, everything we've done, from passing the PACT Act—everybody says, ""What's the PACT Act?"" Well, you know, there's about 3 million military people who've been breathing that air from those burn pits. My son was one of those. It's not about my son, but my son was one of those. My son was the attorney general of Delaware, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year with his National Guard unit, and came home—went one of the—on all the tests they do, one of the fittest guys in the—in his unit, and came back with stage-4 glioblastoma. Fought like hell. Never complained. But I've visited in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 37 times. And he lived within, probably, 200 yards, in Camp Liberty, of the—one of those burn pits. A burn pit is about the size of football field, 8 to 10 feet deep. And they burn everything in there from fuel to poisonous material to rubber to—I mean, across the board. And it's just like you all learned about that from 9/11, what happened to those firefighters breathing that toxic air. And so we—we had a question of whether or not we were going to get the burn pit legislation passed. Was that going to pass? Were they going to spend the money? So all it does is say—just like we did with Agent Orange finally—it's hard to prove that the reason you have the disability you have is because of Agent Orange, but if you were exposed when it was dropped on your head, it was assumed that there was—that was the reason for your illness. Well, the same—all this does is say they're going to provide for—help the families of VA help for—this is someone who comes home having been exposed to a burn pit—have their bills—their medical bills paid for; and if they passed away, have their benefits that flowed for them from—for education, be able to flow to their children. But my point is, these are things that used to be supported by—overwhelmingly by Republicans as well as Democrats. Now they ended up having enough to vote for it. But the whole point I'm trying to make is, we have a chance—no, let me—I'll end it this way. And I apologize to my colleagues; they've heard me say this for a while. I really think we're at an inflection point in American history, not because I'm President or anybody who's in office. One of those times in history where the things that we do the previous 4 years or 3 years, the next 5 or 6 years are going to determine what the country looks like for the next 50 years, literally. And the world is changing. All across the world—the world, it's changing. And what we do matters a great deal. What we do matters a great deal. Imagine 4 more years of the last guy coming up. I can tell you, I spent most of my career dealing with foreign policy. The rest of the world doesn't understand. I'll conclude by giving an example.

And we can straighten this—we can be in a position, if we continue these next 2 years and nail down what we started, we're going to be in a position for the next 10 to 20 years where America is going to be in pretty good shape. Any rate, thank you very much.","['id', 'done', 'hell', 'lot', 'everywhere', 'introduce', 'place', 'folks', 'look', 'reason', 'im', 'really', 'important', 'reelect', 'really', 'decent', 'honorable',

That red wave was supposed to wipe us out and a gigantic victory for Republicans. It never happened. We met the moment again and again with a broad coalition, with all of you. We're going to do it again in 2024. We're going to do it together. So as we enter this reelection campaign, Jill and I, Kamala and Doug, want you to remember the power of America lies with you, the American people. You. You know all this. And now we need you to spread the word to our friends. Go to joebiden.com or text ""share"" to 30330. You're the reason we've never been more optimistic about our future. And we—I've never been more optimistic. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there's simply nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. So let's go win this thing. Let's finish the job. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Let's get it done.","The First Lady. Thank you, Jose. Good evening. Every few years, we tell Americans that this is the most important election of their lives. And every year, we're right—because the fight for freedom has no end. The fight for democracy, for America has no end. There will always be those who want to pull us backwards, who can only see glory in some imagined past. So when they pull, we push. We push for progress. We push for the people we love. We push for the future we want, the future our children deserve. And when we all push together, shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart, we win. That's what we did when we elected Joe and Kamala. I will never forget the moment we got word that they had won. We were sitting on a dock of a lake near our home in Wilmington. And then all of a sudden, we heard shouts of joy coming from our house. And we knew we had won. Don't you remember it? The people who were banging pots and pans and dancing in the streets. It was like we were all holding our breath and suddenly we could breathe again. You made that possible: with a dozen phone calls, with a $5 donation, with a conversation you were a little nervous to have. Just tiny moments again and again, until, together, we created something bigger than any one of us. So thank you for that work. Thank you for standing with us then and now. With your help, Joe has changed our country for good. America has seen the true character of the person I've known for so long, whose heart is big enough to cross our divides and bring together Americans from all walks of life; whose vision and determination are strong enough to cut through the partisanship of our politics and pass historic legislation; whose commitment is steadfast enough not only to keep his promises, but surpass them. And he's not done. He's ready to keep pushing us forward. We will win again, but not without you. We're all in this. And I'm asking you to be all in as well. Help us with those small moments: dollars donated, calls made, and doors knocked. We have to start now. And we can't let up until we win. Because the fight for freedom doesn't end, and this is the most important election of our lives. I know we can win because we have you by our side. Joe. The President. Well, look, everyone, hello. Jill and I, and Kamala and Doug, wanted to get together for two reasons, all of us. One, the first is to thank you. So many of you were with us throughout the incredible ride in 2020, through to this very day. We wouldn't be here without you. And that's not hyperbole. We're counting on you to help us win this next time around. We can't do it without you. Just look at all we've accomplished so far. And think about everything else we can do together. Let's finish the job. And we're within reach. And that's the second reason I wanted to talk to you. We need you. As Jill said, our democracy needs you. And that's, again, not—that's literal. Because this is about our freedoms. MAGA Republicans are trying to take us backwards. But together, we're not going to let them do that. Instead, our agenda is going to bring us forward and build on the progress we made to finish the job. Look, we keep growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down. We said we'd do that. Let's protect a woman's right to choose. Let's get Roe v. Wade. It's just a long—there's just so much we have to do. Look, let's protect our children from gun violence, keep lowering the prescription drug cost. Let's protect Social Security and Medicare. We've gotten so much done, but there's so much more to do. Folks, we're still in the battle for the soul of America. And now we're at an inflection point. One of those moments not only that come around every few generations, they come around, and we're in one of them right now. And when we look back years from now, we'll know whether we met this moment. You know, so you've got to—let me tell you something, because that's so important: Because of all of you, we will meet this moment—because of you—just like we did in 2020. Remember 2020, as Jill said, when everyone had us written off? But you knew we could do it, and we did because of you. Remember 2022, those midterm elections. That red wave was supposed to wipe us out and a gigantic victory for Republicans. It never happened. We met the moment again and again with a broad coalition, with all of you.

And for the first time since the Second World War, our friends began to wonder whether they could—the United States could be relied on.', ""Now, look at where we are today. We've united NATO once more in a way it has never been united before. It's a wonder we're—[applause]."", ""We've created 13 million new jobs since I became President. That's more jobs in little over 2 years than any President has created in one 4-year term. The unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low at 3.7 percent.

I want you to listen to this one. [Laughter]', 'It was time to end the trickle-down economics theory: You know, the wealthy do well, we all do well.', 'Forty years of handing out excessive tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations had been a bust. Democrats as well as Republicans did it. All of it had done—all it had done was hollow out the middle class; blow up the deficit; ship jobs overseas; strip the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another, all across America as the factories shut down.', ""I'm pretty sure you saw in your home what I saw in mine.

I don\'t know what the hell that is. [Laughter] But it\'s working.', ""Let me tell you what it's about. It's about building an economy—literally, not figuratively—from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everybody does well. [Applause] No—the poor have a way up, and the wealthy don't—do—they just do just fine."", ""But like I said, I didn't just come into office with a theory; I came with a plan. And it started with passing the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going again."", ""And that's exactly what it did. It put money in people's pockets, provided a lifetime—lifeline for businesses to stay afloat. And one study concluded that it kept 7 million people in their homes—not losing their homes."", 'Oh, it did one more thing that matters a lot to you: It included the Butch Lewis Act to protect the pensions of millions of workers.

How can that be? Can you believe we used to be the best infrastructure—had the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one? But today, we rate number 13—13. Twelve other nations have better—and by the way, how in the hell can you grow an economy without an infrastructure? Not—not a joke."", 'Under my predecessor, ""Infrastructure Week"" became a punchline. On my watch, we\'re making ""Infrastructure Decade"" a headline. And that\'s what this law is all about. It\'s about investing in America, in our roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more.', ""We've already stated—started some 32,000 projects all across America. As Mayor Kenney knows, none of them are more consequential than right here at I-95 in Philly. In fact, if you go to invest.gov, you'll see a map that's going to show every single project in this country."", ""And by the way, it creates tens of thousands of good-paying jobs with prevailing wage. And you don't need a college degree to make a decent income."", 'You\'ve heard me say before many times, but it sticks in my mind.

It\'s about respect. It\'s about being able look at your child in the eye and say, \'Honey, it\'s going to be okay. We\'re going to make it.\'""', ""That's what this is about. He was right, and I'm determined to make it a reality for every family in this country."", ""But look, if I needed any reminder about how important infrastructure was in the country, I got a reminder just a few days ago right here in Philly. I visited the damaged section of I-95.

I'm instructing my team to move heaven and earth to get it done. And thanks to some smart thinking and some innovative design and using materials right here in Pennsylvania, we're going to get it done in record time because it's so important to the economy not only of Philly, but the entire Northeast Corridor and every community."", 'Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. I kept saying for a long while here: We used to be on the cutting edge of science and technology. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire GDP in research and development. You know what it is now? Got down to .7 percent. And you wonder why the hell the rest of the world is catching up and, in some places, it was moving ahead.', ""Well, America got a wakeup call with the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains. People wonder what the hell you talk about 5 years ago—talking about supply chains. They know now."", 'Well, guess what? We know we can never again be so vulnerable.', 'One key component is semiconductors—those little, tiny, small computer chips, smaller than the fingerprint—fingertip, I should say—that affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States military has.', ""America invented these chips. But, over time, from—we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to then producing less than 10 percent. But we're turning that around."", ""Now, the private sector—because I decided we're going to get this done—the private sector is investing a record $470 billion in advanced manufacturing right here in the United States for—as well as clean energy in America, again, creating good-paying jobs, a prevailing wage, changing people's lives."", 'And fourth, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—[applause]—just like the VA has been able to do.', ""You know, folks, the same drug company making the same prescription, if they—if you go to buy it in Paris, it's cheaper than the United States. Go to buy it in any major country in the world, it's cheaper than the United States. How in the hell can that happen?"", 'Well, guess what? I and many others have been trying to get this done for decades, but by the time they tried—they tried and tried, but Big Pharma always was able to stop them.', ""Not this time. This time, we took on Big Pharma, and we won. Now, seniors on Medicare, instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, they're paying $35 a month. It's life-changing."", ""And it's not just good for people who need lifesaving prescriptions, it's not—it's good for the nation's budget as well. Guess what? The first round of cuts in prices that we've been able to negotiate saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Hear me? [Applause]"", ""No, no, we're not spending money. We're saving money, because we don't have to pay out an additional $160 billion for the same drug coverage. That's pretty nice, I think. Doing more for people and costing taxpayers less money to do it—that's a good objective."", ""And this bill includes the biggest investment ever not only in America, but anywhere in the world when dealing with climate change: $369 billion. And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet, it's going to create jobs—lots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs."", ""Now, let me tell you—[applause]. Now, let me tell you what one of the core principles is throughout everything I've done: Make it in America. We're beginning to make things again with American workers, American products, manufacturing in American plants. For too long, we exported jobs for cheaper labor costs abroad and imported more expensive products that weren't of a quality we needed."", ""We're not going to do that anymore. Under my plan, under Bidenomics, we're creating jobs at home and exporting products abroad. Union jobs."", ""And here's the thing: We're doing all this by cutting the deficit. The budget agreement I just negotiated cuts the deficit by $1 trillion, and we didn't give up anything of consequence."", ""That's on top of my first 2 years as—my first 2 years as President, I've cut the deficit by more than any President has in American history: $1.7 trillion cut from the deficit while doing these things. And I've been able to cut the deficit while protecting all the critical investments I just talked about, as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare from being cut."", 'You may remember, when I did the State of the Union, they started—I said did any of these guys want to cut Social Security and Medicare. And they said, ""Liar, liar!"" And so I stopped. I hadn\'t planned on it. I stopped, and I said, ""Oh, how many of you want to cut Social Security?""', 'Audience member. No one!', 'The President. And—no—no, I\'m not—no, I asked them. I asked the Republicans. [Applause] No—here, listen to this. Remember, I said, ""How many of you want it cut?""', 'And all of the sudden, the ones calling me liars was completely silent. And I said—I said: ""The spotlight is on you all now. How many of you promise not to cut Social Security?"" And they all said, ""We won\'t cut it."" Guess what? It\'s not cut. I\'d never negotiated at a State of the Union before.', 'Audience member. You called them out, Joe!', ""The President. Yes, that's a fact. [Laughter]"", ""One thing didn't get done in that budget agreement was dealing with the Tax Code. I think we all know: Nobody, including those who would do very well, but aren't super, superwealthy—nobody thinks the Tax Code is fair."", ""No, I'm serious. It's just simply not fair. [Laughter] How could it be fair when 55 of the largest corporations in America paid zero in Federal income tax on $40 billion in profit?"", 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. No—well, guess what? We need to get rid of some of these ridiculous special interest tax loopholes, like the one for Big Oil. Big Oil made $200 billion in profit last year, and they got a $30 billion tax break on top of it.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Some of the hedge fund managers and crypto traders—these things are going to change, I promise you, if I have anything to do with it. And the idea—we used to have about 750 billionaires in America. Now, they tell me it's about a thousand, because of the last administration."", 'Well, guess what? You know what—you know what percentage they pay in taxes? Eight percent. E-i-g-h-t.', 'Audience member. What do you pay, Joe?', 'The President. I pay a hell of a lot more than that, man. [Laughter] So do you.', 'And by the way, they pay at a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, than firefighters, probably anyone in this room.', 'Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe!', ""The President. It's time they paid a minimum tax. I don't mind them being billionaires. Just pay your fair share, man."", ""The bottom line is this: It's time that big corporations and the very wealthy start paying their fair share. I made a promise—and I'll keep it for next 4 years if I'm elected—that no one making under $400,000 will see a penny of their Federal taxes go up. And they haven't. I kept that promise, and I will keep it."", ""But it's about time the superwealthy start paying their fair share. So in this time—this campaign, I'm going to go to the country and ask them if they give—if they agree with me, it's time for everyone to start paying their fair share."", ""Folks, look, let me close with this. I truly believe this country is about to take off. I really believe it. Not—my word. The investment we've made in these past 3 years have the power to transform this country in the—for the next five decades."", ""And guess who's going to be at the center of the transformation? You. You. Union. [Applause] No—working people in this country."", 'In 10 years, America is going to look around and say: ""My God, look what we did. Look at the nation\'s roads, bridges, airports, at all the—all the investments."" And—who do you think they\'re going to give credit for? You, because you were the——', 'Audience member. Yeah!', ""The President. No, because you were the ones that will have done it. You're—you're going to lead the world in manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Who's going to build those fabs? Who's going to work—who's going to work in them? Union members are going to do that."", ""A huge—[applause]. A huge number of jobs we're creating won't require a college degree, but they'll pay above $100,000 a year. Who's going to get these jobs? Working folks."", ""We're doing something right now no one has thought possible. We're on the edge of a manufacturing boom in America. For the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing. I was told you can't do it here anymore. Well, I never believed it. And this Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again."", 'Audience member. Thanks, Joe! [Applause]', 'The President. No, I promise you.', 'People studying this right now are astonished at what\'s going on, a boom they never saw coming. Well, we\'re going to show them. Who do you think is going to get stamping these products ""Made in America""? You are. You are.', ""But the Republicans don't like this anymore. Most of them opposed everything I've done and most want to get rid of it all.

Let's go, Joe!"", ""The President. Because let me tell you something: If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs."", ""They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids.

We are.', ""The President. You are. No, you are. That's the God's truth. Working people in this country."", ""Look, we've got a better answer. It's time for everyone—I mean everyone, no matter how rich or powerful they are—to start paying their fair share. You've carried the country on your back.

Folks, it feels good to be home. I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband and damn proud of it. A Philly girl, a card-carrying member of her union. And, David, thank you for that introduction. And I want to thank Liz—President Liz Shuler, who's been a friend of mine for a long, long time and all of you. Folks, if I can go off script for a second here, I want to say something: You know, I've been doing this a long time, but I've never felt the sense of camaraderie and pride that I feel today in this year. I really mean it. Audience member. We love you! The President. No, no, no, no. I'm not saying—I'm not saying—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Let me—let me just say one thing very seriously: You know, I think this is the first time—and I've been around, as I said, a while—in history where, last week, every single environmental organization endorsed me. No, no, no. And this week, for the first time I'm aware of, the AFL-CIO endorsed this early, and every union as well. Because we're coming together. I look out in this crowd, and I see a lot of old friends, a lot of folks—as they say in Claymont, Delaware—who brung me to the dance. I told you when I ran for President I'd have your back. And I have. But you've had my back as well. And I'm more—excuse me for getting a little emotional—I'm more honored by your endorsement than you can imagine. Coming this early, it's going to make a gigantic difference in this campaign. You know, there are a lot of politicians in this country who can't say the word ""union."" Because you know I'm not one of them. I'm proud to say the word. I'm proud to be the most pro-union President in American history. I promised you I would be. But what I'm really proud about—what I'm really proud about—is being reelected the most pro-union President in history. Look, I want to thank Kamala for all she's doing to fight for working families. Look, folks, I've said many times: Wall Street didn't build America, you did. You did. Not a joke. I've been saying this for a long time, long before I ran for President. The middle class built this country, and you built the middle class. Electricians, carpenters, ironworkers, steelworkers, laborers, bricklayers, plumbers, pipe fitters, police officers, firefighters, educators, nurses, painters, airline workers, custodians, transit workers, steel- and metalworkers, grocery store workers, hotel workers, so many others. Audience member. Millwrights! The President. And let me tell you something—millwrights as well. [Laughter] If the investment—the investment bankers in this country—think about it—I mean, this is not a criticism of them, but if the investment bankers in this country went on strike tomorrow, no one would much notice in this room. [Laughter] No, think about this in a literal sense. But if this room didn't show up for work tomorrow or next Monday, the whole country would come to a grinding halt. So tell me—tell me—who matters more in America? Folks, I'm looking forward to this campaign. I want you to know why: because you've got a story to tell. We've got a story to tell. We've got a record to run on. And most importantly, we're not only changing this country, we're transforming it. Just think back: Remember what it was like when I came to office—we came into office. Remember the mess we inherited. The pandemic was raging. Think—I want you to really think about this. I mean this sincerely. It's not a campaign speech; it's a speech about the future of this country. The economy was reeling. Barely 3 million people had been fully vaccinated. Supply chains were broken. Businesses were shutting down. Schools were closed. You had cars—remember cars—not just old jalopies, cars—modern cars, new cars—lined up for miles and miles just to get a box of food put in the back of their car for their families. Our allies in Europe and around the world heard the last President saying our foreign policy was ""America first."" And for the first time since the Second World War, our friends began to wonder whether they could—the United States could be relied on. Now, look at where we are today. We've united NATO once more in a way it has never been united before. It's a wonder we're—[applause]. We've created 13 million new jobs since I became President. That's more jobs in little over 2 years than any President has created in one 4-year term. The unemployment rate is down to nearly a 50-year low at 3.7 percent. I've seen record lows for Black unemployment and Hispanic unemployment as well. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. And as you heard me say before: Where in God's name is it written that America can't lead the world again in manufacturing? Inflation has come down 11 months in a row and—going to continue to come down. Today, it's less than half of what it was 1 year ago. Folks, this didn't just happen. We made it happen. I came to office—— Audience member. You did it! The President. No, you guys. No, I being—I'm being sincere. You guys did. I came to office with a theory and a plan. The theory was this—— Audience members. You did it! The President. No, please listen. I mean it. I want you to listen to this one. [Laughter] It was time to end the trickle-down economics theory: You know, the wealthy do well, we all do well. Forty years of handing out excessive tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations had been a bust. Democrats as well as Republicans did it. All of it had done—all it had done was hollow out the middle class; blow up the deficit; ship jobs overseas; strip the dignity and pride and hope out of a community, one after another, all across America as the factories shut down. I'm pretty sure you saw in your home what I saw in mine. Not a lot trickled down from my parents' kitchen table when I was growing up. So we're changing. We decided to replace this theory with what the press has now called ""Bidenomics."" I don't know what the hell that is. [Laughter] But it's working. Let me tell you what it's about. It's about building an economy—literally, not figuratively—from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. Because when the middle class does well, everybody does well. [Applause] No—the poor have a way up, and the wealthy don't—do—they just do just fine. But like I said, I didn't just come into office with a theory; I came with a plan. And it started with passing the American Rescue Plan, a plan to vaccinate the Nation and get our economy going again. And that's exactly what it did. It put money in people's pockets, provided a lifetime—lifeline for businesses to stay afloat. And one study concluded that it kept 7 million people in their homes—not losing their homes. Oh, it did one more thing that matters a lot to you: It included the Butch Lewis Act to protect the pensions of millions of workers. And that was a big deal. That was a big deal. I committed to you, and we worked together. You—you—got that passed for me. It's one of the most significant achievements to union workers and retirees in over 50 years, and that's a God-natural fact. But not a single Republican in Congress voted for it, but we still got it done because of you—[applause]—because of you. Next—next—we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law because of you. We can't have the strongest economy in the world without the best infrastructure in the world. How can that be? Can you believe we used to be the best infrastructure—had the best infrastructure in the world, rated number one? But today, we rate number 13—13. Twelve other nations have better—and by the way, how in the hell can you grow an economy without an infrastructure? Not—not a joke. Under my predecessor, ""Infrastructure Week"" became a punchline. On my watch, we're making ""Infrastructure Decade"" a headline. And that's what this law is all about. It's about investing in America, in our roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water, high-speed internet, and so much more. We've already stated—started some 32,000 projects all across America. As Mayor Kenney knows, none of them are more consequential than right here at I-95 in Philly. In fact, if you go to invest.gov, you'll see a map that's going to show every single project in this country. And by the way, it creates tens of thousands of good-paying jobs with prevailing wage. And you don't need a college degree to make a decent income. You've heard me say before many times, but it sticks in my mind. My dad used to have an expression—and I swear to God this is what he would say, not a joke. He'd say: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able look at your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. We're going to make it.'"" That's what this is about. He was right, and I'm determined to make it a reality for every family in this country. But look, if I needed any reminder about how important infrastructure was in the country, I got a reminder just a few days ago right here in Philly. I visited the damaged section of I-95. We're working closely with Governor Shapiro and Senator Casey and Fetterman and Congressman Boyle and Mayor Kenney to rebuild it. I've instructed my team to prove that the old saw is wrong. I'm instructing my team to move heaven and earth to get it done. And thanks to some smart thinking and some innovative design and using materials right here in Pennsylvania, we're going to get it done in record time because it's so important to the economy not only of Philly, but the entire Northeast Corridor and every community. Third, we passed the CHIPS and Science Act. I kept saying for a long while here: We used to be on the cutting edge of science and technology. We used to invest 2 percent of our entire GDP in research and development. You know what it is now? Got down to .7 percent. And you wonder why the hell the rest of the world is catching up and, in some places, it was moving ahead. Well, America got a wakeup call with the pandemic. We didn't think much about supply chains. People wonder what the hell you talk about 5 years ago—talking about supply chains. They know now. Well, guess what? We know we can never again be so vulnerable. One key component is semiconductors—those little, tiny, small computer chips, smaller than the fingerprint—fingertip, I should say—that affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States military has. America invented these chips. But, over time, from—we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to then producing less than 10 percent. But we're turning that around. Now, the private sector—because I decided we're going to get this done—the private sector is investing a record $470 billion in advanced manufacturing right here in the United States for—as well as clean energy in America, again, creating good-paying jobs, a prevailing wage, changing people's lives. And fourth, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—[applause]—just like the VA has been able to do. You know, folks, the same drug company making the same prescription, if they—if you go to buy it in Paris, it's cheaper than the United States. Go to buy it in any major country in the world, it's cheaper than the United States. How in the hell can that happen? Well, guess what? I and many others have been trying to get this done for decades, but by the time they tried—they tried and tried, but Big Pharma always was able to stop them. Not this time. This time, we took on Big Pharma, and we won. Now, seniors on Medicare, instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, they're paying $35 a month. It's life-changing. And it's not just good for people who need lifesaving prescriptions, it's not—it's good for the nation's budget as well. Guess what? The first round of cuts in prices that we've been able to negotiate saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Hear me? [Applause] No, no, we're not spending money. We're saving money, because we don't have to pay out an additional $160 billion for the same drug coverage. That's pretty nice, I think. Doing more for people and costing taxpayers less money to do it—that's a good objective. And this bill includes the biggest investment ever not only in America, but anywhere in the world when dealing with climate change: $369 billion. And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet, it's going to create jobs—lots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. Now, let me tell you—[applause]. Now, let me tell you what one of the core principles is throughout everything I've done: Make it in America. We're beginning to make things again with American workers, American products, manufacturing in American plants. For too long, we exported jobs for cheaper labor costs abroad and imported more expensive products that weren't of a quality we needed. We're not going to do that anymore. Under my plan, under Bidenomics, we're creating jobs at home and exporting products abroad. Union jobs. And here's the thing: We're doing all this by cutting the deficit. The budget agreement I just negotiated cuts the deficit by $1 trillion, and we didn't give up anything of consequence. That's on top of my first 2 years as—my first 2 years as President, I've cut the deficit by more than any President has in American history: $1.7 trillion cut from the deficit while doing these things. And I've been able to cut the deficit while protecting all the critical investments I just talked about, as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare from being cut. You may remember, when I did the State of the Union, they started—I said did any of these guys want to cut Social Security and Medicare. And they said, ""Liar, liar!"" And so I stopped. I hadn't planned on it. I stopped, and I said, ""Oh, how many of you want to cut Social Security?"" Audience member. No one! The President. And—no—no, I'm not—no, I asked them. I asked the Republicans. [Applause] No—here, listen to this. Remember, I said, ""How many of you want it cut?"" And all of the sudden, the ones calling me liars was completely silent. And I said—I said: ""The spotlight is on you all now. How many of you promise not to cut Social Security?"" And they all said, ""We won't cut it."" Guess what? It's not cut. I'd never negotiated at a State of the Union before. Audience member. You called them out, Joe! The President. Yes, that's a fact. [Laughter] One thing didn't get done in that budget agreement was dealing with the Tax Code. I think we all know: Nobody, including those who would do very well, but aren't super, superwealthy—nobody thinks the Tax Code is fair. No, I'm serious. It's just simply not fair. [Laughter] How could it be fair when 55 of the largest corporations in America paid zero in Federal income tax on $40 billion in profit? Audience members. Boo! The President. No—well, guess what? We need to get rid of some of these ridiculous special interest tax loopholes, like the one for Big Oil. Big Oil made $200 billion in profit last year, and they got a $30 billion tax break on top of it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Some of the hedge fund managers and crypto traders—these things are going to change, I promise you, if I have anything to do with it. And the idea—we used to have about 750 billionaires in America. Now, they tell me it's about a thousand, because of the last administration. Well, guess what? You know what—you know what percentage they pay in taxes? Eight percent. E-i-g-h-t. Audience member. What do you pay, Joe? The President. I pay a hell of a lot more than that, man. [Laughter] So do you. And by the way, they pay at a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, than firefighters, probably anyone in this room. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. It's time they paid a minimum tax. I don't mind them being billionaires. Just pay your fair share, man. The bottom line is this: It's time that big corporations and the very wealthy start paying their fair share. I made a promise—and I'll keep it for next 4 years if I'm elected—that no one making under $400,000 will see a penny of their Federal taxes go up. And they haven't. I kept that promise, and I will keep it. But it's about time the superwealthy start paying their fair share. So in this time—this campaign, I'm going to go to the country and ask them if they give—if they agree with me, it's time for everyone to start paying their fair share. Folks, look, let me close with this. I truly believe this country is about to take off. I really believe it. Not—my word. The investment we've made in these past 3 years have the power to transform this country in the—for the next five decades. And guess who's going to be at the center of the transformation? You. You. Union. [Applause] No—working people in this country. In 10 years, America is going to look around and say: ""My God, look what we did. Look at the nation's roads, bridges, airports, at all the—all the investments."" And—who do you think they're going to give credit for? You, because you were the—— Audience member. Yeah! The President. No, because you were the ones that will have done it. You're—you're going to lead the world in manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Who's going to build those fabs? Who's going to work—who's going to work in them? Union members are going to do that. A huge—[applause]. A huge number of jobs we're creating won't require a college degree, but they'll pay above $100,000 a year. Who's going to get these jobs? Working folks. We're doing something right now no one has thought possible. We're on the edge of a manufacturing boom in America. For the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing. I was told you can't do it here anymore. Well, I never believed it. And this Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again. Audience member. Thanks, Joe! [Applause] The President. No, I promise you. People studying this right now are astonished at what's going on, a boom they never saw coming. Well, we're going to show them. Who do you think is going to get stamping these products ""Made in America""? You are. You are. But the Republicans don't like this anymore. Most of them opposed everything I've done and most want to get rid of it all. So we've got a fight on our hands. And my question to you is simple: Are you with me in this fight? Let me tell you something—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Because let me tell you something: If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids. And when they come back, as they did just this past week, with their trickle-down economic plan to cut taxes for the rich, who don't think—who do you think they're carrying the water for? They're trying—they've introduced a bill again to reinstate the $2 trillion tax cut of the—80 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent. Who do you think is going to start carrying the burden? Audience member. We are. The President. You are. No, you are. That's the God's truth. Working people in this country. Look, we've got a better answer. It's time for everyone—I mean everyone, no matter how rich or powerful they are—to start paying their fair share. You've carried the country on your back. You've carried long enough. It's time for millionaires and billionaires and big corporations to pay their fair share. I can get that done, but I need you badly. So are you with me? Look, I've been at this a long time. I've been at this a long time. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. I know a lot of people—it's hard to believe, but not for me, because I know the people of this country. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Keep the faith. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Hello, Philadelphia! Hello, organized labor, union labor! There's labor, and there's union labor.

People wonder what the hell you talk about 5 years ago—talking about supply chains. They know now. Well, guess what? We know we can never again be so vulnerable. One key component is semiconductors—those little, tiny, small computer chips, smaller than the fingerprint—fingertip, I should say—that affect nearly everything in our lives from cell phones, automobiles, refrigerators, the most sophisticated weapons systems the United States military has. America invented these chips. But, over time, from—we went from producing 40 percent of the world's chips to then producing less than 10 percent. But we're turning that around. Now, the private sector—because I decided we're going to get this done—the private sector is investing a record $470 billion in advanced manufacturing right here in the United States for—as well as clean energy in America, again, creating good-paying jobs, a prevailing wage, changing people's lives. And fourth, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices—[applause]—just like the VA has been able to do. You know, folks, the same drug company making the same prescription, if they—if you go to buy it in Paris, it's cheaper than the United States. Go to buy it in any major country in the world, it's cheaper than the United States. How in the hell can that happen? Well, guess what? I and many others have been trying to get this done for decades, but by the time they tried—they tried and tried, but Big Pharma always was able to stop them. Not this time. This time, we took on Big Pharma, and we won. Now, seniors on Medicare, instead of paying 400 bucks a month for insulin, they're paying $35 a month. It's life-changing. And it's not just good for people who need lifesaving prescriptions, it's not—it's good for the nation's budget as well. Guess what? The first round of cuts in prices that we've been able to negotiate saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Hear me? [Applause] No, no, we're not spending money. We're saving money, because we don't have to pay out an additional $160 billion for the same drug coverage. That's pretty nice, I think. Doing more for people and costing taxpayers less money to do it—that's a good objective. And this bill includes the biggest investment ever not only in America, but anywhere in the world when dealing with climate change: $369 billion. And the investment isn't only going to help us save the planet, it's going to create jobs—lots of jobs, tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. Now, let me tell you—[applause]. Now, let me tell you what one of the core principles is throughout everything I've done: Make it in America. We're beginning to make things again with American workers, American products, manufacturing in American plants. For too long, we exported jobs for cheaper labor costs abroad and imported more expensive products that weren't of a quality we needed. We're not going to do that anymore. Under my plan, under Bidenomics, we're creating jobs at home and exporting products abroad. Union jobs. And here's the thing: We're doing all this by cutting the deficit. The budget agreement I just negotiated cuts the deficit by $1 trillion, and we didn't give up anything of consequence. That's on top of my first 2 years as—my first 2 years as President, I've cut the deficit by more than any President has in American history: $1.7 trillion cut from the deficit while doing these things. And I've been able to cut the deficit while protecting all the critical investments I just talked about, as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare from being cut. You may remember, when I did the State of the Union, they started—I said did any of these guys want to cut Social Security and Medicare. And they said, ""Liar, liar!"" And so I stopped. I hadn't planned on it. I stopped, and I said, ""Oh, how many of you want to cut Social Security?"" Audience member. No one! The President. And—no—no, I'm not—no, I asked them. I asked the Republicans. [Applause] No—here, listen to this. Remember, I said, ""How many of you want it cut?"" And all of the sudden, the ones calling me liars was completely silent. And I said—I said: ""The spotlight is on you all now. How many of you promise not to cut Social Security?"" And they all said, ""We won't cut it."" Guess what? It's not cut. I'd never negotiated at a State of the Union before. Audience member. You called them out, Joe! The President. Yes, that's a fact. [Laughter] One thing didn't get done in that budget agreement was dealing with the Tax Code. I think we all know: Nobody, including those who would do very well, but aren't super, superwealthy—nobody thinks the Tax Code is fair. No, I'm serious. It's just simply not fair. [Laughter] How could it be fair when 55 of the largest corporations in America paid zero in Federal income tax on $40 billion in profit? Audience members. Boo! The President. No—well, guess what? We need to get rid of some of these ridiculous special interest tax loopholes, like the one for Big Oil. Big Oil made $200 billion in profit last year, and they got a $30 billion tax break on top of it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Some of the hedge fund managers and crypto traders—these things are going to change, I promise you, if I have anything to do with it. And the idea—we used to have about 750 billionaires in America. Now, they tell me it's about a thousand, because of the last administration. Well, guess what? You know what—you know what percentage they pay in taxes? Eight percent. E-i-g-h-t. Audience member. What do you pay, Joe? The President. I pay a hell of a lot more than that, man. [Laughter] So do you. And by the way, they pay at a lower tax rate than schoolteachers, than firefighters, probably anyone in this room. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. It's time they paid a minimum tax. I don't mind them being billionaires. Just pay your fair share, man. The bottom line is this: It's time that big corporations and the very wealthy start paying their fair share. I made a promise—and I'll keep it for next 4 years if I'm elected—that no one making under $400,000 will see a penny of their Federal taxes go up. And they haven't. I kept that promise, and I will keep it. But it's about time the superwealthy start paying their fair share. So in this time—this campaign, I'm going to go to the country and ask them if they give—if they agree with me, it's time for everyone to start paying their fair share. Folks, look, let me close with this. I truly believe this country is about to take off. I really believe it. Not—my word. The investment we've made in these past 3 years have the power to transform this country in the—for the next five decades. And guess who's going to be at the center of the transformation? You. You. Union. [Applause] No—working people in this country. In 10 years, America is going to look around and say: ""My God, look what we did. Look at the nation's roads, bridges, airports, at all the—all the investments."" And—who do you think they're going to give credit for? You, because you were the—— Audience member. Yeah! The President. No, because you were the ones that will have done it. You're—you're going to lead the world in manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Who's going to build those fabs? Who's going to work—who's going to work in them? Union members are going to do that. A huge—[applause]. A huge number of jobs we're creating won't require a college degree, but they'll pay above $100,000 a year. Who's going to get these jobs? Working folks. We're doing something right now no one has thought possible. We're on the edge of a manufacturing boom in America. For the longest time, we've been told to give up on American manufacturing. I was told you can't do it here anymore. Well, I never believed it. And this Nation used to lead the world in manufacturing, and we're going to do it again. Audience member. Thanks, Joe! [Applause] The President. No, I promise you. People studying this right now are astonished at what's going on, a boom they never saw coming. Well, we're going to show them. Who do you think is going to get stamping these products ""Made in America""? You are. You are. But the Republicans don't like this anymore. Most of them opposed everything I've done and most want to get rid of it all. So we've got a fight on our hands. And my question to you is simple: Are you with me in this fight? Let me tell you something—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Because let me tell you something: If Republicans come after what I've done, when they come back to try to get rid of all these clean energy investments and they try to stop the plan on infrastructure, when they try to do these things, guess what? They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your jobs. They're coming for your future. They're coming for the future we're building for your kids and your grandkids. And when they come back, as they did just this past week, with their trickle-down economic plan to cut taxes for the rich, who don't think—who do you think they're carrying the water for? They're trying—they've introduced a bill again to reinstate the $2 trillion tax cut of the—80 percent of which goes to the top 1 percent. Who do you think is going to start carrying the burden? Audience member. We are. The President. You are. No, you are. That's the God's truth. Working people in this country. Look, we've got a better answer. It's time for everyone—I mean everyone, no matter how rich or powerful they are—to start paying their fair share. You've carried the country on your back. You've carried long enough. It's time for millionaires and billionaires and big corporations to pay their fair share. I can get that done, but I need you badly. So are you with me? Look, I've been at this a long time. I've been at this a long time. I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future. I know a lot of people—it's hard to believe, but not for me, because I know the people of this country. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. There's nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity. Nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. God bless you all. May God protect our troops. Keep the faith. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['hello', 'philadelphia', 'hello', 'organized', 'labor', 'union', 'labor', 'theres', 'labor', 'theres', 'union', 'labor', 'folks', 'feels', 'home', 'im', 'joe',

A record 81 million people voted for my candidacy and to end his Presidency. Trump lost the popular vote by 7 million. Trump's claims about the 2020 election never could stand up in court. Trump lost 60 court cases—60. Trump lost the Republican-controlled States. Trump lost before a Trump-appointed judge—and then judges. And Trump lost before the United States Supreme Court. All of it, he lost. Trump lost recount after recount after recount in State after State. But in desperation and weakness, Trump and his MAGA followers went after election officials—who ensured your power as a citizen would be heard. These public servants had their lives forever upended by attacks and death threats for simply doing their jobs. In Atlanta, Georgia, a brave Black mother and her daughter, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, were doing their jobs as election workers until Donald Trump and his MAGA followers targeted and threatened them, forcing them from their homes and unleashing racist vitriol on them. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was just hit with $148 million judgment for cruelty and defamation that he inflicted against them. Other State and local elected officials across the country faced similar personal attacks. In addition, Fox News agreed to pay a record eight—$787 million for the lies they told about voter fraud. Let's be clear about the 2020 election. Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election—every one. But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth: that I had won the election and he was a loser. Well, knowing how his mind works now, he had one—he had one act left—one desperate act available to him: the violence of January the 6th. And since that day, more than 1,200 people have been charged for their assault on the Capitol. Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or pled guilty. Collectively, to date, they have been sentenced to more than 840 years in prison. And what's Trump done? Instead of calling them ""criminals,"" he's called these insurrectionists ""patriots."" They're ""patriots."" And he promised to pardon them if he returns to office. Trump said that there was ""a lot of love"" on January the 6th. The rest of the Nation, including law enforcement, saw a lot of hate and violence. One Capitol police officer called it a ""medieval battle."" That same officer called vile—was called vile, racist names. He said he was more afraid in the Capitol of the United States of America, in the Chambers, than when he was fighting as a soldier in the war in Iraq. He said he was more afraid inside the halls of Congress than fighting in the war in Iraq. In trying to rewrite the facts of January 6, Trump is trying to steal history the same way he tried to steal the election. But he—we knew the truth because we saw it with our own eyes. It wasn't like something—a story being told. It was on television repeatedly. We saw it with our own eyes. Trump's mob wasn't a peaceful protest. It was a violent assault. They were insurrectionists, not patriots. They weren't there to uphold the Constitution, they were there to destroy the Constitution. Trump won't do what an American President must do. He refuses to denounce political violence. So hear me clearly. I'll say what Donald Trump won't. Political violence is never, ever acceptable in the United States political system—never, never, never. It has no place in a democracy. None. You can't be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. You know, Trump and his MAGA supporters not only embrace political violence, but they laugh about it. At his rally, he jokes about an intruder, whipped up by the Big Trump Lie, taking a hammer to Paul Pelosi's skull and echoing the very same words used on January 6: ""Where's Nancy?"" And he thinks that's funny. He laughed about it. What a sick—[laughter]. My God. I think it's despicable, seriously, not just for a President, for any person to say that. But to say it to the whole world listening. When I was overseas—anyway. [Laughter] Oh, my God! Trump's assault on democracy isn't just part of his past. It's what he's promising for the future. He's being straightforward. He's not hiding the ball. His first rally for the 2024 campaign opened with a choir of January 6 insurrectionists singing from prison on a cell phone while images of the January 6 riot played on a big screen behind him at his rally. Can you believe that? This is like something out of a fairy tale, a bad fairy tale. Trump began his 2024 campaign by glorifying the failed violent insurrectionist—insurrection at our—on our Capitol. The guy who claims law and order sows lawlessness and disorder. Trump's not concerned about your future, I promise you. Trump is now promising a full-scale campaign of ""revenge"" and ""retribution""—his words—for some years to come. They were his words, not mine. He went on to say he would be a dictator on day one. I mean, if I were writing a book of fiction and I said an American President said that, and not in jest. He called it, and I quote, the termination—quote—this is a quote—the ""termination of all the rules, regulation, and articles, even those found in the U.S. Constitution,"" should be terminated, if it's his will. It's really kind of hard to believe. Even found in the Constitution, he could terminate? He's threatened the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the death penalty. Says he should be put to death because the Chairman put his oath to the Constitution ahead of his personal loyalty to Trump. This coming from a President who called—when he visited a cemetery, called dead soldiers ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Remember that? Sometimes, I'm really happy the Irish in me can't be seen. [Laughter] It was right around the time I was at Beau's grave, Tommy. How dare he? Who in God's name does he think he is? With former aides, Trump plans to invoke the—Insurrectionist Act—the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy—which he's not allowed to do in ordinary circumstances—allow him to deploy U.S. military forces on the streets of America. He said it. He calls those who oppose him ""vermin."" He talks about the blood of Americans being poisoned, echoing the same exact language used in Nazi Germany. He proudly posts on social media the words that best describe his 2024 campaign, quote, ""revenge""; quote, ""power""; and, quote, ""dictatorship."" There's no confusion about who Trump is and what he intends to do. I placed my hand on our family Bible, and I swore an oath on the very same steps of the Capitol just 14 days after the attack on January the 6th. As I looked out over the capital city, whose streets were lined with National Guard to prevent another attack, I saw an American that had been pushed to the brink—an America that had been pushed to the brink. But I felt enormous pride—not in winning. I felt enormous pride in America because American democracy had been tested and American democracy had held together. And when Trump had seen weakness in our democracy and continues to talk about it, I saw strength—your strength. It's not hyperbole. Your strength. Your integrity. American strength and integrity. Ordinary citizens, State election officials, the American judicial system had put the Constitution first and sometimes at their peril—at their peril. Because of them, because of you, the will of the people prevailed, not the anger of the mob or the appetites of one man. When the attack on January 6 happened, there was no doubt about the truth. At the time, even Republican Members of Congress and Fox News commentators publicly and privately condemned the attack. As one Republican Senator said, ""Trump's behavior was embarrassing and humiliating for the country."" But now that same Senator and those same people have changed their tune. As time has go one—gone on, politics, fear, money, all have intervened. And now these MAGA voices who know the truth about Trump on January 6 have abandoned the truth and abandoned democracy. They made their choice. Now the rest of us—Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans—we have to make our choice. I know mine. And I believe I know America's. We will defend the truth, not give in to the ""big lie."" We'll embrace the Constitution and the Declaration, not abandon it. We'll honor the sacred cause of democracy, not walk away from it. Today I make this sacred pledge to you. The defense, protection, and preservation of American democracy will remain, as it has been, the central cause of my Presidency. America, as we begin this election year, we must be clear: Democracy is on the ballot. Your freedom is on the ballot. Yes, we'll be voting on many issues: on the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, on the freedom of choice, the freedom to have a fair shot, the freedom from fear. And we'll debate and disagree. Without democracy, no progress is possible. Think about it. The alternative to democracy is dictatorship, the rule of one, not the rule of ""We the People."" That's what the soldiers of Valley Forge understood. And so was me—was what we have to understand it as well. We've been blessed so long with a strong, stable democracy. It's easy to forget why so many before us risked their lives and strengthened democracy, what our lives would be without it. Democracy means having the freedom to speak your mind, to be who you are, to be who you want to be. Democracy is about being able to bring about peaceful change. Democracy—democracy—is how we've opened the doors of opportunity wider and wider with each successive generation, notwithstanding our mistakes. But if democracy falls, we'll lose that freedom. We'll lose the power of ""We the People"" to shape our destiny. And if you doubt me, look around the world. Travel with me as I meet with other heads of state throughout the world. Look at the authoritarian leaders and dictators Trump says he admires—he, out loud, says he admires. I won't go through them all. It would take too long. Look, remember how he refers—when he—refers to what he calls the ""love letter"" exchanges between he and the dictator of North Korea? Those women and men out there in the audience who ever fought for the American military, would you ever believe you'd hear a President say something like that? His admiration for Putin—I could go on. And look at what these autocrats are doing to limit freedom in their countries. They're limiting freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom to assemble, women's rights, LGBQ [LGBTQ; White House correction] rights, people who are going to jail, so much more. It's true: The push and pull of American history is not a fairy tale. Every stride forward in America is met with a ferocious backlash, many times from those who fear progress and those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain; from those who traffic in lies told for power and profit; from those who are driven by grievance and grift, consumed by conspiracy and victimhood; from those who seek to bury history and ban books. Did you ever think you'd be at a political event talking about book banning for a Presidential—in a Presidential election? The choice and contest between those forces—those competing forces—between solidarity and division—is perennial. But this time, it's so different. You can't have a contest—you can't have a contest—if you see politics as an all-out war instead of a peaceful way to resolve our differences. All-out war is what Trump wants. That's why he doesn't understand the most fundamental truth about this country. Unlike other nations on Earth, America is not built on ethnicity, religion, geography. We're the only Nation in the history of the world built on an idea—not hyperbole—built on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal. It's an idea declared in the Declaration, created in a way that we viewed everybody as equal and be—should be treated equally throughout their lives. We've never fully lived up to that. We have a long way to go. But we've never walked away from the idea. We've never walked away from it before. I promise you, I will not let Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans force us to walk away now. We're living in an era where a determined minority is doing everything in its power to try to destroy our democracy for their own agenda. The American people know it, and they're standing bravely in the breach. Remember, after 2020, January 6 insurrection to undo the election in which more Americans had voted than any other in American history? America saw the threat posed to the country, and they voted him out. In 2022, historic midterm election, in State after State, election after election, the election deniers were defeated. Now, in 2024, Trump is running as the ""denier in chief""—the election denier in chief. Once again, he's saying he won't honor the results of the election if he loses. Trump says he doesn't understand. Well, he still doesn't understand the basic truth, and that is, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your country only when you win. So I'll keep my commitment to be President for all of America, whether you voted for me or not. I've done it for the last 3 years, and I'll continue to do it. Together, we can keep proving that America is still a country that believes in decency, dignity, honesty, honor, truth. We still believe that no one, not even the President, is above the law. We still believe—the vast majority of us still believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at making it. We're still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. I'll tell you, from my experience working with leaders around the world—and I mean this sincerely, not a joke—that America is still viewed as the beacon of democracy for the world. I can't tell you how many—how many world leaders—and I know all of them, virtually all of them—grab my arm in private and say: ""He can't win. Tell me. No, my country will be at risk."" Think of how many countries, Tommy, you know that are on the—on the edge. Imagine. We still believe in ""We the People,"" and that includes all of us, not some of us. Let me close with this. On that cold winter of 1777, George Washington and his American troops at Valley Forge waged a battle on behalf of a revolutionary idea that everyday people—like where I come from and the vast majority of you—not a king or a dictator—that everyday people can govern themselves without a king or a dictator. In fact, in the Rotunda of the Capitol, there's a giant painting of General George Washington—not President Washington—and he is resigning his commission as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. A European king at this—at the time said, after he won the revolution, ""Now is the time for him to declare his kingship."" But instead, the mob that attacked the Capitol, waving Trump flags and Confederate flags, stormed right past that portrait. That image of George Washington gave them no pause, but it should have. The artist who painted that portrait memorialized that moment because he said it was, quote, ""one of the highest moral lessons ever given to the world."" End of quote. George Washington was at the height of his power. Having just defeated the most powerful empire on Earth, could have held onto the power as long as he wanted. He could have made himself not a future President but a future monarch, in effect. And by the way, when he got elected President, he could have stayed for two, three, four, five terms, until he died. But that wasn't the America he and the American troops at Valley Forge had fought for. In America, genuine leaders—democratic leaders, with a small ""d""—don't hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people. And they do it willingly, because that's the deal. You do your duty. You serve your country. And ours is a country worthy of service, as many Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have shown over the years. We're not perfect. But at our best, we face on—we face head on the good, the bad, the truth of who we are. We look in the mirror and ultimately never pretend we're something we're not. That's what great nations do. And we're a great nation. We're the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. We really are. That's the America I see in our future. We get up. We carry on. We never bow. We never bend. We speak of possibilities, not carnage. We're not weighed down by grievances. We don't foster fear. We don't walk around as victims. We take charge of our destiny. We get our job done with our people—the help of the people we find in America, who find their place in the changing world and dream and build a future that not only they, but all people deserve a shot at. We don't believe—none of you believe America is failing. We know America is winning. That's American patriotism. And it's not winning because of Joe Biden. It's winning. This is the first national election since January 6 insurrection placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy—since that moment. We all know who Donald Trump is. The question we have to answer is: Who are we? That's what's at stake. Who are we? In the year ahead, as you talk to your family and friends, cast your ballots, the power is in your hands. After all we've been through in our history, from independence to Civil War to two World Wars to a pandemic to insurrection, I refuse to believe that, in 2024, we Americans will choose to walk away from what's made us the greatest nation in the history of the world: freedom, liberty. Democracy is still a sacred cause. And there's no country in the world better positioned to lead the world than America. And that's why—I've said it many times. That's why I've never been more optimistic about our future. And I've been doing this a hell of a long time. [Laughter] Just have to remember who we are—with patience and fortitude, with one heart. We are the United States of America, for God's sake. I mean it. There is nothing—I believe with every fiber that there is nothing beyond our capacity if we act together and decently with one another. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I mean it. We're the only Nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into that crisis. That was true yesterday and it's true today, and I guarantee you will be true tomorrow. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. [At this point, the First Lady joined the President on stage.] I understand power. [Laughter] Thank you all so very much. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Audience member. Four more years! The President. [Laughter] Well, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Please. Thank you very, very much. Today—the topic of my speech today is deadly serious, and I think it needs to be made at the outset of this campaign. In the winter of 1777, it was harsh and cold as the Continental Army marched to Valley Forge. General George Washington knew he faced the most daunting of tasks: to fight and win a war against the most powerful empire that existed in the world at the time. His mission was clear. Liberty, not conquest. Freedom, not domination. National independence, not individual glory. America made a vow. Never again would we bow down to a king. Months ahead would be incredibly difficult. But General Washington knew something in his bones, something about the spirit of the troops he was leading, something—something—about the soul of the nation he [that; White House correction] was struggling to be born. In his general order, he predicted, and I quote, ""with one heart and one mind,"" ""with fortitude and with patience,"" they would overcome every difficulty, the troops he was leading. And they did. They did. This army that lacked blankets and food, clothes and shoes. This army whose march left bloody, bare footprints in the snow. This ragtag army made up of ordinary people. Their mission, George Washington declared, was nothing less than ""a sacred cause."" That was the phrase used: ""a sacred cause."" Freedom, liberty, democracy. American democracy. I just visited the grounds of Valley Forge. I've been there a number of times from the time I was a Boy Scout years ago. You know, it's the very site that I think every American should visit because it tells the story of the pain and the suffering and the true patriotism it took to make America. Today we gather in a new year, some 246 years later, just 1 day before January 6, a day forever seared in our memory because it was on that day that we nearly lost America—lost it all. Today we're here to answer the most important of questions. Is democracy still America's sacred cause? Audience member. Yes! The President. I mean it. This is not rhetorical, academic, or hypothetical. Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time, and it's what the 2024 election is all about. The choice is clear. Donald Trump's campaign is about him, not America, not you. Donald Trump's campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He's willing to sacrifice our democracy, put himself in power. Our campaign is different. For me and Kamala, our campaign is about America. It's about you. It's about every age and background that occupy this country. It's about the future we're going to continue to build together. And our campaign is about preserving and strengthening our American democracy. Three years ago tomorrow, we saw with our own eyes the violent mob storm the United States Capitol. It was almost in disbelief as you first turned on the television. For the first time in our history, insurrectionists had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power in America—first time—smashing windows, shattering doors, attacking the police. Outside, gallows were erected as the MAGA crowd chanted, ""Hang Mike Pence."" Inside, they hunted for Speaker Pelosi [of; White House correction] the House, was chanting, as they marched through and smashed windows, ""Where's Nancy?"" Over 140 police officers were injured. Jill and I attended the funeral of police officers who died as a result of the events of that day. And because Donald—because of Donald Trump's lies, they died because these lies brought a mob to Washington. He promised it would be ""wild,"" and it was. He told the crowd to ""fight like hell,"" and all hell was unleashed. He promised he would right them—right them. Everything they did, he would be side by side with them. Then, as usual, he left the dirty work to others. He retreated to the White House. As America was attacked from within, Donald Trump watched on TV in the private small dining room off my Oval—off the Oval Office. The entire nation watched in horror. The whole world watched in disbelief. And Trump did nothing. Members of his staff, members of his family, Republican leaders who were under attack for the—at that very moment pled with him: ""Act. Call off the mob."" Imagine had he gone out and said, ""Stop."" And still, Trump did nothing. It was among the worst derelictions of duty by a President in American history: an attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence. A record 81 million people voted for my candidacy and to end his Presidency. Trump lost the popular vote by 7 million. Trump's claims about the 2020 election never could stand up in court. Trump lost 60 court cases—60. Trump lost the Republican-controlled States. Trump lost before a Trump-appointed judge—and then judges. And Trump lost before the United States Supreme Court. All of it, he lost. Trump lost recount after recount after recount in State after State. But in desperation and weakness, Trump and his MAGA followers went after election officials—who ensured your power as a citizen would be heard. These public servants had their lives forever upended by attacks and death threats for simply doing their jobs. In Atlanta, Georgia, a brave Black mother and her daughter, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, were doing their jobs as election workers until Donald Trump and his MAGA followers targeted and threatened them, forcing them from their homes and unleashing racist vitriol on them.

Other State and local elected officials across the country faced similar personal attacks. In addition, Fox News agreed to pay a record eight—$787 million for the lies they told about voter fraud. Let's be clear about the 2020 election. Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election—every one. But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth: that I had won the election and he was a loser. Well, knowing how his mind works now, he had one—he had one act left—one desperate act available to him: the violence of January the 6th. And since that day, more than 1,200 people have been charged for their assault on the Capitol. Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or pled guilty. Collectively, to date, they have been sentenced to more than 840 years in prison. And what's Trump done? Instead of calling them ""criminals,"" he's called these insurrectionists ""patriots.""

The rest of the Nation, including law enforcement, saw a lot of hate and violence. One Capitol police officer called it a ""medieval battle."" That same officer called vile—was called vile, racist names.

Look at the authoritarian leaders and dictators Trump says he admires—he, out loud, says he admires. I won't go through them all. It would take too long. Look, remember how he refers—when he—refers to what he calls the ""love letter"" exchanges between he and the dictator of North Korea? Those women and men out there in the audience who ever fought for the American military, would you ever believe you'd hear a President say something like that? His admiration for Putin—I could go on. And look at what these autocrats are doing to limit freedom in their countries. They're limiting freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom to assemble, women's rights, LGBQ [LGBTQ; White House correction] rights, people who are going to jail, so much more. It's true: The push and pull of American history is not a fairy tale. Every stride forward in America is met with a ferocious backlash, many times from those who fear progress and those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain; from those who traffic in lies told for power and profit; from those who are driven by grievance and grift, consumed by conspiracy and victimhood; from those who seek to bury history and ban books. Did you ever think you'd be at a political event talking about book banning for a Presidential—in a Presidential election? The choice and contest between those forces—those competing forces—between solidarity and division—is perennial. But this time, it's so different. You can't have a contest—you can't have a contest—if you see politics as an all-out war instead of a peaceful way to resolve our differences. All-out war is what Trump wants. That's why he doesn't understand the most fundamental truth about this country. Unlike other nations on Earth, America is not built on ethnicity, religion, geography. We're the only Nation in the history of the world built on an idea—not hyperbole—built on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal. It's an idea declared in the Declaration, created in a way that we viewed everybody as equal and be—should be treated equally throughout their lives. We've never fully lived up to that. We have a long way to go. But we've never walked away from the idea. We've never walked away from it before. I promise you, I will not let Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans force us to walk away now. We're living in an era where a determined minority is doing everything in its power to try to destroy our democracy for their own agenda. The American people know it, and they're standing bravely in the breach. Remember, after 2020, January 6 insurrection to undo the election in which more Americans had voted than any other in American history? America saw the threat posed to the country, and they voted him out. In 2022, historic midterm election, in State after State, election after election, the election deniers were defeated. Now, in 2024, Trump is running as the ""denier in chief""—the election denier in chief. Once again, he's saying he won't honor the results of the election if he loses. Trump says he doesn't understand. Well, he still doesn't understand the basic truth, and that is, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your country only when you win. So I'll keep my commitment to be President for all of America, whether you voted for me or not. I've done it for the last 3 years, and I'll continue to do it. Together, we can keep proving that America is still a country that believes in decency, dignity, honesty, honor, truth. We still believe that no one, not even the President, is above the law. We still believe—the vast majority of us still believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at making it. We're still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. I'll tell you, from my experience working with leaders around the world—and I mean this sincerely, not a joke—that America is still viewed as the beacon of democracy for the world. I can't tell you how many—how many world leaders—and I know all of them, virtually all of them—grab my arm in private and say: ""He can't win. Tell me. No, my country will be at risk."" Think of how many countries, Tommy, you know that are on the—on the edge. Imagine. We still believe in ""We the People,"" and that includes all of us, not some of us. Let me close with this. On that cold winter of 1777, George Washington and his American troops at Valley Forge waged a battle on behalf of a revolutionary idea that everyday people—like where I come from and the vast majority of you—not a king or a dictator—that everyday people can govern themselves without a king or a dictator. In fact, in the Rotunda of the Capitol, there's a giant painting of General George Washington—not President Washington—and he is resigning his commission as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. A European king at this—at the time said, after he won the revolution, ""Now is the time for him to declare his kingship."" But instead, the mob that attacked the Capitol, waving Trump flags and Confederate flags, stormed right past that portrait. That image of George Washington gave them no pause, but it should have. The artist who painted that portrait memorialized that moment because he said it was, quote, ""one of the highest moral lessons ever given to the world."" End of quote. George Washington was at the height of his power. Having just defeated the most powerful empire on Earth, could have held onto the power as long as he wanted. He could have made himself not a future President but a future monarch, in effect. And by the way, when he got elected President, he could have stayed for two, three, four, five terms, until he died. But that wasn't the America he and the American troops at Valley Forge had fought for. In America, genuine leaders—democratic leaders, with a small ""d""—don't hold on to power relentlessly. Our leaders return power to the people. And they do it willingly, because that's the deal. You do your duty. You serve your country. And ours is a country worthy of service, as many Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents have shown over the years. We're not perfect. But at our best, we face on—we face head on the good, the bad, the truth of who we are. We look in the mirror and ultimately never pretend we're something we're not. That's what great nations do. And we're a great nation. We're the greatest nation on the face of the Earth. We really are. That's the America I see in our future. We get up. We carry on. We never bow. We never bend. We speak of possibilities, not carnage. We're not weighed down by grievances. We don't foster fear. We don't walk around as victims. We take charge of our destiny. We get our job done with our people—the help of the people we find in America, who find their place in the changing world and dream and build a future that not only they, but all people deserve a shot at. We don't believe—none of you believe America is failing. We know America is winning. That's American patriotism. And it's not winning because of Joe Biden. It's winning. This is the first national election since January 6 insurrection placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy—since that moment. We all know who Donald Trump is. The question we have to answer is: Who are we? That's what's at stake. Who are we? In the year ahead, as you talk to your family and friends, cast your ballots, the power is in your hands. After all we've been through in our history, from independence to Civil War to two World Wars to a pandemic to insurrection, I refuse to believe that, in 2024, we Americans will choose to walk away from what's made us the greatest nation in the history of the world: freedom, liberty. Democracy is still a sacred cause. And there's no country in the world better positioned to lead the world than America. And that's why—I've said it many times. That's why I've never been more optimistic about our future. And I've been doing this a hell of a long time. [Laughter] Just have to remember who we are—with patience and fortitude, with one heart. We are the United States of America, for God's sake. I mean it. There is nothing—I believe with every fiber that there is nothing beyond our capacity if we act together and decently with one another. Nothing, nothing, nothing. I mean it. We're the only Nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into that crisis. That was true yesterday and it's true today, and I guarantee you will be true tomorrow. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. [At this point, the First Lady joined the President on stage.] I understand power. [Laughter] Thank you all so very much. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['audience', 'member', 'four', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'please', 'please', 'topic', 'speech', 'deadly', 'serious', 'needs', 'made', 'outset',

There is no negotiation about that. Now—now—we're living in an era of a second lost cause. Once again, there are some in this country trying—trying—to turn a loss into a lie, a lie, which if allowed to live, will once again bring terrible damage to this country. This time, the lie is about the 2020 election, the election in which you made your voices heard and your power known. Just 2 days ago, we marked the third anniversary of the dark—one of the darkest days in American history: January the 6th, the day in which insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol, trying for the first time in American history to stop the peaceful transfer of power in the country. We all saw with our own eyes the truth of what happened. That violent mob was whipped up by lies from a defeated former President—smashing windows, smearing blood on statues, ransacking offices. Outside, insurrectionists erected gallows, chanting ""Hang Mike Pence."" Inside, they hunted for Nancy Pelosi, chanting ""Where's Nancy?"" We saw something on January 6 we'd never seen before, even during the Civil War. Insurrectionists waving Confederate flags inside the halls of Congress built by enslaved Americans. A mob attacked and called Black officers, Black veterans defending the Nation those vile of racist names. And yet an extreme movement of America, the MAGA Republicans, led by a defeated President, is trying to steal history now. They tried to steal an election. Now they're trying to steal history, telling us that violent mob was, and I quote, ""a peaceful protest."" That that insurrection—those insurrectionists were—these are his words—""patriots."" That there was, quote, ""a lot of love that day."" In fact, the rest of the Nation and the world saw a lot of hate and violence. For hours, the defeated former President sat in the private dining room off of my—off of the Oval Office and did nothing, nothing—absolutely nothing. His actions were among the worst derelictions of duty by any President in American history. An attempt—[applause]. An attempt to overturn a free and fair election by force and violence. Let me say what others cannot. We must reject political violence in America. Always—not sometimes, always. It's never appropriate. The violence of January 6 was an extension of an old playbook from the—from the threats and violence and intimidation. In Atlanta, Georgia, two brave Black women, mother and daughter—Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss—they had their lives upended just doing their jobs—menacing calls, death threats, forcing them to literally flee their homes. Those pushing the ""big lie"" have a conspiracy theory among conspiracy theories that outweighs them all that there's what—and—but here is the fact. There is where we don't have facts—their whole theory has no facts, has no proof, has no evidence. That's why, time and again, they lost in every court of law that challenged the results—60 losses in courts of America. There's one thing they don't have. They don't have respect for the 81 million people who voted the other way—voted for my candidacy—and voted to end the Presidency. In their world, these Americans, including you, don't count. But that's not the real world. That's not democracy. That's not America. In America, we all count. In America, we witness to serve all those who, in fact, participate. And losers are taught to concede when they lose. And he's a loser. Then we all came together to put the country before ourselves. The lies that led to January 6 are part of a broader attack on the truth America today that we all have seen before. The same movement that, throughout the mob at the United States Capitol, isn't just trying to rewrite history of January 6, they're trying to determine to erase history and your future: banning books; denying your right to vote and have it counted; destroying diversity, equality, inclusion all across America; harboring hate and replacing hope with anger and resentment and a dangerous view of America. That narrow view of America, a zero-sum view of America that says: ""If you win, I lose. If you succeed, it must be, I failed. If you get ahead, I fall behind."" And maybe worst of all, ""If I hold you down, I lift myself up."" That's not new in America. Every stride forward has often been met with ferocious backlashes from those who fear the progress, from those who exploit that fear for their own personal gain, from those who traffic in lies told for profit and power. But here in Charleston, you know the power of truth. Less than a mile from here was once a port where almost half of all enslaved Africans were trafficked to North America and forced on our shores. And now you have a world-class museum there to tell the truth about the original sin. And it matters. And I want to thank former Mayor Jim [Joe; White House correction] Riley for his leadership, who saw to it the museum was built, and for all of you who made that happen. And with your help, I made Juneteenth the first Federal holiday since Dr. Martin Luther King's Day. [The President picked up a handheld microphone.] This works? Why? Because the truth matters. The truth matters. With your help, we established the national monument—monument in honor of Mamie and Emmett Till because we heard Mrs. Till's call—the mother of a 14-year-old son who was lynched and whose body was mutilated, but the mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral because she said, ""Let the world see what I saw."" The truth matters. It always matters. We can't just to learn—choose to learn what we want to know and not what we should know. We should know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are. That's what great nations do, and we're a great nation, the greatest of all nations. We're not perfect. But at our best, we learn from our past, and we look to the future. A nation continuously striving to be a more perfect Union. I'm here to speak to another truth. It's because of this congregation and the Black community of South Carolina and—not an exaggeration—and Jim Clyburn that I stand here today as your President—because of all of you. That's a fact. [Applause] That's a fact. And I owe you. Audience member. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. And I've done my best to honor your trust. That means rejecting the small, narrow, cramped view of America as well as lifting up a bigger and broader view of America that holds that: ""If you do well, I do well. We all do well."" We all do well if every race and background in small towns and big cities is doing better; when our freedoms are protected and we deny hate as a safe harbor; where everyone has a fair shot at a life of dignity and opportunity; and where our democracy works for everybody. That benefits everybody. I don't get these guys. Everybody does better, even those folks who disagree with us. And I'm keeping my commitment to you. That's the America we're building together. Instead of erasing history, we're making history. And it starts—[applause]. And it starts with an administration I committed to—I said my administration would look like America and taps into our full talents and strengths as a nation, starting with our incredible Vice President, Kamala Harris. When we came to office, the country was in a depth of a pandemic which we lost over a million 200,000 people, so we moved heaven and earth to get the country vaccinated, saving countless lives. With the economy on the brink, we spent—we sent $1,400 checks into the pockets of people who are hurting badly, keep them going. I said we'd invest in all of America—all America—and we are. The results are clear: over 14 million new jobs, record economic growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world. But we have more to do. We see this progress for all Americans. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate recorded in a long, long time. More Blacks, Americans have health insurance than ever, bringing peace of mind and dignity to their lives. I remember when I was a kid. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And my headboard in my room was up against—it was a little split-level home. It was a—we weren't poor. We were—anyway, we weren't—we sure weren't worth—the wealthy. And I remember really, one night, hearing my dad was restless, because the headboard was along my headboard, on the other side of the wall. And I asked my mom the next morning, I said, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said, ""Honey, his employer just told him they're dropping health insurance."" What that does is, it deprives a man and a woman of their dignity. How do you look at your child and say: ""I can't cover you. I can't take care of you."" And now, as Jim pointed out at one point—I won't go into it like I was going to because he said it better—instead of about an average of $400 a month for insulin for seniors with diabetes, we're now paying $35 a month. And by the way, they're still making a profit three times. It costs $10 to make it. And I've been trying to take on—as a couple of you in the audience know from my entire career—Big Pharma. Finally beat them. Finally, finally, finally. And we're going to go back and make sure that Medicare can negotiate prices for everybody, not just for seniors. Again, it saves the American taxpayers billions of dollars not having to pay Pharma for these things. You know, we're growing back—Black wealth, and we have a lot more to do. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years under my watch. More Black small businesses starting up than in decades in the ultimate act—opening a new business is the ultimate act of hope. We're taking on housing discrimination in many ways. So a home owned by—today, a home owned by a Black family on one side of a highway, built by the same builder on the other side of the highway and a White guy living in it, the White guy's home is valued more than the Black guy's. No, I know you know it. But guess what? That's how you build generational wealth, when you build your home. Kamala and I are leading the charge of—mainly Kamala—to protect the freedom to vote and that vote—that be counted. Defending your freedom to choose. We're keeping our commitment of providing incredible opportunities, making historic investments in HBCUs: $7 billion—$7 billion. They're just as good as other universities, just only that they don't have the billionaire contributors, so they can't put the laboratories together to get the contracts to be the ones that design new aircraft carrier decks, being the ones to design—what's changing—it's changing. Providing people a real shot by reducing the burden of student debt—Jim went into it; I won't go into it as I was going to—$132 billion [million; White House correction], 3.6 million people—a significant percentage of those students are African American students—despite our friends on the other side of the table, the Supreme Court did [doing; White House correction] everything we [they; White House correction] can to stop me. Replacing every lead pipe in America. You know how many—not just some. Every single lead pipe in America is going to be taken out and replaced with a—[inaudible]. Why? Because in mostly poor neighborhoods, that's where those lead pipes are. And that's why kids end up with brain damage because of the lead. There's so—I'm not going to go into it. But look, you can turn on a faucet for your child and doesn't get sick from drinking water in their—coming into the home. Delivering high-speed internet that's affordable for everybody—everybody—so you don't have to sit in the McDonald's parking lot for your child to do their homework. Producing clean energy so you can finally breathe clean air without leaving home. Look, I understand it. When we moved from Scranton—I was raised in Claymont, Delaware. More major refineries than any place, including Houston, Texas, and just across the border in Chester. Not a joke. I grew up with asthma, and most of us did, because of the prevailing winds. We'd go—my mom would drive us to school in the morning when I was young—grade school—turn on—when there was a frost, turn on the windshield wipers, there would be an oil slick on the wiper. Because guess what? It's all the fenceline communities who get hurt. Not on my watch. It's changing. We know there's more to do: making childcare and eldercare more affordable, which would save American taxpayers billions of dollars along the way. Early in my administration, we were out—we cut child poverty in half—child poverty—Black child poverty in half by getting families checks every month through the childcare tax credit. And the other side had—went ahead and blocked it. But we're going to get it back. This—[applause]. Look, this fight isn't over. We're going to come back. Because no child in America should ever go to bed hungry, period, period, period, period. After the historic movement for justice in the summer of 2020, I signed the most significant police reform Executive order in history. We didn't get the law passed, but guess what? I did it by Executive order, a significant part of it. But now Congress has to step up and ask and get it—do what I did and make it the law of the land. Just a few days ago, the defeated former President was asked about the recent shooting in Iowa. Did you hear this one? I'm—it's hard to believe. You know what his response was, all those kids dead? We ""have to get over it,"" end of quote. I promise you—— [The President made the sign of the cross.] We ""have to get over it."" My response is: We have to stop it so your children, your family, your friends can leave your home, walk the streets, go to stores, go to the grocery store, and go to church, to be safe from gun violence. There's no excuse for this carnage. We have to ban assault weapons. I did it once before, and I'm going to come back again and do it. Ban high-capacity magazines. We have to pass a—universal background checks. It doesn't violate the Second Amendment. It's common sense, and it saves lives. I'm determined to continue to deliver on equal justice under the law. I made a commitment to you to nominate the first Black woman—and Jim has already talked about it—on the Supreme Court. And by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] Whoa. Her name is Ketanji Brown Jackson. Well, guess what? She knows what she's doing. And by the way, as Jim pointed out, more Black women have been appointed to the Federal Circuit Courts than every other President in American history has appointed, every single, solitary one counted. And we're going to keep going. Look, I want to make it clear: You all made this possible because of your voice. Your voice was heard in shaping your destiny. That's democracy. And I'm proud to have led the effort to make sure your voice, the South Carolina voice, will always be heard, because now you're first in the primary. Look, our North Star as a nation is the very idea of an American [America; White House correction]—an idea, at once the most simple and most powerful idea in the history of the world—that's not hyperbole—a fact. The idea is this: We're all created in the image of God equally. We deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. That covet—it's a covenant we made with each other, a covenant we've never fully lived up to, but we've never fully walked away from either. And faith and history teach us that however dark the night, joy cometh in the morning. And that joy comes with commands from scripture: ""Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy mind, all thy soul,"" and ""Love your neighbor as thyself."" Not so easy. It's hard. But in those commands is the essence of the gospel and the essence of the American promise. And in my life, I've tried to live my faith. And I've many times failed. But I've learned, as many of you might have learned in your path as well, we're all—we're all—imperfect beings. We don't know where fate will take us or when. But we can do our best to seek a life of light, hope, love, and justice and truth. Folks, let me close with this. Denmark Vesey arrived in Charleston enslaved—one of too many—too many from a distant shores, wrenched from painful—on a painful journey, not to a promised land, but to a land that promised to deprive them of freedom. But even though they arrived in the land where the life and rife of [a land that would be rife with; White House correction] pain and persecution, they still believed they had promise, and the Black Church kept them moving. They had faith. They found scripture. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen. Vesey had his kind of faith. He became a carpenter and a movement leader concerned with the least among us. That's why he helped found this very church 200 years ago. Only 40 years after the Declaration of Independence, in this church, your church now, the Black Church has some to—come to symbolize the faith and this purpose, to bear witness to those who are suffering, to bring the good news of a future to come, to follow its mission to be the light in the pathway of darkness. That's patriotism. That's patriotism: to love something so much you make it better, no matter the struggle; a patriotism that inspired generation before us to believe that in America we can do and be anything we want to be. In our time, there's still the old ghost of new—in new garments. And we all need to rise to meet the moment, and the moment is now. Folks, my fellow Americans, this is a time of choosing, so let us choose the truth. Let us choose America. I know—I know—we can do it together. And as the gospel song sings: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy."" ""I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me."" My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I rest my case. [Laughter] Audience members. Four more years! The President. Thank you, please. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to go to my head. [Laughter] Please. Thank you. Jim—— Audience member. We love you! The President. ——you know—just say one thing about what Jim has been talking about that confuses me about our Republican friends sometimes, the MAGA Republicans. No, I mean this—I'm being sincere. Every one of the things that Jim mentioned saves the American taxpayer billions of dollars. You realize, if you have a prescription drug from any major drug company in America, I can take you to Toronto, Canada, London, Rome, any major capital in the world, and buy the same exact drug for sometimes half the price that you get here. Look, folks, when the Federal Government, through Medicare, doesn't have to pay out as much money, it means taxpayers pay less money, because you fund the Federal Government, you fund Medicare. Go down every one of these things—it always confused me. They talk about being rational; it's just about excess profit. But any rate, I don't want to get off on that. I'll get carried away. [Laughter] I don't quite get these guys. Thank you, Jim, for your friendship and, above all, for your fellowship. And, Bishop Green, thank you for those kind words. I mean that sincerely. And thank you, Reverend Manning, for, you know—the shepherd of this house—to allow me to stand at this podium once again. And to all the faithful of Mother Emanuel and distinguished guests. I was talking downstairs. I've spent more time in the Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware, than I have—than most people I know, Black or White—[laughter]—have spent in that church. [Laughter] Because that's where I started—no, I'm serious. It started with the civil rights movement. I used to go to 7:30 Mass, then I'd go to 10 o'clock service with the reverend who was then running the church, who's now the bishop. She's the bishop. And I'm told your bishop had been there before, in South Africa, because that's where he is right now. The point is that I've been blessed to worship here before as well. You know, it's—at moments of joy and—great joy and moments of great pain, in moments of unbearable loss. On June 17, 2015, the beautiful souls, five survivors—and five survivors invited a stranger into this church to pray with them. The word of God was pierced by bullets in hate and rage, propelled by not just gunpowder, but by a poison, a poison that's for too long haunted this Nation. And what is that poison? White supremacy. Oh, it is. It's a poison. Throughout our history, it's ripped this Nation apart. This has no place in America. Not today, tomorrow, or ever. From that day, this Nation saw this congregation, this community demonstrate one of the greatest acts of strength I have ever seen—I mean it sincerely, from the bottom of my—the act of forgiveness, the act of grace. It was, as President Obama sang from here, ""Amazing Grace."" You changed hearts. You did something that may not have happened but for your courage. You brought down the Confederate flag in South Carolina. You brought it down. [Applause] No—you did. And you helped the Nation heal. You showed what America can overcome, what we can be when we want to be something. I'm deeply humbled to speak from this same pulpit my friend—and he was a friend—Reverend Pinckney spoke from. We all miss him, none more than his family and this congregation. But just as all the families of the Emanuel Nine miss the pieces of their soul that they lost that day, we also have been together at moments of unbearable loss for my family. Two days after the service of Reverend Pinckney, my son and I—my surviving son and I came back. My family worshiped with you here, Sunday service, to show our solidarity. But my family also needed to be healed. We didn't even realize how badly. Just 22 days before, we had buried my son Beau, a veteran exposed and died because of those burn pits in Iraq for a year. We were—we were in more pain than we knew. We came here to offer comfort and received comfort from you. No, I'm serious. As I listened in the pews, spent time with the families, visited Reverend Pinckney's office, visited the memorial for the victims outside, I grew stronger. My son, my family grew stronger. We prayed together. We grieved together. We found hope together, for real—for real. And you know, it reminds me that, through our pain, each of us—each of us—must find purpose. For me, that purpose was to live a life worthy of my son Beau. And I mean it sincerely. For you, that purpose is for the lives worthy of loved ones lost—to make them proud. So many of you were there for us during that loss, including my dear friend Jim and Emily Clyburn. Ms. Emily I miss. People of deep faith. Jim, a great public servant and the best friend you could ever have. Jim, I'm thinking of Emily today, and we talked about it downstairs a little bit. I know you do every single, solitary day. She was special. And that bond you shared was something to behold. As many of you know, Jim is a teacher and a student of history. He knows the power of history. He knows the power of truth and the power of lies. He knows what happens when people are allowed to whitewash history, erase history, bury history. He knows what the Bible teaches. We shall know the truth, and the truth shall set us free. But the truth—the truth—is under assault in America. As a consequence, so is our freedom, our democracy, our very country because, without the truth, there is no light. Without light, there's no path from this darkness. Audience member. If you really care about the lives lost here, then you should honor the lives lost and call for a cease-fire in Palestine! Audience members. Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! The President. That's all right. That's all right. That's all right. Audience member. Will you call for a cease-fire? Audience members. Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! [At this point, security staff escorted some members of the audience out of the sanctuary.] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Look, folks, I understand their—I understand their passion. And I've been quietly working—I've been quietly working with the Israeli Government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza. I've been using all that I can to do that. But I understand the passion. Look, folks, after the Civil—— Audience member. You're an understanding person. You're an understanding person. The President. Thank you. Audience member. They don't realize that. You're a good man. The President. Well, thank you. Look, after the Civil War, the defeated Confederates couldn't accept the verdict of the war: They had lost. So they say, they embraced what's known as the Lost Cause, a self-serving lie that the Civil War was not about slavery, but about States' rights. And they've called that the noble cause. That was a lie, a lie that had—not just a lie but it had terrible consequences. It brought on Jim Crow. So let me be clear for those who don't seem to know: Slavery was the cause of the Civil War.

With the economy on the brink, we spent—we sent $1,400 checks into the pockets of people who are hurting badly, keep them going. I said we'd invest in all of America—all America—and we are. The results are clear: over 14 million new jobs, record economic growth, the lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world. But we have more to do. We see this progress for all Americans. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate recorded in a long, long time. More Blacks, Americans have health insurance than ever, bringing peace of mind and dignity to their lives. I remember when I was a kid. We lived in a three-bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And my headboard in my room was up against—it was a little split-level home. It was a—we weren't poor. We were—anyway, we weren't—we sure weren't worth—the wealthy. And I remember really, one night, hearing my dad was restless, because the headboard was along my headboard, on the other side of the wall. And I asked my mom the next morning, I said, ""What's the matter with Dad?"" She said, ""Honey, his employer just told him they're dropping health insurance."" What that does is, it deprives a man and a woman of their dignity. How do you look at your child and say: ""I can't cover you. I can't take care of you."" And now, as Jim pointed out at one point—I won't go into it like I was going to because he said it better—instead of about an average of $400 a month for insulin for seniors with diabetes, we're now paying $35 a month. And by the way, they're still making a profit three times. It costs $10 to make it. And I've been trying to take on—as a couple of you in the audience know from my entire career—Big Pharma. Finally beat them. Finally, finally, finally. And we're going to go back and make sure that Medicare can negotiate prices for everybody, not just for seniors. Again, it saves the American taxpayers billions of dollars not having to pay Pharma for these things. You know, we're growing back—Black wealth, and we have a lot more to do. The racial wealth gap is the smallest it's been in 20 years under my watch. More Black small businesses starting up than in decades in the ultimate act—opening a new business is the ultimate act of hope. We're taking on housing discrimination in many ways. So a home owned by—today, a home owned by a Black family on one side of a highway, built by the same builder on the other side of the highway and a White guy living in it, the White guy's home is valued more than the Black guy's. No, I know you know it. But guess what? That's how you build generational wealth, when you build your home. Kamala and I are leading the charge of—mainly Kamala—to protect the freedom to vote and that vote—that be counted. Defending your freedom to choose. We're keeping our commitment of providing incredible opportunities, making historic investments in HBCUs: $7 billion—$7 billion. They're just as good as other universities, just only that they don't have the billionaire contributors, so they can't put the laboratories together to get the contracts to be the ones that design new aircraft carrier decks, being the ones to design—what's changing—it's changing. Providing people a real shot by reducing the burden of student debt—Jim went into it; I won't go into it as I was going to—$132 billion [million; White House correction], 3.6 million people—a significant percentage of those students are African American students—despite our friends on the other side of the table, the Supreme Court did [doing; White House correction] everything we [they; White House correction] can to stop me. Replacing every lead pipe in America. You know how many—not just some. Every single lead pipe in America is going to be taken out and replaced with a—[inaudible]. Why? Because in mostly poor neighborhoods, that's where those lead pipes are. And that's why kids end up with brain damage because of the lead. There's so—I'm not going to go into it. But look, you can turn on a faucet for your child and doesn't get sick from drinking water in their—coming into the home. Delivering high-speed internet that's affordable for everybody—everybody—so you don't have to sit in the McDonald's parking lot for your child to do their homework. Producing clean energy so you can finally breathe clean air without leaving home. Look, I understand it. When we moved from Scranton—I was raised in Claymont, Delaware. More major refineries than any place, including Houston, Texas, and just across the border in Chester. Not a joke. I grew up with asthma, and most of us did, because of the prevailing winds. We'd go—my mom would drive us to school in the morning when I was young—grade school—turn on—when there was a frost, turn on the windshield wipers, there would be an oil slick on the wiper. Because guess what? It's all the fenceline communities who get hurt. Not on my watch. It's changing. We know there's more to do: making childcare and eldercare more affordable, which would save American taxpayers billions of dollars along the way. Early in my administration, we were out—we cut child poverty in half—child poverty—Black child poverty in half by getting families checks every month through the childcare tax credit. And the other side had—went ahead and blocked it. But we're going to get it back. This—[applause]. Look, this fight isn't over. We're going to come back. Because no child in America should ever go to bed hungry, period, period, period, period. After the historic movement for justice in the summer of 2020, I signed the most significant police reform Executive order in history. We didn't get the law passed, but guess what? I did it by Executive order, a significant part of it. But now Congress has to step up and ask and get it—do what I did and make it the law of the land. Just a few days ago, the defeated former President was asked about the recent shooting in Iowa. Did you hear this one? I'm—it's hard to believe. You know what his response was, all those kids dead? We ""have to get over it,"" end of quote. I promise you—— [The President made the sign of the cross.] We ""have to get over it."" My response is: We have to stop it so your children, your family, your friends can leave your home, walk the streets, go to stores, go to the grocery store, and go to church, to be safe from gun violence. There's no excuse for this carnage. We have to ban assault weapons. I did it once before, and I'm going to come back again and do it. Ban high-capacity magazines. We have to pass a—universal background checks. It doesn't violate the Second Amendment. It's common sense, and it saves lives. I'm determined to continue to deliver on equal justice under the law. I made a commitment to you to nominate the first Black woman—and Jim has already talked about it—on the Supreme Court. And by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] Whoa. Her name is Ketanji Brown Jackson. Well, guess what? She knows what she's doing. And by the way, as Jim pointed out, more Black women have been appointed to the Federal Circuit Courts than every other President in American history has appointed, every single, solitary one counted. And we're going to keep going. Look, I want to make it clear: You all made this possible because of your voice. Your voice was heard in shaping your destiny. That's democracy. And I'm proud to have led the effort to make sure your voice, the South Carolina voice, will always be heard, because now you're first in the primary. Look, our North Star as a nation is the very idea of an American [America; White House correction]—an idea, at once the most simple and most powerful idea in the history of the world—that's not hyperbole—a fact. The idea is this: We're all created in the image of God equally. We deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. That covet—it's a covenant we made with each other, a covenant we've never fully lived up to, but we've never fully walked away from either. And faith and history teach us that however dark the night, joy cometh in the morning. And that joy comes with commands from scripture: ""Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, all thy mind, all thy soul,"" and ""Love your neighbor as thyself."" Not so easy. It's hard. But in those commands is the essence of the gospel and the essence of the American promise. And in my life, I've tried to live my faith. And I've many times failed. But I've learned, as many of you might have learned in your path as well, we're all—we're all—imperfect beings. We don't know where fate will take us or when. But we can do our best to seek a life of light, hope, love, and justice and truth. Folks, let me close with this. Denmark Vesey arrived in Charleston enslaved—one of too many—too many from a distant shores, wrenched from painful—on a painful journey, not to a promised land, but to a land that promised to deprive them of freedom. But even though they arrived in the land where the life and rife of [a land that would be rife with; White House correction] pain and persecution, they still believed they had promise, and the Black Church kept them moving. They had faith. They found scripture. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, evidence of things not seen. Vesey had his kind of faith. He became a carpenter and a movement leader concerned with the least among us. That's why he helped found this very church 200 years ago. Only 40 years after the Declaration of Independence, in this church, your church now, the Black Church has some to—come to symbolize the faith and this purpose, to bear witness to those who are suffering, to bring the good news of a future to come, to follow its mission to be the light in the pathway of darkness. That's patriotism. That's patriotism: to love something so much you make it better, no matter the struggle; a patriotism that inspired generation before us to believe that in America we can do and be anything we want to be. In our time, there's still the old ghost of new—in new garments. And we all need to rise to meet the moment, and the moment is now. Folks, my fellow Americans, this is a time of choosing, so let us choose the truth. Let us choose America. I know—I know—we can do it together. And as the gospel song sings: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy."" ""I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me."" My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['rest', 'case', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'please', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'head',

Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Thank you. Please. Take a seat, if you have one. [Laughter] Hello, Virginia! And the real Governor, Terry McAuliffe. [Laughter] My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband and Kamala's running mate. [Laughter] Kidding aside, thank you, Kamala, for your leadership, for protecting the reproductive freedom, and for so much more that you do. And thank you, Jill and Doug, for shining the spotlight on so many issues affecting women's rights, not just this one. And, Amanda, thanks for the introduction. Do you realize how much courage it takes to do what she did? You give so many young women hope. Jill and I had a chance to sit down—— Audience member. Genocide Joe, how many kids have you killed in Gaza? Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Audience member. Go ahead, Mr. President. [Laughter] Audience member. We love Joe! The President. Well, look—Jill and I had a chance to sit down and talk with Amanda and her husband Josh. I told you how proud we were of your courage, Amanda, standing up and speaking out on such a personal issue to help so many women, and—— Audience member. Israel kills two mothers every hour! Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] Cease-fire now! Cease-fire now! [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. They feel deeply. I want to thank you, again, Amanda, for your absolute courage. And to all of you here today, thank you for your support defending freedom in America, because that's what we're doing. Yes—[applause]. Yes—— Audience member. Miscarriage—[inaudible]—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Yesterday—yesterday marked the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose, her right to make the deeply personal—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. We're going to have—this is going to go on for a while. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. We've got a couple more of these, I think. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. And, folks, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right, and so do a majority of Americans. And they still do. We all know what happened a year and a half ago: A new Supreme Court made an extreme decision overturning Roe v. Wade with their—with their Dobbs decision. Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. I'm sorry this is taking so long. Folks, the Supreme Court did what it never had done before: It ripped away a fundamental constitutional right that was in place for nearly 50 years and that was so important to so many Americans for so long. As I said on that day, the health and lives of women in this Nation would be at risk and the consequences of this decision. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. That's exactly what happened. Today, in America, women are being turned away from—emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care, forced to go to court to plead to help to protect themselves and the ability for them to have children in the future. The cruelty is astounding. And it's a direct affront to a woman's dignity to be told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, to get sicker and sicker before anything can happen, even to the point where, as you heard, your life had been determined to be in danger. Or the idea that a woman should have to carry a fetus after she's been raped or the victim of incest—it's outrageous. It's outrageous. Or the idea—a woman receives competent medical advice that the fetus she is carrying won't live and will impact on her ability to have children in the future, and she still can't get medical care. I think it's unconscionable. Did anyone think—did anyone think that this is where America was going in 2024? Audience members. No! The President. I could go on. But look—and let there be no mistake—the person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump. Audience members. Boo! The President. Listen to what he says. Trump says he's ""proud"" that he overturned Roe v. Wade. He said, and I quote, there has to be ""punishment"" for the women exercising their reproductive freedom. He describes the Dobbs decision as a ""miracle."" But for American women, it's a nightmare. So let's be absolutely clear what Trump is bragging about. The reason there are 21 States where abortion bans are in effect, may [many; White House correction] with no exception for rape or any other—or incest, is Donald Trump. The reason women are being forced to travel out of State—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. This is going to go on for a while. They've got this planned. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] The reason women are being forced to travel across State lines for health care is Donald Trump. The reason their family members are trying to get help—them to—are threatened with—with prosecution is because of Donald Trump. And the reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump. And because of Donald Trump, doctors are fleeing their home States, setting up practices in other States, because they're afraid they'll be put in prison if they exercise their responsibilities. In States like Texas, doctors can get a life sentence for providing the care they were trained to provide. It's outrageous. Audience member. [Inaudible]—is a war crime! The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans—including the woman hollering—[laughter]. Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience member. Keep going! The President. And frankly, Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, are hell-bent on going even further. To date, MAGA Republicans in Congress have proposed three additional national abortion bans to criminalize health care in every State. Let me tell you what they are. First is a zero-week ban with absolutely no exceptions. The second one introduced is a 6-week ban with a penalty for violating it—jail. And the third is a 15-week ban, and the penalty is a 5-year jail sentence. You know, and they're in Congress now. In the past year, Trump himself endorsed a Federal ban, promising to ""lead the charge,"" God love him. [Laughter] And that means even if you live in a State where extremist Republicans are not in charge of the State Government, your right to choose, your right to privacy is still at risk. But as long as I have the power of the Presidency, know this: If Congress were to pass a national abortion ban, I will veto it. I will veto it. Look, MAGA Republicans—MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. MAGA Republicans are trying to limit all women in America from getting a safe and effective medication, approved by the FDA to—for over 20 years now. They're trying to block women from getting this medication even in States where women's health care choices are still protected. And if you live in a State where you cannot get care that you need and you make a plan to travel to another State to get the care you need, MAGA Republicans are trying to stop you as well. And get this. In the State of Alabama, the attorney general is threatening to prosecute family members who help their loved ones travel to another State to get healthcare they need. That can't be America—— Audience members. Boo! The President. That can't be America in 2024. It can't be. So let's be clear that the Dobbs decision also puts at risk the broader rights of privacy for everyone. That's because the fundamental right to privacy, which Roe v. Wade recognized, has served as a basis for so many other rights that are part of the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to—use birth control, the right to marry someone who you love. Justice Thomas wrote as much in his concurring opinion in Dobbs that the future cases of the Court, he said, should be considered—reconsider all substantive due process precedents from Griswold on. That's what he said. Look—— Audience member. [Inaudible] [At this point, the President addressed audience members in the balcony.]  The President. Please don't jump. Folks, the extreme laws passed by Dobbs have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place is your voice. The Dobbs decision practically dared women of America to be heard. In writing, they said, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" No kidding. I said at the time, I don't think this Court and the MAGA Republicans have any clue about the power of women in America. I don't think they have any clue. But they're about to find out. Since the Dobbs decision, all over this country, from Ohio to Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and right here in Virginia, Americans have showed up—women and men of all races, all backgrounds—voting to protect the freedom to choose. And there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America: Donald Trump. Audience member. [Inaudible]—genocide. The President. But look—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. What I said is, there's one other person who doesn't have a clue about the power of women in America. It's Donald Trump. But I promise you, in 2024, he's going to find out about the power of you all. We—[applause]. Oh, he—watch. We need the protections of Roe v. Wade in every State. And we can do it. You can do it. Together, we can do it. It's within your power to do it. So let me be crystal clear. Today isn't just a day to remember the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, today is a day to call to action. With your voice, with your power, with your vote, we can restore the protections that had been around for over 50 years under Roe v. Wade. We can—[applause]. We can—we can once again make it the law of the land in America. And we're going to do that. Are you ready to make it happen? Well, to do that, we need a new Congress. Are you ready to make that happen? Give me a Democratic House of Representatives, and give me a bigger—a bigger Democratic Senate, and we will pass a new law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade, and I will sign it immediately. And let's remember: It was Donald Trump and his Supreme Court who ripped away the rights and freedoms of women in America. And it will be Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and all of you who are going to restore those rights for the women of America. Donald Trump is betting we won't—you won't vote on this issue. But guess what? [Laughter] He's betting we won't hold him responsible either, for taking away the rights. He's betting you're going to stop caring. Audience members. Boo! Audience members. We have daughters! The President. By the way—that you'll get distracted and discouraged and stay home. Audience members. No! The President. Well, guess what? I'm betting he's wrong. I'm betting you're the—won't forget. I'm betting you won't stop caring, that you won't get distracted. And I'm betting, come November, we will vote in a record number. And when we do that, we'll teach Donald Trump a valuable lesson: Don't mess with the women of America unless you want to get the benefit. Look, let me close with this. I believe 2024 is going to be the most important election we've had since 1864. I mean it. And the reasons are clear. Democracy is on the ballot. Freedom is on the ballot, like the freedom to choose; the freedom to vote; the freedom to love who you want; the freedom to go to work, go to school, go to your house of worship without fear of being gunned down by a weapon of war. So my question to you is simple: Are you ready? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to defend democracy? Audience members. Yes! The President. Are you ready to protect our freedoms? Audience members. Yes! The President. And are you ready to win this election? Audience members. Yes! The President. Let's get this done. Talk to your families and friends. Organize your community. Register to vote. Get people to the polls. And let's remember who we are: We are the United States of America. And there's nothing—nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right. You heard me say this before. Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather's house, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" Guess what? My grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's spread the faith. Thank you.","['audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'please', 'seat', 'hello', 'virginia', 'real',

I don't know where he is, but he is."", ""Together, we're proving what I've always believed: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact."", ""Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union President ever, and I'm proud you have my back. Let me just say I'm honored to have your back and you have mine. That's the deal."", ""It comes down to seeing the world the same way. It's not complicated."", 'You know, my dad—who never went to college; who was the smartest, toughest, most gracious man I knew; who managed a car dealership for the bulk of my life—taught me a very important lesson.

Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. It's great to be home. One of the best unions in the world. You look out for one another. And the whole country—the whole country—benefits from what you do. You know—please take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] You're tough as they come, starting with your president, Shawn Fain, a leader with backbone, a backbone like a ramrod. I don't know where he is, but he is. Together, we're proving what I've always believed: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact. Look, I kept my commitment to be the most pro-union President ever, and I'm proud you have my back. Let me just say I'm honored to have your back and you have mine. That's the deal. It comes down to seeing the world the same way. It's not complicated. You know, my dad—who never went to college; who was the smartest, toughest, most gracious man I knew; who managed a car dealership for the bulk of my life—taught me a very important lesson. He'd say: ""Joey""—this is the God's truth—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about decency. It's about your dignity. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going be okay,' and mean it—and mean it."" Folks, that's what the UAW is all about, and it's always been that way. Just after the UAW was founded nearly 90 years ago, it launched what historians call the most important strike in the 20th century: Flint, 1936. Walter Reuther organized a sit-down in a factory. They weren't sure what would happen. They were worried about getting beat up. But they were determined. They were determined. And it took 44 days, but they won the first collective bargaining victory in American history. And the leadership of the UAW spread across the country and led to the first substantial wage increase in a long time, the first cost-of-living allowance, the first employer-provided health care. Within 4 years, workers across the entire auto industry unionized, inspiring workers across other industries as well, giving life to new industries in the labor movement. I share that history with you because all of you made history again. I'm confident—and I mean this—90 years from now, people are going to look back on the impact you had—you in this room. Just like them 90 years ago, you matter now. You lead. And I respect all of you here today. And you represent unions that always led, always lifted, and always inspired workers. The UAW legacy from Walter Reuther to Shawn Fain today—Shawn, you took a lot of heat, but you demonstrated extraordinary leadership. [Applause] You did. And that's what I saw a few months ago during your historic UAW strike—the time—this time in Belleville, Michigan. And I'll say I was so damn proud to stand on that picket line with you. It's not the first—it's not the first UAW picket line I stood in. In my home State of Delaware, I've done it many times. But it's the first time a President did it, I found out later. [Laughter] I've always fought for a strong auto industry, with UAW-built cars leading the world. This is what—it's about a simple proposition: You built these iconic companies. You built GM. You built—you built these companies. You sacrificed to save them in the worst of times. And you deserve to benefit when these companies thrive. As Shawn said, record profits mean record contracts. I'm serious. And that's what you got: record wage increases, winning back cost-of-living adjustments, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and eliminating tiers. [Laughter] Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Laughter] You all know my position. I'm tired—I've tried—you know, I'm tired about jobs going overseas, having products shipped to—look, during the Trump administration and a lot of administrations before that, what'd they do? So many—so many—people around America lost their sense of pride. Because whether it was an automobile company or any company at all, that factory that was there for 30 years. Hiring—they maybe only had 150 people in it, but it was a part of the community. Guess what? Corporate America found the cheapest labor in the world, and they sent the jobs to those laborers and sent the product back to us. But not anymore. We're building product here and shipping it overseas. Buy America and build America. [Applause] I mean it. And what's really important, you made sure the auto future of the world will be made in America. Oh, I mean it. You know, I'm going to digress just a second. Most people don't know that back in the thirties when Roosevelt was talking about the value of unions, he didn't just say unions are okay. He said any product that—in fact, that Congress—any money that Congress gives the President to spend, to build a product—whether it's an aircraft carrier, an automobile, a tanker, a staircase—no matter what that was, it should be built—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. For—— Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. But for a long time—for a long time—— Audience members. UAW! UAW! UAW! The President. For a long time, the Congress would make an appropriation and send it to the President to spend, whether it was building an aircraft carrier or staircase. And guess what? It was supposed to be built by an American worker with American products. Well, guess what? I'm going back to that. We build in America, and we buy American. And here is what you all did: You won commitments from the Big Three to create thousands of more jobs. So that's tens of billions more dollars. Building an auto future made in America. It wasn't just about what you did for the UAW workers. The fact is, you've transformed the entire auto industry that's not yet unionized—or, as we call that, the ""UAW bump."" Because of you, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tulsa [Tesla; White House correction] all gave their workers double-digit raises. Because of you, workers across the country have seen the largest wage increases for workers building cars and trucks and any other transportation equipment in nearly 30 years. Thousands of these workers are already asking to join your union. Even before this, the UAW has been expanding its reach to workers in auto plants in—from auto plants to casi—to casi—casinos.

It's good for companies. It increases the quality of the jobs, the quality of the products. And it's good for economic growth. In fact, I asked—which is unusual for a President to do—I asked the Treasury Department to do a significant study—the most comprehensive report ever—detailing how unions are good for all workers, including nonunion workers; how they found that unions raise standards across workplaces in industry, improving skills and save—pushing up wages, strengthening the benefits for everyone. It matters. It matters, it matters. And some in corporate America are finally beginning to figure it out. And look at what we're doing—what's good for workers and companies. Since I took office, we've attracted billions of dollars in investment here in the United States. We supercharged advanced manufacturing, including electric vehicles made by union workers in America. China is determined—[applause]. China is determined to dominate that market, with EV predominantly made in China and Chinese jobs. The previous administration consent—was content to sit on the sidelines and let China take all these jobs, but I won't let that happen. [Applause] I will not. That's why I—[applause]. That's why I pushed and drafted the CHIPS and Science Act, investing more than $50 billion in manufacturing semiconductors here at home. Automobiles today require 3,000 chips—of these chips to be made. That's why my bipartisan infrastructure law is building a network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations all across America, installed by your brothers and sisters at the IBEW. That's who is doing it. And that's why the Inflation Reduction Act—which, the other team, not a single person supported—that I signed into law—dramatically—is a dramatic incentive for the Big Three and other auto companies to make it here—their future here in America with American jobs, jobs that we want to make union jobs. That's why I announced $12 billion to help companies that respect their workers implement a just transition to electric vehicle future. Because I strongly believe that companies transitioning to new technology should retool, reboot, and rehire in the same factories in the same communities with comparable wages. And existing union workers should have the first shot at those jobs. As Shawn said, I appointed a historically pro-union National Labor Relations Board, because I don't believe any company should be using threats or tactics to stand in the way of workers' rights to organize. Period. And, folks, you've been very patient, sitting a long time. But these investments are paying off. Since I came to office—by the way, the last guy said he's looking for—he's hoping for a recession—— [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] ——[laughter]—because he does not want to be the next Herbert Hoover. He's already Herbert Hoover. [Laughter] He's the only President other than Herbert Hoover who lost jobs when he was President. Look, since I came to office, with your help, we've created 14 million new jobs—14 million—nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide. And that means we're creating American jobs and exporting American products instead of the other way around, like we saw for too long. Unemployment has been below 4 percent for the longest stretch in 50 years, and it's going down. Wages are up; household wealth is up. We have the lowest inflation and fastest recovery of any major economy in the world. We have the fastest growing economy in the world. I know we have more to do. And we're making real progress. Over the last year, prices are down on everyday items from a gallon of gasoline to a gallon of milk. And folks are beginning to feel it. Last week, we saw one of the biggest jumps in how positive consumers are about—feeling about their personal circumstance. But we have more work to do. But our plan is delivering for the American people, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. That's what I said I was going to do—that's what I tried to do as a Senator and Vice President—but because, when we do that, the poor have a ladder up and the middle class does well, and the wealthy do well. Although, they should be paying a hell of a lot more in taxes. We all do well. It's called Bidenomics. If you notice, all the major economists who are talking about ""there's going to be a recession next week, next month""—they're all of a sudden—they're seeing the Lord. [Laughter] I'm a little worried; some of the major economists in American history are now giving me credit. You know, it's like, ""Oh, God, what's going on?"" [Laughter] But look, all kidding aside. This is a fundamental break from what used to be called trickle-down economics. And some Democrat Presidents did it as well as Republican. You know, I sat—not a lot trickled down on my dad's kitchen table growing up. There wasn't a lot. The idea was, if the wealthy do very well, there will be a lot left over, and it will trickle down to ordinary folks. Well, guess what? That trickle-down economy was supercharged by my predecessor. He cut taxes for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. They shipped good-paying jobs overseas because labor was cheaper. It shrank public investment in infrastructure and education—invested less. It hollowed out entire communities, closing factories—I'm not making this up; you know this to be true—closing factories, attacking unions, and leaving too many Americans behind. In fact, when Donald Trump was in office, six auto factories closed around the country. Tens of thousands of auto jobs were lost nationwide during Trump's Presidency. During my Presidency, we've opened 20 auto factories and more to come. We've created more than 250,000 auto jobs all across America. And while I stood in solidarity with you on the picket line—as your president said, I went to the picket line; Donald Trump went to a nonunion shop and attacked you. [Laughter] Let me tell you something I learned a long time ago. If I'm going to be in a fight, I want it to be in a fight with you, the UAW—with you. [Applause] No, no, I mean it. We have a big fight in front of us. We're fundamentally changing the economy in this country. And everybody is getting a little worried about it, the very powerful. Some are seeing the light. But changing the economy—taking it from an economy that takes care of those at the top and changing an economy that gives people who built this country a fair shot. Getting back to my dad, all anyone wants is just a fair shot—just a fair shot, an even shot to be able to make it. That's what my economic plan is all about. That's what the UAW is all about. That's what the—your battle has been about. The days of working people being dealt out of the deal are over in this country as long as I'm President. Working people are going to get their fair share. You've earned it, you fought for it, and you deserve it. So today I want to say to all of you: Thank you, thank you. I could not be more proud or more honored that you've chosen to stand with me. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. For all the progress we've made together, you're the real hero. I mean—I want to make it clear: You're the heroes of this story. It's not what I did; it's what the American people standing up with backbone did. You're the reason why. And I mean it sincerely. I'm supposedly an expert in foreign policy. I've known every major world leader for the past 25 years. And guess what? As I tell every world leader, remind them, whether they're an adversary or an ally, it's never, ever, ever been a good bet to bet against the American people—never, never, never. And that's been true throughout history, and it's still true today. Because of you—I mean this—because of you, I've never been more optimistic about America's future. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And I mean this: There is nothing beyond our capacity when we work together. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops, and God bless the American worker. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Every time I'd walk out of my grandfather—leaving his house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would come to the door, and she'd say, ""No, Joey, spread it.""

Thank you all so much. Please, sit down, if you have a seat. [Laughter] I once said that—I said, ""Sit down""—""That Biden doesn't know what he's doing; there's no chairs."" [Laughter] But thank you—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Well—[laughter]. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you very, very much. Thank you. By the way, I want you to know, for the first time in American history, the Divine Nine has an office in the White House. I know where the power is. I know where the power is. It's—well, let me say—I want to say very much thank you to Robin. Robin and my wife Jill, became prayer partners—for real. And I think they became even more than that. They became good friends. Where—where are you, Robin? There you are. And thank you, thank you, thank you. And I know you know—know this guy—this guy named Clyburn, you know him here? [Laughter] I am President of the United States of America for one reason—not a joke—Jim Clyburn. We hit rock bottom—and all of you. He came down, and he said we're going to win South Carolina, and we won in the primary in every single county. Well, Jim, thank you very, very much. Thank you. And, by the way, you know, I know—I see—I know talent when I see it, and I—soon as he—his term as mayor came up, I stole him. You know this guy right here—Benjamin—Steve Benjamin. Well, look, folks, you know, I came, basically, to say—start off say, ""Thank you."" You've had my back. You've had my back. And I believe—I hope I've had yours. And—[applause]. You know, when I ran for President in 2020, what made me do it was there—remember that situation down in Charlottesville, Virginia, with those folks coming out of the fields carrying torches and Nazi flags? I mean, for real—Nazi banners and White supremacists, and they were—and they were marching in the night. And a young woman was killed. A young woman who was a witness was killed. I spoke to her mom. And the guy I'm running against this time was asked—the sitting President—he said, what—he said—was asked, ""What did you think?"" He said, ""There were very good people on both sides."" Some things are not debatable. No, I mean it. And when I ran, I realized I got criticized for saying that one of the main reasons I was running was—and I meant it sincerely—to restore the soul of America—no, I mean it—and to bring us back together. Look, folks, one of the things we don't talk a lot about—but I've been talking a lot about, and I think most people are observing it—Black, White, Hispanic, no matter what—is that, you know, our democracy is at stake. No, it really is at stake for the first time in a long time. Jim knows and read a lot and spoken a lot about de Tocqueville, who wrote about America early on and why America was so strong. And he didn't say it was strong because of our military. He—I'll get—I'll get right to it: He said it was strong because of our churches, because of our faith. No, I mean it. I'm—I'm sincere. He talked about how our voices—that, you know, we're unyielding, and we were a people who believed in integrity, believed in decency. My dad used to have an expression. He'd say, at the dinner table—my dad was a hard-working guy, never got a chance to go to college, but my dad was a really decent, honorable man, a well-read man. And the dinner table was a place where we—we had conversation and, incidentally, ate—[laughter]—before my dad would go back to work. He'd come home and then go back to work. And he'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about a person's dignity. It's about respect."" This—I swear to God, this is what he would say, my word as a Biden: ""It's about dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay.'"" But it's only okay if our system is adhered to; if we abide by our democratic principles; if we, in fact, don't try to undermine the very Constitution. And the fellow I'm running against has—has made no bones about it: He thinks we should be able to rip it apart—not—not a joke. He talked about being able to even ignore the Constitution. By the way, I love his one thing that he should be able to use his special forces to kill somebody if he thought it was a problem. [Laughter] In my church, we say, ""Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."" [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] What the—[laughter]. But all kidding aside, there's a great deal at stake. I'm not going to take a lot of your time. But you know, the Bible teaches that we shall know the truth, and the truth shall set us free. Well, I think we do know the truth. We do know the truth. We do know what the choice is here. It's pretty stark. And it's about dignity, respect; it's about whether we believe—— You know, we're the—I'll get right to it. We're the most unique nation in the world. Now, everybody says those kinds of things about their country, but every other country is organized based on ethnicity, based on geography, based on religion. But we're the only Nation in the world based on an idea—literally, an idea—an idea contained in our Constitution that says, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights""—life, liberty, et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. Every generation, we get closer; until now, it's at stake. It literally is at stake. And, folks, it's important, not just for the African American community, but for every community in this country. It's about who we are. It's about what—think about it—how the world looks at us. I've been doing foreign policy for a long, long time. I was a chairman of those committees and the like. And that's why Barack asked me be on his ticket. And I know every one of those heads of state, and I've known them for a while. And every meeting I go to internationally, I—as they're walking out—this is the God's truth; I can say this in front of the press—virtually every one of them pull me aside and say: ""You've got to win. We can't let that happen again. You can't let that happen again. You can't let that happen again."" Folks, this is about a—the campaign is a lot bigger than me, you, and all of us. It's about who we are as a country. And, by the way, you know, what we—we're—the thing about us is we believe in those basic principles. We don't always practice them as a nation, but we—we do believe in honesty and decency. We do believe that people should be treated with respect. We don't live up to it. We don't live up to it all the time, but we don't walk away from it. And you know, a question I have—and I want to cut through all these notes I have here to get to the end because I don't want to keep you. Look, one of the things in my church—I spent an awful lot of time in African American churches—Black churches. I come from a State that, like South Carolina, had the shame of being a slave State—Delaware. Although it fought on the side of the North, it was a slave State. We have all the vestiges of what that—all—still living that down. That's why I got involved in public life. And what I used to do, I used to go to 7—I'm a practicing Catholic, and I used to go to 7:30 Mass at St. Joe's, and then I'd go to Reverend Beaman's church at 10:30, be—and we'd prepare for going out and marching and doing the things we were going to do.

Biden,2024,0.0,"Vice President Kamala D. Harris. Hello, Delaware! Can we please give it up for Julie, who is an extraordinary human? I have to tell you, I have worked with Julie for years, and she is someone who really just represents all that I know that we all stand for: about the people, about organizing, about coalition building, bringing people together, and the work that it requires around the clock. Julie, thank you for all of your work. And, Mr. President, Dr. Biden, the first Second Gentleman of the United States, my husband—[laughter]—I want to—I just—I have to tell you what joy Doug and I were feeling as we were coming into Delaware. And we were reflecting, Mr. President and Dr. Biden, on those days that we were waiting, as we all remember, for the announcement about who would be the next President of the United States. And this is a community that is so extraordinary in terms of the support that you give so tirelessly and so selflessly. And we know this is what it's going to take: all of us being here together, understanding that it is about all of us. The Senators are here. The soon-to-be-Senator is here. And this election, yes, it is about each of us asking of ourselves: What kind of country do we want to live in? That really is what is at stake. Knowing that we each have the power to answer that question. Yes, it is about our ticket. But it is about all of us. And I'm so proud to work every day with our President. I will tell you—[applause]—he is a son of Delaware. This is family. So I know you know what I'm talking about. But, for the sake of the cameras—[laughter]—let me just tell you something: Joe Biden, first of all, is fearless. When you look at what he has pushed through, in spite of the odds, that's the story of his life. But it is the story also of his Presidency. Joe Biden doesn't hear ""no."" Some people talked about ""Infrastructure Week"" forever. Joe Biden said, ""We're going to make it a reality."" So many of our young leaders know what is at stake in terms of the climate and what we must do to build up our ability in terms of adaptation and resiliency, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, saving this beautiful planet God has given us. Joe Biden is the one, under his Presidency, that pushed through historic legislation, together with our Senators and so many of our friends in Congress. Joe Biden is the President who said—as he has always said—we're going to invest in science. He was the author of the Moonshot. And when he became President, it was about saying we're going to get a CHIPS and Science bill and invest in what we need to do to be a global leader on the challenges that face the world. And those are just a few of the things. But I have to tell you, it is a great blessing and privilege for me to work with him every day. Because he really, really cares. And you know, there is a certain perversion that has been taking place, I think, in our country by some to suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you beat down. But the measure of our leader is based on who he lifts up. With the character of a true leader, which is someone who has a profound character of caring about the suffering of other people and then spending days and nights doing what he knows is possible to lift people up.

It's too late. [Laughter] You're one of only two Presidents in American history—you and Herbert Hoover—who left office with fewer jobs than when you took office. Herbert Hoover—yes. Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Look, when I got elected—I've been working my whole career as a Senator—long back with my old buddy Harry Reid and others—trying to get Big Pharma and the pharmaceutical companies to start to play it on the new level. And we have to beat them. They changed—they charge extraordinary prices, charging more for prescription drugs here in America than anywhere else in the entire world—made by the same drug company. You have a prescription for anything, take it to a local drugstore. I promise you, if I put you on a plane and took you to Toronto or Paris or Berlin or anywhere in Europe, you can buy that same drug, that same prescription for somewhere between 40- and 60-percent less. We said we'd beat them, and we did. Insulin—$35 a month for insulin for seniors on [with; White House correction] diabetes instead of $400 a month or more. We're also capping the cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors, even for expensive drugs like cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 year. Because of the progress we're making so far, 143,000 Nevadans will begin to save an average of $434 a year on prescription drugs. And, folks, I promise you, I'm just getting started. Our actions not only save patients thousands of dollars, they save taxpayers billions of dollars. You know, Medicare pays for these drugs that go out through—over—are being overcharged. Guess what it's saving the tax—the American taxpayer—what we've done so far? One hundred and sixty billion dollars that taxpayers don't have to pay to Medicare to give them these—[inaudible]. Republicans say they're concerned about the deficit. Give me a break. [Laughter] Give me a break. We've tried to make it $35 a month for everyone, not just seniors, but Republicans blocked us. And with your vote in 2024, we're going to make it happen for everyone in America, not just seniors. I promise you. And that will reduce the deficit by even more. Look, I promised we'd help eliminate the accumulated student debt. That—— Audience member. There you go. Yes! [Laughter] The President. ——that millions of Americans carried during the economic pandemic and beyond. The Supreme Court of the United States blocked me, but they didn't stop me. I found another way to help more than 3,700,000 people with $130 billion of relief and counting. There were several existing programs that the bureaucracy wasn't pushing, including one of the—it's called public servants, like teachers, firefighters. Public servants. So I fixed the program to deliver relief for public servants: teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and so on. And guess what? Some of you are getting notices right now. You're going to get another student cut. [Laughter] And this time, you're going to not have any doubt about who sent it to you. It's going to have my name on it: Biden. No, I mean it, because we got another $25 billion a year. And guess what? It's—not only is it a good thing to do, it drows [grows; White House correction] the economy—it grows the economy. It's not costing people. Guess what? When you're able to eliminate that—how many of you have had your student debt eliminated? Well, some of you had student debt eliminated for over $100,000. Audience member. That's right! Right here! The President. Well, guess what? It changes everything. You were able to go out and buy your first home. You were able to go out and buy your first automobile maybe. You were able to go out and see to it that you have an opportunity to get up—to build that business you wanted. And I kept my promise as well to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] And by the way, I've appointed more Black women to the Federal Courts of Appeals than every other President in American history combined—combined. All told, with the help of the Senator from the State of Illinois, I've gotten 175 Federal judges confirmed. Two-thirds of them are women, and two-thirds are people of color. Hold a second there. I also said—when I got elected, I made a promise: I was going to have an American administration that looked like America. I have more women in my Cabinet than men. I have more African Americans on it. I have more people in the backgrounds that are similar. And by the way, I make no apologize—no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history. Let me say one more thing. I also said that—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study with—raising the wages of union members, which I've been able to—I fought like hell to have happen, and it's happening. And unions are more popular now than they've been in generations. I said, ""What was—what's the effect of that?"" It raises everybody's wages. Everything raises, because guess what? When you're making more money for the job you're doing, you're the best workers in—we have the best workers in America—in the world. Look, remember those little computer chips that we were—we invented those suckers—about the size of the end of a fingertip? Guess what? You need 300 of them—three—to build an automobile. You needed them for cell phones. You need them for all kinds of things. And we had lost that market. We had lost that market completely. So I got in a plane, and I flew to South Korea. And they said, ""What the hell are you doing in South Korea?"" Well, they are a major manufacturer of chips. I sat down with their President and with Samsung. I said, ""Come and invest in America."" Because guess what? We now have $50 billion coming to America—investing in. And they're building these facilities. They built what they call ""fabs""—factories. They're great big—look like gigantic football fields underneath a roof. Guess what? Know what the average salary in those is? And you don't need a college degree. A hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year. And they're coming all over America. And thanks to what we call the bipartisan infrastructure law—it's a fancy way of saying we're building a hell of a lot—[laughter]—I've signed—that I signed, there are over 40,000 projects underway. Remember, the last President—he kept talking about ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] He had ""Infrastructure Week"" for 4 years and didn't do a damn thing. [Laughter] No, but I'm serious. But guess what? We're doing a heck of a lot. In the State of Nevada, I just approved $3 billion for the Nation's first high-speed rail line. Three billion dollars. It's going to take you from here to Las Vegas—well, from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in 2 hours by train instead of 4 hours by car. At 186 miles an hour, it will also reduce carbon emissions. It will take 3 million vehicles off the road, helping the air quality. And it's going to create 35,000 jobs during construction, 10,000 union jobs—building trades: carpenters, electricians, ironworkers, laborers, and more. Jobs now and jobs beyond. And generating significant economic growth from Nevada to California, and that includes transforming California with another high-speed rail line coming down from the south, going through central part of the State. Guess what? There's—they're going to—that's train is going to go 220 miles an hour. Things are changing, folks. We have to get with the rest of the world. We have to—we're the best—we're the most innovative country in the world. What the hell have we been doing? [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. And look, just like Franklin Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act back in the thirties—he provided electricity for every home and farm because it was necessary. Electricity was the new need, and rural areas and poor folks couldn't afford it, so he signed the Rural Electrification Act. Well, we're bringing high-speed internet everywhere in America—because internet today is just as essential to doing business as electricity was then. So far, that includes nearly 270,000 households across Nevada that are paying less than $30 a month now for internet, instead of two to three times that amount, so children can do their homework, businesses are able to thrive, farmers and ranchers can know when the best time to sell their product is. And by the way, we're ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child—not a joke—so every child can turn on a faucet and drink clear water without worrying about brain damage. And guess what? It's creating thousands of good union jobs. And the one State I don't have to talk about gun violence in is here. I've been hearing the tragic times that occurred here in this State. We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades, but I want to make clear to you: I will not stop until I once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. There's no rationale for it. None, none, none. I mean it. I did it once when I was a Senator, and I will do it again. Look, we're saving the planet with the most significant investments in climate change ever—ever, anywhere, anytime, in the whole entire history of the world. And that includes, just in your State, an investment of $12 billion in clean energy provisions that—so you'll be a national leader in electric vehicles, batteries, and more, creating tens of thousands of jobs and generating significant economic growth. I signed into law a thing called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws helping veterans exposed to toxic materials, and their families. It matters, and there's so much more we're doing that we can do with these folks. I've been saying for a long time—— Audience member. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. ——and I think it's—well, thank you. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Folks—— Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Thank you. I've been saying for a long time, America has many obligations but only one sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they come home. It's a sacred obligation. So, when I introduced this legislation, well, a lot of my Republican colleagues weren't sure they wanted to vote for it. But guess what? I also included, from my generation, Agent Orange. How many people in the Vietnam generation had Agent Orange come down upon their heads, but they couldn't prove without a doubt that whatever their ailment was, was because of the Agent Orange? Well, guess what? What it should have been is what it is now, and the same way with burn pits. The burn pits out there where they burn—these pits are a size of a football field, 10 feet deep, 40 yards wide, and almost 100 yards long. And guess what? They burn everything in there, from jet fuel to body to—everything, all contaminated waste. And it generates—just like you saw what happened to those 9/11 firefighters. They all came out with cancer, many of them, because of the smoke they were inhaling. Well, the same thing happened. Matter of fact, I had a son who was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he should be here, not me. And guess what? He volunteered—he was attorney general, and he gave up his—active attorney general, and he said, ""I'm going with my National Guard unit,"" because they were going to go to Iraq. And he spent a year there. I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 19 times. And his hooch where he slept was only about 200 yards, maybe a little—maybe more, maybe 400 yards from where he slept, breathing in that air for a year. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma, a brain cancer that there's no cure for. And he died—and he died. The idea that he'd have to prove it was because of that is bizarre. And guess what? Now anyone that's exposed to these burn pits, anyone who can demonstrate they were there, if they come down with the disease, it's covered. And if they—[applause]. And one other thing it means. It means if they passed away, their children are entitled to the education benefits and the other benefits they would have been if he'd been alive and come home—they'd been alive and come home. So, folks, look, the same way, as I said, with Agent Orange. Now, imagine the nightmare if Donald Trump is reelected. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. And by the way, this is the guy who, when he was in France and he was—they asked him to go to this—a American cemetery in France from World War II where Americans were buried. And you know what he said? He said those folks buried in that cemetery were ""suckers"" and ""losers."" ""Suckers"" and ""losers,"" the guy said. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not kidding. By the way, that's beyond—I'm glad I wasn't there. [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. I shouldn't say that. But I'm glad I wasn't there. To call my son and your sons and daughters who gave their lives for this country ""suckers"" and ""losers."" That's how this guy thinks. Who the hell does he think he is? After a recent deadly shooting in Perry, Iowa, where two kids [people; White House correction] were killed—a sixth-grader and a school principal, what did Trump say? It wasn't long ago. He said, ""they've got to get over it."" ""They've got to get over it."" Audience member. We don't get over it! The President. Well, we're not going to get over it, we're going to stop it. And now Trump, from the beginning—and by the way, you all know there's no climate problems, right? [Laughter] I mean, think about it. Think about it. All kidding aside, think about it. This guy is denying we have a problem with climate. This guy is saying—and his MAGA Republican friends want to repeal the historic climate legislation I got passed. And get this, 100,000 Nevadans will get health care this year through the Affordable Care Act—and access to affordable premiums. But after trying and failing more than 60 times, Trump and his MAGA Republican friends are promising to get rid of the Affordable [Care; White House correction] Act again if they get elected. Audience members. Boo! The President. And by the way, it's the only reason why people all over this country have the protections for preexisting conditions—and they'll take it away. I don't know what they're thinking. I don't know what they're thinking. I really mean it. And seniors here in Nevada and all across America should know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away their $35-a-month insulin, as well as the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs. How many of you believe the tax system is fair? Raise your hand. [Laughter] And even those of you who are doing well. We've made progress making sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share by paying a minimum 15 percent—just 15 percent. That paid for all the programs I'm talking about so far. And we did that, and we still cut the deficit $7 billion. But guess what? Trump passed, last time out, a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and big corporations that expanded the Federal debt significantly. And now, instead of protecting Social Security and Medicare like I am, Trump and his MAGA friends want to give another billion-dollar—multibillion-dollar tax cut to the superwealthy and the biggest corporations. Look, I'm not antiwealth. I'm not anticorporation. I come from the corporate State of the world. [Laughter] Seriously. More corporations are incorporated in my State, as you know, Gov, than every other State in the Nation combined. But they've got to pay their fair share. I'm serious. Think about it. Look, folks, we—before the pandemic, there were 750—48 maybe—roughly 750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know what their average tax rate they pay—the Federal tax rate? Eight-point-two percent. Anybody wouldn't trade that—for that tax rate? Well, let me tell you something. If in fact they paid their fair share, over the next 10 years, it'd be forty—$400 billion in new income coming in. We could take care of all these problems. We could have daycare for all kids. We could increase economic growth even more, et cetera. But Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away that opportunity. But I'm going to—if you reelect me—I tell you what, man—hang on, taxes. And I promise, not anybody making less than 400 grand would have one penny in Federal taxes raised. I kept that promise in the beginning. I haven't make—and I will not make—I will not break it again. But look, Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your fundamental freedoms. Your voting rights are under attack: where you can register, how you can register, when you have to register, whether there's mail-in ballot, all the stuff they want to do to change the law. And now Trump is bragging about having overturned another basic freedom: Roe v. Wade. Audience members. Boo! The President. No—he's on television, and he's out saying, ""I did this because it's the Supreme Court that I appointed."" God love him. Well, Roe v. Wade has taken away a woman's right to choose. And by the way, now they're planning a national ban on the right to choose. They made it clear. If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on the right to choose, I will veto it. And by the way, Kamala is doing an incredible job going around the country making this case. And here's the deal, folks. Here's the deal. The idea, if in fact you do what I hope you will do—we'll get more registered people—more people who are registered to vote between the—now and the general election, elect all the Democratic Congressmen and Senators all across the country, give me a Senate and a House, I'm going to bring back Roe v. Wade. And by the way, I love how Trump is now saying, ""Biden is for abortion on demand."" Not true. That's not what Roe v. Wade said. It said there are three trimesters and how it worked. Let me close with this. Look, Trump and his MAGA friends are dividing us, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past, not leading us to the future; refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections; and seeking, as Trump says, to ""terminate""—his words—""terminate"" elements of the U.S. Constitution. And you're telling me he doesn't—democracy is not at risk? Embracing political violence—never since the Civil War has any President engaged in or said political violence was ever appropriate—political violence in America. Calling January 6 insurrectionists—you know what he calls them? ""Patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, no, I—no, I'm—I mean, think about this. People have pled guilty. You know, right after I was elected, I went to what they call a G-7 meeting, all the NATO leaders. And it was in the south of England. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And Mitterrand [Macron; White House correction], from Germany—I mean, from France looked at me and said, ""You know, what—why—how long you back for?"" [Laughter] And I looked at him, and the—and the Chancellor of Germany said, ""What would you say, Mr. President, if you picked up the paper tomorrow in the London Times, and London Times said, 'A thousand people break through the House of Commons, break down the doors, two bobbies are killed in order to stop the election of the Prime Minister.' What would you say?"" And I never thought about it from that perspective. What would we say that happened in another democracy around the world? Well, the whole world watched—the whole world watched. And what's going on? Well, guess what? It's not going happen. He's not—you know what's going to happen if he loses—and he's going to lose. You know, this guy has an interesting vocabulary. He calls immigrants ""vermin"" who ""poison the blood"" of the Nation. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. It's hard to make this up. And he says they threaten our very democracy. He said—folks, we must make clear where we stand. Well, we have to make sure we stand for the truth and will defeat the lies. We must make it clear that in America, just like all of you do in Nevada, we still believe in honesty, decency, dignity, respect. Folks—— Audience member. You'd better win, Joe! Audience member. Get 'em, Joe! The President. Well, you're right—— Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. Well, that's the reason I'm running, because we have to win. Audience member. Thank you! The President. No, no. I give you my word. We have to. It's not much of a choice here. Look, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. I'll end with this. And that sounds like hyperbole, like Americans beating their chest, but we are. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation is built based on ethnicity, religion, or other common traits. The only—thing we're built on is that ""we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator,"" et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it before. We've never—we leave nobody behind in America. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot—just a fair shot. My dad used to say—and he'd say at the dinner table—my dad was a well-read guy who didn't get to go to college because of the war. And—but he'd come home before he went back to close the business he was manager of. And we'd have a conversation and, incidentally, eat. And he'd look and he'd say, many times: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" He meant it. We don't give hate any safe harbor in America. We believe in America. We know what the stakes are. We must keep the White House and keep the Senate by reelecting Jacky Rosen. And, folks, we have to win. We have to win back the House of Representatives and win it up and down the ticket—and State and locally. And that's why we have to get more people to register to vote after this primary—to do that—to do that in the primary. Anybody wondering, tell them—where they vote—go to iwillvote.com. And here in Nevada—here in Nevada—you'll know—you'll be given exactly where you vote. We have to must—we have to organize, mobilize, vote. When we do that, we'll be able to look back and say something few generations have ever been able to say. When American democracy was at risk, like it is now, you all saved it. [Applause] I mean it. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. And that's what we're going to do again. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. [At this point, music began to play. The President then resumed his remarks as follow.]  Every time—every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandma—""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith, guys.","The President. Hello, Nevada! Hello, hello, hello. What a great crowd. Melvin, thank you for that introduction. And thank you, Congressman Steven Horsford, a great friend and an incredible leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Where is he? There is he. Well, you know, it's been—he's been a key player in all this progress we're making. And so is Dina Titus. Where is Congresswoman Titus? There she is. And Senator Jacky Rosen. There you are, Jacky. All right. [Laughter] Look, let's be clear: We need to reelect Jacky. It's critical. And I'll start with the simplest message: From the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you. You all are the reason why I'm President of the United States of America. You're the reason. No, I'm—[applause]. You're the reason that Kamala Harris is a historic Vice President. And you're the reason that Donald Trump is a former President. [Laughter] And you're the reason—you'll make Donald Trump a loser again. In 2020, I ran because I thought everything this country stood for—everything we believed in, everything that made America ""America""—was at risk. I think people thought that maybe I was being hyperbolic about that. I'd say—they'd say: ""Joe, what do you mean our democracy is at risk? What do you mean we're in a battle for the soul of America?"" Well, they may not have understood it, but the people understood it. They don't say that anymore. Just think back to the mess Donald Trump left this country in. The pandemic was raging. The economy was reeling. And look how far we've come because of you. We vaccinated—[applause]. We vaccinated America to get through a pandemic. We created a record 15 million new jobs, getting this economy strong, more than any President has in 4 years. And right here in Nevada, 285,000 new jobs. And nationwide, Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate of any time in 30 years. Latino small businesses are starting up as the fastest rate in over a decade. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which put $1,400 into people's pockets. And on top of that, they got a $300 check per child, per family, per month for hard-working families. Over 300,000—there were 380,000 families in Nevada benefited until the—our friends on the other side wiped it out. You know, nationwide, that's thousands of dollars that people put in their pockets to be able to get real crisis—to get through a real crisis. That cut Black child poverty in half. It cut—[applause]. It cut Latino child poverty by 43 percent. And it cut Indigenous child poverty by half as well. Look, I know—we know we have a lot more to do. Not everyone is feeling the benefits of our investments in progress yet. But inflation is now lower in America than any other major economy in the world—in the world. And in recent weeks, we're seeing real evidence that the American consumers are feeling real confidence in the economy that we're beginning to build. A recent Washington Post headline said, and I quote, ""Falling inflation and rising growth give U.S. the world's best recovery""—""the world's best recovery."" And we're just getting started. And let me tell you something else—who is noticing this: Donald Trump. [Laughter] The strange things he says. [Laughter] He recently said, ""When there's a crash, I hope it's in the next 12 months."" Isn't that wonderful—the former President to root for a crash? It's unbelievable. It's un-American. How can anyone, especially a former President, wish for an economic crash that would devastate millions of Americans? And by the way, pause for a minute. How many times did you hear, when I first got elected President, my policy—we're going to bring a recession next month? Every month. [Laughter] None of them are saying it anymore. The mainstream economists. Because of—I'm here because of you guys. Here's what it really means: Donald Trump knows the economy we built is strong and getting stronger. He knows that while it's good for America, it's bad for him politically. Trump also said the one President he doesn't want to be like was Herbert Hoover. Donald, I've got bad news for you, pal. It's too late. [Laughter] You're one of only two Presidents in American history—you and Herbert Hoover—who left office with fewer jobs than when you took office. Herbert Hoover—yes. Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Look, when I got elected—I've been working my whole career as a Senator—long back with my old buddy Harry Reid and others—trying to get Big Pharma and the pharmaceutical companies to start to play it on the new level. And we have to beat them. They changed—they charge extraordinary prices, charging more for prescription drugs here in America than anywhere else in the entire world—made by the same drug company. You have a prescription for anything, take it to a local drugstore. I promise you, if I put you on a plane and took you to Toronto or Paris or Berlin or anywhere in Europe, you can buy that same drug, that same prescription for somewhere between 40- and 60-percent less. We said we'd beat them, and we did. Insulin—$35 a month for insulin for seniors on [with; White House correction] diabetes instead of $400 a month or more. We're also capping the cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors, even for expensive drugs like cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 year. Because of the progress we're making so far, 143,000 Nevadans will begin to save an average of $434 a year on prescription drugs. And, folks, I promise you, I'm just getting started. Our actions not only save patients thousands of dollars, they save taxpayers billions of dollars. You know, Medicare pays for these drugs that go out through—over—are being overcharged. Guess what it's saving the tax—the American taxpayer—what we've done so far? One hundred and sixty billion dollars that taxpayers don't have to pay to Medicare to give them these—[inaudible]. Republicans say they're concerned about the deficit. Give me a break. [Laughter] Give me a break. We've tried to make it $35 a month for everyone, not just seniors, but Republicans blocked us. And with your vote in 2024, we're going to make it happen for everyone in America, not just seniors. I promise you. And that will reduce the deficit by even more. Look, I promised we'd help eliminate the accumulated student debt. That—— Audience member. There you go. Yes! [Laughter] The President. ——that millions of Americans carried during the economic pandemic and beyond. The Supreme Court of the United States blocked me, but they didn't stop me. I found another way to help more than 3,700,000 people with $130 billion of relief and counting. There were several existing programs that the bureaucracy wasn't pushing, including one of the—it's called public servants, like teachers, firefighters. Public servants. So I fixed the program to deliver relief for public servants: teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers, and so on. And guess what? Some of you are getting notices right now. You're going to get another student cut. [Laughter] And this time, you're going to not have any doubt about who sent it to you. It's going to have my name on it: Biden. No, I mean it, because we got another $25 billion a year. And guess what? It's—not only is it a good thing to do, it drows [grows; White House correction] the economy—it grows the economy. It's not costing people. Guess what? When you're able to eliminate that—how many of you have had your student debt eliminated? Well, some of you had student debt eliminated for over $100,000. Audience member. That's right! Right here! The President. Well, guess what? It changes everything. You were able to go out and buy your first home. You were able to go out and buy your first automobile maybe. You were able to go out and see to it that you have an opportunity to get up—to build that business you wanted. And I kept my promise as well to appoint the first Black woman to the United States Supreme Court. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, and by the way, she's smarter than the rest of these guys. [Laughter] And by the way, I've appointed more Black women to the Federal Courts of Appeals than every other President in American history combined—combined. All told, with the help of the Senator from the State of Illinois, I've gotten 175 Federal judges confirmed. Two-thirds of them are women, and two-thirds are people of color. Hold a second there. I also said—when I got elected, I made a promise: I was going to have an American administration that looked like America. I have more women in my Cabinet than men. I have more African Americans on it. I have more people in the backgrounds that are similar. And by the way, I make no apologize—no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history. Let me say one more thing. I also said that—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study with—raising the wages of union members, which I've been able to—I fought like hell to have happen, and it's happening. And unions are more popular now than they've been in generations. I said, ""What was—what's the effect of that?"" It raises everybody's wages. Everything raises, because guess what? When you're making more money for the job you're doing, you're the best workers in—we have the best workers in America—in the world. Look, remember those little computer chips that we were—we invented those suckers—about the size of the end of a fingertip? Guess what? You need 300 of them—three—to build an automobile. You needed them for cell phones. You need them for all kinds of things. And we had lost that market. We had lost that market completely. So I got in a plane, and I flew to South Korea. And they said, ""What the hell are you doing in South Korea?"" Well, they are a major manufacturer of chips. I sat down with their President and with Samsung. I said, ""Come and invest in America."" Because guess what? We now have $50 billion coming to America—investing in. And they're building these facilities. They built what they call ""fabs""—factories. They're great big—look like gigantic football fields underneath a roof. Guess what? Know what the average salary in those is? And you don't need a college degree. A hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year. And they're coming all over America. And thanks to what we call the bipartisan infrastructure law—it's a fancy way of saying we're building a hell of a lot—[laughter]—I've signed—that I signed, there are over 40,000 projects underway. Remember, the last President—he kept talking about ""Infrastructure Week""? [Laughter] He had ""Infrastructure Week"" for 4 years and didn't do a damn thing. [Laughter] No, but I'm serious. But guess what? We're doing a heck of a lot. In the State of Nevada, I just approved $3 billion for the Nation's first high-speed rail line. Three billion dollars. It's going to take you from here to Las Vegas—well, from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in 2 hours by train instead of 4 hours by car. At 186 miles an hour, it will also reduce carbon emissions. It will take 3 million vehicles off the road, helping the air quality. And it's going to create 35,000 jobs during construction, 10,000 union jobs—building trades: carpenters, electricians, ironworkers, laborers, and more. Jobs now and jobs beyond. And generating significant economic growth from Nevada to California, and that includes transforming California with another high-speed rail line coming down from the south, going through central part of the State. Guess what? There's—they're going to—that's train is going to go 220 miles an hour. Things are changing, folks. We have to get with the rest of the world. We have to—we're the best—we're the most innovative country in the world. What the hell have we been doing? [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. And look, just like Franklin Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act back in the thirties—he provided electricity for every home and farm because it was necessary. Electricity was the new need, and rural areas and poor folks couldn't afford it, so he signed the Rural Electrification Act. Well, we're bringing high-speed internet everywhere in America—because internet today is just as essential to doing business as electricity was then. So far, that includes nearly 270,000 households across Nevada that are paying less than $30 a month now for internet, instead of two to three times that amount, so children can do their homework, businesses are able to thrive, farmers and ranchers can know when the best time to sell their product is. And by the way, we're ripping out every poisonous lead pipe in America so every child—not a joke—so every child can turn on a faucet and drink clear water without worrying about brain damage. And guess what? It's creating thousands of good union jobs. And the one State I don't have to talk about gun violence in is here. I've been hearing the tragic times that occurred here in this State. We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades, but I want to make clear to you: I will not stop until I once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. There's no rationale for it. None, none, none. I mean it. I did it once when I was a Senator, and I will do it again. Look, we're saving the planet with the most significant investments in climate change ever—ever, anywhere, anytime, in the whole entire history of the world. And that includes, just in your State, an investment of $12 billion in clean energy provisions that—so you'll be a national leader in electric vehicles, batteries, and more, creating tens of thousands of jobs and generating significant economic growth. I signed into law a thing called the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws helping veterans exposed to toxic materials, and their families. It matters, and there's so much more we're doing that we can do with these folks. I've been saying for a long time—— Audience member. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. ——and I think it's—well, thank you. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Folks—— Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Thank you. I've been saying for a long time, America has many obligations but only one sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm's way and to care for them and their families when they come home. It's a sacred obligation. So, when I introduced this legislation, well, a lot of my Republican colleagues weren't sure they wanted to vote for it. But guess what? I also included, from my generation, Agent Orange. How many people in the Vietnam generation had Agent Orange come down upon their heads, but they couldn't prove without a doubt that whatever their ailment was, was because of the Agent Orange? Well, guess what? What it should have been is what it is now, and the same way with burn pits. The burn pits out there where they burn—these pits are a size of a football field, 10 feet deep, 40 yards wide, and almost 100 yards long. And guess what? They burn everything in there, from jet fuel to body to—everything, all contaminated waste. And it generates—just like you saw what happened to those 9/11 firefighters. They all came out with cancer, many of them, because of the smoke they were inhaling. Well, the same thing happened. Matter of fact, I had a son who was the attorney general of the State of Delaware, and he should be here, not me. And guess what? He volunteered—he was attorney general, and he gave up his—active attorney general, and he said, ""I'm going with my National Guard unit,"" because they were going to go to Iraq. And he spent a year there. I was in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan over 19 times. And his hooch where he slept was only about 200 yards, maybe a little—maybe more, maybe 400 yards from where he slept, breathing in that air for a year. He came home with stage 4 glioblastoma, a brain cancer that there's no cure for. And he died—and he died. The idea that he'd have to prove it was because of that is bizarre. And guess what? Now anyone that's exposed to these burn pits, anyone who can demonstrate they were there, if they come down with the disease, it's covered. And if they—[applause]. And one other thing it means. It means if they passed away, their children are entitled to the education benefits and the other benefits they would have been if he'd been alive and come home—they'd been alive and come home. So, folks, look, the same way, as I said, with Agent Orange. Now, imagine the nightmare if Donald Trump is reelected. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No, no, no. And by the way, this is the guy who, when he was in France and he was—they asked him to go to this—a American cemetery in France from World War II where Americans were buried. And you know what he said? He said those folks buried in that cemetery were ""suckers"" and ""losers."" ""Suckers"" and ""losers,"" the guy said. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not kidding. By the way, that's beyond—I'm glad I wasn't there. [Laughter] No, no, I'm serious. I shouldn't say that. But I'm glad I wasn't there. To call my son and your sons and daughters who gave their lives for this country ""suckers"" and ""losers."" That's how this guy thinks. Who the hell does he think he is? After a recent deadly shooting in Perry, Iowa, where two kids [people; White House correction] were killed—a sixth-grader and a school principal, what did Trump say? It wasn't long ago. He said, ""they've got to get over it."" ""They've got to get over it."" Audience member. We don't get over it! The President. Well, we're not going to get over it, we're going to stop it. And now Trump, from the beginning—and by the way, you all know there's no climate problems, right? [Laughter] I mean, think about it. Think about it. All kidding aside, think about it. This guy is denying we have a problem with climate. This guy is saying—and his MAGA Republican friends want to repeal the historic climate legislation I got passed. And get this, 100,000 Nevadans will get health care this year through the Affordable Care Act—and access to affordable premiums. But after trying and failing more than 60 times, Trump and his MAGA Republican friends are promising to get rid of the Affordable [Care; White House correction] Act again if they get elected. Audience members. Boo! The President. And by the way, it's the only reason why people all over this country have the protections for preexisting conditions—and they'll take it away. I don't know what they're thinking. I don't know what they're thinking. I really mean it. And seniors here in Nevada and all across America should know this: Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away their $35-a-month insulin, as well as the $2,000 cap on prescription drugs. How many of you believe the tax system is fair? Raise your hand. [Laughter] And even those of you who are doing well. We've made progress making sure the biggest corporations pay their fair share by paying a minimum 15 percent—just 15 percent. That paid for all the programs I'm talking about so far. And we did that, and we still cut the deficit $7 billion. But guess what? Trump passed, last time out, a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and big corporations that expanded the Federal debt significantly. And now, instead of protecting Social Security and Medicare like I am, Trump and his MAGA friends want to give another billion-dollar—multibillion-dollar tax cut to the superwealthy and the biggest corporations. Look, I'm not antiwealth. I'm not anticorporation. I come from the corporate State of the world. [Laughter] Seriously. More corporations are incorporated in my State, as you know, Gov, than every other State in the Nation combined. But they've got to pay their fair share. I'm serious. Think about it. Look, folks, we—before the pandemic, there were 750—48 maybe—roughly 750 billionaires in America. Now there are a thousand. You know what their average tax rate they pay—the Federal tax rate? Eight-point-two percent. Anybody wouldn't trade that—for that tax rate? Well, let me tell you something. If in fact they paid their fair share, over the next 10 years, it'd be forty—$400 billion in new income coming in. We could take care of all these problems. We could have daycare for all kids. We could increase economic growth even more, et cetera. But Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away that opportunity. But I'm going to—if you reelect me—I tell you what, man—hang on, taxes. And I promise, not anybody making less than 400 grand would have one penny in Federal taxes raised. I kept that promise in the beginning. I haven't make—and I will not make—I will not break it again. But look, Trump and his MAGA friends are determined to take away your fundamental freedoms. Your voting rights are under attack: where you can register, how you can register, when you have to register, whether there's mail-in ballot, all the stuff they want to do to change the law. And now Trump is bragging about having overturned another basic freedom: Roe v. Wade. Audience members. Boo! The President. No—he's on television, and he's out saying, ""I did this because it's the Supreme Court that I appointed."" God love him. Well, Roe v. Wade has taken away a woman's right to choose. And by the way, now they're planning a national ban on the right to choose. They made it clear. If MAGA Republicans try to pass a national ban on the right to choose, I will veto it. And by the way, Kamala is doing an incredible job going around the country making this case. And here's the deal, folks. Here's the deal. The idea, if in fact you do what I hope you will do—we'll get more registered people—more people who are registered to vote between the—now and the general election, elect all the Democratic Congressmen and Senators all across the country, give me a Senate and a House, I'm going to bring back Roe v. Wade. And by the way, I love how Trump is now saying, ""Biden is for abortion on demand."" Not true. That's not what Roe v. Wade said. It said there are three trimesters and how it worked. Let me close with this. Look, Trump and his MAGA friends are dividing us, not uniting us; dragging us back to the past, not leading us to the future; refusing to accept the results of legitimate elections; and seeking, as Trump says, to ""terminate""—his words—""terminate"" elements of the U.S. Constitution. And you're telling me he doesn't—democracy is not at risk? Embracing political violence—never since the Civil War has any President engaged in or said political violence was ever appropriate—political violence in America. Calling January 6 insurrectionists—you know what he calls them? ""Patriots."" Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, no, I—no, I'm—I mean, think about this. People have pled guilty. You know, right after I was elected, I went to what they call a G-7 meeting, all the NATO leaders. And it was in the south of England. And I sat down, and I said, ""America is back."" And Mitterrand [Macron; White House correction], from Germany—I mean, from France looked at me and said, ""You know, what—why—how long you back for?"" [Laughter] And I looked at him, and the—and the Chancellor of Germany said, ""What would you say, Mr. President, if you picked up the paper tomorrow in the London Times, and London Times said, 'A thousand people break through the House of Commons, break down the doors, two bobbies are killed in order to stop the election of the Prime Minister.' What would you say?"" And I never thought about it from that perspective. What would we say that happened in another democracy around the world? Well, the whole world watched—the whole world watched. And what's going on? Well, guess what? It's not going happen. He's not—you know what's going to happen if he loses—and he's going to lose. You know, this guy has an interesting vocabulary. He calls immigrants ""vermin"" who ""poison the blood"" of the Nation. No—— Audience members. Boo! The President. It's hard to make this up. And he says they threaten our very democracy. He said—folks, we must make clear where we stand. Well, we have to make sure we stand for the truth and will defeat the lies. We must make it clear that in America, just like all of you do in Nevada, we still believe in honesty, decency, dignity, respect. Folks—— Audience member. You'd better win, Joe! Audience member. Get 'em, Joe! The President. Well, you're right—— Audience member. We love you, Joe! The President. Well, that's the reason I'm running, because we have to win. Audience member. Thank you! The President. No, no. I give you my word. We have to. It's not much of a choice here. Look, we're the most unique nation in the history of the world. I'll end with this. And that sounds like hyperbole, like Americans beating their chest, but we are. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. Every other nation is built based on ethnicity, religion, or other common traits. The only—thing we're built on is that ""we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all women and men are created equal, endowed by their Creator,"" et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it before. We've never—we leave nobody behind in America. We believe everyone deserves a fair shot—just a fair shot. My dad used to say—and he'd say at the dinner table—my dad was a well-read guy who didn't get to go to college because of the war. And—but he'd come home before he went back to close the business he was manager of. And we'd have a conversation and, incidentally, eat. And he'd look and he'd say, many times: ""Joey, remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about your place in the community. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay.'"" He meant it. We don't give hate any safe harbor in America. We believe in America. We know what the stakes are. We must keep the White House and keep the Senate by reelecting Jacky Rosen. And, folks, we have to win. We have to win back the House of Representatives and win it up and down the ticket—and State and locally. And that's why we have to get more people to register to vote after this primary—to do that—to do that in the primary. Anybody wondering, tell them—where they vote—go to iwillvote.com. And here in Nevada—here in Nevada—you'll know—you'll be given exactly where you vote. We have to must—we have to organize, mobilize, vote. When we do that, we'll be able to look back and say something few generations have ever been able to say. When American democracy was at risk, like it is now, you all saved it. [Applause] I mean it. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America. And there is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. We're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went in. And that's what we're going to do again. May God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. [At this point, music began to play. The President then resumed his remarks as follow.]  Every time—every time I'd walk out of my Grandpop Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandma—""No, Joey, spread it."" Let's go spread the faith, guys.","['hello', 'nevada', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'crowd', 'melvin', 'introduction', 'congressman', 'steven', 'horsford', 'friend', 'incredible', 'leader',

[Laughter]"", ""And thanks to the elected officials here today, including someone—I keep telling her I think we're related. We come from the same—our families come from the same county in Ireland. Representative Scanlon, where is she? [Laughter] There you are. You're doing a hell of a job representing this district."", ""If you're tired, you probably watched my address last night. [Laughter] I got my usual warm reception from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] In my address, I spoke about how far we've come since we took office. And I talked about how much is at stake."", ""Folks, our freedoms really are on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take away our freedoms. That's not an exaggeration. Well, guess what? We will not let him. We will not let him."", 'Last night, at the U.S. Capitol, the same building where our freedoms came under assault on July the 6th—excuse me, January the 6th, we talked about another [a mother in; White House correction] Alabama. Fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to another Alabaman—thanks to the miracle of IVF.', 'She scheduled treatments to have a second child. But the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait.', ""What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks, do you know why it happened? I'll tell you why. One reason: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, he's bragged about it repeatedly that he's the reason it got overturned. He got his wish."", 'And States are passing bans, criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their State to get care. And now, MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period.', 'Audience members. Boo!', ""The President. Well, take it seriously, folks. Because it's—that's what they're doing—heading for. Hear me loud and clear: This will not happen on my watch. The decision—the decision to over——"", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Thank you.', 'The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, ""Women are not without electoral power or political power."" Clearly, these bragging—[laughter]—anyway. [Laughter] Those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. No clue.', ""They found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot in 2022 and 2023, and they'll find out again in 2024. I mean this from the bottom my heart when I say I thank Vice President Harris for leading on this issue and so many others."", 'You know—and, Pennsylvania, I have a message for you: Send me the Congress that I—can support this right, and I promise you, if we take back Congress, we will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land.', ""Look, I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. And we have. I inherited an economy that was—was on the brink. Excuse me. Now our economy is the envy of the world. Fifteen million new jobs in just 3 years—that's a record in American history. Unemployment hit a 50-year low. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs and counting."", ""As I said when I started, where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Wages are up, and inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent."", ""We made so much progress. So now let's talk about the future we can build, because we have more to do. Look, the future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, God love them."", ""For example, Americans pay more—as the pharmacist can tell us, the doc can tell us—for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. And I've been fighting the pharmaceutical industry since I was in the Senate for over 30 years. But guess what? We're ending it."", ""And the law I proposed and signed, no one—not one Republican voted for it, but we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month, for example, on insulin for seniors, they only have to pay 35 bucks. And by the way, it only costs $10 to make. They're still paying thirty—they're still getting a big profit."", ""But look, I'm not stopping there. Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it, not just seniors."", ""I finally beat Big Pharma. And now we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, just like the VA does for our military. This doesn't just save seniors money; it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars, cutting the deficit."", ""Now it's time to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs. You know, it's going to save the taxpayers another $200 billion. It already saved $160 billion off your taxes because the Medicare doesn't have to pay that bill."", ""Folks, starting next year—the bill I got passed, we're capping the total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year."", ""And my goal next year: Let's do that for all of America—all of America. Let's cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone."", ""And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. Over 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. But Donald Trump has announced he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and his Republican colleagues tried 49 other times in the last—since Obamacare was passed. But it's not going to happen on my watch."", ""Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. I'm proposing an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month over the next 2 years to put toward their mortgage if they are buying for the first home or if in fact they're moving into a larger place because they're afraid they're going to lose the mortgage rate they have."", ""But guess what? I can't guarantee it, but I'll bet you—I'll bet you—those rates come down more because I bet you that that little outfit that sets interest rates is going to come down. [Laughter] It's going to come down."", ""And, folks, we're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and apartments and bring those rents down."", ""And by the way, a lot of my Republican friends that's costing a lot of money and raising the deficit. Guess what? We cut the deficit. It cut the deficit $1 trillion. The last guy ballooned the deficit."", 'We passed a budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. They kept trying to get out of it, but they finally agreed.', ""And now it's my goal to cut the Federal deficit by $3 billion more—$3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy—and I'm a capitalist, by the way. You can go make a million bucks; you make a billion, good for you. But pay your taxes."", ""We have a thousand billionaires in America—a thousand. And guess how much they're—what their tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Anybody want to trade your tax rate with them?"", ""I'm—think about that. Eight-point-three percent—a billionaire."", 'Audience member. I pay more than that.', 'The President. Donald Trump—you sure in hell do. [Laughter]', 'Look, Donald Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut when he was President, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy, and exploded the Federal deficit—exploded it. We cut the deficit. And we [he; White House correction] added more to the national debt than any President in his term in all of history—and under Donald Trump.', 'These guys talk about—oh. [Laughter]', ""Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits, charging you more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing."", ""Looks like companies that—that you wouldn't notice—they thought you wouldn't notice. But you know, if you're—they give you the same sized bag of potato chips with about 20-percent fewer potato chips in it. [Laughter] No, by the way, that's not a joke."", ""Some of you may have seen, there was a TV thing on how Snickers bars—same exact price with a—don't hold me to the exact number—but, like, 20-percent less bar. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Congress needs to sign Bobby Casey's bill to stop shrinkflation—stop it."", 'These are—in the family I grew up in, these are kitchen table issues.', ""I'm also getting junk fees for those hidden fees added to the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8."", ""And by the way, I'm not being arbitrary. The law says they can charge for a late fee what it costs them to collect it. It does not cost anywhere near $32, but they make, over time—over that period, billions of dollars. Literally, it stunned me."", ""You've got 450,000 people paying those late fees. And they charge—that's what we're—they end up paying over $2 billion. The banks and credit card companies don't like it. Why? I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with those junk fees by eliminating them—$20 billion."", ""And by the way, I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. Those are the two places I grew up. And you know what? That made a difference in my household, if you had to pay an extra 50 bucks a month, 100 bucks a month, for things. That wasn't fair. It matters, and so does this."", 'Folks, does anybody think the Tax Code is fair?', 'Audience members. No!', ""The President. No, I mean it. I'm serious. I don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair."", 'Under my plan, nobody making less than $400,000 a year, which I had never made—[laughter]—until I became President—[laughter]—will pay one penny in additional tax—nobody—not one penny.', ""But big corporations—[applause]. Big corporations will finally have to begin to pay their fair share. No, really, this is just fairness. It's about fairness and decency. This is not a—we're not making this stuff up."", 'In 2020, 50—you may remember, this was a big fight I had with the Republicans. In 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion in profit and paid zero in Federal taxes.', 'Audience members. Boo!', 'The President. Well, I was determined to change that. And guess what? Not anymore.', ""Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. It's only 15 percent. It's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes."", ""This time, we're going to raise the minimum tax to corporations to at least 21 percent. And so every billion-dollar corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. Look, I want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, corporate jets, massive executive pay that gets deducted."", ""Look, as I said, there are a thousand billionaires in America, and their Federal tax rate is 8.2 percent. I said 3 before. That's far less than the vast majority of you pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a teacher or a sanitation worker or a nurse. No, I mean—[applause]."", ""That's why I proposed not the highest tax, the minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—just 25. And guess what? Do you know how much money that would raise over the next 10 years? Five hundred billion dollars."", ""And imagine what that could do for America and for our future. It could cut the deficit, it could provide for childcare, it could provide—I mean, there's so much that we need to do—and not raise the deficit."", ""Well, let's invest in—and let's continue to invest in the future by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don't know—even—since I've been President, I've gone with the—with all the folks from my administration. I have flown over those wildfires out West and in the Northwest, in the Southwest. I've—literally in a helicopter, all of them. And guess what? It's burned down more timber and more housing than comprises the entire State of Maryland."", ""We're taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world. They said I couldn't get it passed. We got $369 billion passed for climate change and still cut the deficit."", 'And America is safe—America is safer today than when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up to 30 percent nationwide, the biggest increase in American history under the last guy. And now, through the American Rescue Plan—which every Republican voted against, I might add—I made the largest investment in public safety ever.', ""Last year, murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime led—fell to one of the lowest levels more than—in more than 50 years. I'm ramping up Federal enforcement to violence—for the Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women."", 'These guys fought taking away guns from domestic abusers.', ""I mean, I don't know where they're—we beat the NRA when I proposed and signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. Now we have to beat NRA again. I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I did it once."", 'And pass universal background checks. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers. Look, imagine if tobacco had the same limitations—companies—that gun manufacturers. The only major corporation in America—industry in America that you cannot sue is gun manufacturers. Think about that. Imagine if that had been the case with tobacco, how many more people would be dying of cancer.', ""Look, there's a lot more to say. But I'm keeping you standing too long. I know—[laughter]—I know—I know—[applause]."", 'Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!', 'The President. Look, I was watching on television last night about 2 in the morning, after we got back to the house—[laughter]—the house—the White House. [Laughter] Still think of—hard to think of it as home. [Laughter]', 'I had the TV on. And there was a Fox News commentator saying: ""You know, Biden is changing from trickle-down economics to build from the middle out and the bottom up. It\'s going to ruin America."" Ruin America? We have the strongest economy in the world right now.', ""And like I said—well, like I said—and I mean this sincerely, and I've believed it my whole career and finally got it done: If we focus on the middle class, first of all—first of all—they're the heart and soul and sinew of the country. If you focus on them and give them an even chance, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very, very well—still do very well."", ""As I said, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism, when it turns to engaged in noncompetition, it ends up being just stealing."", ""Let me close with this. I know you're thinking that I couldn't have been around very long. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever before. I know the American story. I've seen it again and again, in contests between competing forces for the battle for the soul of this Nation."", ""Some of you may remember when I ran in 2020, I got criticized by the press for saying I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of America; two, to build the middle class so we can begin to grow again and everybody have an even chance; and, three, to unite the country. They're still my goals. They're still my goals."", ""Audience member. That's why you're my President, Joe!"", 'The President. Well, thank you.', 'Because the soul of the country is who we are. Look, you know, did you ever think—those of you who are over 40—[laughter]—did you ever think we\'d be in a situation where we talk to each other like we talk these days? Why you see things that we see that, no matter how tense things were—and they\'re really tough in other parts of our history—when you ride down the street, and there\'s a Trump banner with a ""F- you"" on it—[laughter]—and a little—and a 6-year-old kid putting up his middle finger. [Laughter]', ""Did you ever see—no, I'm serious. Did you every think you'd hear people talk the way they do? Look, it demeans—it demeans—who we are. That's not who—that's not America. Those between—those—look, those of us who want to pull America back at the past and those who want to move into the future."", ""My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future—I mean it sincerely—freedom, democracy, a future based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency, fairness, equality, just treating people just fairly. No, I really mean it. We don't always live up, but that—there—that's the American creed."", 'Donald Trump sees the story differently.

Biden,2024,0.0,"The President. I think I should go home now. [Laughter] Hello, Delco! I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And thanks to the elected officials here today, including someone—I keep telling her I think we're related. We come from the same—our families come from the same county in Ireland. Representative Scanlon, where is she? [Laughter] There you are. You're doing a hell of a job representing this district. If you're tired, you probably watched my address last night. [Laughter] I got my usual warm reception from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] In my address, I spoke about how far we've come since we took office. And I talked about how much is at stake. Folks, our freedoms really are on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take away our freedoms. That's not an exaggeration. Well, guess what? We will not let him. We will not let him. Last night, at the U.S. Capitol, the same building where our freedoms came under assault on July the 6th—excuse me, January the 6th, we talked about another [a mother in; White House correction] Alabama. Fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to another Alabaman—thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have a second child. But the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks, do you know why it happened? I'll tell you why. One reason: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, he's bragged about it repeatedly that he's the reason it got overturned. He got his wish. And States are passing bans, criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their State to get care. And now, MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, take it seriously, folks. Because it's—that's what they're doing—heading for. Hear me loud and clear: This will not happen on my watch. The decision—the decision to over—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, ""Women are not without electoral power or political power."" Clearly, these bragging—[laughter]—anyway. [Laughter] Those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. No clue. They found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot in 2022 and 2023, and they'll find out again in 2024. I mean this from the bottom my heart when I say I thank Vice President Harris for leading on this issue and so many others. You know—and, Pennsylvania, I have a message for you: Send me the Congress that I—can support this right, and I promise you, if we take back Congress, we will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Look, I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. And we have. I inherited an economy that was—was on the brink. Excuse me. Now our economy is the envy of the world. Fifteen million new jobs in just 3 years—that's a record in American history. Unemployment hit a 50-year low. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs and counting. As I said when I started, where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Wages are up, and inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent. We made so much progress. So now let's talk about the future we can build, because we have more to do. Look, the future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, God love them. For example, Americans pay more—as the pharmacist can tell us, the doc can tell us—for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. And I've been fighting the pharmaceutical industry since I was in the Senate for over 30 years. But guess what? We're ending it. And the law I proposed and signed, no one—not one Republican voted for it, but we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month, for example, on insulin for seniors, they only have to pay 35 bucks. And by the way, it only costs $10 to make. They're still paying thirty—they're still getting a big profit. But look, I'm not stopping there. Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it, not just seniors. I finally beat Big Pharma. And now we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, just like the VA does for our military. This doesn't just save seniors money; it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars, cutting the deficit. Now it's time to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs. You know, it's going to save the taxpayers another $200 billion. It already saved $160 billion off your taxes because the Medicare doesn't have to pay that bill. Folks, starting next year—the bill I got passed, we're capping the total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year. And my goal next year: Let's do that for all of America—all of America. Let's cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. Over 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. But Donald Trump has announced he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and his Republican colleagues tried 49 other times in the last—since Obamacare was passed. But it's not going to happen on my watch. Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. I'm proposing an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month over the next 2 years to put toward their mortgage if they are buying for the first home or if in fact they're moving into a larger place because they're afraid they're going to lose the mortgage rate they have. But guess what? I can't guarantee it, but I'll bet you—I'll bet you—those rates come down more because I bet you that that little outfit that sets interest rates is going to come down. [Laughter] It's going to come down. And, folks, we're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and apartments and bring those rents down. And by the way, a lot of my Republican friends that's costing a lot of money and raising the deficit. Guess what? We cut the deficit. It cut the deficit $1 trillion. The last guy ballooned the deficit. We passed a budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. They kept trying to get out of it, but they finally agreed. And now it's my goal to cut the Federal deficit by $3 billion more—$3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy—and I'm a capitalist, by the way. You can go make a million bucks; you make a billion, good for you. But pay your taxes. We have a thousand billionaires in America—a thousand. And guess how much they're—what their tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Anybody want to trade your tax rate with them? I'm—think about that. Eight-point-three percent—a billionaire. Audience member. I pay more than that. The President. Donald Trump—you sure in hell do. [Laughter] Look, Donald Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut when he was President, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy, and exploded the Federal deficit—exploded it. We cut the deficit. And we [he; White House correction] added more to the national debt than any President in his term in all of history—and under Donald Trump. These guys talk about—oh. [Laughter] Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits, charging you more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing. Looks like companies that—that you wouldn't notice—they thought you wouldn't notice. But you know, if you're—they give you the same sized bag of potato chips with about 20-percent fewer potato chips in it. [Laughter] No, by the way, that's not a joke. Some of you may have seen, there was a TV thing on how Snickers bars—same exact price with a—don't hold me to the exact number—but, like, 20-percent less bar. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Congress needs to sign Bobby Casey's bill to stop shrinkflation—stop it. These are—in the family I grew up in, these are kitchen table issues. I'm also getting junk fees for those hidden fees added to the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8. And by the way, I'm not being arbitrary. The law says they can charge for a late fee what it costs them to collect it. It does not cost anywhere near $32, but they make, over time—over that period, billions of dollars. Literally, it stunned me. You've got 450,000 people paying those late fees. And they charge—that's what we're—they end up paying over $2 billion. The banks and credit card companies don't like it. Why? I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with those junk fees by eliminating them—$20 billion. And by the way, I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. Those are the two places I grew up. And you know what? That made a difference in my household, if you had to pay an extra 50 bucks a month, 100 bucks a month, for things. That wasn't fair. It matters, and so does this. Folks, does anybody think the Tax Code is fair? Audience members. No! The President. No, I mean it. I'm serious. I don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody making less than $400,000 a year, which I had never made—[laughter]—until I became President—[laughter]—will pay one penny in additional tax—nobody—not one penny. But big corporations—[applause]. Big corporations will finally have to begin to pay their fair share. No, really, this is just fairness. It's about fairness and decency. This is not a—we're not making this stuff up. In 2020, 50—you may remember, this was a big fight I had with the Republicans. In 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion in profit and paid zero in Federal taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I was determined to change that. And guess what? Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. It's only 15 percent. It's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. This time, we're going to raise the minimum tax to corporations to at least 21 percent. And so every billion-dollar corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. Look, I want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, corporate jets, massive executive pay that gets deducted. Look, as I said, there are a thousand billionaires in America, and their Federal tax rate is 8.2 percent. I said 3 before. That's far less than the vast majority of you pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a teacher or a sanitation worker or a nurse. No, I mean—[applause]. That's why I proposed not the highest tax, the minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—just 25. And guess what? Do you know how much money that would raise over the next 10 years? Five hundred billion dollars. And imagine what that could do for America and for our future. It could cut the deficit, it could provide for childcare, it could provide—I mean, there's so much that we need to do—and not raise the deficit. Well, let's invest in—and let's continue to invest in the future by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don't know—even—since I've been President, I've gone with the—with all the folks from my administration. I have flown over those wildfires out West and in the Northwest, in the Southwest. I've—literally in a helicopter, all of them. And guess what? It's burned down more timber and more housing than comprises the entire State of Maryland. We're taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world. They said I couldn't get it passed. We got $369 billion passed for climate change and still cut the deficit. And America is safe—America is safer today than when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up to 30 percent nationwide, the biggest increase in American history under the last guy. And now, through the American Rescue Plan—which every Republican voted against, I might add—I made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime led—fell to one of the lowest levels more than—in more than 50 years. I'm ramping up Federal enforcement to violence—for the Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women. These guys fought taking away guns from domestic abusers. I mean, I don't know where they're—we beat the NRA when I proposed and signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. Now we have to beat NRA again. I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I did it once. And pass universal background checks. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers. Look, imagine if tobacco had the same limitations—companies—that gun manufacturers. The only major corporation in America—industry in America that you cannot sue is gun manufacturers. Think about that. Imagine if that had been the case with tobacco, how many more people would be dying of cancer. Look, there's a lot more to say. But I'm keeping you standing too long. I know—[laughter]—I know—I know—[applause]. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, I was watching on television last night about 2 in the morning, after we got back to the house—[laughter]—the house—the White House. [Laughter] Still think of—hard to think of it as home. [Laughter] I had the TV on. And there was a Fox News commentator saying: ""You know, Biden is changing from trickle-down economics to build from the middle out and the bottom up. It's going to ruin America."" Ruin America? We have the strongest economy in the world right now. And like I said—well, like I said—and I mean this sincerely, and I've believed it my whole career and finally got it done: If we focus on the middle class, first of all—first of all—they're the heart and soul and sinew of the country. If you focus on them and give them an even chance, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very, very well—still do very well. As I said, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism, when it turns to engaged in noncompetition, it ends up being just stealing. Let me close with this. I know you're thinking that I couldn't have been around very long. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever before. I know the American story. I've seen it again and again, in contests between competing forces for the battle for the soul of this Nation. Some of you may remember when I ran in 2020, I got criticized by the press for saying I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of America; two, to build the middle class so we can begin to grow again and everybody have an even chance; and, three, to unite the country. They're still my goals. They're still my goals. Audience member. That's why you're my President, Joe! The President. Well, thank you. Because the soul of the country is who we are. Look, you know, did you ever think—those of you who are over 40—[laughter]—did you ever think we'd be in a situation where we talk to each other like we talk these days? Why you see things that we see that, no matter how tense things were—and they're really tough in other parts of our history—when you ride down the street, and there's a Trump banner with a ""F- you"" on it—[laughter]—and a little—and a 6-year-old kid putting up his middle finger. [Laughter] Did you ever see—no, I'm serious. Did you every think you'd hear people talk the way they do? Look, it demeans—it demeans—who we are. That's not who—that's not America. Those between—those—look, those of us who want to pull America back at the past and those who want to move into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future—I mean it sincerely—freedom, democracy, a future based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency, fairness, equality, just treating people just fairly. No, I really mean it. We don't always live up, but that—there—that's the American creed. Donald Trump sees the story differently. He sees a story of resentment, revenge, retribution. I've been working like hell to unite Europe, NATO, and make sure Ukraine doesn't get crushed by this dictator in Russia. But you know, the fact is that you have a President who literally has invited Putin to do what it wants—do what the hell it wants if it could come into Ukraine. He thinks Putin is a strong—basically, he's a decent guy. You know who he's meeting with today in—down in Mar-a-Lago? Audience member. Orban. The President. Orban of Hungary, who has stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works; he's looking for dictatorship. The only member of NATO—that's who he's meeting with. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we defend our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has a fair shot and the wealthy pay their fair share. And I see a future where the planet moves from the climate crisis and our country away from the gun violence that we have so much of. I see a future where America remains the beacon of the world. I've been doing foreign policy since I was a kid in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I've gone now—I spent over almost 200 hours with the leaders of Europe, the heads of state. I know them all. I've known them well. And guess what? You know what every one of them says to me, virtually—except Orban—[laughter]—I'm serious—as we leave these meetings? Audience members. Four more years? [Laughter] The President. Well, indirectly. They grab my arm, and they pull me aside. I'm serious. They pull me aside and say, ""You've got to—he can't win again""—[laughter]—""because my democracy""—meaning their country—""my democracy is at stake."" ""My democracy is at stake."" Folks, above all, I see a country for all Americans, a future for all of Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. Because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to be here. Thank you. [At this point, the First Lady joined the President on stage.] By the way—by the way, you know, she talked about how she fell in love with me. The First Lady. Oh, no. No. The President. I had to ask this woman five times to marry me—[laughter]—five. And finally, the fifth time, I was down in South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela when I was a Senator. I came back to her apartment in Wilmington, Delaware, when I got off the plane. I knocked on the door and said: ""Jill, you've got my Irish up. I'm asking you one more time."" [Laughter] ""Only one more time. Not when, but will you marry me?"" And she goes like this: ""Okay."" [Laughter] I tell you what, she did it. I married a Philly girl.","The President. I think I should go home now. [Laughter] Hello, Delco! I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And thanks to the elected officials here today, including someone—I keep telling her I think we're related. We come from the same—our families come from the same county in Ireland. Representative Scanlon, where is she? [Laughter] There you are. You're doing a hell of a job representing this district. If you're tired, you probably watched my address last night. [Laughter] I got my usual warm reception from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. [Laughter] In my address, I spoke about how far we've come since we took office. And I talked about how much is at stake. Folks, our freedoms really are on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take away our freedoms. That's not an exaggeration. Well, guess what? We will not let him. We will not let him. Last night, at the U.S. Capitol, the same building where our freedoms came under assault on July the 6th—excuse me, January the 6th, we talked about another [a mother in; White House correction] Alabama. Fourteen months ago, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to another Alabaman—thanks to the miracle of IVF. She scheduled treatments to have a second child. But the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. She was told her dream would have to wait. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks, do you know why it happened? I'll tell you why. One reason: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to overturn Roe v. Wade. In fact, he's bragged about it repeatedly that he's the reason it got overturned. He got his wish. And States are passing bans, criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their State to get care. And now, MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, take it seriously, folks. Because it's—that's what they're doing—heading for. Hear me loud and clear: This will not happen on my watch. The decision—the decision to over—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. The decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, ""Women are not without electoral power or political power."" Clearly, these bragging—[laughter]—anyway. [Laughter] Those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. No clue. They found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot in 2022 and 2023, and they'll find out again in 2024. I mean this from the bottom my heart when I say I thank Vice President Harris for leading on this issue and so many others. You know—and, Pennsylvania, I have a message for you: Send me the Congress that I—can support this right, and I promise you, if we take back Congress, we will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. Look, I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our Nation's history. And we have. I inherited an economy that was—was on the brink. Excuse me. Now our economy is the envy of the world. Fifteen million new jobs in just 3 years—that's a record in American history. Unemployment hit a 50-year low. Eight hundred thousand new manufacturing jobs and counting. As I said when I started, where is it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world again? Wages are up, and inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent. We made so much progress. So now let's talk about the future we can build, because we have more to do. Look, the future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share, God love them. For example, Americans pay more—as the pharmacist can tell us, the doc can tell us—for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. And I've been fighting the pharmaceutical industry since I was in the Senate for over 30 years. But guess what? We're ending it. And the law I proposed and signed, no one—not one Republican voted for it, but we finally beat Big Pharma. Instead of paying $400 a month, for example, on insulin for seniors, they only have to pay 35 bucks. And by the way, it only costs $10 to make. They're still paying thirty—they're still getting a big profit. But look, I'm not stopping there. Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it, not just seniors. I finally beat Big Pharma. And now we're giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, just like the VA does for our military. This doesn't just save seniors money; it's saving taxpayers billions of dollars, cutting the deficit. Now it's time to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for even more drugs. You know, it's going to save the taxpayers another $200 billion. It already saved $160 billion off your taxes because the Medicare doesn't have to pay that bill. Folks, starting next year—the bill I got passed, we're capping the total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year, even for expensive cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14-, $15,000 a year. And my goal next year: Let's do that for all of America—all of America. Let's cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. Over 100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of preexisting conditions. But Donald Trump has announced he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and his Republican colleagues tried 49 other times in the last—since Obamacare was passed. But it's not going to happen on my watch. Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. I'm proposing an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month over the next 2 years to put toward their mortgage if they are buying for the first home or if in fact they're moving into a larger place because they're afraid they're going to lose the mortgage rate they have. But guess what? I can't guarantee it, but I'll bet you—I'll bet you—those rates come down more because I bet you that that little outfit that sets interest rates is going to come down. [Laughter] It's going to come down. And, folks, we're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and apartments and bring those rents down. And by the way, a lot of my Republican friends that's costing a lot of money and raising the deficit. Guess what? We cut the deficit. It cut the deficit $1 trillion. The last guy ballooned the deficit. We passed a budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade. They kept trying to get out of it, but they finally agreed. And now it's my goal to cut the Federal deficit by $3 billion more—$3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy—and I'm a capitalist, by the way. You can go make a million bucks; you make a billion, good for you. But pay your taxes. We have a thousand billionaires in America—a thousand. And guess how much they're—what their tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Anybody want to trade your tax rate with them? I'm—think about that. Eight-point-three percent—a billionaire. Audience member. I pay more than that. The President. Donald Trump—you sure in hell do. [Laughter] Look, Donald Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut when he was President, overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy, and exploded the Federal deficit—exploded it. We cut the deficit. And we [he; White House correction] added more to the national debt than any President in his term in all of history—and under Donald Trump. These guys talk about—oh. [Laughter] Too many corporations raise their prices and pad their profits, charging you more and more for less and less. That's why we're cracking down on corporations engaged in price gouging and deceptive pricing. Looks like companies that—that you wouldn't notice—they thought you wouldn't notice. But you know, if you're—they give you the same sized bag of potato chips with about 20-percent fewer potato chips in it. [Laughter] No, by the way, that's not a joke. Some of you may have seen, there was a TV thing on how Snickers bars—same exact price with a—don't hold me to the exact number—but, like, 20-percent less bar. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Congress needs to sign Bobby Casey's bill to stop shrinkflation—stop it. These are—in the family I grew up in, these are kitchen table issues. I'm also getting junk fees for those hidden fees added to the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we're cutting credit card late fees from $32 to $8. And by the way, I'm not being arbitrary. The law says they can charge for a late fee what it costs them to collect it. It does not cost anywhere near $32, but they make, over time—over that period, billions of dollars. Literally, it stunned me. You've got 450,000 people paying those late fees. And they charge—that's what we're—they end up paying over $2 billion. The banks and credit card companies don't like it. Why? I'm saving American families $20 billion a year with those junk fees by eliminating them—$20 billion. And by the way, I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware. Those are the two places I grew up. And you know what? That made a difference in my household, if you had to pay an extra 50 bucks a month, 100 bucks a month, for things. That wasn't fair. It matters, and so does this. Folks, does anybody think the Tax Code is fair? Audience members. No! The President. No, I mean it. I'm serious. I don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody making less than $400,000 a year, which I had never made—[laughter]—until I became President—[laughter]—will pay one penny in additional tax—nobody—not one penny. But big corporations—[applause]. Big corporations will finally have to begin to pay their fair share. No, really, this is just fairness. It's about fairness and decency. This is not a—we're not making this stuff up. In 2020, 50—you may remember, this was a big fight I had with the Republicans. In 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America made $40 billion in profit and paid zero in Federal taxes. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I was determined to change that. And guess what? Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. It's only 15 percent. It's still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. This time, we're going to raise the minimum tax to corporations to at least 21 percent. And so every billion-dollar corporation finally begins to pay their fair share. Look, I want to end tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, corporate jets, massive executive pay that gets deducted. Look, as I said, there are a thousand billionaires in America, and their Federal tax rate is 8.2 percent. I said 3 before. That's far less than the vast majority of you pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax than a teacher or a sanitation worker or a nurse. No, I mean—[applause]. That's why I proposed not the highest tax, the minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—just 25. And guess what? Do you know how much money that would raise over the next 10 years? Five hundred billion dollars. And imagine what that could do for America and for our future. It could cut the deficit, it could provide for childcare, it could provide—I mean, there's so much that we need to do—and not raise the deficit. Well, let's invest in—and let's continue to invest in the future by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. I don't know—even—since I've been President, I've gone with the—with all the folks from my administration. I have flown over those wildfires out West and in the Northwest, in the Southwest. I've—literally in a helicopter, all of them. And guess what? It's burned down more timber and more housing than comprises the entire State of Maryland. We're taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world. They said I couldn't get it passed. We got $369 billion passed for climate change and still cut the deficit. And America is safe—America is safer today than when I took office. The year before I took office, murder rates went up to 30 percent nationwide, the biggest increase in American history under the last guy. And now, through the American Rescue Plan—which every Republican voted against, I might add—I made the largest investment in public safety ever. Last year, murder rates saw the sharpest decrease in history. Violent crime led—fell to one of the lowest levels more than—in more than 50 years. I'm ramping up Federal enforcement to violence—for the Violence Against Women Act, which I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women. These guys fought taking away guns from domestic abusers. I mean, I don't know where they're—we beat the NRA when I proposed and signed the most significant gun safety law in 30 years. Now we have to beat NRA again. I'm demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I did it once. And pass universal background checks. Repeal the immunity that protects gun manufacturers. Look, imagine if tobacco had the same limitations—companies—that gun manufacturers. The only major corporation in America—industry in America that you cannot sue is gun manufacturers. Think about that. Imagine if that had been the case with tobacco, how many more people would be dying of cancer. Look, there's a lot more to say. But I'm keeping you standing too long. I know—[laughter]—I know—I know—[applause]. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, I was watching on television last night about 2 in the morning, after we got back to the house—[laughter]—the house—the White House. [Laughter] Still think of—hard to think of it as home. [Laughter] I had the TV on. And there was a Fox News commentator saying: ""You know, Biden is changing from trickle-down economics to build from the middle out and the bottom up. It's going to ruin America."" Ruin America? We have the strongest economy in the world right now. And like I said—well, like I said—and I mean this sincerely, and I've believed it my whole career and finally got it done: If we focus on the middle class, first of all—first of all—they're the heart and soul and sinew of the country. If you focus on them and give them an even chance, the poor have a way up and the wealthy still do very, very well—still do very well. As I said, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism, when it turns to engaged in noncompetition, it ends up being just stealing. Let me close with this. I know you're thinking that I couldn't have been around very long. [Laughter] When you get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever before. I know the American story. I've seen it again and again, in contests between competing forces for the battle for the soul of this Nation. Some of you may remember when I ran in 2020, I got criticized by the press for saying I was running for three reasons: one, to restore the soul of America; two, to build the middle class so we can begin to grow again and everybody have an even chance; and, three, to unite the country. They're still my goals. They're still my goals. Audience member. That's why you're my President, Joe! The President. Well, thank you. Because the soul of the country is who we are. Look, you know, did you ever think—those of you who are over 40—[laughter]—did you ever think we'd be in a situation where we talk to each other like we talk these days? Why you see things that we see that, no matter how tense things were—and they're really tough in other parts of our history—when you ride down the street, and there's a Trump banner with a ""F- you"" on it—[laughter]—and a little—and a 6-year-old kid putting up his middle finger. [Laughter] Did you ever see—no, I'm serious. Did you every think you'd hear people talk the way they do? Look, it demeans—it demeans—who we are. That's not who—that's not America. Those between—those—look, those of us who want to pull America back at the past and those who want to move into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future—I mean it sincerely—freedom, democracy, a future based on the core values that have defined America: honesty, decency, fairness, equality, just treating people just fairly. No, I really mean it. We don't always live up, but that—there—that's the American creed. Donald Trump sees the story differently. He sees a story of resentment, revenge, retribution. I've been working like hell to unite Europe, NATO, and make sure Ukraine doesn't get crushed by this dictator in Russia. But you know, the fact is that you have a President who literally has invited Putin to do what it wants—do what the hell it wants if it could come into Ukraine. He thinks Putin is a strong—basically, he's a decent guy. You know who he's meeting with today in—down in Mar-a-Lago? Audience member. Orban. The President. Orban of Hungary, who has stated flatly he doesn't think democracy works; he's looking for dictatorship. The only member of NATO—that's who he's meeting with. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we defend our freedoms, not take them away. I see a future where the middle class has a fair shot and the wealthy pay their fair share. And I see a future where the planet moves from the climate crisis and our country away from the gun violence that we have so much of. I see a future where America remains the beacon of the world. I've been doing foreign policy since I was a kid in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. And I've gone now—I spent over almost 200 hours with the leaders of Europe, the heads of state. I know them all. I've known them well. And guess what? You know what every one of them says to me, virtually—except Orban—[laughter]—I'm serious—as we leave these meetings? Audience members. Four more years? [Laughter] The President. Well, indirectly. They grab my arm, and they pull me aside. I'm serious. They pull me aside and say, ""You've got to—he can't win again""—[laughter]—""because my democracy""—meaning their country—""my democracy is at stake."" ""My democracy is at stake."" Folks, above all, I see a country for all Americans, a future for all of Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. Because I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who in the hell we are. We are the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to be here. Thank you. [At this point, the First Lady joined the President on stage.] By the way—by the way, you know, she talked about how she fell in love with me. The First Lady. Oh, no. No. The President. I had to ask this woman five times to marry me—[laughter]—five. And finally, the fifth time, I was down in South Africa trying to see Nelson Mandela when I was a Senator. I came back to her apartment in Wilmington, Delaware, when I got off the plane. I knocked on the door and said: ""Jill, you've got my Irish up. I'm asking you one more time."" [Laughter] ""Only one more time. Not when, but will you marry me?"" And she goes like this: ""Okay."" [Laughter] I tell you what, she did it. I married a Philly girl.","['home', 'hello', 'delco', 'im', 'joe', 'biden', 'im', 'jill', 'bidens', 'husband', 'thanks', 'elected', 'officials', 'including', 'someone', 'keep', 'telling', 'related',

Pay your fair share of Federal taxes. Do you know how much they pay? You know what the rate is they pay in Federal taxes? Eight-point-two percent. Raise your hand if you'd trade for that? You'd all take 8.2 percent, wouldn't you? It's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse. That's why I proposed a minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—25—just 25 percent. You know how much money that would raise? Five hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years. Imagine what that could do for America and our—for our future—from lowering the deficit to childcare, home care, paid leave so many other countries have—and still lower the deficit. Look, folks, let me close with this. You're all standing. I'm keeping you too long. I know—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I know the American story. It's a—thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Folks, look, I know the American story. It's a contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of this Nation, between those who want to pull America backwards and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future of freedom and democracy. And Trump and I have a very different value set, if it isn't obvious already. Mine is based on core values that have defined America. And the rest of the world looks at us that way: decency, honesty, fairness, equality. But we all know Donald Trump sees a different America, an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That's not me. That's not you. We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. And, folks, I mean this. As I've traveled the world—I've been in most countries around the world. I know the vast majority of the world leaders because I've been around a day or two. [Laughter] I know I don't look it. [Laughter] But we see a future—I see a future—that must remain the beacon of the world. Above all, we see a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. So join me. Get out the vote. Vote! Vote! Vote! Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. Vote! Folks, from the bottom of my heart, I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is simply nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. So let's do that. Get out to vote. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. [At this point, the President picked up a pin thrown onto the stage.] ""Regulate guns, not women.""","The President. Hello, Atlanta! I'm Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And, Desera, thank you for your introduction. And when you're President and I say—they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" don't say ""Joe who?"" Okay? [Laughter] Mayor Andre Dickenson—Dickens—I just add another syllable to your name. [Laughter] Thank you for the passport into the city, Mr. Mayor. And Reverend Senator Warnock, thank you for your leadership. And thank you for the honor—giving me the honor to speak at your congregation at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Look, Senator Ossoff—you're the best, Jon. You're doing a hell of a job. And he's always, always there, and he votes his conscience, and he's not afraid to stand up for what he believes. To the many Members of the House of Representatives here and all other elected officials, thank you for your service. And to former Atlanta mayor and former member of my team in the White House, Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you. Keisha—I said to her a moment ago—I said, ""We miss you."" And her husband said: ""So did I. I got her."" [Laughter] And, Governor Wes Moore, thank you for coming down from Maryland, man. He's the best, man. He can play. [Laughter] And all of you here today, you know, you're the reason why we're going to win. By the way, that's not hyperbole. You're the reason we're going to win. Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's a guy who's kicking off his general election campaign on the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene. Audience members. Boo! The President. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with. [Laughter] And yesterday he was hosting at his club Viktor Orban—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who says he doesn't think democracy works. Called him a ""fantastic leader."" Seriously. [Laughter] He's been sucking up to win him—[laughter]—anyway—[inaudible]—dictators and authoritarian thugs all around the world. He said the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un wrote him a—quote, ""wrote him a beautiful letter."" [Laughter] He bragged about calling Xi Jinping a ""king."" He called Putin, and he said, ""Do whatever the hell you want to our allies."" Audience members. Boo! The President. I'm not making these—I'm not making these quotes up. When he says he wants to be a dictator, I believe him. But I don't want to get carried away here. [Laughter] Before I begin, I want to say thank you—— Audience member. What are you going to do, Genocide Joe? Tens of thousands of Palestinians—[inaudible]. The President. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Wait, wait, wait. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, thank you. Look, I don't resent—I don't resent—I don't resent his passion. There's a lot of Palestinians who are being unfairly victimized. But, folks, look—— Audience member. Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! The President. ——before I begin, I want to say thank you to all those outstanding Black, Latinos, AAPI organizations supporting Kamala and me. In 2020 and 2022, especially here in Georgia, but all across the country, you called your neighbors, you texted your friends, you knocked on doors, and you never stop. And you're with us all the way. And we're here to say a simple thank you, thank you, thank you. And you're here tonight because you really want to do it again, because you are going to win this primary for us on Tuesday. And because we're going to win in November. So I mean this: Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really mean it. Three years ago, you helped the Democratic ticket and won Georgia a Presidential election for the first time in 30 years. On Thursday, when I gave my State of the Union Address, I talked about how far we've come since the 2020 election. I also talked about how much is at stake. Folks, it's not hyperbole to suggest our freedoms are literally on the ballot this November. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take our freedoms away. And by the way, not all Republicans. This ain't your father's Republican Party. These guys are different. But guess what? We're not going to let them take them away. Thursday night marked 59 years since hundreds of foot soldiers for justice in Selma, Alabama, marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge named after the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan to claim their fundamental right to vote. They were beaten, they are bloodied, they were left for dead, but they were unbowed. Our late friend, son of Georgia, John Lewis, was there. And what happened? Five months later, we passed—the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. But nearly six decades after that, the same forces are back—led by Donald Trump—taking us back in time, suppressing the vote, subverting elections. That's why we have to stand up again. We know what to do. And my message to Georgia voters and to voters all across this country is: Send me a Congress that will pass the Freedom To Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The same forces that want to deny the right to vote try to deny other core values of American diversity as well: banning books, erasing history. Instead of celebrating the contribution of immigrants to our country, to our economy, and our communities, Donald Trump calls them ""vermin,"" ""poison"" in the blooding of—poisoning the blood of America. No one should ever doubt where my heart is. Unlike Donald Trump, on my first day in office as President, I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for ""Dreamers"" and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our community. Because unlike Donald Trump, I know who we are as Americans. It's why I promised to have an administration that looks like America. The most diverse Cabinet and administration in American history led by a [historic; White House correction] Vice President. A court that represents all the people. Sixty-five percent of the judges I've appointed are women. Sixty-five percent are people of color. I've appointed more Black women to the circuit courts than every other President in American history combined and the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. Look, in my State of the Union Address, I talked about the social worker in Alabama. She scheduled an IVF treatment for a second child. But the Supreme Court of Alabama shut down IVF treatments across the State, unleashed by the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Audience members. Boo! The President. What her family has gone through should never have happened. And, folks—folks, you know why this happened. Well, I tell you why: Donald Trump. He came to office determined to see Roe v. Wade overturned. In fact, he brags about it. Well, he got his wish. And States are passing bans that criminalize doctors, forcing rape and incest victims to leave their States to get help. And now MAGA Republicans and Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose. Well, hear me loud and clear: not on my watch. In its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court majority wrote, and I quote, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" As I said in the State of the Union, ""They ain't seen nothing yet."" But they're about to see—they're about to see it, just like we saw it on the ballot in 2022 and 2023. And they'll find out again in 2024. I'm deadly earnest about this. Look, I want to thank Vice President Harris for leading the way on this issue and so many others. And, Georgia, I have a message for you: Send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, and I promise you I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again. Folks, I inherited an economy that was on the brink. But since I took office, we've created 15 million new jobs in just 3 years. That's a record in American history. Eight hundred new manufacturing jobs. I said, ""Where's it written that we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world?"" Unemployment hit a 50-year low—so far. And under Donald Trump, Black and Latino unemployment skyrocketed. Under my administration, we have record low Black and Latino unemployment. Donald Trump, Asian American unemployment nearly doubled. Now—now—the employment rate of Asian Americans is the highest it's been since 2008. Look, we've cut Black child poverty in half, cut Latino poverty by a record as well. We're seeing the fastest rate of new Latino businesses all over this decade. And the next 30 years, it's going to even be bigger. Look, folks, more people have health insurance than ever before. The racial wealth gap is a smallest it's been in 20 years. Wages are back up; inflation is coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 to 3 percent. And we've already accomplished a lot. So now let's talk about the future we can build together. It's about the future. For example, Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else in the world. It's wrong. But I'm ending it. With the law I proposed that we signed, no—not one Republican voted for it, I might add—we finally beat Big Pharma. For example, instead of paying $400 a month for insulin that saves seniors lives, they now only pay $35. Do you know how much it costs to make it? It costs $10. It costs $10 to make it. But I didn't stop there. We capped insulin at 35 bucks a month, and I want to do it for every single American. I finally beat Big Pharma and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for all prescription drugs and—like the VA does. But guess what? It just doesn't save seniors money, it's saving the taxpayers $160 billion, that one thing. Seriously. Cutting the Federal deficit—these guys talk about the debt—I don't want to get into that. I'll get carried—[laughter]. Now it's time to go further and negotiate lower drug prices for every drug. Look, that will save taxpayers, if we do that, another $200 billion because Medicare doesn't have to pay the bill. Beginning in January of next year, it's already the law we passed. We capped prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at total $2,000 a year, no matter how much they cost. Because you—as some of you know, unfortunately, you've experienced it. These cancer drugs can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year. Now let's cap prescription drug costs to $2,000 a year for every American—all Americans. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal. It used to be called ""Obamacare."" Over 100 Americans—100 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of a preexisting condition because of that law. And not only that, we've lowered the cost of insurance by $800 a year for so many families—and on top of it. Donald Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Audience members. Boo! The President. That would mean ripping health insurance away from 3 million Black Americans, 4 million Latinos, and a million Asian Americans. I've got news for Donald Trump: not on my watch. [Laughter] And if Trump and the Republicans try to cut Social Security again, I will stop them. Look, I'm also working to bring down the cost of housing. That's why I want to provide—I want to provide an annual tax credit for the next 2 years of $400 a month, over the next 2 years, as rates come down, to put toward mortgages. If they're—buying your first home or you need to trade up a little for more space. That's what's going to happen. And the interest rates will be down. We're cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price fixing and driving up rents. Now Congress needs to pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable houses and apartments and bring those rents down. Look, we're also removing all poisonous lead pipes in the—millions of them in America so every child can turn on a water fountain at school or at home without risking getting brain damage, because that's what's happening. Look, and I'm making college more affordable. It was hard for me and my brothers and sisters to get through college because it was tough. And the tuitions weren't even anywhere near what they are today. By fixing the student loan program, like the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, I've reduced the burden of student debt for nearly 4 million Americans, including teachers, nurses, firefighters, and other public servants. Donald Trump swears that if he gets elected, he's going to stop it. Well, let me tell you something: He won't stop me. So let's continue to increase Pell grants for working class and middle class families, increase our record investment in HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions. We already contributed over $7 billion to HBCUs. And you know why? Because they're just as bright, just as capable as—though they don't have the endowments. And so they can't—they can't—they don't have the laboratories to train for the new high-tech jobs. But now they will. And now they do. Look, we're building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Donald Trump did just the opposite. He enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the top one-half of 1 percent and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He added more to the national debt in the 4 years he was there than any Presidential term in history—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——so—by the way. Give me a break about reducing the debt. Come on. Folks, how many of you think the Tax Code is fair? Raise your hand. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I sure don't. And I'm going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in Federal tax. Nobody. Not one penny. But big corporations and the very wealthy will finally begin to pay their fair share. In 2020, the 55 largest corporation—of the five—Fortune 500, 55 of those companies made $40 billion in profits, and they didn't pay a single penny in tax. Zero. Audience members. Boo! The President. Not anymore. Thanks to the law I wrote and signed, big companies have to pay a minimum of 15 percent. But 15 percent is still less than working people pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every billion-dollar corporation begins to finally begin to pay their fair share. Look, folks, there are 1,000 billionaires in America—1,000. Look, I'm a—I'm a capitalist. If you make a billion dollars, fine, if you do it fairly. But guess what? Pay your fair share of Federal taxes. Do you know how much they pay? You know what the rate is they pay in Federal taxes? Eight-point-two percent. Raise your hand if you'd trade for that? You'd all take 8.2 percent, wouldn't you? It's far less than the vast majority of Americans pay. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse. That's why I proposed a minimum tax of 25 percent for billionaires—25—just 25 percent. You know how much money that would raise? Five hundred billion dollars over the next 10 years. Imagine what that could do for America and our—for our future—from lowering the deficit to childcare, home care, paid leave so many other countries have—and still lower the deficit. Look, folks, let me close with this. You're all standing. I'm keeping you too long. I know—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I know the American story. It's a—thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Folks, look, I know the American story. It's a contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of this Nation, between those who want to pull America backwards and those who want to move America into the future. My lifetime has taught me to embrace the future of freedom and democracy. And Trump and I have a very different value set, if it isn't obvious already. Mine is based on core values that have defined America. And the rest of the world looks at us that way: decency, honesty, fairness, equality.

We see a future where we define democracy and defend it, not diminish it. We see a future where we defend the basic freedoms, not take them away. We see a future—we see a future where we reward work, not just wealth, where the wealthy pay their fair share. And we see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence. And, folks, I mean this. As I've traveled the world—I've been in most countries around the world. I know the vast majority of the world leaders because I've been around a day or two. [Laughter] I know I don't look it. [Laughter] But we see a future—I see a future—that must remain the beacon of the world. Above all, we see a country for all Americans, a future for all Americans, a Presidency for all Americans. So join me. Get out the vote. Vote! Vote! Vote! Audience members. Vote! Vote! Vote! The President. Vote! Folks, from the bottom of my heart, I believe in America. I believe in you, the American people. We just have to remember who we are, for God's sake. We are the United States of America. There is simply nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. So let's do that. Get out to vote. And God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

But one of the things is that there's three things I want to do. One, I want to restore the soul of this country. When I ran the first time, I meant it. Well, and that sounds like—that sounds like hyperbole, but I just mean basic dignity, basic—just basic sense of dignity and just treating people with respect. I mean, we've—I've been around—I know I don't look it, but I've been around a long while. [Laughter] But all kidding aside, think about it. I've doubt whether those of you who have been around half the time I've been around thought it would ever get to this point in the way we treat one another in politics. It's just not healthy. I—the reason Barack asked me to be his Vice President was because of my background in foreign policy, and I had spent a lot of—an awful lot of time traveling the world and knew almost every major world leader and know them all now as well. And they're wondering about us, when—they're wondering about whether we are the same country we are—have advertised ourselves to be since the end of World War II. There's a lot at stake. And it's about protecting us, not just them. So, when I talk about—everybody wonders why I talk in the middle of a campaign about—about dealing with making sure that Ukraine is taken care of. Well, you know, the message that the President says when he says to Putin, ""Come on, if we—if they don't pay their dues, you just come in and do whatever the hell you want."" You know, you have—I mean, there's things that—anyway. The same thing with regard to dealing with the border. The border—I—the first bill I ever introduced as a—as the President of the United States was essentially what got passed this time out, led by a Republican—by the conservative Republican, who they're vilifying now for having worked out this deal. But look, what we need is we need—is we need to just—an orderly process at the border, not to keep—they're not vermin. They're not scum. They're not people who are all criminals coming. It's just—[applause]. And you know, it's—I think the American people get it, but the way it's being run now is just not—well, I'm going on too long. [Laughter] But look, health care is critically important. I've been fighting from the time I was a kid in the Senate to take on the Big Pharma companies. The idea that it costs $10 to make insulin, $13 to package it all told, and they're selling it for 400 bucks is crazy. It's a rip-off. If you got on Air Force One with me, flew out of here, and I flew you to Toronto, to Berlin, to Rome, to any place in the world and you brought your prescription with you—whatever it is, for whatever product—you're going to pay 40- to 60-percent less in any country you land in for—made by the same company. So it's just about being fair. And the process is, it also cuts the deficit. What we did so far, just reducing the cost of insulin from an average of somewhere around 400 bucks a month to 35 bucks a month—[applause]—well, it's not—it doesn't just help—it doesn't just help the patient. It saved the country $160 billion—$160 billion they're paying out less—because Medicare didn't have to pay it. And the same way with—regarding the Affordable Care Act. You know, 800 bucks, if you have—you have thousands of people here in your State qualifying for it, over—well over 100,000 across the country doing it—more than that, quite frankly—significant more. And the end result of it is that if you didn't have that Affordable Care Act and you had a preexisting condition, you couldn't afford any insurance. So it's just about basic fairness, just basic decency. By the way—I'll stop talking, and I'll take questions, if you want me to. But one of the things that I found interesting is, Trump keeps talking about the deficit. Well, he raised the deficit more in 4 years than any President in American history. We've cut it. We've cut—we've done all this, and we cut the deficit. But it's just about—you know, we've never lived up to, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, endowed by their Creator,"" et cetera. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it. This guy wants to walk away from it. Listen to what he's saying. Listen to what he wants to do. While I was down in Georgia working on health care and making sure that we had the support of all the minority organizations in the country that we support so strongly, he was with Viktor Orban, who talked about democracy being a problem, and telling him how much he understood him and agreed with him. Come on. I mean—so this is not who we are. We've got to make sure that we communicate that. I'm going to be working like the devil. And I'm looking forward to doing more and more of these events than the big events because this is how I used to campaign. You've campaigned with me before. [Laughter] Audience member. A few times. The President. A few times. But really, it's about—it's just getting to look people in the eye, get their feelings. They tell you the truth when you're talking to them. Anyway. Am I allowed to take questions? [Laughter] Anybody here, the staff?","['got', 'little', 'training', 'senator', 'hey', 'folks', 'thanks', 'awful', 'lot', 'cant', 'tell', 'appreciate', 'look', 'stunned', 'write', 'campaign', 'really',

[Applause] And, by the way, we are—we are—a country of immigrants. Audience member. Yes! The President. We're—they are not ""vermin."" And look, you know, the fact of the matter is, all of us are immigrants—every one of us except the Native Americans here. And the fact of the matter is that we—it's what built this country. That's why we're the most unique country in the world, the most powerful nation in the world, the most connected nation in the world. And we've got to take advantage of it, not walk away from it. Any rate. A lot more to talk about, but I want to—just came to say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And by the way, history is watching. History is watching. [The President gestured toward Harry Abramson.] This young man is going to be reading about what we do and don't do. Now, I don't mean me personally—what we do as a generation now. We have a chance to really turn this country in the right direction, move in directions that are—— You know, we have the most vibrant economy in the world. We've got a lot more to do—a lot more to do. We're investing in health care. We're investing in all the things that matter, all the things that your Senator from this State, Johnson, says if back to—if we win, he's going to try to eliminate—eliminate. So, we—this is really important—really important, not because of me, but because of all of you and all we can do. [The President read a sign held by audience member Chris Syrrakos, a cannabis business owner from Menomonee Falls, WI.] So, ""No one should be jailed""—by the way, I'm taking care of that. No one is going to be jailed. [Laughter] No one should be jailed for just using and possessing marijuana and it staying on their record. Mr. Syrrakos. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Shake my hand on that. [The President shook hands with Mr. Syrrakos.] The President. And, by the way—— Mr. Syrrakos. Yes, sir, Mr. President. The President. And, by the way, the fact of the matter is, that stays on their record all—the whole time just for smoking marijuana. Now, if you're out selling it, if you're out growing, it's a different deal. But if you're just using, it should be wiped off your record. Because you have that on your record, you have to—""Have you ever been arrested or do you have a felony on your record?"" You have to put yes. Not anymore. Not anymore. Anyway, we've got to do everything from gun violence to deal with choice. You know, our freedoms are at stake. They really are at stake—not a joke—the right to choose, the right to be able to determine whether you're going to get to vote, how we vote. There's so much more we can do. But I'm talking too much. I just want to talk to you each individually. Thank you all very, very much.","['folks', 'power', 'gwen', 'moore', 'runs', 'whole', 'life', 'runs', 'everything', 'county', 'executive', 'mayor', 'youve', 'got', 'hell', 'crew', 'tell', 'thing', 'campaign', 'particularly', 'milwaukee', 'specifically', 'wisconsin', 'generally', 'several', 'knocking', 'doors', 'old', 'fashioned', 'really', 'gets', 'making', 'contact', 'secondly', 'opened', 'youve', 'got', '44', 'headquarters', '44', 'next', 'days', 'become', 'joe', 'biden', 'waiting', 'room', 'promise', 'wont', 'joe', 'okay', 'folks', 'look', 'weve', 'got', 'lot', 'theres', 'awful', 'lot', 'stake', 'campaign', 'tell', 'understand', 'fully', 'things', 'campaign', 'particularly', 'headquarters', 'milwaukee', 'theres', 'reason', 'theres', 'reason', 'wasnt', 'id', 'afraid', 'gwen', 'kidding', 'aside', 'look', 'ordinary', 'grew', 'neighborhood', 'poor', 'middle', 'class', 'technically', 'lower', 'middle', 'class', 'three', 'bedroom', 'house', 'four', 'kids', 'grandpop', 'living', 'decent', 'wasnt', 'anything', 'left', 'end', 'month', 'started', 'dad', 'used', 'trickle', 'economic', 'program', 'whole', 'hell', 'lot', 'trickled', 'dads', 'kitchen', 'table', 'decided', 'completely', 'different', 'approach', 'govern', 'sure', 'invested', 'built', 'middle', 'bottom', 'occurs', 'wealthy', 'still', 'start', 'paying', 'fair', 'share', 'taxes', 'oh', 'came', 'announcing', '36', 'million', 'project', 'reconnect', 'city', 'never', 'separated', 'place', 'reason', 'city', 'city', 'wilmington', 'delaware', 'grew', 'situation', '95', 'whats', '50', 'audience', 'member', 'ninety', 'four', '50', '94', 'little', 'almost', 'quarter', 'mile', 'wide', 'city', 'divided', 'neighborhood', 'profound', 'impacts', 'economy', 'im', 'im', 'charge', 'program', 'havent', 'funded', 'delaware', 'yet', 'im', 'hells', '3', 'billion', 'across', 'bringing', 'together', 'weve', 'different', 'view', 'opposition', 'guys', 'im', 'running', 'dying', 'nation', 'growing', 'nation', 'behind', 'really', 'mean', 'ive', 'long', 'never', 'ive', 'never', 'optimistic', 'americas', 'prospects', 'never', 'never', 'never', 'sounds', 'hyperbole', 'hands', 'folks', 'across', 'ever', 'ran', 'win', 'lot', 'helped', '2020', 'made', 'sure', 'loser', 'loser', 'sure', 'happens', 'immigrants', 'audience', 'member', 'yes', 'vermin', 'look', 'fact', 'matter', 'immigrants', 'except', 'native', 'fact', 'matter', 'built', 'thats', 'unique', 'powerful', 'nation', 'connected', 'nation', 'weve', 'got', 'advantage', 'walk', 'away', 'rate', 'lot', 'talk', 'came', 'history', 'watching', 'history', 'watching', 'young', 'man', 'reading', 'mean', 'personally', 'generation', 'chance', 'really', 'turn', 'direction', 'move', 'directions', 'vibrant', 'economy', 'weve', 'got', 'lot', 'lot', 'investing', 'health', 'care', 'investing', 'things', 'matter', 'things', 'senator', 'johnson', 'says', 'win', 'hes', 'try', 'eliminate', 'eliminate', 'really', 'important', 'really', 'important', 'jailed', 'im', 'taking', 'care', 'jailed', 'jailed', 'using', 'possessing', 'marijuana', 'staying', 'record', 'mr', 'syrrakos', 'yes', 'sir', 'yes', 'sir', 'shake', 'hand', 'mr', 'syrrakos', 'yes', 'sir', 'mr', 'fact', 'matter', 'stays', 'record', 'whole', 'smoking', 'marijuana', 'youre', 'selling', 'youre', 'growing', 'different', 'deal', 'youre', 'using', 'wiped', 'record', 'record', 'ever', 'arrested', 'felony', 'record', 'put', 'yes', 'anymore', 'anymore', 'anyway', 'weve', 'got', 'everything', 'gun', 'violence', 'deal', 'choice', 'freedoms', 'stake', 'really', 'stake', 'joke', 'choose', 'able', 'determine', 'whether', 'youre', 'vote', 'vote', 'theres', 'im', 'talking', 'talk', 'individually']",8.430578,13.409341,0.05,0.1,0.1

[Laughter] No, I'm serious. If they want to let them run around, that's good by me as well. [Laughter] Look, the bottom line is, if you think about it: All of us in this room have one fundamental difference between us and Trump. And I mean this sincerely. We have a different value set. It gets—to me, you know, I've been campaigning around the country and been in this job for 3 years, and it's—you know, it makes it—the more I've thought about it, it's just fundamentally different. You mentioned vets. Well, you know this is a guy who said, when he wouldn't go up to visit a cemetery of veterans, that they're a bunch of ""losers"" and ""suckers."" My son was one of those ""losers"" and ""suckers."" You know, it just—I just—I've never heard a President say the things that this guy has said. But the difference is he means them. He means what he says. With your help, we got elected the first time around. And this county and this State is really, really, really critical. Number two. [A toddler in the audience cried.] Number two, my campaign manager here, she's had enough. [Laughter] She doesn't like all that noise either. [Laughter] Look, last week, Donald Trump and I clinched the nominations. We're going to beat him again. We not only have this office; we've opened up four offices so far—we're—in this State. Four. And there are going to be more. And, folks, you know, we're going to keep making the case for a second term by lowering the costs and creating more jobs. You know, we have grassroots support. You know, so far, this campaign, we've raised—more than 1,300,000 people have contributed under $200 to us—1,300,000. And 500,000 of those people are brandnew from before. And it's a—[applause]. And, folks, you know, the fact is that the support around the country is real. I mean, it's not just—and it's not just for me. It's for Kamala and for the Democratic Party. The third thing is, you know, we're—we've already created tens of thousands of good-paying jobs right here in this State as well—by the way, clean jobs—jobs that—clean energy jobs. Trump lost millions of jobs—millions when he was President. It's amazing how the nostalgia for a lost 4 years was. I mean, look, Trump passed a tax cut. Here's what he said. He said in Mar-a-Lago when he passed his last tax cut, which increased the deficit—exploded the deficit larger than any President ever has in a 4-year term. And here's what he said. He said, ""I made a lot of you richer."" This time out, he's saying—he was in Mar-a-Lago, and he told a crowd of people—I want to look down and make sure I get it exactly right. He said—he described the crowd as, ""I know you're rich as hell, but that's why I'm going to give you another big tax cut."" The point is, it's about values. What do we value? Who are we? I mean, who are we for? What are we trying to get done? Folks, you know, Trump wants to undo everything we've done. You know, he wants to strip Medicare of the ability to negotiate prices. I've been fighting my whole career as a Senator and then as a Vice President to make sure that Medicare is able to do what the VA is able to do. The VA can negotiate with the drug companies as to how much they're going to pay for all the medicines that come into the VA, but we've never been able to do it. We finally beat them. And not a joke: If we got back on Air Force One here and you picked any State—any capital in the world and said—and brought a prescription you had to have filled by whatever the company is—an American pharmaceutical company—I can—you could fly to Toronto, to London, to Paris, to Budapest, anywhere. I promise you that you can buy it there for 40- to 60-percent less than you're paying for it. How many of you know someone who needs insulin? Okay, well, guess what? It was costing 400 bucks a month on average. It now costs $35 a month. And by the way, they're still making over 300 percent. Do you know how much it costs to make it? Ten dollars—t-e-n. Ten dollars. We also wrote into the law he wants to get rid of that, in fact, no senior, no matter how high the prescription trusts—bills are—and by the way, some of the cancer drugs are $10-, $12-, $14,000, $15,000—will never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for their drug—[applause]—$2,000. And guess what? With your help, if we get elected the next 4 years, we're going to change that to apply to everybody in America. I mean it. When I first passed the insulin, it—it applied to everyone. When I tried to get it reauthorized, I—the Republicans blocked it. But look, folks, the bottom line is, he wants to undo everything we've done. You know, we've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide. We created an awful lot of jobs right here in your State. And by the way, you know, I was—every time I land here, I think of Harry Reid, in Nevada. Harry—Harry and so many of you talked about—talked about the fact that we needed high-speed rail from Vegas to California, to Los Angeles. Well, guess what? It's coming. Well over a billion dollars, man. And you're going to be able to get to—not that anybody wants to get to Los Angeles, but—[laughter]—people from Los Angeles want to get to Nevada. Well, they'll do it in 2 hours instead of 4 and take tens of thousands of vehicles off the road and improve the environment. Look, folks, the fact is that there's a reason why we're doing so well. It's because of union labor. Not a joke. And by the way, that's not a joke. It's a fact. I didn't realize—although I'd been around—you know, I know I've only been around a little—I look like I'm 25, 30, but—[laughter]. But I didn't realize back when the law was passed during the FDR administrations that labor unions were able to organize and the rules—[inaudible]—organization—that they passed a provision in the law that I didn't realize until a couple of years ago—until I—about 8 years ago that existed. It says if a President is given money by the Congress to spend on any American project or individuals that that President must use, one, American products in doing it and, two, must use American labor to do it. As I assume my labor friends will tell you, I've been the most prolabor President in the history of the United States of America for a simple reason. They grow the economy. They grow the economy. I had the Treasury Department do a study. I asked them—I said, ""What is the effect of using union labor on the rest of the economy?"" Everybody does better when unions do better. Everybody does better. Wages up across the board. So, folks, look—I'm going on too long. I apologize. [Music began to play.] [Laughter] That must be my traveling staff. [Laughter] One closing comment. We've never had a President who has said or done some of the things this guy has said. We have thousands upon thousands of people dying in Ukraine. One of the things that Dr. Kissinger said—Henry Kissinger said before—he called about 10 days before he died, and asked if I would speak to him. And so I called—he didn't call. He asked if I'd call him, and I did. And he said—you know, he said, ""Not since the time of—way back when""—— [A toddler in the audience babbled.] Are you really? [Laughter] No, I'm kidding. ""For the longest time, Europe looked over its shoulder at Russia with some dread."" And he said, ""Not since Napoleon have they not looked over their shoulder, until we came along."" He said: ""You've strengthened NATO like it's never been strengthened before. You've united Europe in a way. You've increased NATO and the border of NATO from bringing in Sweden and Norway."" And he says, ""It's changed the world."" This guy is talking about Putin like he's his lost long—long-lost buddy, which he is. No, here's what he said. He said: If Putin—if the—if a NATO member or a European country doesn't do—pay their dues, then come in, do whatever the hell you want, Putin. Folks, this is—this guy is—he has no basis on understanding what American foreign policy is about and what our national security is about. The idea that we'd walk away from a sacred obligation that has existed since World War II, has kept the peace in Europe, is crazy. But look, I'm confident—I'm confident—we get our message out to the American people, we're going to win again. But here's the deal. You're the ones that are going to do it. And that's not hyperbole. I'm not joking with you. It gets on—down to, as we used to say—my football coach, all block and tackling: knocking on doors, calling people, going and making the case face to face with them. That's why we're opening these campaign headquarters. We're opening them all over the country. And we're going to continue to do so, so people can ask questions—people can look us in the eye and ask the questions, and we can have answers—we have answers for them. So the bottom line here is, I feel really good as I go around the country. Not a joke. And by the way, I—and the press are all good guys in here, but—[applause]—but they report a lot of polls. The last four polls out, we're winning. Okay? But guess what? None of these polls mean a damn thing this early on, so we've just got to keep at it. Anybody want to ask me any questions? Q. I have one. The President. Yes. Child Tax Credit/Economic Improvement Efforts  Q. The child family credits really helped save my daughter's family during COVID. Is there any possibility of bringing those back? The President. That is one of the—I—what—I didn't get into—what I plan on doing next time out: We're going to bring back the child tax credit. It cut child poverty in half. And by the way, it grows the economy. When women are able to go to work knowing they have a safely—a safe place for their children, it grows the economy—in terms of education, as well, by the way. We're in a situation where—think about it—you know, a lot of people haven't had the advantage others have had. They may come from a home that is—doesn't have the same background, doesn't have the same educational background, doesn't have books in the house. All the studies show, for example, if a child comes from a broken home where there are no books in the house and mom or dad are having real trouble, they're going to hear a million fewer words spoken before—not the—not different words, total words spoken—than a kid coming from a middle class household. A million. And it puts them—and they start off way, way behind.

How the hell can we lead the world if we don't have the best infrastructure in the world, we don't have the best education in the world, we don't have the best tax system, and so on. And the other thing I'm going to do—I'm going to talk about it down in Vegas—is that we're going to also make sure that we deal with all those things that affect people's daily lives. Look, you know, I come from a house—and I'll end with this.

But what we found out with—there are significant studies being done—that if in fact—if in fact—you have a circumstance where you start a kid in preschool at the age 3, 4, and 5, they have a 50-percent better chance—50 percent of them go on to go all through 12 years and on to college if in fact they have that chance—and it doesn't cost us much. How the hell can we lead the world if we don't have the best infrastructure in the world, we don't have the best education in the world, we don't have the best tax system, and so on. And the other thing I'm going to do—I'm going to talk about it down in Vegas—is that we're going to also make sure that we deal with all those things that affect people's daily lives. Look, you know, I come from a house—and I'll end with this. I'll—come from a household where there was a—we lived in a three-bedroom house—we weren't poor, but my dad—I guess we were technically lower middle class income. We never thought of ourselves that way. But we lived in a decent house, a three-bedroom house, a split-level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. And I—and you know, but there wasn't—on the trickle-down economics—you know, everybody talks about—not a whole hell of a lot ever trickled down on my dad's kitchen table. My dad used to say—for real, not a joke—my dad used to say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect."" For real. For real. ""It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, everything is going to be okay.'"" Well, that's what we're working on. We're building this economy from the middle out and the bottom up. When that happens, everybody does well, including the wealthy. And by the way, I'm a capitalist. If you can make a million bucks or a billion bucks, go make it. Just pay your fair share of taxes. Okay? By the way, you know, we have—in the United States of America, we have a thousand billionaires now since—— Audience members. Wow. The President. A thousand. It was 740 when it was—before the pandemic. Now it's a thousand. And guess what happened? You know how—you know what their—their average tax rate is—Federal tax rate? Eight-point-three percent. I plan on raising it—and we're going to get it done if you give me a Democratic Congress—to 25 percent. That's all. Twenty-five percent. And by the way, guess what that will do? That will raise $400 billion over 10 years. And imagine what we could be doing with childcare, health care, so many other things—— Quick question there. Q. I wanted to ask you, because I know you going to win—[laughter]—I wanted you, when you win, please, support the registry. It's a law that just needs to be adjust and will help—[inaudible]—million immigrants, because, you know, immigrants are the—[inaudible]—base of this country. [Inaudible] The President. All right. Q. It's a—it's a law. It's already 80 years old. It needs to be adjust. Hasn't been adjusted for the last 40 years. So, when you become the President who can—[inaudible]—you will. I wanted to—[laughter]. The President. By the way, get her phone number. I'll call you. Okay? [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Okay? Q. Yes. The President. All right. I know, I know, I know, I know. I've got to go. I—anyway.","['im', 'voting', 'house', 'kids', 'rule', 'worry', 'okay', 'im', 'serious', 'let', 'run', 'around', 'thats', 'look', 'bottom', 'line', 'room', 'fundamental', 'difference', 'trump', 'mean',

[Laughter] Look, one of the reasons why I've spent so much time and effort in dealing with Latino small—Latino universities and Black universities is, they haven't had the endowments these other universities had. So the jobs of the future—the high-tech jobs—they don't have the laboratories. They don't have the ability to train—they—every student is as competent as anybody going to Harvard or Yale or Stanford or anywhere else. But they don't have the—they don't have the means to train. And so that's where the money is going, primarily. It's going not only to get them in school, but to be able to put together the laboratories to train them to be the engineers, the technicians, the people who are going to lead the technology of the future. And look, folks, the fact is that—I shouldn't probably get started on it, but—[laughter]—because I promised I'd be brief because I want to say hello to every one of you, but—[laughter]. Look, this election is not a referendum on me. It's an election between me and a guy named Trump. And this is a guy who—whose—the way he talks about the Latino community is—well, in 2016, he called Latinos ""criminal, drug dealers, and rapists"" when he came down that escalator. Now he says immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country."" What the hell is he talking about? No, I'm serious. Think about it. We are—in fact, the reason we're as good as we are is because we are the most diverse country in the world. Seriously, the most—[applause]. And look, you know, that's not all. He wants to get rid of all the programs we put together—from health care, to education, to small-business help. And Social Security, he wants to cut. He said, ""No, I don't want to cut it."" He just said, ""But there's a lot you can do to trim and cut."" Well, let me tell you something. Folks, he only cares about the wealthy. This—I love this quote from him. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump told his friends, and I quote, ""I know plenty of you, and you're rich as hell, and we're going to give you more tax cuts."" That was recently, okay? Well, that's the last thing I'm going to do, I want to tell you. You may remember when we started off this campaign in 2020, there were 55 major corporations that made $40 billion and didn't pay a single penny in taxes. And I was able to get a 15-percent minimum tax on them and paid for every single thing we did and still cut the budget a trillion dollars. And so, folks, look, let me—let me—[applause]. I don't want to get going, giving a whole speech, because I want to meet you. [Laughter] Let me just tell you one thing. The fact of the matter is, I come from a household that is like maybe a lot of yours. We weren't poor, but we were, I guess, technically, from a financial standpoint, lower middle class. When coal died in Scranton, where I was born, we moved down to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town. And we lived in what later became subsidized housing. It wasn't at the time. It was an apartment complex. And my dad kept trying to figure out how we can own a home. Because you own a home, you can build some equity in a home. When you build equity, you can then save and do—move on from there. And we lived in a three-bedroom split-level home in a development, they called it—45 homes built—the same exact kind of homes. And there were four kids and a grandpop living with us in that home. We never thought we were poor. We never thought we were left behind. But we had to figure out how to get scholarships to go to school. We had to figure out how to pay to get—my dad busted his neck to make sure we had whatever we needed and could have whatever we needed. But the end result of it was that it was—we used to have a thing called trickle-down economics, where if the wealthy did very well, it trickled down, everybody did fine. Well, I observed, nothing ever trickled down to my dad's kitchen table. And so, when I got elected, I decided I was going to build the country from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. That way everybody does well. The wealthy still can do well. They don't pay their taxes very much, but they do well. I'm serious. And the middle class does well, and the poor have a way up. And so that's why we've been able to create all these jobs nationwide. That's why we've been able to grow the economy as we have. And that's just starting to kick in. And, folks, look, you know, I'll end by saying this. The tax system now is not fair. Trump wants another $2 trillion tax cut to be—that's what he says he wants—the first thing he wants to do when he gets elected. Well, his administration caused the biggest deficit in American history in a 4-year period—the biggest in American history. And we've cut deficit by over—by the time it's out, over $2 trillion we've cut the deficit. But here's what he wants to do. He wants to make sure that the biggest corporations continue to benefit. Well, look, in the United States today—and I'll end with this—there are 1,000 billionaires. I'm a capitalist. If you can make a billion dollars, wonderful. If you can make a million dollars, wonderful. But I tell you what: You ought to pay your fair share. You know what—you know what the average—what the tax a billionaire pays—these 100 [1,000; White House correction] billionaires? Eight-point-three percent Federal tax. Every one of you here would trade for that, wouldn't you? Well, let me tell you something. I'm going to make sure it gets raised to a minimum of 25 percent, which is still significantly lower than the top rate. But here's what that would do. If we raised that one thing—if we raised that 25-percent tax, it would raise $500 billion over 10 years—$500 billion. We'd be able to have childcare again for everybody at $300 per kid. We'd be able to make sure that everybody has an access to an education. We'd be able to have early education for families that don't have the capacity. We've been able—we'd be able to do so much more. We'd be able to cut the deficit as well. So, folks, I'm optimistic. America has the capacity to do almost anything. We just have to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. There—[applause]. No, no. And there is nothing—there is nothing—beyond our capacity. We're the only nation in the world that has gone through that I can—and as a—a researcher in history, the only thing—I can—only nation in the world that has gone through—every crisis we've ever gone through, we've come out stronger than we went in—only case, only nation. Let's remember who we are. We're the United States of America. Nothing is beyond our capacity when we work together. And with you all, we're going to work together and change the world here. Not a joke. There is so much more to say, but I'm going to stop now. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","Well, folks, I have to tell you straight up: I like y'all, but I couldn't resist that little baby. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I want to thank you all and thank Luis for that introduction. When you're President and they say, ""Joe Biden is out in the waiting room,"" promise me you won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter] [Inaudible] Folks, look, you know, when I get criticism some places for having such a strong interest in Latino voters and Latino Americans and people here in the country, I point out to them—I say, ""Can you imagine when you have 28 percent of all the students in public school are Latino, and—nationwide—anybody who doesn't pay attention is really stupid."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. Think about it. Think about what this means. Think about the future. There's such enormous opportunities. You know, and I made a historic investment—a $15 billion investment in Hispanic-serving institutions, including Arizona State now. But I should have started off by thanking Mary and Earl. Thank you very, very much. Thank you for very much for hosting us. Small businesses like yours all across America are the glue that holds communities together, and we want to thank you for that. I really mean it. Thank you. Look, and I want to thank my campaign manager you heard speak first. She is a—it's a little bit in her blood. César Chávez is her grandfather. And he's the guy that got me interested. When he came to Delaware when I was running in nineteen—I won't even tell you when—[laughter]—1871. [Laughter] He came to Delaware in the 1970s to help deal with the farmworkers. And we had—we have—Delaware has a gigantic industry in agriculture. That whole thing called the Delmarva Peninsula—Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia—it's a $4 billion industry, primarily in agriculture, but particularly in chickens. And he was organizing. And I got involved with him and in trying to make some headway. [At this point, the President briefly imitated a southern Delaware accent.] And in southern Delaware, they talk at you like this, you know what I mean? [Laughter] And it was one of the best things I ever did in my life, because I learned a whole heck of a lot that I didn't know. You know, and one of the things is that—someone who did so much to improve the lives of Latinos all across Arizona and all across the country, and it's in her blood. It's in her blood deeply. I'm sure it is in a lot of you as well. I'm excited to be down the street from our new campaign headquarters. I don't think we could fit anybody in—everybody in at this moment. But it's in the heart of the community. And we have seven more offices that are—seven offices are opening here and at—by the end of the month. Second thing. You know, we—last time, you're the reason why, in large part, I beat Donald Trump. Let's beat him again. Well, you know, we—I need you. I need you badly. I need the help. Kamala and I desperately need your help, because, look, there's only about six or seven States that are going to determine the outcome of this election. And they're toss-up States, and this is one of them. And I made sure that, by the way, when I got elected that my—I told you my campaign would look like America, my administration would look like America. We have—and I've followed through on that. For example, Secretary Becerra is lowering prescription drug costs. He's heading up one whole agency. Secretary Cardona is easing student debt, among other things. And Administrator Guzman is investing in small business. Look, I want to remind folks, because we turned out in 2020, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for Latinos in a long, long time. We cut Hispanic child poverty to record lows. We lowered the health care costs. We made historic investments in Latino small businesses. And we addressed gun violence in the communities. And we're excited now that ASU is joining the ranks of other historic-serving [Hispanic-serving; White House correction] institutions, because they can get part of that $15 billion now.

Please, take a seat if you have one.', 'And, Amy, thank you for that introduction and for your work as an educator. You know, it was great to meet your family, including your husband Michael, whose uncle Jimmy McNulty was the former mayor and grew up with me in Scranton, Pennsylvania.', ""You know, thanks to the mayor, Paige—excuse me, I'm going to—I was going to talk about the old mayor—Paige Cognetti, for that welcome. And she's been incredible. She's been with me all along the way."", ""It's always great to be with one of America's best Governors, and I mean that sincerely: Josh Shapiro. He's the best. Stand up, Josh. [Applause] Get up."", ""I think Josh and a lot of people are always tired of hearing me talk about Scranton, but it—you know, Scranton is a place that climbs into your heart, and it never leaves. I mean that sincerely. It's home, that's a special thing that's etched into your heart. For me, it was 2446 North Washington Avenue, just a block away from Amy's house. [Laughter]"", ""We used to come back after morning Mass at St. Paul's on Sunday—St. Clare's wasn't built until I had moved—and my grandfather, who worked for the newspaper, and my uncles would hold court around a kitchen table with a guy who was sort of the David Broder of the Pennsylvania press—Scranton press.

They'd talk about what was going on in the world. They were all learned men. And I learned a lot here in Scranton."", 'I learned that money doesn\'t determine your worth.

Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt. I said, ""I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""Nothing I can do."" Look, on a serious note, since I came to office—[laughter]—I've already cut the Federal deficit. You know, all the stuff they talk about what we've done—and I'm going to be self-serving a little bit: Every other—every objective alternative points out we've had the most successful economy of any major economy in the world so far. A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the Federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion—$1 trillion. And I signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade as well. And I know what to cut. I want to cut the Federal deficit even more by making big corporations and the very wealthy begin to finally pay their fair share. We're not asking anything that's unusual. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny. I hope you're all able to make $400,000. [Laughter] I never did. But they're not going to pay an extra penny in Federal taxes. That's a promise. Nobody. Not one penny. You know, I have to say: If Trump's stock in the Truth Social—his company—drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his. [Laughter] It's possible. Folks, look, I want to cut taxes on the hard-working folks here in Scranton and all across the country, in Claymont—where I moved from Scranton to Claymont, in Delaware—all across the country, like Amy's family. In fact, the child tax credit I extended during the pandemic put up to $300 per child—per child [a month; White House correction] in the pockets of around 40 million working families, and it literally cut child poverty in half. And we still reduced the deficit. We still reduced the deficit. That included helping 1.4 million families and nearly 2.4 million children right here in Pennsylvania. Republicans refused to extend it, which raised taxes on working families. I want to restore it—restore the expanded childcare tax credit—because no child should live in poverty in this country—no child. We've got a lot more work to do. I know the cost of housing is so important. I want to provide families like Amy's a $10,000 tax credit to help them buy their first home or trade up for a little more space. Audience member. Thank you. The President. Well, no, it's important. And by the way, it will grow the economy. When Trump was President in 2020, 55 of the largest corporations in America of the Fortune 500 made $40 billion in profit and paid zero—zero—in Federal income taxes. Audience member. Sinful. Sinful. The President. Well, guess what? I came along and took care of the sin. Not anymore. Thanks to the law that I wrote and signed, big corporations now have to pay a minimum—they should be paying more—a minimum of 15 percent-tax. It was a start, but not enough. By doing that 15 percent tax, they pay for every program that people are now benefiting from and still cut the deficit by $70 billion. And by the way, that 15 percent is still less than working people play in Federal tax—pay in Federal taxes. It's time to raise the corporate tax—minimum tax to at least 21 percent so every big corporation finally has to pay their fair share. But you know, Trump and his MAGA friends want to get rid of the corporate minimum tax. With the same law, I gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drugs, which is why those of you have diabetes and need insulin, instead of paying 400 bucks a month, you're now paying $35 a month for insulin. I've been working on taking on Big Pharma my whole career. But guess what? If I put you on Air Force One, we flew out of here, and you went—you name it—you took a prescription you had from a drug company in America, I will take you, any city you name, whether it's Berlin, whether it's in Canada, whether it's in Hungary—wherever it is. And you'll pay 40-, 60-percent less for that same exact prescription. Not a joke. And by the way, when we in fact reduce some—there's much more to come in that health care proposal—that Medicare proposal. For example, seniors, beginning in 2024 [2025; White House correction], no matter how much their prescription drug costs are, they'll never have to pay more than $2,000 a year, no matter what. And by the way, companies will still make money. They'll still make a significant profit—still make a significant profit. It helps reduce the—and by the way, when we do this, it has a benefit, and that's already part of the law I passed. But guess what? Not only does it reduce the Federal deficit—help with the prescription holder, it reduces the Federal debt. You know how much the first tranche of this has done? It's reduced the Federal debt by $160 billion. Why? Because Social Security—Medicare does not have to pay out $400 a month. They're paying out $35 a month. But Trump has committed, if he's reelected, from—gets elected again, he wants to get rid of the law and give Big Pharma the power again to charge again whatever you want, which will also increase the deficit. Folks, are we going to let that happen? Audience members. No! The President. We can't. And that same law empowers the IRS to go after the superwealthy. You know, what—you ever—it's amazing how the—we had passed legislation increasing the number of auditors. Guess who wanted them all cut? No, I'm not joking. Republicans. Why? Because it takes an awful lot of sophistication to be able to go through the tax returns of these billionaires to know what's going on. But while you work hard and pay your taxes, Trump wants to give his billionaire friends the power to avoid paying even what they already owe, not what they should be paying. I know you—if you didn't know better, you'd think I'm making this up, but you can check it all out. Folks, he's coming for your money, your health care, and your Social Security. And we're not going to let it happen. We're not going to—can't let it happen. Look, let me close with this. As you observed—I can't hide it, Scranton fills me with an enormous pride. My mom didn't live in Scranton permanently since 1954. I swear to God, whenever she was asked, no matter where we were: ""Mrs. Biden, where do you live? Where are you from?"" She'd say, ""Scranton."" [Laughter] Do you know anybody who's from Scranton that still doesn't brag about being from Scranton? [Laughter] Look, because I see here what I saw in Claymont, Delaware, where we moved—it used to be a big steel town with 4,000 workers—all gone now. Although, we're back for—with other growth. In Claymont, Delaware, and what I see in so many towns around America: a deep pride—a deep, deep pride—in your work, a deep pride in your family, a deep pride in your community and in your country. I've always thought the World War II monument downtown by City Hall says so much about Scranton. My Uncle Ambrose Finnegan—Bosie Finnegan from North Washington—he served and died in World War II. Right after D-Day, on Sunday, all four of my mother's brothers signed up to go fight in the military. In those days, you could do it—brothers could go off to war together. Fathers and brothers could do the same. And that war—I—and everybody called him Bosie Finnegan. Bosie was a hell of an athlete, but Bosie joined the Army Air Corps before there was an Air Force. And his name is etched on the monument down by City Hall. Here in Scranton, I grew up understanding we have many obligations as a country, but we only have—and I got in trouble for saying this from the time I was a young Senator. We only—we have many—we have only one truly sacred obligation, and that is to equip those we send to war and take care of them and their families when they come home or if they don't come home. I don't want to lose my temper on this. But I think about that statue in town now that I'm Commander in Chief. And I had them double-check if my memory was correct that Uncle Bosie, Ambrose J. Finnegan's name is etched on that statue. I have to say, there are a lot of things that Donald Trump has said and done that I find extremely offensive. But one that offends me the most is when he refused, as President, to visit an American cemetery outside of Paris when he was President. And why? He said that those soldiers who gave their lives were, quote—it was his quote—""suckers"" and ""losers."" ""Suckers"" and ""losers,"" he said it. Who the hell does he think he is? Who does he think he is? These were heroes. These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this Nation. Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office. Thank God I wasn't standing next to him. But, as I've said, Donald Trump looks at the world differently than you and me. He wakes up in the morning in Mar-a-Lago thinking about himself, how he can help his billionaire friends gain power and control and force their extreme agenda on the rest of us. Listen to what he says. He says, quote, ""I'll be dictator on day one."" Quote, ""I am your retribution."" He promises, quote, ""a bloodbath"" if he loses. This guy denies January 6. Listen—listen to what he says, because you know he means it. I wake every morning thinking about how to make life better, like you do, for working and middle class families here in Scranton and all across the country, where the power and the freedom rest with you and ""We the People."" Maybe that's why millions of everyday power—folks are powering our campaign. So far, 1.6 million people have contributed to our campaign, with 550,000 brandnew this time around. And they're new contributors. But guess what? Ninety-seven percent of these contributions were under $200. It matters. You matter. My grandfather would tell me when I walked out the door in North Scranton—in Washington Avenue in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith,"" when I was a kid. And my grandmother would yell: ""No, Joey, spread it. Spread it."" Let's keep the faith. Let's spread it. Let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if—when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you.","The President. Hello, Scranton. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I think I should go home now, except I'm already home. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, take a seat if you have one. And, Amy, thank you for that introduction and for your work as an educator. You know, it was great to meet your family, including your husband Michael, whose uncle Jimmy McNulty was the former mayor and grew up with me in Scranton, Pennsylvania. You know, thanks to the mayor, Paige—excuse me, I'm going to—I was going to talk about the old mayor—Paige Cognetti, for that welcome. And she's been incredible. She's been with me all along the way. It's always great to be with one of America's best Governors, and I mean that sincerely: Josh Shapiro. He's the best. Stand up, Josh. [Applause] Get up. I think Josh and a lot of people are always tired of hearing me talk about Scranton, but it—you know, Scranton is a place that climbs into your heart, and it never leaves. I mean that sincerely. It's home, that's a special thing that's etched into your heart. For me, it was 2446 North Washington Avenue, just a block away from Amy's house. [Laughter] We used to come back after morning Mass at St. Paul's on Sunday—St. Clare's wasn't built until I had moved—and my grandfather, who worked for the newspaper, and my uncles would hold court around a kitchen table with a guy who was sort of the David Broder of the Pennsylvania press—Scranton press. You think I'm kidding. It wasn't, but anyway. And he would—they'd come and have breakfast at the table. And a kid could wander around the table where the adults were sitting, but you could never sit at the table. And I'd walk up and stand next to my grandpop and—while he was—while they were having conversation, and they were talking about what—they'd talk about what was going on in the neighborhood. They'd talk about what was going on in the world. They were all learned men. And I learned a lot here in Scranton. I learned that money doesn't determine your worth. My grandfather would tell me, ""Joey, nobody—nobody—is more worthy than you, and everyone is your equal."" And that was a—— Audience member. Yes. The President. No, that was—[applause]. I learned that no one's looking for a handout. All anybody wants is a fair shot—a fair shot—at making it, and they deserve a fair shot. My dad had a saying. He'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" You know, people like Donald Trump learned very different lessons. He learned the best way to get rich is inherit it. [Laughter] Not a bad way. I'm not—he learned that paying taxes was something people who worked for a living did, not him. He learned that telling people ""you're fired"" was something to laugh about. I guess that's how you look at the world when you're in Park Avenue and Mar-a-Lago. But if you grew up in a place like Scranton, nobody handed you anything. You paid your taxes. You made sure being told ""you're fired"" wasn't entertainment, it was a nightmare that people worried about. And all people knew—all I knew about the people like Trump who looked down on us were the people that haven't changed. They wouldn't welcome us in their homes and their clubs. Folks, where we come from matters. When I look at the economy, I don't see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago. I see it through the eyes of Scranton—and that's not hyperbole; that's a fact—where honesty and decency matter, where faith matters, where family is everything, where we grew up knowing in our homes that Wall Street didn't build this country; the middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. We know the best way to build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down. Because when you do that, the poor have a ladder up, the middle class does well, and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well. That's a stark contrast from my opponent. He looks at the economy from Mar-a-Lago, where he and his rich friends embrace the failed trickle-down policies that have failed working families for more than 40 years. Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values: These are the competing visions for our economy, and they raise questions of fundamental fairness at the heart of this campaign that I want to talk to you about a little bit today. Folks, does anybody really think that the present Tax Code is fair? Raise your hand if you think it's fair. I'm not joking. Well, neither do I. [Laughter] I'm a capitalist. If you want to—if you're able to go out and make a million bucks, fine. That's okay. But just make sure you pay your fair share in taxes. A fair Tax Code is how we invest in the things that make this country strong: health care, education, defense, and so much more. But here's the deal. For more than 40 years, our Republican friends have promised that the best way to grow the economy is from the top down. But here's what they don't tell you: It's never worked. The benefits don't trickle down. When the very wealthy pay less in taxes, then we have to borrow more and invest less in the things that families really need, from schools, to hospitals, health care, roads, bridges, and so much more. Think what's happens when that factory closes in Scranton or anywhere around the country, when the school is underfunded, when inequity grows larger and larger. It puts the middle class further in—out of reach and rips the dignity and pride and hope out of communities all across the country, including right here in Pennsylvania. Folks, trickle-down economics failed the middle class. It failed America. And the truth is, Donald Trump embodies that failure. He wants to double down on trickle down. His failure starts with his $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthiest and biggest corporations and exploded the Federal debt when he was President. Donald Trump added more to the national debt than any President of the United States in a term in all of American history—more to the national debt. Meanwhile, when the pandemic hit, Trump failed the most basic duty any President owes the American people: a duty to care and a duty to respond. Remember when he told us, ""Don't worry; this will all be over by Easter""? Remember when he told us, literally, inject bleach? [Laughter] Bless me, Father. [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] [Laughter] Look, think about it. [Applause] Think about it. Because he failed to care, not only did people die, but millions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their livelihoods. On Trump watch—on Trump is [Trump's; White House correction] watch, for the 4 years he was President, we lost—nearly 3 million jobs were lost, 275,000 of those jobs lost right here in Pennsylvania. In the Scranton area, Trump lost 17,400 jobs; 180,000 manufacturing jobs lost nationwide, including 37,000 manufacturing jobs right here in Pennsylvania. There are only two Presidents on record in all of American history that left office with fewer jobs than when they entered office: Herbert Hoover and, yes, Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Look, Trump is running again on the same trickle-down—failed trickle-down policies. Nothing has changed. Just a few months ago, at a closed-door event in Mar-a-Lago, he told his millionaire and billionaire donors the following—this is a quote—""You're rich as hell, and we're going to give you tax cuts,"" end of quote. And then they all laughed about it, not because they didn't think it would happen, because they knew it will happen if he's elected. How does that make me feel? How does it make you feel? How does it make the people I grew up with feel? I think it's outrageous. Trump wants to renew another round of billionaire tax breaks and corporate giveaways. And look, I come from the corporate State of the world: Delaware. I represented it for 36 years. They're entitled to make a fair profit. It makes sense. There is more corporations incorporated in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined. But this is ridiculous, what's going on now. You know, there are about 1,000 billionaires—billionaires—in America. Do you know what the average Federal tax rate for a billionaire is today in America? For real: 8.3 percent. [Laughter] That's how much Federal tax—no, I'm serious. Not a joke. Far less than the vast majority of Americans pay in Federal taxes. No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a nurse, a sanitation worker. [Applause] I mean it. And that tax break that he passed several years ago is about to expire. But Trump wants to give another billionaire tax break. Listen to what he says. Trump says his MAGA friends want to, quote, ""terminate""—I love his terminology—""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act. That would mean over a hundred million Americans with preexisting conditions who now have health care because of the Affordable Care Act would lose their coverage. One hundred million. It means millions of young people would be kicked off their parents' health care policies once they turn 26. The Affordable Care Act is paid for by a surtax on the very wealthy investment income. Trump wants to get rid of that, and as a consequence, would cost millions of American who lose coverage an average of an additional $6,000 a year to maintain their health care. It would mean billionaires would get, as a consequence of not having to pay the tax anymore, another $3.5 million tax cut per billionaire. You heard me right. Billionaires would each get an additional tax cut every year of $3.5 million. That's 70 times what a typical family here in Scranton makes in 1 year. I have a better idea. As soon as I came to office, I expanded tax credits through the Affordable Care Act and saved millions of Americans another $800 per person per year on their health care premiums. Health care should be a basic right. Those tax credits are going to expire next year though. And I want to make those tax credits permanent. It's the first thing I'll do if I'm reelected is make them permanent. Folks, and my plan calls for a minimum Federal income tax of 25 percent—just 25 percent—on billionaires. Well below the top rate, but fair, and they can afford it. Do you know how much money that would raise? That would raise $500 billion over the next 10 years. Five hundred billion dollars. It would be a drop in the bucket for them. They wouldn't have to sell one single bit of their assets. And imagine what we could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, homecare, eldercare, and more, like every major country in the world has. Of—all this is not only good for families, it creates jobs. It generates growth. It generates income. It generates economic vitality. Because guess what? When you have childcare and you don't have to go out and hire somebody, you can go to work. It—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: What would—what would—what's the effect of this? The effects of what I'm talking about is increased—increased—economic growth. We have the most successful economy in the world today. But, folks, how does Trump pay for these billionaire tax cuts? Well, Trump recently said Social Security and Medicare, quote—here's his quote: ""There's a lot you can do in terms of cutting,"" end of quote. Well, right on cue, the MAGA Republicans in Congress released their budget, which hasn't gotten nearly enough attention. The budget they proposed for next year would raise the retirement age of Social Security and would slash Medicare. Think about that for a second. MAGA Republicans want billionaires to pay less in taxes, want seniors to work longer before they can retire on Social Security benefits, and they want to cut Medicare. I've got a better idea. Let's protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share in high taxes. And by the way, whether you're liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, or Independent, whatever you are, think about it: We're not asking much. Just asking for just basic fairness. You know, I've already been delivering real results in a fiscally responsible way. But I know not everyone is feeling it. Just the other day, a defeated-looking guy came up to me and asked if I could help. He was drowning in debt. I said, ""I'm sorry, Donald, but I can't help you."" [Laughter] ""Nothing I can do."" Look, on a serious note, since I came to office—[laughter]—I've already cut the Federal deficit. You know, all the stuff they talk about what we've done—and I'm going to be self-serving a little bit: Every other—every objective alternative points out we've had the most successful economy of any major economy in the world so far. A lot more to do, but guess what? During the whole time, I've been able to cut the Federal deficit at the same exact time by over $1 trillion—$1 trillion. And I signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade as well. And I know what to cut. I want to cut the Federal deficit even more by making big corporations and the very wealthy begin to finally pay their fair share. We're not asking anything that's unusual. Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny. I hope you're all able to make $400,000. [Laughter] I never did. But they're not going to pay an extra penny in Federal taxes. That's a promise. Nobody. Not one penny. You know, I have to say: If Trump's stock in the Truth Social—his company—drops any lower, he might do better under my tax plan than his. [Laughter] It's possible. Folks, look, I want to cut taxes on the hard-working folks here in Scranton and all across the country, in Claymont—where I moved from Scranton to Claymont, in Delaware—all across the country, like Amy's family. In fact, the child tax credit I extended during the pandemic put up to $300 per child—per child [a month; White House correction] in the pockets of around 40 million working families, and it literally cut child poverty in half.

And we're not going to let it happen. We're not going to—can't let it happen. Look, let me close with this. As you observed—I can't hide it, Scranton fills me with an enormous pride. My mom didn't live in Scranton permanently since 1954. I swear to God, whenever she was asked, no matter where we were: ""Mrs. Biden, where do you live? Where are you from?"" She'd say, ""Scranton.""

Listen to what he says. He says, quote, ""I'll be dictator on day one."" Quote, ""I am your retribution."" He promises, quote, ""a bloodbath"" if he loses. This guy denies January 6. Listen—listen to what he says, because you know he means it. I wake every morning thinking about how to make life better, like you do, for working and middle class families here in Scranton and all across the country, where the power and the freedom rest with you and ""We the People."" Maybe that's why millions of everyday power—folks are powering our campaign. So far, 1.6 million people have contributed to our campaign, with 550,000 brandnew this time around. And they're new contributors. But guess what? Ninety-seven percent of these contributions were under $200. It matters. You matter. My grandfather would tell me when I walked out the door in North Scranton—in Washington Avenue in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith,"" when I was a kid. And my grandmother would yell: ""No, Joey, spread it. Spread it."" Let's keep the faith. Let's spread it. Let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There is nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if—when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, folks. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you.","['hello', 'scranton', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'home', 'except', 'im', 'already', 'home', 'please', 'seat', 'amy', 'introduction', 'educator', 'meet', 'family',

Come on.', 'With the Bells and the Bidens, like all of you—my dad used to have an expression. He\'d say, ""Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end""—""the beginning, the middle, and the end.""', '[At this point, the President addressed Eloise Giroux, daughter of Megan Bell Giroux, who introduced the President, and granddaughter of Tommy Bell, a childhood friend of the President.]', 'And you need Secret Service guarding you. [Laughter]', ""But, folks, look, first of all, I want to thank the Carpenters Union. They've been with me for my entire career. They've been loyal to me, and I think I've been loyal to them."", ""Now, one of the things that she hadn't told you is Tommy is—along with Larry—Larry, stand up. This is Larry Orr. Larry is another one of the—he lived right across the gates in Marywood—and another guy named Charlie Roth, the four of us were inseparable."", ""When things changed for my dad up in Scranton and lost his job, we moved back to Delaware, where he was from. And when he originally—that's where he came from—Delaware—to Scranton."", ""And I'd come home though for every holiday, almost all summer. And when I fell in love when I was in law school—I actually wasn't even in law school, I was in college. I went on spring break. I had made $85 of—from a tax return. [Laughter] And—oh, you think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter]"", ""And my dad didn't own, but he ran an automobile dealership. And so I had a car, and I put five guys in the car. They all chipped in to pay the way down. We went to Lauderdale."", ""Now, the problem is—I'm going to lose a lot of credibility with all of you—[laughter]—but I'm the only Scrantonian and the only Irishman you've ever met that's never had a drink in his life, because too many people have too many drinks in their life, in my opinion. [Laughter] And so we got down to Fort Lauderdale, and all everybody was doing is drunk most of the time. And I found out that there was a possibility of being able to get on a plane for 20 bucks—$22 round trip to go to Nassau. [Laughter]"", 'So I thought, ""Well, there may be some nice girls in Nassau."" [Laughter] The only reason we all came down—any rate.', 'So I got on the plane, and I had two guys with me. We had just finished spring football practice at the University of Delaware. And I had been named as the likely starting safety that year and—next year. And so we started off, and a guy named—his nickname was—he was Mike McCrann. We called him ""Crash"" McCrann. He looked like Rock Hudson and acted like it. [Laughter] And a guy named Fred Sears, who ran one of the biggest banks in Delaware later.', ""And so we walked into—we went to the British Colonial hotel. We—actually, we found a bunch of guys from Michigan. We slept on the floor of their place. And we went to go to the beach. Turns out, all the beaches in Nassau—public beaches, there's none of the college girls. They're—you know, they're all locals, and there's not many people."", ""So we walked down to the beach this particular day—the first day we got there—and the British Colonial hotel had this chain-link fence that ran from the street all the way down into the water so you couldn't cross into the hotel area. And so we wondered what the heck we were going to do."", 'Turns out they—a bunch of folks going in and throwing their towels saying ""British Colonial hotel"" on it over the—barbed wire—not barbed wire—chain-link fence. So I had an idea. We each grabbed a towel, put it around us, and we walked in the front door—[laughter]—no, I\'m serious; true story—of the British Colonial hotel.', 'And we walked in, and we acted like—and you walked in, and you had the registration on the left and down the—but straight ahead—like, from here, half again the distance from the back wall—was the glass looking out on the swimming pool and then beyond the swimming pool and onto the ocean.', 'And so we just walked in like we belonged there and walked right out. [Laughter] And I\'m standing there, and we\'re all looking around, and I saw this beautiful young woman. I said, ""I\'m going to go talk to her."" And old Crash McCrann, I nicknamed—he was a fullback—I said, ""No, I am."" I said—and Fred Sears, my buddy, flipped a coin. I won. [Laughter]', 'And so I walked up, sat down on the end of the bench of the—and the sun was coming from—toward the water. And it was later—and toward the water. And I sat on the end of the chaise lounge, and I said: ""My name is Joe Biden. I\'m from the University of Delaware."" And she said, ""My name is Neilia Hunter. I\'m from Syracuse."" And I said hi, and we started to talk and just talking.', ""And I watched this yacht pull up in front. I'm not—this is not a joke. Well, to me, it was a yacht. It was, like, 40, 45 feet. [Laughter] And I see this guy with a white hat on, white, you know, uniform—not uniform—pants and the shoes and the whole deal. And he gets in a little dingy, and he rows to shore."", 'And I\'m just—I\'m talking to her like—like you\'re she, and I\'m looking up. And I watch the guy pull up, and he pulls a—the dingy up onto the beach. And he starts walking toward us. And I\'m just watching him. And he walks straight to us, and he looks down at Neilia, and he says, ""Neilia, are we on for dinner tonight?"" [Laughter] I thought, ""Oh, man."" [Laughter]', 'But what happened was he—she looked, and she said, ""Oh, I\'m sorry""—it was the Wickwire family, a major highway contractor in New York—in Skaneateles, New York, in the State of New York. And what—they were neighbors.', 'And she said, ""No."" She said, ""I—Joe and I are going to go to dinner."" [Laughter] And so, with that, he left, and she was mortified. She said, ""I\'m so sorry, but I didn\'t want to."" I said, ""Why don\'t we?"" I had a total of $42 left. [Laughter] But then, you could buy a McDonald\'s hamburger for 19 cents or something.

They paid $10 for every car we delivered back to Delaware.', ""So I'd get a van, take 10 guys up, get 100 bucks; I'd keep $50.

And he came back—he—his hooch—that's where he slept—was only about 400 yards from a major burn pit.

And a lot of people said, ""What\'s he doing that for?"" Because it is at stake. We\'ve never had this kind of a campaign before.', ""And so, for me, it's not about whether or not you're left, right, or center—although it matters to my philosophy of government—but it matters about whether or not you're going to abide by the basic rules, you're going to have a sense of decency."", 'You—I\'ve never thought I\'d see a time when I\'m going through a neighborhood or a rural town that\'s in the west and see big signs that—have a Trump sign in the middle that says ""F—Biden"" and having a little kid standing with his middle finger, 7 years old, 8 years old.

What's going to follow?"", ""So I—when I started the book—and I decided to run instead. I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world.

A simple proposition that—just simply, people just want a shot. They just want an even shot and just to be able to realize the possibility that what they care about will matter with what will happen.', 'What made me run for President: In fact, when I moved from Scranton—my dad was born in Baltimore. They say——', '[The President imitated a Baltimore accent.]', 'Baltimore—[laughter]—in Baltimore. And his dad was with the American Oil Company. And they opened up the American Oil Company, used to—AMOCO, it became. And the Blaustein family owned it. He opened up York, Pennsylvania, then he opened up Scranton. And they moved to Scranton when my dad was a junior in high school.', ""And you know, it's—and so, I was born in Scranton, and then we moved back to Delaware. When we moved back to Delaware, one thing that I hadn't seen in Scranton—there were very few African Americans in Scranton when I was here in Lackawanna County—very few. But in Delaware, we have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of population of any State in the Nation."", ""And in addition to that, we're one of those border States that couldn't—that—it was a slave State that fought on the side of the North because it couldn't figure how to get to the South.

It was a long way—but very, very modest apartment complex was being built in Claymont with about 400 apartments."", ""And I remember that they'd drive—Mom would drive us up to school in the morning because it was too dangerous to—it was a—the Philadelphia Pike was an—access highway. It wasn't I-95, which is now the way to get there. But she was worried of us crossing the streets."", 'So I was in third grade. My sister was in first grade. And they\'d drop us in the parking lot.

There were no Whites in it. And even though the major school—public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up.', 'I remember asking my mother why they couldn\'t come—why\'d that bus go all the way downtown?

And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open.', ""So I joined a group of senior members of the—Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a Northeastern Democratic Party.

Now, one of the things that she hadn't told you is Tommy is—along with Larry—Larry, stand up. This is Larry Orr. Larry is another one of the—he lived right across the gates in Marywood—and another guy named Charlie Roth, the four of us were inseparable. When things changed for my dad up in Scranton and lost his job, we moved back to Delaware, where he was from. And when he originally—that's where he came from—Delaware—to Scranton. And I'd come home though for every holiday, almost all summer. And when I fell in love when I was in law school—I actually wasn't even in law school, I was in college. I went on spring break. I had made $85 of—from a tax return. [Laughter] And—oh, you think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter] And my dad didn't own, but he ran an automobile dealership. And so I had a car, and I put five guys in the car. They all chipped in to pay the way down. We went to Lauderdale. Now, the problem is—I'm going to lose a lot of credibility with all of you—[laughter]—but I'm the only Scrantonian and the only Irishman you've ever met that's never had a drink in his life, because too many people have too many drinks in their life, in my opinion. [Laughter] And so we got down to Fort Lauderdale, and all everybody was doing is drunk most of the time. And I found out that there was a possibility of being able to get on a plane for 20 bucks—$22 round trip to go to Nassau. [Laughter] So I thought, ""Well, there may be some nice girls in Nassau."" [Laughter] The only reason we all came down—any rate. So I got on the plane, and I had two guys with me. We had just finished spring football practice at the University of Delaware. And I had been named as the likely starting safety that year and—next year. And so we started off, and a guy named—his nickname was—he was Mike McCrann. We called him ""Crash"" McCrann. He looked like Rock Hudson and acted like it. [Laughter] And a guy named Fred Sears, who ran one of the biggest banks in Delaware later. And so we walked into—we went to the British Colonial hotel. We—actually, we found a bunch of guys from Michigan. We slept on the floor of their place. And we went to go to the beach. Turns out, all the beaches in Nassau—public beaches, there's none of the college girls. They're—you know, they're all locals, and there's not many people. So we walked down to the beach this particular day—the first day we got there—and the British Colonial hotel had this chain-link fence that ran from the street all the way down into the water so you couldn't cross into the hotel area. And so we wondered what the heck we were going to do. Turns out they—a bunch of folks going in and throwing their towels saying ""British Colonial hotel"" on it over the—barbed wire—not barbed wire—chain-link fence. So I had an idea. We each grabbed a towel, put it around us, and we walked in the front door—[laughter]—no, I'm serious; true story—of the British Colonial hotel. And we walked in, and we acted like—and you walked in, and you had the registration on the left and down the—but straight ahead—like, from here, half again the distance from the back wall—was the glass looking out on the swimming pool and then beyond the swimming pool and onto the ocean. And so we just walked in like we belonged there and walked right out. [Laughter] And I'm standing there, and we're all looking around, and I saw this beautiful young woman. I said, ""I'm going to go talk to her."" And old Crash McCrann, I nicknamed—he was a fullback—I said, ""No, I am."" I said—and Fred Sears, my buddy, flipped a coin. I won. [Laughter] And so I walked up, sat down on the end of the bench of the—and the sun was coming from—toward the water. And it was later—and toward the water. And I sat on the end of the chaise lounge, and I said: ""My name is Joe Biden. I'm from the University of Delaware."" And she said, ""My name is Neilia Hunter. I'm from Syracuse."" And I said hi, and we started to talk and just talking. And I watched this yacht pull up in front. I'm not—this is not a joke. Well, to me, it was a yacht. It was, like, 40, 45 feet. [Laughter] And I see this guy with a white hat on, white, you know, uniform—not uniform—pants and the shoes and the whole deal. And he gets in a little dingy, and he rows to shore. And I'm just—I'm talking to her like—like you're she, and I'm looking up. And I watch the guy pull up, and he pulls a—the dingy up onto the beach. And he starts walking toward us. And I'm just watching him. And he walks straight to us, and he looks down at Neilia, and he says, ""Neilia, are we on for dinner tonight?"" [Laughter] I thought, ""Oh, man."" [Laughter] But what happened was he—she looked, and she said, ""Oh, I'm sorry""—it was the Wickwire family, a major highway contractor in New York—in Skaneateles, New York, in the State of New York. And what—they were neighbors. And she said, ""No."" She said, ""I—Joe and I are going to go to dinner."" [Laughter] And so, with that, he left, and she was mortified. She said, ""I'm so sorry, but I didn't want to."" I said, ""Why don't we?"" I had a total of $42 left. [Laughter] But then, you could buy a McDonald's hamburger for 19 cents or something. [Laughter] So she said, ""Well, I know a place we can go."" And she's a very classy lady. She picked a place she thought we—I could afford. And so we walked into this particular restaurant and sat down. I ordered a hamburger because I didn't have any money, and she—the classy woman she was, she ordered the same thing, like whatever it was. But anyway, we—and I was smitten by her. I really was. And you know, sometimes, there's love at first sight. This really was. I was—my—I was just taken by her. And she was really quiet, and she was lovely. And one thing led to another, and she said—the bill came. And the bill was $48. [Laughter] And I had $23. And I could feel under the table—I could feel this. [The President rested his hand on an audience member's knee.] And I put my hand down, and she put 40 bucks in my hand. [Laughter] Her father was fairly wealthy. He was a Navy cook and an Auburn—if you know Auburn, New York, he had a large diner in Auburn, which was very profitable, and he also had the contracts to do Syracuse University. Anyway, he was a fairly wealthy guy. And so I took it, and I paid. I said, ""I'm so embarrassed."" She said, ""Oh, it happens to my father all the time."" [Laughter] So we're walking back to the hotel she was staying at, and I swear to God, I hadn't kissed her, I hadn't done—we hadn't done a single thing together. And there was a chain and—that—post and chain dividing—stopping the parking lot from coming out of the—and so, like a horse's tail, I was going to show—I jumped over the chain. [Laughter] And I caught my ankle and fell. [Laughter] Totally mortified. She said: ""Oh, that's okay. That's—are you okay?"" I said, ""Yes."" And I got up, and I looked at her, and I know—and this wasn't a joke—I looked at her. I said, ""You know, I think I'm going to marry you."" I give you my word. And she looked at me, and we hadn't even kissed one another, and she said, ""I think so."" From that time on, I quit the football team that year—that was spring practice—the next year, and I started commuting every single weekend. My dad ran an automobile agency, and I made money by getting—there was a place called Manheim Auto Auction, where they—and I would drive to Manheim. And back in those days at Delaware, you could not—you could not have a car on campus. And so a lot of the guys I was with, they were happy to get a chance to drive a relatively new car. They paid $10 for every car we delivered back to Delaware. So I'd get a van, take 10 guys up, get 100 bucks; I'd keep $50. [Laughter] No. And that's how I'd go back and forth every single weekend—every single weekend. And—but sometimes, it just happens. Sometimes, it just happens. And so no man deserves one great love, let alone two. When she was killed in that accident with my daughter as well, my two boys weren't expected to make it. And they were only just 3 and just 4 years old. And what happened was that I got put on that 10-most-eligible-bachelors list in America. [Laughter] You've got it man. I thought it was a pretty cool thing. [Laughter] But I used to send more things to the Secret Service because I'd get women sending me pictures that I was afraid I'd get set up for. [Laughter] And unlike the guy running, I didn't take advantage of any of it. [Laughter] Any rate, to make a long story short, all kidding aside, I would just give them to the Secret Service. So I decided I couldn't—I really couldn't date anybody because every time I'd go out with somebody—I had more yentas in Delaware than you can imagine—very nice to me. And so I just gave up. And I get a call from my youngest brother. He said, ""Joe, I've got just the girl for you."" And he was at the University of Delaware at the time, as this girl was. She used to be 9 years younger than me. Now she's 25 years younger, but—[laughter]. So he said: ""You'll love her. She doesn't like politics."" [Laughter] And I met her, and this third date I went out with her, I realized I was going to marry her. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. So I've been an incredibly fortunate guy—incredibly fortunate. And that's why I kept coming back up to Scranton, because what would happen is, I would drive up on—after I paid my guys their money, I'd drive up on Friday—through Scranton, up 81, up into Syracuse, next to Skaneateles Lake—and then go back. And I'd always stop at my Uncle Jack's house on the way back in Scranton. And you know, everybody's from Scranton, but no one ever leaves Scranton. [Laughter] It's in their—but any rate, I don't know why the hell I told you that. [Laughter] Except you reminded me. Megan Bell Giroux. It was my fault. I told—[inaudible]. The President. No, no, but you know, look, folks, I've ran for—I can't tell you how much I appreciate what you've done. It's a pretty basic thing for me. You may remember when I announced for President, I said I was running for three reasons, initially. I said, one is to restore the soul of America. We lost a sense of decency that was in the way we campaign and what people say and how they talk to one another. And the second thing, I said I wanted to rebuild the middle class because when the middle class works, everyone works—everyone does better. I said, thirdly, I want to unite the country. And I was, understandably, by the national press, viewed as I was—they'd give me credit for being a fairly significant United States Senator and able to cross the aisle and get a lot done, but they thought I was extremely naive. I don't know how we can lead the world when we can't unite ourselves. I really mean it. I mean, so we've got a lot of work to do. And then I decided—my son Beau ended up going—volunteering to go to Iraq. He was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he came back—he—his—I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Senator and as a Vice President. And he came back—he—his hooch—that's where he slept—was only about 400 yards from a major burn pit. And the burn pit is about the size of a football field—probably 80 yards long, 30, 40 yards wide—burning everything from human waste to oil and the rest. And just like the 9/11 firemen got—my son came back after a year with glioblastoma—stage 4 glioblastoma. And I lost him. And I didn't—I wasn't going to run again. I really wasn't. Not a—I give you my word, I had no intention of running again. And then along came what happened down in Charlottesville. And I talked to the mother who lost that daughter who was killed by these—coming out of a field, in the United States of America, in the year two thousand and—I guess it was '16, '17, '18, in that range, but a little later—carrying torches, Ku Klux Klan, Nazi banners—I mean, literally Nazi swastikas, and marching through the streets. And my future opponent, my present opponent—they asked him what he thought of it. He said there were ""very good people on both sides."" And I'm going to say something that may sound outrageous to you, but I thought—I thought—he's the antithesis of everything I believe, and I thought I could beat him. And that's why I ran. And so what's at stake now, folks, is our democracy. It's not hyperbole. You may remember, when I got the nomination, the first thing I did, I made a speech at the—in Convention Hall—excuse me, in Philadelphia. And I made a speech on democracy. And a lot of people said, ""What's he doing that for?"" Because it is at stake. We've never had this kind of a campaign before. And so, for me, it's not about whether or not you're left, right, or center—although it matters to my philosophy of government—but it matters about whether or not you're going to abide by the basic rules, you're going to have a sense of decency. You—I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood or a rural town that's in the west and see big signs that—have a Trump sign in the middle that says ""F—Biden"" and having a little kid standing with his middle finger, 7 years old, 8 years old. Oh, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are. So the point I'm making is this: We are—think of—it this way: If the United States wasn't leading the world, who could step up to do it? No, not a joke. What other country? What other country? I've known every major world leader for the last 35 years. I know them all by their first names—not a joke—not because I'm important; because of the nature of my job when I was Foreign Relations Committee and a senior Senator. And you know, the rest of the world looks to us. I walk in a room—no matter whether it's the G-7 or the G-20, whatever it is—and they all look to me—not me, Joe Biden; America—because they know we are the essential nation. And you know, Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essential—she was absolutely right, absolutely right. And we have a chance. We have an incredible chance to change the direction of the world without using American forces. We have an enormous chance. So I said before I ran, I was going to write a book on inflection points in American history, where the things that happen in a very short period of time can determine what the next four, five, six decades look like. We have a chance. We have a chance to change the dynamic in a way that we haven't had before. The postwar era is over. It's over. What's going to follow? So I—when I started the book—and I decided to run instead. I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world. Were it not for Gutenberg inventing the printing press, there would be no unity in Europe. They wouldn't have been able to communicate with one another at the period of time. All the way to the—it's a silly example—Nixon would probably be President but for a televised debate where he perspired a great deal. And—[laughter]—no, I—no, I'm not joking. I'm thinking these things matter. Even to now, look what's happening on TikTok. Look what's happening. What are the source of information? These press people are all honest and decent, and they take real risks. And not a lot—and they don't all like me. But they—[laughter]—no, I'm serious. This is—they're entitled to that. But they take real risks. But, folks, think about it. Where do people get their news these days? I mean, all the data shows hardly anybody watches the nightly news, in relative terms. Who reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the—and so on? I mean, what percentage of people? So where did they get their news? And it's so much—so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what's true. So we've got a lot at stake here—a lot at stake. But for me, it gets down to a basic thing. My dad used to say—for real; my word—he'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than—is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it—and mean it."" That's what this is all about. The vast majority of the American people just want an even chance, just a shot. Just a shot. And it breaks down into everything from taxes to philosophy. But with your help, I've been able to get a lot done that no one thought could get done. We've been able to get a lot done. But there's so much more we have to do, but we can do it. But we have to win. And it gets down to old-fashioned politics, gets down to knocking on doors, gets down to telling stories about why you're for who you're for. It gets down to being able to have—pick these people to put yard signs up. It matters. Last point I'll make—and I'm talking too long, and I apologize. [Laughter] The last point I'll make is, we have over 100—is it 120 or 160? What's it up to now? Individual contributors? Aide. Oh, 1.6—[inaudible]. The President. One-point-six million individual contributors; 550,000 more than before—than—since we started, new contributors. You know what the—of—97 percent of those contributors contributed less than $200—97 percent. There's a real groundswell going on because of you. It matters. It matters. And people are contributing $5, $10, $30, $50. And it's having a real impact and real effect. We have opened more campaign offices because of you all than he—doesn't—hasn't opened any that I'm aware of. I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. We're also in a situation where we're in a position that we're generating a paid staff. That's significant. And we're growing in every State. I've been to—every single—every single of the toss-up States so far. And guess what? If you knock anybody who knows anything about polling, it's awful hard to poll these days. Because—no, I'm serious. But guess what? Even in the polls that are being used now, we're ahead in—35 polls, but—by the way—it's just about continuing to push. And, again, one simple proposition: How do we give hard-working Americans an even shot, an even chance—an even chance to make it? Just that. Nothing more than that. And how do we move people together again? And I think we can do it. I'm confident that we're going to be able to do it. And I feel very good about where we are because of all of you. But thank you for what you're doing. Again, I didn't mean to tell you so much. [Laughter] But thank you, thank you, thank you. Pennsylvania General Election Campaign Director Amy Friedman. Well, Mr. President, I think we have a few folks eager to ask you questions, if we may. The President. Sure. Ms. Friedman. Absolutely. Sam. Sam Kuchwara. Mr. President, what made you run for President? The President. A simple proposition, and I was—I asked that question—I just came from my old home where I was raised in Scranton. A simple proposition that—just simply, people just want a shot. They just want an even shot and just to be able to realize the possibility that what they care about will matter with what will happen. What made me run for President: In fact, when I moved from Scranton—my dad was born in Baltimore. They say—— [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] Baltimore—[laughter]—in Baltimore. And his dad was with the American Oil Company. And they opened up the American Oil Company, used to—AMOCO, it became. And the Blaustein family owned it. He opened up York, Pennsylvania, then he opened up Scranton. And they moved to Scranton when my dad was a junior in high school. And you know, it's—and so, I was born in Scranton, and then we moved back to Delaware. When we moved back to Delaware, one thing that I hadn't seen in Scranton—there were very few African Americans in Scranton when I was here in Lackawanna County—very few. But in Delaware, we have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of population of any State in the Nation. And in addition to that, we're one of those border States that couldn't—that—it was a slave State that fought on the side of the North because it couldn't figure how to get to the South. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. So was Maryland. So was Tennessee. Anyway—and so I remember when we moved to Delaware, we lived on—in what later became section 8 housing. It was a long way—but very, very modest apartment complex was being built in Claymont with about 400 apartments. And I remember that they'd drive—Mom would drive us up to school in the morning because it was too dangerous to—it was a—the Philadelphia Pike was an—access highway. It wasn't I-95, which is now the way to get there. But she was worried of us crossing the streets. So I was in third grade. My sister was in first grade. And they'd drop us in the parking lot. And we used to watch—and I couldn't understand why this little Catholic school I went to, Holy Rosary—why this bus would go by when we pulled in the parking lot that had what was referred to then as—all full of ""Colored"" children. There were no Whites in it. And even though the major school—public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up. I remember asking my mother why they couldn't come—why'd that bus go all the way downtown? And she said, ""Because they're not allowed to go to school with White kids."" ""Not allowed to go to school with White kids."" And that had an enormous impression on me. And it got me engaged in the civil rights movement. I wasn't in any great shape, but I was a public—I became a public defender after getting a job with a fancy law firm. My city of Wilmington, Delaware, was the only city in America occupied by the military for 10 months, with the National Guard standing on the corner with drawn bayonets for 10 months when Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots that occurred. And so I got involved trying to change the Democratic Party and turn it into more—the conservative party on race was the Democratic Party in Delaware. And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open. So I joined a group of senior members of the—Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a Northeastern Democratic Party. The Governor of Delaware could choose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference or the Northeast. And the Democrats often chose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference. In the southern part of the State there is a canal that goes across the top of my State, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal that cuts—bisects the State. And when you just go below that canal—and I'm not—this is not a criticism—— [The President imitated a regional accent.] They talk at you like this. Eastern Shore of Maryland. Very southern in the way they talk and the way they move and everything. And so I got involved in trying to change the party. And one thing led to another, and I remember they came to me and said they wanted me to run, the local folks. Trying to get people to run—just show up as Democrats in areas they—that they weren't able to win. And so I got a call—I was a public defender part-time in a—and I had a law practice. I was starting alone. And with that, I remember a group of people from Elsmere, Delaware—the Democratic organization—came to see me, wanted me to run for the State Senate. And I said, ""I can't do that because I'm just starting a law firm, and I can't go to Dover."" And they came back about 3 days later and said, ""Well, why don't you run for the county council?"" I said, ""I can't do that."" And they said, ""Come here."" And they walked me to my window in my office, and it looked across—and they said, ""They meet there twice a week at night."" [Laughter] So they wanted me to run in a district no Democrat had ever run. And I said: ""Well, at least I can do my job. I can go out and run. Make—demonstrate that we're running."" And the problem is, I asked my sister who has graduated with honors from Delaware, who's smarter than me and ran my campaign. And she won a campaign where a Democrat had never won. And all of a sudden, I was in the county council. And—but the Democrats—the Republicans saw something in me I didn't see, for—it's the God's truth. They saw in me that I was going to do something beyond that. I was elected to a 4-year term. And what they did was, they reapportioned me to a 2-year term. So it was either up or out. And I was happy with that. I was prepared to leave and do my practice and work in the party. And one thing led to another, and I won't bore you with the detail, but one day I showed up at an off-year convention, and I was in—I was in the motel after—the local motel getting changed after the afternoon session, go back to the evening session. And I'd come down with some young activists—they were a little older than me, but still young activists—who were involved in trying to reform the party. And I was in one of those 8-by-10 bathrooms—you know they have a shower, a toilet, and a sink. And I got a towel on me and shaving cream, and I hear, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" at my door really loudly. And I wonder, ""What the hell is that?"" I thought it was this guy Bob Cunningham, who had a radio show, and couple of other guys. So I say, ""Okay, okay, guys."" And I walked to the door and opened it up and standing there was the former Governor of the State of Delaware, Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy, about 6'5"". [The President imitated a regional accent.] Talked at you like this. [Laughter] And the State representative who got defeated 4 years earlier as a Democratic State—who was retired—and one of the—from the family that had more so—more Senators appointed than any other family in American history, the Tunnells—and a former retired justice and the State chairman. And they said—and I'm standing in a towel with shaving cream on my face. [Laughter] And with that, they looked at me and said—they come in and said: ""We're coming—we just had dinner. We want to talk to you."" And I walked in, and I said, ""Okay, gentlemen."" And I ran to the bathroom thinking I could put something on. [Laughter] All I could do is take off the shaving cream. I had on a towel. I walked out—two headboards nailed to one side of the wall, the desk to the other side. And I'm—they're—he's sitting on the end of the bed. And I'm sitting down, and they said, ""Joe, we just had dinner, and we think you should run for the Senate."" I said: ""Run? Man, I'm not old enough."" And the former Justice looked at me he said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do well in constitutional law."" [Laughter] ""You don't have to be—you have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected at any age. You'll be—17 days after, you'll be eligible. One thing then, I don't know about you, but all of us who have some teacher or some professor we really had faith in. Well, my political philosophy professor at Delaware—which was between—Newark, Delaware—between Dover and my home—was one of those guys. And I called him, and I said, ""Can I stop by and see you?"" And I remember seeing him and asking him my—a question: What he thinks I should do. He said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" I go, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] Seriously, it's an absolutely true story. He said, ""Joe, the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves."" [Laughter] And I was opposed to the Vietnam war. Anyway, one thing led to another. I ended up running not with any enthusiasm as I started. But we had the same kind of thing of—just a lot of young people and people who hadn't been deeply involved. Just—there was a—we had a picnic for our volunteers at the end of the summer. And there was ads on the radio: ""Do not take I-95 South. Biden is having a picnic. There was no accident."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. [Laughter] Nixon won by 60 percent of the vote. We won by a rousing 3,100 votes. But my point is, it wasn't planned. I love reading these biographies of me that: ""Biden knew he was going to run for President. He knew it was going to happen."" But look, folks, it matters, it matters what we do. You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here doing it—forget me. I mean, you wouldn't be here if you didn't think a lot was at stake. And we have enormous opportunities—enormous opportunities. But I know that probably over-answers your question, but—[laughter]. Ms. Friedman. Amazing. Mr. President, thank you so, so much. Hasn't this been amazing?","The President. Guys, you come up here. Come on. Come on. Good to see you, buddy. Audience member. Yes, you too. The President. Come on. With the Bells and the Bidens, like all of you—my dad used to have an expression. He'd say, ""Family is the beginning, the middle, and the end""—""the beginning, the middle, and the end."" [At this point, the President addressed Eloise Giroux, daughter of Megan Bell Giroux, who introduced the President, and granddaughter of Tommy Bell, a childhood friend of the President.] And you need Secret Service guarding you. [Laughter] But, folks, look, first of all, I want to thank the Carpenters Union. They've been with me for my entire career. They've been loyal to me, and I think I've been loyal to them. Now, one of the things that she hadn't told you is Tommy is—along with Larry—Larry, stand up. This is Larry Orr. Larry is another one of the—he lived right across the gates in Marywood—and another guy named Charlie Roth, the four of us were inseparable. When things changed for my dad up in Scranton and lost his job, we moved back to Delaware, where he was from. And when he originally—that's where he came from—Delaware—to Scranton. And I'd come home though for every holiday, almost all summer. And when I fell in love when I was in law school—I actually wasn't even in law school, I was in college. I went on spring break. I had made $85 of—from a tax return. [Laughter] And—oh, you think I'm kidding; I'm not. [Laughter] And my dad didn't own, but he ran an automobile dealership. And so I had a car, and I put five guys in the car. They all chipped in to pay the way down. We went to Lauderdale. Now, the problem is—I'm going to lose a lot of credibility with all of you—[laughter]—but I'm the only Scrantonian and the only Irishman you've ever met that's never had a drink in his life, because too many people have too many drinks in their life, in my opinion. [Laughter] And so we got down to Fort Lauderdale, and all everybody was doing is drunk most of the time. And I found out that there was a possibility of being able to get on a plane for 20 bucks—$22 round trip to go to Nassau. [Laughter] So I thought, ""Well, there may be some nice girls in Nassau."" [Laughter] The only reason we all came down—any rate. So I got on the plane, and I had two guys with me. We had just finished spring football practice at the University of Delaware. And I had been named as the likely starting safety that year and—next year. And so we started off, and a guy named—his nickname was—he was Mike McCrann. We called him ""Crash"" McCrann. He looked like Rock Hudson and acted like it. [Laughter] And a guy named Fred Sears, who ran one of the biggest banks in Delaware later. And so we walked into—we went to the British Colonial hotel. We—actually, we found a bunch of guys from Michigan. We slept on the floor of their place. And we went to go to the beach. Turns out, all the beaches in Nassau—public beaches, there's none of the college girls. They're—you know, they're all locals, and there's not many people. So we walked down to the beach this particular day—the first day we got there—and the British Colonial hotel had this chain-link fence that ran from the street all the way down into the water so you couldn't cross into the hotel area. And so we wondered what the heck we were going to do. Turns out they—a bunch of folks going in and throwing their towels saying ""British Colonial hotel"" on it over the—barbed wire—not barbed wire—chain-link fence. So I had an idea. We each grabbed a towel, put it around us, and we walked in the front door—[laughter]—no, I'm serious; true story—of the British Colonial hotel. And we walked in, and we acted like—and you walked in, and you had the registration on the left and down the—but straight ahead—like, from here, half again the distance from the back wall—was the glass looking out on the swimming pool and then beyond the swimming pool and onto the ocean. And so we just walked in like we belonged there and walked right out. [Laughter] And I'm standing there, and we're all looking around, and I saw this beautiful young woman. I said, ""I'm going to go talk to her."" And old Crash McCrann, I nicknamed—he was a fullback—I said, ""No, I am."" I said—and Fred Sears, my buddy, flipped a coin. I won. [Laughter] And so I walked up, sat down on the end of the bench of the—and the sun was coming from—toward the water. And it was later—and toward the water. And I sat on the end of the chaise lounge, and I said: ""My name is Joe Biden. I'm from the University of Delaware."" And she said, ""My name is Neilia Hunter. I'm from Syracuse."" And I said hi, and we started to talk and just talking. And I watched this yacht pull up in front. I'm not—this is not a joke. Well, to me, it was a yacht. It was, like, 40, 45 feet. [Laughter] And I see this guy with a white hat on, white, you know, uniform—not uniform—pants and the shoes and the whole deal. And he gets in a little dingy, and he rows to shore. And I'm just—I'm talking to her like—like you're she, and I'm looking up. And I watch the guy pull up, and he pulls a—the dingy up onto the beach. And he starts walking toward us. And I'm just watching him. And he walks straight to us, and he looks down at Neilia, and he says, ""Neilia, are we on for dinner tonight?"" [Laughter] I thought, ""Oh, man."" [Laughter] But what happened was he—she looked, and she said, ""Oh, I'm sorry""—it was the Wickwire family, a major highway contractor in New York—in Skaneateles, New York, in the State of New York. And what—they were neighbors. And she said, ""No."" She said, ""I—Joe and I are going to go to dinner."" [Laughter] And so, with that, he left, and she was mortified. She said, ""I'm so sorry, but I didn't want to."" I said, ""Why don't we?"" I had a total of $42 left. [Laughter] But then, you could buy a McDonald's hamburger for 19 cents or something. [Laughter] So she said, ""Well, I know a place we can go."" And she's a very classy lady. She picked a place she thought we—I could afford. And so we walked into this particular restaurant and sat down. I ordered a hamburger because I didn't have any money, and she—the classy woman she was, she ordered the same thing, like whatever it was. But anyway, we—and I was smitten by her. I really was. And you know, sometimes, there's love at first sight. This really was. I was—my—I was just taken by her. And she was really quiet, and she was lovely. And one thing led to another, and she said—the bill came. And the bill was $48. [Laughter] And I had $23. And I could feel under the table—I could feel this. [The President rested his hand on an audience member's knee.] And I put my hand down, and she put 40 bucks in my hand. [Laughter] Her father was fairly wealthy. He was a Navy cook and an Auburn—if you know Auburn, New York, he had a large diner in Auburn, which was very profitable, and he also had the contracts to do Syracuse University. Anyway, he was a fairly wealthy guy. And so I took it, and I paid. I said, ""I'm so embarrassed."" She said, ""Oh, it happens to my father all the time."" [Laughter] So we're walking back to the hotel she was staying at, and I swear to God, I hadn't kissed her, I hadn't done—we hadn't done a single thing together. And there was a chain and—that—post and chain dividing—stopping the parking lot from coming out of the—and so, like a horse's tail, I was going to show—I jumped over the chain. [Laughter] And I caught my ankle and fell. [Laughter] Totally mortified. She said: ""Oh, that's okay. That's—are you okay?"" I said, ""Yes."" And I got up, and I looked at her, and I know—and this wasn't a joke—I looked at her. I said, ""You know, I think I'm going to marry you."" I give you my word. And she looked at me, and we hadn't even kissed one another, and she said, ""I think so."" From that time on, I quit the football team that year—that was spring practice—the next year, and I started commuting every single weekend. My dad ran an automobile agency, and I made money by getting—there was a place called Manheim Auto Auction, where they—and I would drive to Manheim. And back in those days at Delaware, you could not—you could not have a car on campus. And so a lot of the guys I was with, they were happy to get a chance to drive a relatively new car. They paid $10 for every car we delivered back to Delaware. So I'd get a van, take 10 guys up, get 100 bucks; I'd keep $50. [Laughter] No. And that's how I'd go back and forth every single weekend—every single weekend. And—but sometimes, it just happens. Sometimes, it just happens. And so no man deserves one great love, let alone two. When she was killed in that accident with my daughter as well, my two boys weren't expected to make it. And they were only just 3 and just 4 years old. And what happened was that I got put on that 10-most-eligible-bachelors list in America. [Laughter] You've got it man. I thought it was a pretty cool thing. [Laughter] But I used to send more things to the Secret Service because I'd get women sending me pictures that I was afraid I'd get set up for. [Laughter] And unlike the guy running, I didn't take advantage of any of it. [Laughter] Any rate, to make a long story short, all kidding aside, I would just give them to the Secret Service. So I decided I couldn't—I really couldn't date anybody because every time I'd go out with somebody—I had more yentas in Delaware than you can imagine—very nice to me. And so I just gave up. And I get a call from my youngest brother. He said, ""Joe, I've got just the girl for you."" And he was at the University of Delaware at the time, as this girl was. She used to be 9 years younger than me. Now she's 25 years younger, but—[laughter]. So he said: ""You'll love her. She doesn't like politics."" [Laughter] And I met her, and this third date I went out with her, I realized I was going to marry her. No man deserves one great love, let alone two. So I've been an incredibly fortunate guy—incredibly fortunate. And that's why I kept coming back up to Scranton, because what would happen is, I would drive up on—after I paid my guys their money, I'd drive up on Friday—through Scranton, up 81, up into Syracuse, next to Skaneateles Lake—and then go back. And I'd always stop at my Uncle Jack's house on the way back in Scranton. And you know, everybody's from Scranton, but no one ever leaves Scranton. [Laughter] It's in their—but any rate, I don't know why the hell I told you that. [Laughter] Except you reminded me. Megan Bell Giroux. It was my fault. I told—[inaudible]. The President. No, no, but you know, look, folks, I've ran for—I can't tell you how much I appreciate what you've done. It's a pretty basic thing for me. You may remember when I announced for President, I said I was running for three reasons, initially. I said, one is to restore the soul of America. We lost a sense of decency that was in the way we campaign and what people say and how they talk to one another. And the second thing, I said I wanted to rebuild the middle class because when the middle class works, everyone works—everyone does better. I said, thirdly, I want to unite the country. And I was, understandably, by the national press, viewed as I was—they'd give me credit for being a fairly significant United States Senator and able to cross the aisle and get a lot done, but they thought I was extremely naive. I don't know how we can lead the world when we can't unite ourselves. I really mean it. I mean, so we've got a lot of work to do. And then I decided—my son Beau ended up going—volunteering to go to Iraq. He was the attorney general of the State of Delaware. And he came back—he—his—I was in, I think, 36, 38 times in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Senator and as a Vice President. And he came back—he—his hooch—that's where he slept—was only about 400 yards from a major burn pit. And the burn pit is about the size of a football field—probably 80 yards long, 30, 40 yards wide—burning everything from human waste to oil and the rest. And just like the 9/11 firemen got—my son came back after a year with glioblastoma—stage 4 glioblastoma. And I lost him. And I didn't—I wasn't going to run again. I really wasn't. Not a—I give you my word, I had no intention of running again. And then along came what happened down in Charlottesville. And I talked to the mother who lost that daughter who was killed by these—coming out of a field, in the United States of America, in the year two thousand and—I guess it was '16, '17, '18, in that range, but a little later—carrying torches, Ku Klux Klan, Nazi banners—I mean, literally Nazi swastikas, and marching through the streets. And my future opponent, my present opponent—they asked him what he thought of it. He said there were ""very good people on both sides."" And I'm going to say something that may sound outrageous to you, but I thought—I thought—he's the antithesis of everything I believe, and I thought I could beat him. And that's why I ran. And so what's at stake now, folks, is our democracy. It's not hyperbole. You may remember, when I got the nomination, the first thing I did, I made a speech at the—in Convention Hall—excuse me, in Philadelphia. And I made a speech on democracy. And a lot of people said, ""What's he doing that for?"" Because it is at stake. We've never had this kind of a campaign before. And so, for me, it's not about whether or not you're left, right, or center—although it matters to my philosophy of government—but it matters about whether or not you're going to abide by the basic rules, you're going to have a sense of decency. You—I've never thought I'd see a time when I'm going through a neighborhood or a rural town that's in the west and see big signs that—have a Trump sign in the middle that says ""F—Biden"" and having a little kid standing with his middle finger, 7 years old, 8 years old. Oh, I promise, it happens all the time. It's not who we are. So the point I'm making is this: We are—think of—it this way: If the United States wasn't leading the world, who could step up to do it? No, not a joke. What other country? What other country? I've known every major world leader for the last 35 years. I know them all by their first names—not a joke—not because I'm important; because of the nature of my job when I was Foreign Relations Committee and a senior Senator. And you know, the rest of the world looks to us. I walk in a room—no matter whether it's the G-7 or the G-20, whatever it is—and they all look to me—not me, Joe Biden; America—because they know we are the essential nation. And you know, Madeleine Albright wrote about us being the essential—she was absolutely right, absolutely right. And we have a chance. We have an incredible chance to change the direction of the world without using American forces. We have an enormous chance. So I said before I ran, I was going to write a book on inflection points in American history, where the things that happen in a very short period of time can determine what the next four, five, six decades look like. We have a chance. We have a chance to change the dynamic in a way that we haven't had before. The postwar era is over. It's over. What's going to follow? So I—when I started the book—and I decided to run instead. I started the book, I talked about how technology has changed the direction in the world. Were it not for Gutenberg inventing the printing press, there would be no unity in Europe. They wouldn't have been able to communicate with one another at the period of time. All the way to the—it's a silly example—Nixon would probably be President but for a televised debate where he perspired a great deal. And—[laughter]—no, I—no, I'm not joking. I'm thinking these things matter. Even to now, look what's happening on TikTok. Look what's happening. What are the source of information? These press people are all honest and decent, and they take real risks. And not a lot—and they don't all like me. But they—[laughter]—no, I'm serious. This is—they're entitled to that. But they take real risks. But, folks, think about it. Where do people get their news these days? I mean, all the data shows hardly anybody watches the nightly news, in relative terms. Who reads the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the—and so on? I mean, what percentage of people? So where did they get their news? And it's so much—so easy to just flat-out lie and not know what's true. So we've got a lot at stake here—a lot at stake. But for me, it gets down to a basic thing. My dad used to say—for real; my word—he'd say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than—is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it—and mean it."" That's what this is all about. The vast majority of the American people just want an even chance, just a shot. Just a shot. And it breaks down into everything from taxes to philosophy. But with your help, I've been able to get a lot done that no one thought could get done. We've been able to get a lot done. But there's so much more we have to do, but we can do it. But we have to win. And it gets down to old-fashioned politics, gets down to knocking on doors, gets down to telling stories about why you're for who you're for. It gets down to being able to have—pick these people to put yard signs up. It matters. Last point I'll make—and I'm talking too long, and I apologize. [Laughter] The last point I'll make is, we have over 100—is it 120 or 160? What's it up to now? Individual contributors? Aide. Oh, 1.6—[inaudible]. The President. One-point-six million individual contributors; 550,000 more than before—than—since we started, new contributors. You know what the—of—97 percent of those contributors contributed less than $200—97 percent. There's a real groundswell going on because of you. It matters. It matters. And people are contributing $5, $10, $30, $50. And it's having a real impact and real effect. We have opened more campaign offices because of you all than he—doesn't—hasn't opened any that I'm aware of. I'm not being facetious. I'm not being facetious. We're also in a situation where we're in a position that we're generating a paid staff. That's significant. And we're growing in every State. I've been to—every single—every single of the toss-up States so far. And guess what? If you knock anybody who knows anything about polling, it's awful hard to poll these days. Because—no, I'm serious. But guess what? Even in the polls that are being used now, we're ahead in—35 polls, but—by the way—it's just about continuing to push. And, again, one simple proposition: How do we give hard-working Americans an even shot, an even chance—an even chance to make it? Just that. Nothing more than that. And how do we move people together again? And I think we can do it. I'm confident that we're going to be able to do it. And I feel very good about where we are because of all of you. But thank you for what you're doing. Again, I didn't mean to tell you so much. [Laughter] But thank you, thank you, thank you. Pennsylvania General Election Campaign Director Amy Friedman. Well, Mr. President, I think we have a few folks eager to ask you questions, if we may. The President. Sure. Ms. Friedman. Absolutely. Sam. Sam Kuchwara. Mr. President, what made you run for President? The President. A simple proposition, and I was—I asked that question—I just came from my old home where I was raised in Scranton. A simple proposition that—just simply, people just want a shot. They just want an even shot and just to be able to realize the possibility that what they care about will matter with what will happen. What made me run for President: In fact, when I moved from Scranton—my dad was born in Baltimore. They say—— [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] Baltimore—[laughter]—in Baltimore. And his dad was with the American Oil Company. And they opened up the American Oil Company, used to—AMOCO, it became. And the Blaustein family owned it. He opened up York, Pennsylvania, then he opened up Scranton. And they moved to Scranton when my dad was a junior in high school. And you know, it's—and so, I was born in Scranton, and then we moved back to Delaware. When we moved back to Delaware, one thing that I hadn't seen in Scranton—there were very few African Americans in Scranton when I was here in Lackawanna County—very few. But in Delaware, we have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of population of any State in the Nation. And in addition to that, we're one of those border States that couldn't—that—it was a slave State that fought on the side of the North because it couldn't figure how to get to the South. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. So was Maryland. So was Tennessee. Anyway—and so I remember when we moved to Delaware, we lived on—in what later became section 8 housing. It was a long way—but very, very modest apartment complex was being built in Claymont with about 400 apartments. And I remember that they'd drive—Mom would drive us up to school in the morning because it was too dangerous to—it was a—the Philadelphia Pike was an—access highway. It wasn't I-95, which is now the way to get there. But she was worried of us crossing the streets. So I was in third grade. My sister was in first grade. And they'd drop us in the parking lot. And we used to watch—and I couldn't understand why this little Catholic school I went to, Holy Rosary—why this bus would go by when we pulled in the parking lot that had what was referred to then as—all full of ""Colored"" children. There were no Whites in it. And even though the major school—public school, Claymont High School, was a right-hand turn three blocks up. I remember asking my mother why they couldn't come—why'd that bus go all the way downtown? And she said, ""Because they're not allowed to go to school with White kids."" ""Not allowed to go to school with White kids."" And that had an enormous impression on me. And it got me engaged in the civil rights movement. I wasn't in any great shape, but I was a public—I became a public defender after getting a job with a fancy law firm. My city of Wilmington, Delaware, was the only city in America occupied by the military for 10 months, with the National Guard standing on the corner with drawn bayonets for 10 months when Dr. King was assassinated because of the riots that occurred. And so I got involved trying to change the Democratic Party and turn it into more—the conservative party on race was the Democratic Party in Delaware. And the Republican Party, which was the party of DuPont, was very, very restrictive on economic issues, but it was more open. So I joined a group of senior members of the—Democratic Party to try to reform the Democratic Party and move it to more of a Northeastern Democratic Party. The Governor of Delaware could choose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference or the Northeast. And the Democrats often chose to be part of the Southern Governors' Conference. In the southern part of the State there is a canal that goes across the top of my State, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal that cuts—bisects the State. And when you just go below that canal—and I'm not—this is not a criticism—— [The President imitated a regional accent.] They talk at you like this. Eastern Shore of Maryland. Very southern in the way they talk and the way they move and everything. And so I got involved in trying to change the party. And one thing led to another, and I remember they came to me and said they wanted me to run, the local folks. Trying to get people to run—just show up as Democrats in areas they—that they weren't able to win. And so I got a call—I was a public defender part-time in a—and I had a law practice. I was starting alone. And with that, I remember a group of people from Elsmere, Delaware—the Democratic organization—came to see me, wanted me to run for the State Senate. And I said, ""I can't do that because I'm just starting a law firm, and I can't go to Dover."" And they came back about 3 days later and said, ""Well, why don't you run for the county council?"" I said, ""I can't do that."" And they said, ""Come here."" And they walked me to my window in my office, and it looked across—and they said, ""They meet there twice a week at night."" [Laughter] So they wanted me to run in a district no Democrat had ever run. And I said: ""Well, at least I can do my job. I can go out and run. Make—demonstrate that we're running."" And the problem is, I asked my sister who has graduated with honors from Delaware, who's smarter than me and ran my campaign. And she won a campaign where a Democrat had never won. And all of a sudden, I was in the county council. And—but the Democrats—the Republicans saw something in me I didn't see, for—it's the God's truth. They saw in me that I was going to do something beyond that. I was elected to a 4-year term. And what they did was, they reapportioned me to a 2-year term. So it was either up or out. And I was happy with that. I was prepared to leave and do my practice and work in the party. And one thing led to another, and I won't bore you with the detail, but one day I showed up at an off-year convention, and I was in—I was in the motel after—the local motel getting changed after the afternoon session, go back to the evening session. And I'd come down with some young activists—they were a little older than me, but still young activists—who were involved in trying to reform the party. And I was in one of those 8-by-10 bathrooms—you know they have a shower, a toilet, and a sink. And I got a towel on me and shaving cream, and I hear, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" at my door really loudly. And I wonder, ""What the hell is that?"" I thought it was this guy Bob Cunningham, who had a radio show, and couple of other guys. So I say, ""Okay, okay, guys."" And I walked to the door and opened it up and standing there was the former Governor of the State of Delaware, Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy, about 6'5"". [The President imitated a regional accent.] Talked at you like this. [Laughter] And the State representative who got defeated 4 years earlier as a Democratic State—who was retired—and one of the—from the family that had more so—more Senators appointed than any other family in American history, the Tunnells—and a former retired justice and the State chairman. And they said—and I'm standing in a towel with shaving cream on my face. [Laughter] And with that, they looked at me and said—they come in and said: ""We're coming—we just had dinner. We want to talk to you."" And I walked in, and I said, ""Okay, gentlemen."" And I ran to the bathroom thinking I could put something on. [Laughter] All I could do is take off the shaving cream. I had on a towel. I walked out—two headboards nailed to one side of the wall, the desk to the other side. And I'm—they're—he's sitting on the end of the bed. And I'm sitting down, and they said, ""Joe, we just had dinner, and we think you should run for the Senate."" I said: ""Run? Man, I'm not old enough."" And the former Justice looked at me he said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do well in constitutional law."" [Laughter] ""You don't have to be—you have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected at any age. You'll be—17 days after, you'll be eligible. One thing then, I don't know about you, but all of us who have some teacher or some professor we really had faith in. Well, my political philosophy professor at Delaware—which was between—Newark, Delaware—between Dover and my home—was one of those guys. And I called him, and I said, ""Can I stop by and see you?"" And I remember seeing him and asking him my—a question: What he thinks I should do. He said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" I go, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] Seriously, it's an absolutely true story. He said, ""Joe, the penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves."" [Laughter] And I was opposed to the Vietnam war. Anyway, one thing led to another. I ended up running not with any enthusiasm as I started. But we had the same kind of thing of—just a lot of young people and people who hadn't been deeply involved. Just—there was a—we had a picnic for our volunteers at the end of the summer. And there was ads on the radio: ""Do not take I-95 South. Biden is having a picnic. There was no accident."" [Laughter] No, I'm serious. [Laughter] Nixon won by 60 percent of the vote. We won by a rousing 3,100 votes. But my point is, it wasn't planned. I love reading these biographies of me that: ""Biden knew he was going to run for President. He knew it was going to happen."" But look, folks, it matters, it matters what we do. You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be here doing it—forget me. I mean, you wouldn't be here if you didn't think a lot was at stake. And we have enormous opportunities—enormous opportunities. But I know that probably over-answers your question, but—[laughter]. Ms. Friedman. Amazing. Mr. President, thank you so, so much. Hasn't this been amazing?","['guys', 'see', 'buddy', 'audience', 'member', 'yes', 'bells', 'bidens', 'dad', 'used', 'expression', 'hed', 'family', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'beginning', 'middle',

Having the Kennedy clan here supporting me like they are, that really means a lot to me.', 'You know, when I was the age of some of you guys in this audience, the—all I had to look to—not all I had—had to look at the Kennedy family.', ""I have—as I said, I have—I have President John F. Kennedy's desk, the Resolute, where John-John came out through the front of the desk, you know? And I sit there, and I look at the—those two—those two busts by the fireplace. I'm sitting at my desk, from here to the wall, there's President—or excuse me—Martin Luther King and there's Teddy Kennedy, whose brother is the one sitting—brings to my head about what we got to do, but his brother sitting there on that other—other pedestal, Robert F. Kennedy."", ""And look, you're—you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House."", ""And I was able—and you're getting a whole hell of a lot of people on board."", 'I went home, as they say, to——', '[At this point, the President imitated a Scranton, PA, accent.]', '""Scranon""—[laughter]. There\'s no ""t"" in Scranton if you\'re from Scranton. [Laughter]', ""I went home to Scranton, and we got a chance to talk about a lot of things. But the main thing we got to talk about is the value set that's up there, just like it is throughout the working class areas of this State—you know, an awful lot of good people, decent people I grew up with, people who taught me, for real, that—that everything was about treating everybody with dignity, no matter who you were. Not a joke. Not a joke."", 'And so then we headed off to Pittsburgh. And you know, Pittsburgh is back—the ""City of Bridges,"" 438 of them, as a matter of fact. They keep building them too—[laughter]—a whole hell of a lot of them.', ""But you know, steel—you know, I've always joked and said that this not only a steel State, this is a State that has a spine of steel. And the folks in Pittsburgh are really working like hell, and they're doing well. And we're finally making sure that United States Steel stays United States Steel. It's not going to be anything—anybody else's steel."", ""And then, you know, we—I'm here because—some of you remember—some of you—I'm only 42, but—[laughter]—some of you who are a little bit older may remember that, for the longest time, my little State of Delaware, just south of here—I was raised in—after Scranton, in Claymont, Delaware, right on the border. And you know, for the longest time, Delaware had no television station. We were covered by Philly."", 'And one of the proudest moments of my life—I nearly got killed politically—was when I was the most popular Senator in Pennsylvania. [Laughter] No, really. Remember that? It was—because they had to cover—I was on—Philadelphia television as much as both the Senators were from Pennsylvania. [Laughter]', ""But look, there's a lot at stake. And I'm only going to take a few seconds."", 'Audience member. Take as long as you want.', 'The President. No, no, no. [Laughter]', ""It really is about—our democracy is really at risk. It's not a joke. I mean, I'm being deadly earnest. And this guy means what he says. If we haven't learned that now, we're kidding ourselves. He means what he says."", ""And when he talks about being a dictator on the first day, he means being able to negate elements of the Constitution. He's named where they were. He said what he would do."", 'The idea that he thinks that those insurrectionists were ""patriots"" and he\'s going to free them all if, in fact, he gets elected—I mean, this is a full-blown attack on the Capitol in a way that hadn\'t happened since the Civil War.', ""So there's a lot going on. He's committed to be opposed to—not just figuratively, literally—everything you've helped me get done—everything. He wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He wants to get rid—just go down the list."", ""So what you're doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than any—all of us combined. It's about what kind of country our kids are going to live in. Not because I'm running—not Joe Biden. I mean this sincerely. Not because of me, but because of the opposite, what happens if we lose this election."", ""And it's—you know, Joe has done a hell of a job. I asked Joe to be the Envoy to Ireland when we were—no, it's a big deal. The Irish accords, we were not sure they were going to—weren't going to fall apart. He went over, he gained the respect of the Republic as well as the North, and he made sure they stayed in place."", ""So, Joe, I've got to warn you: If I win, you're not going anywhere, pal. [Laughter] You may be out of the country, but you're going to be working with us. [Laughter]"", ""Any rate. So I just want to—I just want to thank you all. You've been incredible to me. Philadelphia has always been the base of how I've won all my elections. I mean, for real. So, I'm counting on it."", ""And you know, Pennsylvania is—I think Pennsylvania is one of those States where it's kind of unique. It's a very successful State. It's a wealthy State. But it's also a working class State, where people keep their word, where people mean what they say, where people show up and do what they say they're going to do. And that's who we are."", ""So I'll end by saying: For the longest time, as a young Senator, I heard about trickle-down economics. You know, there used to be—there was a law that was passed in 1934. It was about unions and could they be—were they legal or not, so on and so forth. But the law that ended up being passed said not only are unions legit and they have a right to—you can't artificially stop them from organizing, but they did a second thing."", 'It said that, in the United States of America, if a President is given money from the Congress to do something that is for America—build a new aircraft carrier deck, build a highway, build—whatever it is the money is given for—he should do two things or she should do two things: Number one, make sure they use American products and, number two, American workforce.', ""That was honored in the breach for the vast majority of the years. When I came to office—and the only excuse could be is there weren't workers that could do the job in America and if there weren't materials to be able to do the job."", ""But since I've been President, it's been investing in America. The longest time we spent, including some administrations—even some—[inaudible]—some Democratic administrations."", ""What did we do? Corporate America—and I know a little bit about corporate America, being from Delaware—more corporations incorporated there than every other State in the Union. That's not a joke."", ""But I've always been straight with them. But what did corporate America decide to do? If they had to build something, they found the cheapest labor in the world to build it with. So, they go overseas so they—the labor was cheaper—whether it was to Taiwan, South Korea, wherever it was—and then they'd import the product back home. We changed that. We are making sure we build it here and sending the product over there. And that's why we're working."", 'And for the longest time, you notice, the—the mainstream economists criticized me, said I didn\'t get it right. But guess what they\'re saying now? No, I\'m serious. Not—not the right wing, but even the conservative economists. It\'s working. Invest in—because they started to say: ""This about the government making judgments of what\'s best for the country. Let the free enterprise system do it."" The free enterprise system didn\'t do it as well as we\'re doing it now. It\'s still a free enterprise system. We decide where to invest the money.', 'So thank you for all you\'ve done. We\'re going to do well here in the State because of you. But it gets down to basic things. As Joe said, it\'s about picking up the phone. It\'s about knocking on doors. It\'s about standing in the shopping centers. It\'s about showing up and just asking: ""What do you care about? What\'s on your mind?"" Because an awful lot of people become very sour. Think about it.', 'It used to be the way we would communicate. Most people picked up the paper and read the, quote, ""Philadelphia Inquirer,"" in the old days, picked up the phone, or turned on the TV and watch the nightly news. They don\'t do it anymore. It\'s on this phone. It sounds—no, that\'s not a joke. If you look at the percentages of people where they get their news, and there\'s so much on—and it\'s not—you can almost not blame them because so much of what you read is just flat lies. Simply not true.', ""And so the only way to get through is eye to eye. That's the best way to do it. And that's why I'm counting on all of you."", ""And lastly, I'll point out that, you know, we have 11 headquarters here in Pennsylvania and still we're going—keep going. But we also have more people employed here as volunteers—volunteers for full-time employees as well in this effort. He doesn't have one single headquarter in this State. The one he had, he closed. No, I'm serious. He doesn't have any headquarters around the country."", ""You know how much money we raised so far? We raised a whole hell of a lot of money. We got one-point—but here's the deal: 1.6 million people. Let me make sure that's—either two or six. I—the press is here, and I don't want to be misquoted. [Laughter] Get the exact number. Hang on."", 'Aide. One-point-six.', ""The President. Is it one-six—it's 1.6, isn't it?"", 'Aide. One-point-six.', 'The President. Yes.', 'White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

I mean, is the—and we raised a lot of money last time around.', ""So, folks, we're really moving. And I think we're going to see in all the—in—I didn't even get into the—into the issues which you all know so well."", 'But I mean—and isn\'t it amazing how principled the opposition is?

Not a joke. Not a joke. And so then we headed off to Pittsburgh. And you know, Pittsburgh is back—the ""City of Bridges,"" 438 of them, as a matter of fact. They keep building them too—[laughter]—a whole hell of a lot of them. But you know, steel—you know, I've always joked and said that this not only a steel State, this is a State that has a spine of steel. And the folks in Pittsburgh are really working like hell, and they're doing well. And we're finally making sure that United States Steel stays United States Steel. It's not going to be anything—anybody else's steel. And then, you know, we—I'm here because—some of you remember—some of you—I'm only 42, but—[laughter]—some of you who are a little bit older may remember that, for the longest time, my little State of Delaware, just south of here—I was raised in—after Scranton, in Claymont, Delaware, right on the border. And you know, for the longest time, Delaware had no television station. We were covered by Philly. And one of the proudest moments of my life—I nearly got killed politically—was when I was the most popular Senator in Pennsylvania. [Laughter] No, really. Remember that? It was—because they had to cover—I was on—Philadelphia television as much as both the Senators were from Pennsylvania. [Laughter] But look, there's a lot at stake. And I'm only going to take a few seconds. Audience member. Take as long as you want. The President. No, no, no. [Laughter] It really is about—our democracy is really at risk. It's not a joke. I mean, I'm being deadly earnest. And this guy means what he says. If we haven't learned that now, we're kidding ourselves. He means what he says. And when he talks about being a dictator on the first day, he means being able to negate elements of the Constitution. He's named where they were. He said what he would do. The idea that he thinks that those insurrectionists were ""patriots"" and he's going to free them all if, in fact, he gets elected—I mean, this is a full-blown attack on the Capitol in a way that hadn't happened since the Civil War. So there's a lot going on. He's committed to be opposed to—not just figuratively, literally—everything you've helped me get done—everything. He wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He wants to get rid—just go down the list. So what you're doing here is bigger than me, bigger than you, bigger than any—all of us combined. It's about what kind of country our kids are going to live in. Not because I'm running—not Joe Biden. I mean this sincerely. Not because of me, but because of the opposite, what happens if we lose this election. And it's—you know, Joe has done a hell of a job. I asked Joe to be the Envoy to Ireland when we were—no, it's a big deal. The Irish accords, we were not sure they were going to—weren't going to fall apart. He went over, he gained the respect of the Republic as well as the North, and he made sure they stayed in place. So, Joe, I've got to warn you: If I win, you're not going anywhere, pal. [Laughter] You may be out of the country, but you're going to be working with us. [Laughter] Any rate. So I just want to—I just want to thank you all. You've been incredible to me. Philadelphia has always been the base of how I've won all my elections. I mean, for real. So, I'm counting on it. And you know, Pennsylvania is—I think Pennsylvania is one of those States where it's kind of unique. It's a very successful State. It's a wealthy State. But it's also a working class State, where people keep their word, where people mean what they say, where people show up and do what they say they're going to do. And that's who we are. So I'll end by saying: For the longest time, as a young Senator, I heard about trickle-down economics. You know, there used to be—there was a law that was passed in 1934. It was about unions and could they be—were they legal or not, so on and so forth. But the law that ended up being passed said not only are unions legit and they have a right to—you can't artificially stop them from organizing, but they did a second thing. It said that, in the United States of America, if a President is given money from the Congress to do something that is for America—build a new aircraft carrier deck, build a highway, build—whatever it is the money is given for—he should do two things or she should do two things: Number one, make sure they use American products and, number two, American workforce. That was honored in the breach for the vast majority of the years. When I came to office—and the only excuse could be is there weren't workers that could do the job in America and if there weren't materials to be able to do the job. But since I've been President, it's been investing in America. The longest time we spent, including some administrations—even some—[inaudible]—some Democratic administrations. What did we do? Corporate America—and I know a little bit about corporate America, being from Delaware—more corporations incorporated there than every other State in the Union. That's not a joke. But I've always been straight with them. But what did corporate America decide to do? If they had to build something, they found the cheapest labor in the world to build it with. So, they go overseas so they—the labor was cheaper—whether it was to Taiwan, South Korea, wherever it was—and then they'd import the product back home. We changed that. We are making sure we build it here and sending the product over there. And that's why we're working. And for the longest time, you notice, the—the mainstream economists criticized me, said I didn't get it right. But guess what they're saying now? No, I'm serious. Not—not the right wing, but even the conservative economists. It's working. Invest in—because they started to say: ""This about the government making judgments of what's best for the country. Let the free enterprise system do it."" The free enterprise system didn't do it as well as we're doing it now. It's still a free enterprise system. We decide where to invest the money. So thank you for all you've done. We're going to do well here in the State because of you. But it gets down to basic things. As Joe said, it's about picking up the phone. It's about knocking on doors. It's about standing in the shopping centers. It's about showing up and just asking: ""What do you care about? What's on your mind?"" Because an awful lot of people become very sour. Think about it. It used to be the way we would communicate. Most people picked up the paper and read the, quote, ""Philadelphia Inquirer,"" in the old days, picked up the phone, or turned on the TV and watch the nightly news. They don't do it anymore. It's on this phone. It sounds—no, that's not a joke. If you look at the percentages of people where they get their news, and there's so much on—and it's not—you can almost not blame them because so much of what you read is just flat lies. Simply not true. And so the only way to get through is eye to eye. That's the best way to do it. And that's why I'm counting on all of you. And lastly, I'll point out that, you know, we have 11 headquarters here in Pennsylvania and still we're going—keep going. But we also have more people employed here as volunteers—volunteers for full-time employees as well in this effort. He doesn't have one single headquarter in this State. The one he had, he closed. No, I'm serious. He doesn't have any headquarters around the country. You know how much money we raised so far? We raised a whole hell of a lot of money. We got one-point—but here's the deal: 1.6 million people. Let me make sure that's—either two or six. I—the press is here, and I don't want to be misquoted. [Laughter] Get the exact number. Hang on. Aide. One-point-six. The President. Is it one-six—it's 1.6, isn't it? Aide. One-point-six. The President. Yes. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. One-point-six. The President. One-point-six million individual contributions. Okay. Those of you that have been involved in politics before know what—the next number I'm going to give you is important: 97 percent of those contributions are under—under $200. Ninety-seven percent. Five hundred fifty new contributors—individual contributors just since the last election. I mean, is the—and we raised a lot of money last time around. So, folks, we're really moving. And I think we're going to see in all the—in—I didn't even get into the—into the issues which you all know so well. But I mean—and isn't it amazing how principled the opposition is? [Laughter] Trump: ""I am the reason why Roe v. Wade was overturned. I think it should be States' rights issue now."" [Laughter] ""But, wait, I don't know. Maybe""—— These guys—I'm going to get in trouble. Anyway. [Laughter] Thank you all so very, very much. Appreciate it, appreciate it, appreciate it. Thank you. And thank you.","The President. I tell you what, I'm not sure I want this night to be over with. [Laughter] I tell you what, man, this is a bit of a dream for me. I mean it sincerely. Having the Kennedy clan here supporting me like they are, that really means a lot to me. You know, when I was the age of some of you guys in this audience, the—all I had to look to—not all I had—had to look at the Kennedy family. I have—as I said, I have—I have President John F. Kennedy's desk, the Resolute, where John-John came out through the front of the desk, you know? And I sit there, and I look at the—those two—those two busts by the fireplace. I'm sitting at my desk, from here to the wall, there's President—or excuse me—Martin Luther King and there's Teddy Kennedy, whose brother is the one sitting—brings to my head about what we got to do, but his brother sitting there on that other—other pedestal, Robert F. Kennedy. And look, you're—you're my ticket to the White House: you, Pennsylvania. No, it's not hyperbole. You're the ticket to the White House. And I was able—and you're getting a whole hell of a lot of people on board. I went home, as they say, to—— [At this point, the President imitated a Scranton, PA, accent.] ""Scranon""—[laughter]. There's no ""t"" in Scranton if you're from Scranton. [Laughter] I went home to Scranton, and we got a chance to talk about a lot of things. But the main thing we got to talk about is the value set that's up there, just like it is throughout the working class areas of this State—you know, an awful lot of good people, decent people I grew up with, people who taught me, for real, that—that everything was about treating everybody with dignity, no matter who you were.

What an incredible honor. I don't want to become emotional, but what an incredible honor to have the support of the Kennedy family."", ""John White, Jr., thanks for those kind words and for carrying on your family's civil rights legacy. And so is your son Kellan, who's doing a hell of a job on our campaign. He's helping us win Pennsylvania."", ""Kerry, I—that was the most meaningful introduction I've ever gotten in my life, other than when my sister introduced me. And I want to thank you for your friendship, well beyond the introduction."", ""It's an incredible honor to receive the endorsement of your family. And it means so much to me."", ""Your mom Ethel, whom I spoke with on the phone a couple weeks ago—well, I guess, last week—to wish her happy birthday, she's always been so gracious to my family during the most difficult time of my life. She's done so much for the country and the world in her own right."", ""And of course, your dad, who I never got to meet—I just missed—he was a Senator from New York. He came up to Syracuse University and spoke, and I waited in line, but I didn't get a chance to physically meet him. I never got—but he inspired me. And his passion and courage inspired my generation."", 'Like millions of Americans, I remember that night on April 4, 1968. I was finishing law school at Syracuse University when we heard Dr. King had been assassinated.

You know, one of the things that earlier today I spoke about—up in Washington and, actually, also last week—talking about that this election is a basic, old-fashioned election. It's about getting out the votes. It's about putting together campaigns the old-fashioned way. Not that we don't use all the technology available, but just everything from knocking on doors to putting up road signs to make sure that we get people to the polls, all those things."", ""And you know, it's a—we've got to—there are some animated issues.

But it's not the only one."", ""You know, I know you're reading in the press lately that there's a great concern among—I've been doing this for a couple years. [Laughter] Well, it's hell turning 50. You know what I mean? [Laughter]"", ""And as—and I've spent an awful lot of my time dealing with foreign policy because I was chairman of that committee and because that's why Barack asked me to—for 8 years, to handle portions of that. And one of the things that people don't understand, I don't think, fully, is we are the essential nation."", ""No, not a joke. It's not hyperbole. It's not bragging. It's—think of it this way: If the United States stepped off the world stage, like Trump wants us to do, who would lead the world? Who would lead the world?"", 'And one of the things that\'s happening now is that—and I\'ve—say this in front of the press that—they\'ve heard me say it before. Every international meeting I attend with other heads of state—whether it\'s the G-7, the G-20, all these international meetings—before I leave, literally, almost every one will walk up to me and wait to get me in a corner alone and grab my arm and say, ""You\'ve got to win."" Not because of me, but because of the alternative. And they say, ""Because my democracy depends upon it,"" meaning their democracy.', ""So the whole world is looking, and they're looking to see how we handle ourselves in this election, not just on whether we win or not, but how we handle ourselves."", 'And one of the things that—you know, for me, I got involved when I was a kid in electoral politics out of the civil rights movement. And it all got down to one person at a time—I mean it sincerely—organizing.', ""My State, to its great shame, was segregated by law. That's why I got involved as a kid when I got out of high school and into college.

Of those 1.6 million contributors, 97 percent contributed less than $200.

And the Marist poll now has us up by 3 nationwide."", ""The point I'm making is, people are beginning to listen. This is a time people begin to focus and listen.

For real. It's hard to make it up—make it up. And it just was astounding to me. And a young woman was killed—I spoke to her mom—who was a bystander."", 'And they asked the then-President Trump what he thought, and he said there were—""I think there are very fine people on both sides."" That\'s when I decided I had to run, for real, because our democracy is also at stake—literally, the democracy is at stake.', ""But the way to make sure people understand that is to go out and find out what's on their minds, see what they need. What is it they're most concerned about? And you know, we—you know, we've had enormous success when we've actually asked people—when we go out and do it the old-fashioned way.

It's knocking on doors. It's sending out postcards. It's getting on the telephone. It's going around and making sure people have rides to the polls, all those things."", ""And by the way, when I ran this time, I made it real clear what I was going to do. I said I was going to change the way our economy works, instead of trickle-down economics where they go—where the very wealthy get all the tax breaks and all that will trickle down and grow the economy. I'm a capitalist. I don't care if you—if you make a billion bucks. Just pay your taxes. [Laughter]"", ""No, I really mean it. You know what the average tax rate for someone making—there's—we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Not a joke—8.3 percent. Anybody want to trade with their tax rate?"", 'Audience members. Yes!', ""The President. But look, everything we've done because of your help you've provided over the last 3½ years, he wants to undo. He's made no bones about it—all of it. Just like you have a—Scott wants to get rid of Social Security. You know, these guys are for real."", ""But look at what we've done. We built—we've got a lot—we've got a lot more work to do, but we built the strongest economy in the world. We've got to get inflation even further down. There's a lot more we have to do."", ""And by the way, I know a lot of people got a little frustrated with me when I said I'm going to be the most pro-union President in American history. Well, guess what? I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: With all the union help we're getting and all the union support that we're—they're getting, what's the impact? Everybody does better. Everybody does better, even the people who are [not; White House correction] paying for the union dues, because guess what? I mean, paying the union wage—because they get the best workers in the world."", ""So my generic point is, there's a lot we have going.

And one of the things that's happening now is that—and I've—say this in front of the press that—they've heard me say it before. Every international meeting I attend with other heads of state—whether it's the G-7, the G-20, all these international meetings—before I leave, literally, almost every one will walk up to me and wait to get me in a corner alone and grab my arm and say, ""You've got to win."" Not because of me, but because of the alternative. And they say, ""Because my democracy depends upon it,"" meaning their democracy. So the whole world is looking, and they're looking to see how we handle ourselves in this election, not just on whether we win or not, but how we handle ourselves. And one of the things that—you know, for me, I got involved when I was a kid in electoral politics out of the civil rights movement. And it all got down to one person at a time—I mean it sincerely—organizing. My State, to its great shame, was segregated by law. That's why I got involved as a kid when I got out of high school and into college. And it's about just doing the basic things: talking to people—literally, talking to people. And, for example, we're—I'm really excited. We've raised almost a half a billion dollars so far. [Applause] But here's what excites me: So far, we have 1.6 million contributors—1.6 million contributors—550,000 more than we had last time at this stage of the game. But here's the deal. Of those 1.6 million contributors, 97 percent contributed less than $200. Think of all the numbers that that means. We're in a situation where they have—and as I said, where we raised almost—we're headed toward a half a billion dollars. And that's all about—being able to do the things we have to do in a campaign, especially one that's as hard fought as this and one that is so full of lies, so full of misrepresentations being made. I think—you know, whether the press thinks I'm good, bad, or indifferent, I think they acknowledge that there's less than truth that comes out of the other guy's mouth. And you know, you wouldn't know it from what you read and hear, but you know, we're in pretty good shape in the polls. The—and I know you're all activists, so that's why I'm bothering to tell you this: The polls don't win you an election. But in the last 23 national polls, I've been ahead in 10 of them, Trump has been ahead in 8, and we've been tied in 5. More importantly, the momentum is clearly in our favor. For example, we moved 8 points in the latest Marquette poll and 7 points in the Echelon poll. And the Marist poll now has us up by 3 nationwide. The point I'm making is, people are beginning to listen. This is a time people begin to focus and listen. They have generic impressions up to now, but now they're listening. And they're beginning to listen. And so this campaign's—how many offices have we opened now, total? Where is my—— Aide. A hundred and thirty-three. The President. A hundred—we've opened a hundred—[applause]—133 offices. And here you are. That's the note I had. Yes. And here in Florida, we're opening coordinated offices, hiring staff, and recruiting volunteers as well. But you know, I know we can do this, but I've never been more optimistic. I know—I've been saying this for a long time: I've never been more optimistic about America than I am today. You know, when I—I wasn't going to run in 2020, because I had lost my son in Iraq—because of Iraq in nineteen—anyway, in 2015. But what happened was, remember when, in—down in Virginia, those folks came out of the woods carrying torches and with Nazi banners and singing? For real. It's hard to make it up—make it up. And it just was astounding to me. And a young woman was killed—I spoke to her mom—who was a bystander. And they asked the then-President Trump what he thought, and he said there were—""I think there are very fine people on both sides."" That's when I decided I had to run, for real, because our democracy is also at stake—literally, the democracy is at stake. But the way to make sure people understand that is to go out and find out what's on their minds, see what they need. What is it they're most concerned about? And you know, we—you know, we've had enormous success when we've actually asked people—when we go out and do it the old-fashioned way. And we're just really kicking it up now. We're, you know—we're getting toward the end here. Last time out, we ran, and we raised the vast majority of the money we made in the last 3 months. That's when people began to focus. But we're going to do—we're going to be—we have to be really organized in a big way. But it's basic organization; it's not rocket science. It's knocking on doors. It's sending out postcards. It's getting on the telephone. It's going around and making sure people have rides to the polls, all those things. And by the way, when I ran this time, I made it real clear what I was going to do. I said I was going to change the way our economy works, instead of trickle-down economics where they go—where the very wealthy get all the tax breaks and all that will trickle down and grow the economy. I'm a capitalist. I don't care if you—if you make a billion bucks. Just pay your taxes. [Laughter] No, I really mean it. You know what the average tax rate for someone making—there's—we have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Not a joke—8.3 percent. Anybody want to trade with their tax rate? Audience members. Yes! The President. But look, everything we've done because of your help you've provided over the last 3½ years, he wants to undo. He's made no bones about it—all of it. Just like you have a—Scott wants to get rid of Social Security. You know, these guys are for real. But look at what we've done. We built—we've got a lot—we've got a lot more work to do, but we built the strongest economy in the world. We've got to get inflation even further down. There's a lot more we have to do. And by the way, I know a lot of people got a little frustrated with me when I said I'm going to be the most pro-union President in American history. Well, guess what? I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: With all the union help we're getting and all the union support that we're—they're getting, what's the impact? Everybody does better. Everybody does better, even the people who are [not; White House correction] paying for the union dues, because guess what? I mean, paying the union wage—because they get the best workers in the world. So my generic point is, there's a lot we have going. There's no reason why we can't reclaim our heritage and who we are as the most generous, leading nation in the world and still grow. So there's a lot more to say, but I'm already saying too much. Audience member. No, you're not. No, you're not, Mr. President. No, you're not. Audience member. Teamsters in the house. The President. Teamsters in the house, that's the—I tell you what. They better damn well be in the house, man. [Laughter] I tell you what. Audience member. The only reason I have a pension—— The President. And by the way—— Audience member. ——is because of you, sir. The President. Is that right? Audience member. The only reason I have a pension is because of you. The President. Well, we did get that done. Anyway—[applause]. Besides, I used to drive an 18-wheeler. You know what I did? Audience member. [Inaudible]—you helped negotiate. The President. That's exactly right. Audience member. Thirty-billion-dollar contract with one of the largest employers in America: UPS. You stood strong with us, and we'll stand strong with you, sir. The President. Well, thank you. I mean, look, I'm getting a little off course here. But the bottom line is this—[laughter]—it matters to ordinary people. When I said, when I got elected, I was going to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, because that way the poor have a chance, the middle class grow, and the wealthy still do very well. They still do very well. And it's working. We've—we have 16 million new employees—I mean, we—it's working. We still have to deal with inflation, and there's a lot of costs out there for ordinary people. We're going to be getting you a lot of information to get to the folks out there. But, for example, we're in a situation now where you have a circumstance where there's a lot of junk fees. For example, you have a bank overdraft, they charge you 37 bucks instead—but guess what? Now they can only charge you 8. Because they're supposed—because it just—I don't want to cost them money, but that—exorbitant prices they're charging. Same with credit card overdrafts. Same—a whole range of things that affect people. My dad—I'll end with my dad. My dad used to say—my dad was a really well-read man who never got a chance to go to college because of World War II. And his—he'd always say: ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid""—he meant it—""being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay,' and mean it."" The only thing we're about as Democrats, in my view, is giving everyone a shot. Everyone gets a fair shot. And I'll be damned if we're not going to do that this time out. So thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Good seeing you. Audience member. Thank you, Mr. President. [An aide approached the President.] The President. Thank you. [Inaudible]—wait, wait. I'm not going—to take my microphone. Hey—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. [Inaudible]—10 bucks? Aide. [Inaudible] The President. All right. Okay. Hey, kids, remember what I told you now? [Laughter] Remember our deal? All right. Anyway, thank you, everybody.","['please', 'sit', 'begin', 'something', 'kids', 'mom', 'dad', 'owe', 'big', 'team', 'wheres', 'team', 'deal', 'ive', 'got', 'two', 'young', 'men', 'making',

That's not an easy thing to do."", 'You know, Kaitlyn represents millions of women who are enduring unbearable pain and cruelty because of Donald Trump.', 'Audience member. Boo!', ""The President. Sadly, it's pain and cruelty that millions of women in Florida now face. You know, but as I said—as she just said, it's not inevitable. It's not inevitable. We can stop it. When you vote, we can stop it."", 'And thanks to Representative Kathy Castor. Kathy, where are you? There she is. Stand up, Kathy. Kathy is doing an incredible job in Congress, and I—and is a great, great friend. Thanks for riding over with me from the airport.', 'You know, the worst sentence in the English language these days is, ""The President is at the airport."" It means you\'ve got to show up, you know? [Laughter] But anyway, thank you.', 'And I want to thank Debbie, our next U.S. Senator. Deb, stand up. As one—as one senior Senator, years ago when I was a freshman running for reelection in the United State Senate, said to me—he said, ""I\'ll campaign for you or against you, whatever will help the most.""

I think that voters are going to sunset Rick Scott.', ""It's important, man."", ""And thanks to all of you here today. It's good to be at a community college.

My wife still is a full-time professor at Northern Virginia Community College."", '[At this point, an audience member dropped a cell phone.]', ""You lost your phone. Get that man his phone.

No, I really mean it."", ""You know, if I have my way in the next 4 years, I'm going to make community college free. And it will grow the economy. It won't cost the taxpayers."", ""Look, next week, one of the Nation's most extreme anti-abortion laws will take affect here in Florida. It's criminalizing reproductive health care for—before women even know whether they're pregnant. I mean, this is bizarre. I can put—you can put a doctor in prison if he takes care of a patient, as you just heard some version of from Louisiana."", ""You know, this extreme Florida law is going to impact 4 million—4 million—women in the State of Florida. Florida is one of the twenty-one States in America—where America—you can't get access you need for care. This adds up to one in three women throughout the United States of America have this limitation."", ""For 50 years, the Court ruled that there was a fundamental constitutional right to privacy, but 2 years ago that was taken away.

In fact, Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, which meant there's no Federal right, no decision can be made—all those decisions are made at a State level.

It's about—this isn't about States' rights. It's about women's rights. No, I really—I mean this. I—look—folks, look, now he's worried that voters will hold him accountable for saying he's responsible for getting Roe v. Wade overturned. [Laughter] Donald Trump is worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the cruelty and chaos he created."", 'Audience member. We will!', 'Audience member. We will!', 'The President. Folks, the bad news for Trump is that we are going to hold him accountable. We are. He should be held accountable.', 'He should be accountable for States enacting extreme laws that put IVF treatments at risk for women desperately trying to have families.', 'Voters are going to hold Trump accountable for women being turned away from emergency rooms, like my introducer was; forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care; forced to go to court to plead for help to protect herself and her ability to have children in the future.', 'Folks, voters are going to hold Trump accountable. When women are told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, get sicker and sicker to the point where your life is determined to be in danger. Pregnant women in America are risk—at risk, particularly Black women in America.', 'Audience member. Yes.', ""The President. No, that's the statistic. Data shows they're already too likely to die from complications at birth."", ""I believe voters are going to hold Trump accountable when family members and doctors are threatened with prosecution for trying to help them.

Approved by the FDA 20 years ago, they're trying to outlaw that now."", 'For 50 years, the Court had recognized that women in America had a fundamental, constitutional right, and then Trump took it away by the—with the deal he made.

Do you?"", 'Audience members. No!', ""The President. And, folks, in a sense, I don't know why he's—we're surprised by Trump. How many times does he have to prove we [he; White House correction] can't be trusted?"", 'Trump bragged how proud he was to get rid of Roe v. Wade overturned; he took credit for it.

In fact, the MAGA majority in the House of Representatives has introduced three separate bans—three separate bans to choice—to ban choice nationwide—in every single State, based on the State—each State."", ""These bills—they're overwhelming—have overwhelming support of Republicans in Congress.

Congress ever—if Congress ever passes a ban, I will veto that ban."", 'Elect a Democratic Congress. Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again.', ""Let's be clear. The overturning of Roe v. Wade also puts at risk broader rights of privacy for everyone. If you think I'm exaggerating, here's what Justice Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade. He wrote that the future cases of the Court should reconsider—reconsider—all substantive due process precedents, from Griswold—Griswold legalized the use of contraception—and Obergefell—legalized same-sex marriage."", 'Justice Thomas means it, and so does Donald Trump.', ""Again, here's what that means: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control, the right to marry the person you love. All that is at risk now because there it is no longer viewed by some of our good friends in the Court as a constitutional guaranteed right."", 'Are we going to let that happened?', 'Audience members. No!', 'Audience member. No way, Joe! [Laughter]', 'The President. I like it, man. Will you come with me? [Laughter]', 'Folks, the extreme laws passed since overturning Roe v. Wade have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place in America is your voice.', 'In its decision overturning Roe v. Wade and saying States should make the decisions, the Court practically dared women—practically dared women—to be heard. Here\'s what they wrote in that decision, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" [Laughter] No kidding. No kidding.

Four more years! The President. Well, God love you. Well, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Kaitlyn, thank you for that introduction. And more importantly—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience member. [Laughter] We love you, Joe. The President. Well, thank you for that introduction and for your courage, if you're back there—your courage for the—and to share your story. That's not an easy thing to do. You know, Kaitlyn represents millions of women who are enduring unbearable pain and cruelty because of Donald Trump. Audience member. Boo! The President. Sadly, it's pain and cruelty that millions of women in Florida now face. You know, but as I said—as she just said, it's not inevitable. It's not inevitable. We can stop it. When you vote, we can stop it. And thanks to Representative Kathy Castor. Kathy, where are you? There she is. Stand up, Kathy. Kathy is doing an incredible job in Congress, and I—and is a great, great friend. Thanks for riding over with me from the airport. You know, the worst sentence in the English language these days is, ""The President is at the airport."" It means you've got to show up, you know? [Laughter] But anyway, thank you. And I want to thank Debbie, our next U.S. Senator. Deb, stand up. As one—as one senior Senator, years ago when I was a freshman running for reelection in the United State Senate, said to me—he said, ""I'll campaign for you or against you, whatever will help the most."" [Laughter] It's really important you win. This is a critical, critical race. Debbie is running against Rick Scott—— Audience members. Boo! The President. ——who wants to sunset Social Security. Audience members. Boo! The President. I think that voters are going to sunset Rick Scott. It's important, man. And thanks to all of you here today. It's good to be at a community college. As a matter of fact, my wife has been campaigning all over the country with me between classes. My wife still is a full-time professor at Northern Virginia Community College. [At this point, an audience member dropped a cell phone.] You lost your phone. Get that man his phone. He's going to be in trouble. Or that woman her phone. [Laughter] She's teaching this very day, Jill is. Community college, as she often says, is one of the best kept secrets in America. No, I really mean it. You know, if I have my way in the next 4 years, I'm going to make community college free. And it will grow the economy. It won't cost the taxpayers. Look, next week, one of the Nation's most extreme anti-abortion laws will take affect here in Florida. It's criminalizing reproductive health care for—before women even know whether they're pregnant. I mean, this is bizarre. I can put—you can put a doctor in prison if he takes care of a patient, as you just heard some version of from Louisiana. You know, this extreme Florida law is going to impact 4 million—4 million—women in the State of Florida. Florida is one of the twenty-one States in America—where America—you can't get access you need for care. This adds up to one in three women throughout the United States of America have this limitation. For 50 years, the Court ruled that there was a fundamental constitutional right to privacy, but 2 years ago that was taken away. Let's be real clear. There's one person responsible for this nightmare, and he's acknowledged it, and he brags about it: Donald Trump. Audience members. Boo! The President. In fact, Trump has bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, which meant there's no Federal right, no decision can be made—all those decisions are made at a State level. A lot of people don't even know that. They don't focus on it. It's a—every State can make a decision. Well, you know, now Trump says the law is, quote, ""working the way it's supposed to."" Trump goes on to say individual State laws are working—his words—""brilliantly."" ""Brilliantly."" It's a 6-week ban in Florida. It's really brilliant, isn't it? Even before women know they're pregnant. Is that brilliant? Audience members. No! The President. Look, just take a look at Arizona. That goes all the way back to 1864, before Arizona was even a State and before women had the right to vote—concluding that that's the law of the land in Arizona. And today, MAGA Republicans refuse to repeal that ban in Arizona. Trump is literally taking us back 160 years. He says it's up to the States and this is all about States' rights. But he's wrong. The Supreme Court was wrong. This should be a constitutional right in the Federal Constitution, a Federal right. And it shouldn't matter where in America you live. It's about—this isn't about States' rights. It's about women's rights. No, I really—I mean this. I—look—folks, look, now he's worried that voters will hold him accountable for saying he's responsible for getting Roe v. Wade overturned. [Laughter] Donald Trump is worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the cruelty and chaos he created. Audience member. We will! Audience member. We will! The President. Folks, the bad news for Trump is that we are going to hold him accountable. We are. He should be held accountable. He should be accountable for States enacting extreme laws that put IVF treatments at risk for women desperately trying to have families. Voters are going to hold Trump accountable for women being turned away from emergency rooms, like my introducer was; forced to travel hundreds of miles to get basic health care; forced to go to court to plead for help to protect herself and her ability to have children in the future. Folks, voters are going to hold Trump accountable. When women are told by extreme politicians and judges to wait, get sicker and sicker to the point where your life is determined to be in danger. Pregnant women in America are risk—at risk, particularly Black women in America. Audience member. Yes. The President. No, that's the statistic. Data shows they're already too likely to die from complications at birth. I believe voters are going to hold Trump accountable when family members and doctors are threatened with prosecution for trying to help them. Not only that, I believe voters are going to hold Trump accountable and his MAGA extremist friends to prevent all women in America from getting safe and effective medication, like mifepristone. Approved by the FDA 20 years ago, they're trying to outlaw that now. For 50 years, the Court had recognized that women in America had a fundamental, constitutional right, and then Trump took it away by the—with the deal he made. Now, in America today, in 2024, women have fewer rights than their mothers and their grandmothers had because of Donald Trump. Look, I don't think we're going to let them get away with it. Do you? Audience members. No! The President. And, folks, in a sense, I don't know why he's—we're surprised by Trump. How many times does he have to prove we [he; White House correction] can't be trusted? Trump bragged how proud he was to get rid of Roe v. Wade overturned; he took credit for it. He said there has to be ""punishment"" for women exercising their reproductive freedom. Audience members. Boo! The President. His words, not mine. He described the Dobbs decision as a ""miracle."" Maybe it's coming from that Bible he's trying to sell. [Laughter] Whoa. I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it. [Laughter] Folks, it was no miracle. It was a political deal to get rid of Roe v.—a deal. A political deal he made with the Evangelical base of the Republican Party to look past his moral character —if they looked past his moral and character flaws in exchange for his commitment to appoint Justices of the Supreme Court who would overturn Roe. Don't think he's making the deal right now with MAGA extremists to ban nationwide abortion in every single State, because he's making it. In fact, the MAGA majority in the House of Representatives has introduced three separate bans—three separate bans to choice—to ban choice nationwide—in every single State, based on the State—each State. These bills—they're overwhelming—have overwhelming support of Republicans in Congress. But know this: As long as I have the power of the Presidency, it's never going to happen. [Applause] I mean it. Congress ever—if Congress ever passes a ban, I will veto that ban. Elect a Democratic Congress. Kamala and I will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. Let's be clear. The overturning of Roe v. Wade also puts at risk broader rights of privacy for everyone. If you think I'm exaggerating, here's what Justice Thomas wrote in his concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade. He wrote that the future cases of the Court should reconsider—reconsider—all substantive due process precedents, from Griswold—Griswold legalized the use of contraception—and Obergefell—legalized same-sex marriage. Justice Thomas means it, and so does Donald Trump. Again, here's what that means: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control, the right to marry the person you love. All that is at risk now because there it is no longer viewed by some of our good friends in the Court as a constitutional guaranteed right. Are we going to let that happened? Audience members. No! Audience member. No way, Joe! [Laughter] The President. I like it, man. Will you come with me? [Laughter] Folks, the extreme laws passed since overturning Roe v. Wade have no place in the United States of America. But what does have a place in America is your voice. In its decision overturning Roe v. Wade and saying States should make the decisions, the Court practically dared women—practically dared women—to be heard. Here's what they wrote in that decision, ""Women are not without electoral or political power."" [Laughter] No kidding. No kidding. I mean, almost challenging you. I said at the time, I don't think the Court of the MAGA Republicans have a clue about the power of women in America. [Applause] I mean it. I mean it. But they're beginning to find out.

I'm serious."", ""Look, if we just charge them 24 percent in their tax, which isn't the highest tax rate, we'd generate fifty—$500 billion over the next 10 years, allow us to significantly cut the deficit, allow us to move all from—have daycare. Allow us to do so many things to make the country stronger."", 'I want to point out one thing. It\'s a little off point, but I wanted you to remember it. I asked the Treasury Department, because I was getting all this compliment and, from some, criticism about being so pro-union—I said, ""What happens to wages generally when unions have to get paid a decent salary?"" Everybody\'s salaries goes up. Everybody. You grow the economy. You grow the economy. You grow the economy.', ""Look, the bottom line is, we're doing what's always worked best in this country: investing in all of America and all Americans. Our plan is working.

But even before Trump was President, Trump preferred nonunion workers in his real estate projects. And I don't want to get into the stories. But anyway. Even he—even in that he didn't keep his word. He just asked contractors, vendors, and small businesses. And if you read in the press, if any of it's true, he never paid them—a whole hell a lot of them. The guy has never worked a day in a working man's boots. By the way, he gave me a pair of boots as a gift, by the way. [Laughter] I know how to put them on. I still sometimes cut the yard. They don't—the Secret Service doesn't let me do it anymore. [Laughter] Folks, I'm making Davis-Bacon requirements stronger to guarantee prevailing wage. By the way, we're making them stronger. That will—[applause]—that alone will increase wages for more than a million construction workers. Trump's MAGA allies are trying to take it away now. But it's not going to happen on my watch. Since the 1930s, the law has said when the Federal Government spends taxpayers' dollars on a project, it can only buy American products to do it and use American workers to get it done. That's ""Buy America."" Donald Trump failed to uphold that. But not anymore. My administration uses American products and American workers. That's why it's growing. [Applause] I mean it. Because, folks—[applause]—it's not a joke. It's not a campaign line. The God's truth is you're the best workers in the world. That's a fact. You're the best workers in the world. When I went out to South Korea to get them to start to build back those computer chips here in America, I said, ""Why are you""—and they decided to do it, investing billions of dollars. I said, ""Why are you doing it?"" He said: ""Two things: You have the best workers in the world, and you have the safest place in the world to do it."" Well, folks, when I think climate, I think jobs. I think union jobs—good-paying jobs that don't require a college degree. You've attracted nearly $700 billion in private-sector investment in advanced manufacturing, in semiconductors, clean energy, and so much more here in America, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, Building Trades jobs. In fact, construction of new factories has more than doubled in our administration. Meanwhile, Donald Trump still thinks windmills cause cancer. [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] Ooh! [Laughter] That's what he said. And by the way, remember when he was trying to deal with COVID? He said just inject a little bleach in your veins. [Laughter] He missed; it all went to his hair. [Laughter] Look, I shouldn't have said that. [Applause] I probably shouldn't have said that. [Laughter] Audience member. Truth! The President. You guys are a bad influence on me. [Laughter] Trump and his MAGA allies want to repeal the most significant investments in climate ever, the work that—that you risked your lives doing lots of it. You know, it—and he wants to risk all those jobs. Are you surprised? I'm not. A lot of you don't know that if you want to be a pipe fitter—a lot of people don't know, if you want to be a pipe fitter or an electrician or any of the other trades here, it takes 4 or 5 years of hard work as an apprentice. Most people think you can walk up—and I keep—you guys should talk more about this. They think you can walk up and you just say, ""I want to be an electrician,"" and you get a license. It's 4 or 5 years. It's like going back to college. It's going—like getting a college degree. And that's the reason—the reason you're the best is because you're the best trained in the world. You get it; I get it. But Donald Trump has no clue. He undermined union apprenticeships by lowering standards and lowering pay. He ended—I ended his antiwork policy to save the building trades apprenticeships program because they're the gold standard of the world. They are. They actually are. And look—and earlier this week—earlier this week, I teamed up together to recruit young people into the building trades. It's—my American Climate Corps will now pave a pathway to your apprenticeship program, because it matters. It matters. Through my American Rescue Plan, there's—not a single Republican voted for, I might add—I also enacted the Butch Lewis Act, the most prolabor law in 50 years, because of you—because of you. That one act—that one act—has already protected hard-earned pensions of over 1 million workers and retirees and counting. We made that happen. While Trump promised it, he never even lifted a finger to try to get it. Are you surprised? Audience members. No! The President. I—hell no, I'm not, either. [Laughter] Trump put union busters on the National Labor Relations Board throughout his administration. I've appointed people in my administration that actually care about American workers, like former—the building trades leader, Marty Walsh, who was a great Labor Secretary during my administration. By the way, if you ever need—if you're ever in a foxhole, I tell you, you want—— [The President briefly imitated a Boston accent.] Marty Walsh with you, man. [Laughter] Oh, you think I'm kidding. He's the real deal. You know, I've walked proudly on union picket lines, while at the same time, Trump bashed unions from nonunion shops. Are you surprised? Audience members. No! The President. Look, I want to sign the PRO Act into law. Audience members. Yes! The President. Trump said he'd veto it. Trump said he'd veto it. Beyond that, he supports a national right-to-work law, for God's sake. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I—think about it. What is the single biggest killer that could happen? A national right-to-work law. Look, he might as well say he doesn't support any unions. Are we going to let him—that happen, pal? We're not going to let that happen. Audience members. No! The President. Let me ask you: Does anyone here think the tax system is fair? Raise your hand. Well, Trump is proud of his $2 trillion tax cut in his administration that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and the biggest corporations while exploding the Federal debt. Trump added more to the national debt than any President in a single term in all of American history—to the national debt. I cut the national debt so far—[applause]—and still got all those other things did by doing simple things like, you know—remember those 40 Fortune 500 company—or those Fortune 500 companies, 40 of them—I think, no, it was 50—who didn't pay a single penny in taxes and made 40 billion—4 billion—$40 billion? Well, guess what? I did a terrible thing. I made them pay 15 percent. [Laughter] And we cut the deficit by $70 billion. Look, now Trump is saying if he gets elected, he wants to give another—by the way, that tax credit of his expires next year. Okay? [Applause] Well, let me tell you something: It's going to stay expired and dead forever if I'm reelected. But anyway. He wants another—he wants to give another massive tax cut for the wealthy. And he also says he wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security, and you're going to let him—that happen? Audience members. Boo! The President. No, he—by—— Audience members. Boo! The President. By the way, these guys mean this stuff. They mean it. And the Republican caucus went ahead and said they want to do that too. Look, folks, I remember there used to be two parties—real parties, you know. But this ain't your father's Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. [Laughter] Look, I've got a better idea. I'm going to protect Social Security and Medicare by making the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share of the—no billionaire—[applause]. Look—look, guys—no billionaire—and there's a thousand of them in America—a thousand billionaires—no billionaire should pay less in taxes than a teacher, a nurse, a construction worker, a police officer. Guess what? You know what their average—average tax rate for a billionaire in America is? Eight-point-three percent. That's what they pay. Audience members. Boo! The President. I'm serious. I'm serious. Look, if we just charge them 24 percent in their tax, which isn't the highest tax rate, we'd generate fifty—$500 billion over the next 10 years, allow us to significantly cut the deficit, allow us to move all from—have daycare. Allow us to do so many things to make the country stronger. I want to point out one thing. It's a little off point, but I wanted you to remember it. I asked the Treasury Department, because I was getting all this compliment and, from some, criticism about being so pro-union—I said, ""What happens to wages generally when unions have to get paid a decent salary?"" Everybody's salaries goes up. Everybody. You grow the economy. You grow the economy. You grow the economy. Look, the bottom line is, we're doing what's always worked best in this country: investing in all of America and all Americans. Our plan is working. So far, we've created over 15 million new jobs, including 848,000 construction jobs for a record 8.2 million across the construction industry. Folks—and by the way, did you know there are only two Presidents in American history who left office with fewer American jobs than they entered it: Herbert Hoover and, yes, Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] Only two. Look, folks—folks, we're moving again. We're moving again as a country. We're beginning to gain momentum. We have the best economy in the world, but we've got a lot more to do. But we're moving again because you guys and women. I mean—I'm not being solicitous. That's why we're moving. We're building again. And we're just getting started. Let me close with this. As I travel the country, I see the amazing things you're doing—I mean it, all over the country, in red States and blue States. And this past June, I was in Philadelphia, Sean's hometown. And I married a Philly girl. You don't screw around with Philly people. [Laughter] If I didn't vote for every Philly—root for every Philly team out there, I'd be sleeping alone. [Laughter] You all think I'm kidding. [Laughter] Look, remember when that tanker truck crashed and closed the key stretch of I-95 in Philly? It was expected, like in the last administration, it would take months and months for anything to happen. Well, 150,000 vehicles travel that overpass every single day. So what did we do? We contacted all of you. We organized. You organized. We rebuilt that. You rebuilt that in less than 2 weeks, record time. How? Because you're the Building Trades—laborers, operating engineers, cement finishers, plumbers, pipe fitters, steelworkers. So many union workers. You showed up—[applause]. You showed up around the clock. And you got it done. By the way, that's America. By the way, unions are more popular today than they've ever been in a long, long time, not because of Joe Biden supporting them—because of you. You always step up. You step into the breach. You get things done. That's the union movement. That's what it's about. In Baltimore, we're moving heaven and earth—or as my dad, from Baltimore, would say—— [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] Baltimore—Baltimore. [Laughter] We're moving heaven and earth to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its tragic collapse, and we're doing it with you: with union labor and American steel—[applause]—and American steel. That's America. That's the union movement. Look, folks, I mean you're doing—you ought to see—I mean, I've been to the site. It's incredible. I've been over that bridge a lot. I mean, I commuted every day for 36 years as a U.S. Senator, when my wife and daughter were killed and I used to commute back and forth to be with my boys. And I've over that area in Baltimore Harbor. You—it's incredible what you're doing. And, folks, the choice is clear. Donald Trump's vision of America is one of revenge and retribution. A defeated former President who sees the world from Mar-a-Lago and bows down to billionaires, who looks down on American union workers. It's not just he's not supporting; he looks down on us. I—no, I'm not joking. Think about it. Think about the guys you grew up with who you'd like to get into the corner and just give them a straight left. [Laughter] I'm not suggesting we hit the President. [Laughter] But we all know those guys growing up. We all know guys like that growing up. My vision of America is one of hope and opportunity—the view from Scranton and working class Americans like you. Here's the future I see, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I've never been more optimistic about America's chances, not because I'm President, because of the state of the moment. The world needs us. Look at we—I just signed—we just signed the bill to give support to Ukraine. We rebuilt NATO. We increased it. Like it or not, we're the leading country in the world. The rest of the world looks to us. I see an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see an America where we protect freedoms, not take them away. I see an economy that grows from the middle out and the bottom up, where the wealthy pay their fair share so we can have childcare, paid leave, and so much more, and still reduce the Federal deficit and increase economic growth. Folks, imagine what we can do next. Four—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. ——more years. Pause. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Are you ready? Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Are you ready to move forward? Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Well, thank you. We're all ready. We're ready to move forward not back. Are we ready to choose unity over division, dignity over hate, truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy—for democracy? We can do this. I give you my word as a Biden, I've never been more optimistic about our future in my entire career. We just have to remember who we are. And I mean this. Think about it. We are the United States of America, and there's nothing beyond our capacity—nothing, nothing, nothing—when we do it together. We've got to do it together. God bless you all. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. I don't want to go.","The President. Whoa! [Applause] Holy mackerel! Whoa! Hello, hello, hello! Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please have a seat. Whoa! Whoa! What a welcome. I'm going home. [Laughter] Thank you, thank you, thank you, Building Trades. God love you all. [Applause] No, I really mean it. And, Sean, thank you for your friendship, your partnership. And it's been an incredible honor—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart—an incredible honor to be endorsed by the Building Trades. I mean it. You're the best. Not a joke. It's not a joke. You're the best in the world. And that's not a joke. You're the best in the world. You know, you had my back in 2020. And because of you, I'm standing here as President of the United States of America—because of you. And that's a fact. And because you, in 2024, we're going to make Donald Trump a loser again. Are you ready? [Applause] Are you ready? I'm so damn proud to be with you. And I really mean it: I'm proud to be with you. All my relatives, my grandpop and everybody else up in—were—they're all gone now, but in Scranton, they—my—I had an uncle who used to say, ""Joey, you're belt buckle to shoe sole union."" Well, let me tell you something. I'm proud to be the most union—pro-union President in American history. And it's because of you. You're proof what have—I've always known—not a joke—I've always known that Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class. That's a fact. That's a fact. Folks, being with you today reminds me of where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware. I was up in Scranton last week. It's great to have the mayor of Scranton, by the way, Paige Cognetti. Where are you, Paige? She's here today. I don't—it's a big crowd out there, but you'll—if you see her, you'll know her. [Laughter] Look, in Scranton, I learned a basic value set that all of you learned as well, no matter where you're from. I learned that money doesn't determine your worth. I learned that all anyone wants is just a fair shot—a fair shot—at making it. Don't block the road for me. Give me an even shot. My dad, I swear to God, used to have an expression. He'd come home from—after he closed—he'd come for dinner and then go back and close his—the shop. My dad would say: ""Joey a job""—and I mean it sincerely—""a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your child in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" That's what we're all about: dignity of all workers—the dignity of workers. I mean it. And we all grew up—[applause]. We all grew up with folks who sort of looked down on us because of what our dads did. They weren't in business. They weren't executives. They weren't something special. But they are special. You know, but people like Donald Trump learned a different lesson. He learned the best way to get rich is inherit it. [Laughter] He learned that paying taxes is something working people did, not him. He learned that telling people ""you're fired"" was something to laugh about. Not in my household. Not in my neighborhood. I mean it sincerely. No joke. Especially being fired because you had no protection. Folks, I guess that's how you look at the world from Mar-a-Lago, where Trump and his rich friends embrace the same failed trickle-down policies that have failed working class families and union families for over 40 years. But if you grew up where we grew up, nobody handed you anything. Being told you were fired wasn't entertainment. It was devastating. It was a nightmare. And, folks, we all know people like Trump who look down on us, don't we? We all know somebody we grew up with like that. Well, folks, where I come from, it matters. When I look at the economy, I don't see it through the eyes of Mar-a-Lago, I see it through the eyes of—through the eyes of Scranton and working people like all of you and my family. You know, we know the best way to grow an economy is from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. My dad used to say not a whole hell of a lot trickled down on his kitchen table in that top-down policy. When we do that, when we work from the bottom up and the middle out, the poor have a ladder up and the middle class does well. And by the way, the wealthy still do very well if they just start paying their damn taxes. So it's either Scranton values or Mar-a-Lago values. These are competing visions of the economy at the heart of this election, competing visions of what we look at and see as America. Folks, one of the reasons I ran for President was to rebuild the backbone of the middle class, and we have. We're following my blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America. And guess what? It's working. You're building that America. You're—in this room—are building that America. For example, thanks to my bipartisan infrastructure law, more than 51,000 new manufacturing projects have been announced so far, and we're just beginning. It's just beginning. It's just beginning—[applause]. We're just starting. Roads, bridges, ports, airports, clean water systems, available high-speed internet all across America and built by the Building Trades. Remember when President Trump promised us—[laughter]—I've got to be careful. [Laughter] Audience member. Say it! Say it! The President. He promised us ""Infrastructure Week."" Well, I tell you what, it took 4 years; he never built a damn thing. Nothing. I'm serious. Are you surprised? I'm sure—I'm making sure the projects, like project labor agreements, so highly skilled workers have a voice on the job. But even before Trump was President, Trump preferred nonunion workers in his real estate projects. And I don't want to get into the stories. But anyway. Even he—even in that he didn't keep his word. He just asked contractors, vendors, and small businesses. And if you read in the press, if any of it's true, he never paid them—a whole hell a lot of them. The guy has never worked a day in a working man's boots. By the way, he gave me a pair of boots as a gift, by the way. [Laughter] I know how to put them on. I still sometimes cut the yard. They don't—the Secret Service doesn't let me do it anymore. [Laughter] Folks, I'm making Davis-Bacon requirements stronger to guarantee prevailing wage. By the way, we're making them stronger. That will—[applause]—that alone will increase wages for more than a million construction workers. Trump's MAGA allies are trying to take it away now. But it's not going to happen on my watch. Since the 1930s, the law has said when the Federal Government spends taxpayers' dollars on a project, it can only buy American products to do it and use American workers to get it done. That's ""Buy America."" Donald Trump failed to uphold that. But not anymore. My administration uses American products and American workers. That's why it's growing. [Applause] I mean it. Because, folks—[applause]—it's not a joke. It's not a campaign line. The God's truth is you're the best workers in the world. That's a fact. You're the best workers in the world. When I went out to South Korea to get them to start to build back those computer chips here in America, I said, ""Why are you""—and they decided to do it, investing billions of dollars. I said, ""Why are you doing it?"" He said: ""Two things: You have the best workers in the world, and you have the safest place in the world to do it.""

In Baltimore, we're moving heaven and earth—or as my dad, from Baltimore, would say—— [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] Baltimore—Baltimore. [Laughter] We're moving heaven and earth to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge after its tragic collapse, and we're doing it with you: with union labor and American steel—[applause]—and American steel. That's America. That's the union movement. Look, folks, I mean you're doing—you ought to see—I mean, I've been to the site. It's incredible. I've been over that bridge a lot. I mean, I commuted every day for 36 years as a U.S. Senator, when my wife and daughter were killed and I used to commute back and forth to be with my boys. And I've over that area in Baltimore Harbor. You—it's incredible what you're doing. And, folks, the choice is clear. Donald Trump's vision of America is one of revenge and retribution. A defeated former President who sees the world from Mar-a-Lago and bows down to billionaires, who looks down on American union workers. It's not just he's not supporting; he looks down on us. I—no, I'm not joking. Think about it. Think about the guys you grew up with who you'd like to get into the corner and just give them a straight left. [Laughter] I'm not suggesting we hit the President. [Laughter] But we all know those guys growing up. We all know guys like that growing up. My vision of America is one of hope and opportunity—the view from Scranton and working class Americans like you. Here's the future I see, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I've never been more optimistic about America's chances, not because I'm President, because of the state of the moment. The world needs us. Look at we—I just signed—we just signed the bill to give support to Ukraine. We rebuilt NATO. We increased it. Like it or not, we're the leading country in the world. The rest of the world looks to us. I see an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see an America where we protect freedoms, not take them away. I see an economy that grows from the middle out and the bottom up, where the wealthy pay their fair share so we can have childcare, paid leave, and so much more, and still reduce the Federal deficit and increase economic growth. Folks, imagine what we can do next. Four—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. ——more years. Pause. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Are you ready? Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Are you ready to move forward? Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Well, thank you. We're all ready. We're ready to move forward not back. Are we ready to choose unity over division, dignity over hate, truth over lies? Are you ready to choose freedom over democracy—for democracy? We can do this. I give you my word as a Biden, I've never been more optimistic about our future in my entire career. We just have to remember who we are. And I mean this. Think about it. We are the United States of America, and there's nothing beyond our capacity—nothing, nothing, nothing—when we do it together. We've got to do it together. God bless you all. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you all. I don't want to go.","['whoa', 'holy', 'mackerel', 'whoa', 'hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'audience',

And by the way, you have to sing ""Happy Birthday.""

He then continued his remarks as follows.]', 'Now you have to let me wife know that I did what I was supposed to do, right? [Laughter]', ""God love you. It's hell turning 60, isn't it?

I'd better be careful here. [Laughter]"", 'Well, thanks for having me. Thanks for—I really appreciate you letting me come by.', 'One of the few times I walked in with a chief—former chief of police and not arrested.

Nice to meet you too.', 'The President. Keep the faith.', 'Anyway, I—you know, this reminds me of when I first started running for office 180 years ago. [Laughter] I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. And I come from a very modest family. We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with—in a neighborhood that was in a suburban area they were building and—with four kids and a grandpop. And—but we thought we were okay. We thought everything was all right.', 'And—but my State of Delaware—I got involved in politics because of the African American community. I got to—we have the eighth largest Black population as a percentage in America. And to our great shame, Delaware was a slave State.', 'We have all the vestiges—the State sort of divided two-thirds to one-third. One-third top—we have a canal that separates the entire State, connects the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. And anything above the canal is basically more northeast or central States.', 'Everything south of the canal is Southern. And, I mean, for real.', '[The President briefly imitated a regional accent.]', ""We're going to talk at you like this. You know what I mean? And—for real. [Laughter] And—the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula, et cetera."", ""Everybody thinks that the DuPont Company is the biggest thing in Delaware. The biggest thing in Delaware are chickens. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. It's the single biggest—$400 million industry."", 'But my point is that I got involved because when I first got—when I got out of law school—and I went to law school. I had to get some financial help to get there. And I got to law school. When I got back, I got a job with a fancy firm—the biggest, oldest firm in the State that—and it was called Prickett, Ward, Burt, and Sanders. And I got the job.', 'But unfortunately, in my State—show how old I am—Wilmington, Delaware, is the only city in America occupied by the National Guard since the Civil War because when Dr. King, who is one of my heroes—when he got assassinated, we had riots in Delaware.', 'And so the Southern Governor—he was a Democrat, but he was a Southerner in terms of his attitudes—he put the National Guard on the streets for 10 months on every corner with drawn bayonets. Only city in America ever occupied since the Civil War.', 'And I quit this fancy law firm and became a public defender, because I wanted to be——', 'Audience member. Woo! [Laughter]', 'The President. And so I—and the year I—so I ran as a—they came to me and said they wanted me to run—the local people—run for the State senate as a State senator. And I said: ""I can\'t do that, because I\'m just—I\'m working part time as a public defender and part time setting up a law practice. And I can\'t go to Dover because I wouldn\'t be able to make a living.""', 'And so then they came back to me 3 days later and said, ""Want to run for county council?"" I said, ""County council, I can\'t do that."" And then they walked over to the window in my office and said: ""Right over there, that\'s the courthouse. It meets there twice a week. You can make it."" [Laughter]', 'So I checked this—true story—so I checked it out, and no one had ever won the district they wanted me to run in. So I figured, ""What the hell, I\'ll do it, because I won\'t win."" [Laughter] But I\'ll make the effort—[inaudible].', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. No, I really—I didn't think it would, because I thought we'd, you know, begin to build—I kept arguing more people should get engaged and run to change the nature of the Democratic Party."", ""Audience member. That's right!"", 'The President. So what happened was, I made a mistake. My best friend in the world, my sister——', 'Audience member. [Inaudible]', ""The President. That's okay——"", ""Audience member. I'm sorry."", 'The President. ——managed my campaign. [Laughter]', ""My sister is 3 years younger—used to be 3 years younger than me. Now she's 23 years younger. [Laughter] By the way, there is no man in the Biden household that is any younger than any woman in the household. [Laughter] That's the family rule. You think I'm kidding? [Laughter]"", ""Anyway, she managed my campaign, and I won. And I won a 4-year term. And I didn't want to go initially, seriously. And—but turns out the decennial Census—every 10 years, there's a new—you know, they redo the districts. And so I got reapportioned from a 4-year term to a 2-year term because Republicans saw something in me I didn't see—that they thought I was going to run for higher office. [Laughter]"", ""So this is—no, this is the God's truth. So I'm 28 years old now. [Laughter] So I'm going around the State trying to get people to run, and a group of senior members of the Democratic Party, the ones who were mainstream Democrats——"", 'Audience member. Here we are.', ""The President. ——were—that's right—[laughter]—came to me and said—one day, I was—went to the Democratic Convention down in Dover, Delaware, the off-year convention."", 'And I was trying to get other people to run for office.

Well, good to see you, man. Mr. Oliver. Nice to meet you too. The President. Keep the faith. Anyway, I—you know, this reminds me of when I first started running for office 180 years ago. [Laughter] I got elected to the United States Senate when I was 29 years old. And I come from a very modest family. We lived in a three-bedroom split-level home with—in a neighborhood that was in a suburban area they were building and—with four kids and a grandpop. And—but we thought we were okay. We thought everything was all right. And—but my State of Delaware—I got involved in politics because of the African American community. I got to—we have the eighth largest Black population as a percentage in America. And to our great shame, Delaware was a slave State. We have all the vestiges—the State sort of divided two-thirds to one-third. One-third top—we have a canal that separates the entire State, connects the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware River. And anything above the canal is basically more northeast or central States. Everything south of the canal is Southern. And, I mean, for real. [The President briefly imitated a regional accent.] We're going to talk at you like this. You know what I mean? And—for real. [Laughter] And—the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula, et cetera. Everybody thinks that the DuPont Company is the biggest thing in Delaware. The biggest thing in Delaware are chickens. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. It's the single biggest—$400 million industry. But my point is that I got involved because when I first got—when I got out of law school—and I went to law school. I had to get some financial help to get there. And I got to law school. When I got back, I got a job with a fancy firm—the biggest, oldest firm in the State that—and it was called Prickett, Ward, Burt, and Sanders. And I got the job. But unfortunately, in my State—show how old I am—Wilmington, Delaware, is the only city in America occupied by the National Guard since the Civil War because when Dr. King, who is one of my heroes—when he got assassinated, we had riots in Delaware. And so the Southern Governor—he was a Democrat, but he was a Southerner in terms of his attitudes—he put the National Guard on the streets for 10 months on every corner with drawn bayonets. Only city in America ever occupied since the Civil War. And I quit this fancy law firm and became a public defender, because I wanted to be—— Audience member. Woo! [Laughter] The President. And so I—and the year I—so I ran as a—they came to me and said they wanted me to run—the local people—run for the State senate as a State senator. And I said: ""I can't do that, because I'm just—I'm working part time as a public defender and part time setting up a law practice. And I can't go to Dover because I wouldn't be able to make a living."" And so then they came back to me 3 days later and said, ""Want to run for county council?"" I said, ""County council, I can't do that."" And then they walked over to the window in my office and said: ""Right over there, that's the courthouse. It meets there twice a week. You can make it."" [Laughter] So I checked this—true story—so I checked it out, and no one had ever won the district they wanted me to run in. So I figured, ""What the hell, I'll do it, because I won't win."" [Laughter] But I'll make the effort—[inaudible]. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. No, I really—I didn't think it would, because I thought we'd, you know, begin to build—I kept arguing more people should get engaged and run to change the nature of the Democratic Party. Audience member. That's right! The President. So what happened was, I made a mistake. My best friend in the world, my sister—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. That's okay—— Audience member. I'm sorry. The President. ——managed my campaign. [Laughter] My sister is 3 years younger—used to be 3 years younger than me. Now she's 23 years younger. [Laughter] By the way, there is no man in the Biden household that is any younger than any woman in the household. [Laughter] That's the family rule. You think I'm kidding? [Laughter] Anyway, she managed my campaign, and I won. And I won a 4-year term. And I didn't want to go initially, seriously. And—but turns out the decennial Census—every 10 years, there's a new—you know, they redo the districts. And so I got reapportioned from a 4-year term to a 2-year term because Republicans saw something in me I didn't see—that they thought I was going to run for higher office. [Laughter] So this is—no, this is the God's truth. So I'm 28 years old now. [Laughter] So I'm going around the State trying to get people to run, and a group of senior members of the Democratic Party, the ones who were mainstream Democrats—— Audience member. Here we are.

Not a joke. And so I go into the—I decide I'm going to take a shower and shave to go back that night. So I'm in one of those 9—8 by 10 showers—you know, I mean—restrooms in a motel and—with a shower—with a toilet, a bath, and a shower and a sink. And I have a towel around me and shaving cream, and I'm shaving. And I hear, ""Bam, bam, bam,"" on my—on the door of the hotel room—I mean the motel room. So I figured it's the guys that I came down with—you know, get me in trouble. I said, ""Oh, come in."" I opened—opened the door. I had a razor in my hand, shaving cream, and a towel around me. And there's four senior Democrats standing there. [Laughter] The former Chief Justice of the State of Delaware, who had more people in his family, as a U.S. Senator—when they used to vote through the legislature—than any family in American history—than, I should say, in Delaware history. The State chairman. And the Congressman, who was the good guy who had lost three terms ago because he was too progressive. And a guy named Elbert N. Carvel, a big guy. [The President briefly imitated a regional accent.] Talked at you like this. Former Governor. [Laughter] And—I know I'm—I should—am I boring you here with this story? Anyway—[laughter]. So I'm embarrassed as hell. I'm standing there with a towel around me in a hotel room that has the headboards nailed to the wall. You know what kind I mean. It was clean but—and two twin bed—two—two beds and desk nailed to the wall. And I'm—so I said: ""Come in, gentlemen. Give me—give me a minute."" [Laughter] And I ran in the bathroom, thinking I could change. Well, there was nothing to change into. So I wiped off the—all the shaving cream, and I walked out. And I'm sitting there, and I leaned against that desk—I'll never forget it. I'm looking at four of these—to me, two of them, I'd never met and knew of—never met in my life. And they said—and the Chief Justice said, ""We just came from dinner, Joe."" And then the Governor is going, ""And, Joe, we think you should run for the Senate."" I said, ""What?"" I swear to God. True story. [Laughter] And—because I—because they had asked me to go try to recruit people to run for the Senate. And I said: ""I'm—I'm—I'm too young. I'm only 29."" And the Chief Justice said, ""Joe, you obviously didn't do very well in constitutional law."" [Laughter] Absolutely true. And I said—he said: ""You have to be 30 to be sworn in, but you can be elected earlier. You've just got to wait."" And he said, ""You only have to wait 17 days to be eligible."" And so I thought, ""This is the craziest thing I've ever heard in my life."" So I said thank you, and they left. I went back and rode home with a group that I went down with—the three guys I went down with. But what I did before that: On the way up, I called my—I had a political philosophy professor—you all have one professor, one high school teacher you really respect? Audience member. Yes. The President. And his name was David Ingersoll. And I called him ahead of time. I said, ""Can I stop and see you?"" Because Dover, Delaware, is below Newark, Delaware, and below where my home was near Wilmington. And so I stopped, and I said—I told him what happened, and he said, ""What do you think?"" I said, ""What do I say?"" He said, ""Joe, remember what Plato said."" I'm thinking, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" [Laughter] I'm serious. True story. He said: ""Plato said the penalty—to paraphrase Plato: The penalty that good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves. You should run."" I said, ""Oh, God."" Anyway, so I went home and talked it over with my wife. She said: ""Look, Joe, you're working 40 hours a week trying to get this law firm going, and you're a public defender. And at the same time, you're doing 20 hours or 30 hours a week as a county councilman. Either get in or get out."" Audience member. That's right! Audience member. Wife knows best! The President. But there were a whole lot of things I was worried about back then. I didn't support the Vietnam war—a lot of things going on. And so I ran. But I made the mistake of asking my sister to manage my campaign. [Laughter] Nixon got 60—59.8 percent of the vote in Delaware—almost 60 percent. And I won by 3,100 votes. [Applause] And here I am. And I only got elected because I got—when I run in Delaware—not a joke—I get 90 percent of the African American vote in off-years and—[inaudible]—years because you're the most loyal constituency because I've been loyal to my constituency. And so—and things are changing. Guess what? Now, Delaware is blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. [Applause] Oh, you think I'm kidding? I'm not. We are as blue as you can get. [Laughter] And with a little bit of luck and you all making sure that we change things here in Wisconsin as well—— Audience member. That's right. Audience member. We're going to do it. Audience members. Yes! The President. Well, I—you've got some Senators I would like to see change too. And if we do, we're going to make some—and, look, I'll—I'm going to hush up. As my grandfather would say, ""Hush up."" But one of the things that I think—you know, and I'll be very serious for just 1 second and stop and talk—answer any questions you have or just walk around meeting each one of you individually. You know, I really think democracy is at stake here. Audience member. It is. It is. Audience member. Absolutely. Audience member. No doubt about it. The President. Not—not a joke. When I ran the first time, I made a speech at Independence Hall on democracy. And the press—and they're all smart as hell, the press back here—wondered why I was talking about democracy back then in 2020. And 60 percent of our polling showed people were worried about what was at stake. And we ended up winning. But one thing I want you to be wary of—aware of: Trump means what he says. Audience member. Yes, he does. The President. He means what he says. And he says he's going to get rid of all the stuff that we've done, which is making sure that people don't have to pay 400 bucks a month for insulin for their diabetes instead of $35 a month. Make sure—I'll just go down the whole list. And I was asked—I just did an interview with a national reporter at the last stop I made. She asked the question whether or not I thought that the—would Trump—did he mean what he said when he said, basically, he's not sure he's going to accept the results of the election. And I said: ""He won't. He won't."" So—but we really have to—we can do a lot because I think the public is really ready to see some change. And, anyway. I'm talking too much. Like I said, my mother would say: ""Hush up, Joey. Stop the talking."" Audience member. Keep going, Joe! [Laughter] The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you.","['see', 'man', 'hey', 'folks', 'jamie', 'audience', 'members', 'jamie', 'jamie', 'wheres', 'mom', 'mom', 'god', 'love', 'mom', 'mom', 'audience', 'member', 'thats',

This is the guy who is going to—they're his phrase. By the way, get this week's TIME magazine. Read what he said—in his own words, what he said. So this is an important election for all the people we care about, and we care about all the American people out there. And there's a lot of hard-working folks that are trying to figure out what's going on. And we've got a lot more work to do—we made a lot of progress—a lot more work to do. But any rate, I—as my mother would say if she were here: ""Joey, hush up. You've spoken too much."" [Laughter] But thank you all for being here. And I'd like to come around and talk to each one of you individually, answer your questions. Okay? Thank you, thank you, thank you.","The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now, look, I realize I'm surrounded by Morehouse Men. [Laughter] I want you to know I'm a Delaware State guy. Okay? [Laughter] And the Vice President's Howard. So, you know, you guys are okay. But you know, I mean—well, you—okay? Audience member. [Inaudible]—take it. The President. Better take it. [Laughter] You realize how insufferable it's going to be now with my chief guy—used to be—what's his name? I can't think of it now. [Laughter] Used to—he used to be a Morehouse guy. What's his name? Audience member. Cedric. The President. Yes, Cedric something! [Laughter] I tell you what, I'm going to Morehouse tomorrow. And by the way, let's wish this guy happy graduation, man. Tomorrow. And he made a commitment to me: When he's elected President and they say, ""Joe Biden is in the waiting room,"" he won't say, ""Joe who?"" [Laughter] That's the commitment. Well, look, it's good to be back. I was—the last time I was in this room was, I think, 2014, 2015—in that range. And you know, as they say in Claymont, Delaware, where I—when we moved from Scranton, Pennsylvania, moved to a little steel town in northern Delaware called Claymont. And you all brung me to the dance. The reason we're here is because—and all the electeds that are here—and I don't want to start naming; I'll leave somebody out—but you really made a gigantic difference. And everybody—it's easy to forget, but I don't forget—little elections in January elected two Senators—[applause]—two. And every—and I want you all to remember that when we first got elected, we were told that because everything was so close in terms of numbers, we couldn't get anything big done. We got everything done. Because of you. [Applause] No, I'm not joking. Because of you. From the Recovery Act—all the way around the horn, all of it. And we're going to do a lot more. You know, I'm—I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to do this again. And I really mean it when I say—the Congressman knows what I'm talking about—we've got a—we've got a tight operation. And it's going to be—I think we're going to do well. I think—and you know, look, here's the deal. You hear about how, you know, we're behind in the polls. Well, so far, the polls haven't been right once. Now that—look, we're all—we're either tie or slightly ahead or slightly behind. But what I look at is actual election results. And election results are in the primaries. Look at the primaries. Well, Mr. Trump has—he doesn't have an opponent, but he lost 120,000 votes in Pennsylvania—didn't vote for him. [Laughter] They voted for a woman who's no longer in the race. A hundred—I'm—they're rough numbers; I think it's 120,000, I think. In Indiana, I think it was 100,000 votes. And my point is that this is—I'm not going to take a lot of time. I want to talk to you individually. But the fact is that this election, a lot's at stake—lot's at stake. It's not about me; it's about the alternative as well. You know, he—I think it's fair to say—I won't use the exact phrase that I'd use if I was still playing ball, but my opponent is not a good loser. [Laughter] But he is a loser. [Laughter] And I—[laughter]—oh, I don't want to get started. I'm going to get in trouble. [Laughter] But—but the thing is, he's laid out—and the Republicans in the House, they can tell you; my colleagues can tell you—they're laying out exactly what they're going to do if they win. Everything you let me do, everything you helped me do, everything we've done, they want to undo, from the climate legislation to taking—not allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. American people—instead of 400 bucks a month, seniors are paying 35 bucks a month for their insulin. There's a lot more. There's a lot more. But look—[applause]. And I'll end by saying I honest to God—and I think you think it too; I'm not sure, but I think you know—that our democracy is really on the line. Listen to things he said. They asked him what happens, is he going to accept the loss. He said, ""It depends."" And then he said if he loses, there's going to be a ""bloodbath.""

He'd eliminate the $2,000 cap that I've set that no senior ever has to pay for—on a yearly basis more than $2,000 for all prescriptions, including those—[inaudible]—needed drugs for cancer and many other things that can cost as much as $14-, $15,000 a year—the medicines you need in order to live. Look, folks, on my watch, 20 million Americans have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. MAGA Republicans have tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times, and Trump is still determined to do it. In his words, he wants to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more Americans. But we're going to deny Trump. During his Presidency, he enacted a $2 trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefited the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. These Republicans talk about the debt. Well, guess what? He racked up more Federal debt than any previous Presidential term in all of American history. And now he wants to do it again. At the same time, he's determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. Folks, I have a better tie—[idea; White House correction]. I'll protect it—Medicare and Social Security—by making the very wealthy finally begin to pay their fair share. Look, I'm a union guy. I want to remind everybody: Wall Street didn't build America. The middle class built America. And unions built the middle class. I walked the picket line with union workers here in Michigan. At the same time, Trump went to a nonunion shop to show his disrespect for union workers. He brags about getting Roe v. Wade overturned. He not only denies reproductive freedom but worsens the mortality rate for Black moms, who have [are; White House correction] nearly three times more likely to die from pregnancy complications than a White woman. Trump openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. He and his MAGA extremists gutted affirmative action. Let me ask you: If he's reelected, who do you think he'll put on the Supreme Court? You think he'll put anybody who has a brain? Folks, look, as Dr. King said: ""Give us the ballot. We'll put judges on the bench who will judge justly and do mercy."" Reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and we will help the NAACP. We will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the Freedom To Vote Act, and make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. Look, the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion are the core strength of America. That's why I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history to tap into the full talents of our country. I promised you, when I was President, I would have an administration that looked like America. We have more African Americans; we have more women; we have more minorities in our administration than any other administration in all of history. That's why we're doing so damn well. Folks, I never imagined that in 2024 there'd be folks wanting to ban books in America. What in God's name is that about? Not only that, they're trying to erase Black history, literally. They're wrong. They don't understand, Black history is American history. Not a joke. Together, we make history; we do not erase history. But, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in a second term than the first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020—and I mean this sincerely—something snapped in Trump. He just can't accept he lost, and he lost it. That's why on January 6, what happened? Every legal avenue Trump tried to challenge the election failed, so he unleashed an insurrection. And now he's running again. And he's not only obsessed with—about losing 2020, he's clearly unhinged. Just listen to him. He calls the irrectionists [insurrectionists; White House correction] who stormed Capitol Hill ""patriots."" He says, if reelected, he wants, quote, ""every"" one of them pardoned. Let me ask you, what do you think he would have done on January the 6th if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? No, I'm serious. What do you think? I can only imagine. This time, he's telling people—he's being more honest—he said, ""I'll be a dictator on day one."" Asked if he thought violence would occur if he lost, he said, quote, ""It depends."" How can it be that any American President cannot denounce political violence? I know I can, I will, and I have. Political violence has no place in America, period. But that's not Donald Trump. Donald Trump has said, if he loses again in November, there will be, quote, ""bloodshed"" [""bloodbath""; White House correction]. What in God's name are we talking about here? This is the United States of America. Folks, Trump isn't running to lead America. He's running for revenge. But revenge is no way to lead a country. You can't build a future on revenge. You can't build better lives through revenge. That's why I'm running to lead America into the future, a future of promise and hope and possibilities, because that's who we are: a nation of possibilities. Look, folks, let me close with this. On Friday, I joined the NAACP at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. We honored the 70th anniversary of Brown versus the Board of Education. I spent time with the plaintiffs and their families in the Oval Office at the White House. And I also met with members of the Little Rock Nine. One year after Brown versus Board, Vivian Malone and James Hood reached the doors of the University of Alabama. They were blocked by hate and the Governor of Alabama. Back in Washington, President Kennedy addressed the Nation, warning of the moral crisis, bigotry that was facing the Nation. He announced the landmark civil rights bill. Late that night, in Jackson, Mississippi, an NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, was assassinated outside his home. Earlier this month, I posthumously awarded Medgar Evers the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our Nation's highest civilian honor. His spirit endures. The NAAC [NAACP; White House correction] spirit endures. Folks, what is at risk in 2024 are our freedoms, our very democracy. And that's not hyperbole. That's why I need you. Imagine the future we can build together. I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we protect our freedoms, don't take them away. I see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy begin to pay their fair share in taxes so we can pay for childcare, eldercare, paid leave, and so much more that good could—the economy could reduce the Federal deficit. I see a future where we save the planet from a climate crisis and our country from gun violence. Above all, I see a future where the full promise of America is available to all Americans, regardless of religion, race, or background. Folks, the idea of America is that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it either. But Trump will. I will not. I know we—you won't either. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity if we do it together. And there's no better outfit to do it with than the NAACP. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. NAACP Detroit Branch President Wendell Anthony. Hello. Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the James Weldon Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award to President Joseph R. Biden. ""Let us march on till victory is won."" [At this point, Mr. Anthony presented the President with the James Weldon Johnson Lifetime Achievement Award.] The President. Folks, I'm going to say one more thing. My State was a slave State, to its great shame. My State was segregated by law. My State needed to change. The Democratic Party in my State used to be recalcitrant, used to be more Southern than it was Northeastern. So, when I get old enough to register to vote, I could not bring myself to register as a Republican, but I could not register as a Democrat at the time, because I joined an organization to try to change the party. And that organization, the first one I joined, I had to register as a ""decline""—decline to state what you are. But I already was part of a party that was changing the Nation and my State: the NAACP. God love you all for what you do.","The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Rev. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Please, have a seat. I don't feel tired. I feel inspired. Hello, Detroit. My name is Joe Biden, and I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP. Matter of fact, the first organization I ever joined was the NAACP. Didn't get to vote until you were 21 in those days, but I got involved in civil rights when I was 15. And, folks, look, I want to thank Reverend Anthony for that introduction. I tell you what, I measure the significance of an award based on the character and the consequence of those organizations bestowing it. And I love Detroit for three reasons. Number one, my dad was an automobile manager. Detroit put food on our table every night. Oh, not a joke. Not a joke. And when I was Vice President, things were kind of bad during the pandemic [recession; White House correction], and what happened was Barack said to me, ""Go to Detroit and help fix it."" Well, poor mayor, he spent more time with me than he ever thought he was going to have to. [Laughter] God love you. Mayor Michael E. Duggan of Detroit. Love you. The President. Folks, I'm humbled to receive this organization [award; White House correction], which defines the character and consequence of what we do. I'm always grateful to Derrick Johnson, the leadership for the NAACP. Of course, thanks to all the members of the biggest NAACP branch in America—in Detroit. And it's great to see so many friends, including Debbie Stabenow. I'm going to miss her in Washington, but she's not going to get away because I'm going to keep coming to her for advice. I'll always be your friend and seek your counsel. And Governor Gretchen Whitmer is my cochair of my campaign. Senator Gary Peters and Mayor Mike Duggan—you know, Mike Duggan is a—I brag about him all the time. I think Mike is one of the best mayors in the entire United States of America, and you know I mean that. All the members of the congressional—the delegation and all other local leaders. Look, folks, I just came from Atlanta, where I delivered a commencement at Morehouse College. It was truly inspiresing [inspiring; White House correction]: over 400 young Black men who will do extraordinary things. I told them I saw them, I heard them, and the Nation needs them. They're the future of this country. And I'm here tonight to say the Nation also needs all of you. And I mean that sincerely. You matter. You matter. Let's be clear. Because of your vote, it's the only reason I'm standing here as President of the United States of America, period. Again, that's not a joke. That's a fact. You're the reason Kamala Harris is a historic Vice President. You're the reason Donald Trump is the defeated former President. And you're the reason Donald Trump's going to be a loser again. You placed enormous faith in me. I've tried my best to honor the trust by doing everything in my power to get us through one of the toughest periods in our history. We got through the pandemic. We're investing more money than ever in Black families and communities. We delivered checks to deposit in people's pockets to reduce Black child poverty. We're reconnecting Black neighborhoods cut off by old highways and decades of disinvestment, including here in Detroit. We're removing every lead pipe so every child, particularly in neighborhoods that are on the brink, can drink clean water without fear of brain damage. We're making the most significant investment ever in climate, including the most significant action in environmental justice ever. Every child in America deserves to breathe clean air. We're delivering affordable high-speed internet so no child has to do their homework outside a McDonald's parking lot. I promised we'd be the best—we'd beat—finally beat Pharma. As a Senator, I tried for years to take them on. We finally did: $35 a month insulin for seniors instead of $400 a month or more. And we capped the total out-of-pocket costs for seniors at $2,000 a year, no matter how high their prescription costs are. Expensive cancer drugs can cost $10-, $12-, $15,000 a year. This year, Medicare is negotiating to lower prices for the costliest drugs on the market to treat everything from heart disease to arthritis. These reforms not only save people money and their lives, it saves the taxpayer $160 billion because Medicare doesn't have to pay those exorbitant prices. On my watch, more Black Americans have health insurance than ever in all of history. I protected and expanded the Affordable Care Act, saving millions of families $800,000 in premium—$8,000 [$800; White House correction] in—a year in premium. My administration has taken the most significant action to provide student debt relief ever. Over 4.5 million Americans, includes a significant number of Black borrowers, have their debts wiped out. And incidentally, it helps grow the economy. And I'm not finished yet. We're investing a record $16 billion in HBCUs—[applause]—$16 billion—more than ever, because you're critical to our Nation's growth and the opportunities for African American women and men. We're increasing access to capital to start business and loans to buy homes. We're cracking down on corporate landlords who [to; White House correction] keep rents down. Our policies are resulting in historic lows of Black unemployment. Black small businesses are starting up at the fastest rate they have in 30 years. We're opening the doors to generational wealth. In fact, the racial wealth gap is its lowest level in 20 years. But there's much more to do. I kept another commitment: to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It matters. It matters. Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. By the way, I've appointed more Black women to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal than every other President in American history combined. People are now realizing how critical those Supreme Court appointments are. Overall, I've appointed nearly 200 judges to the Federal bench. We passed the most significant gun safety law in decades. And I will not stop until I once again am able to ban assault weapons in America. But, folks, all that progress is at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark things were and unsettling things were when he was President. But we'll never forget. We'll never forget him lying about how serious the pandemic was, telling Americans, ""Just inject bleach."" [Laughter] I think that's what he did. That's why he's so screwy. [Laughter] Trump wants to give power back to Big Pharma, charge exorbitant prices again. He wants to take seniors back to paying $400 a month for insulin instead of $35.

Well, I tell you what, it's a hell of a crew, isn't it? Audience members. Yes. The President. The only one I'm afraid of. [At this point, the President pointed at Lynette Sutton, managing partner of Girl Concrete Inc.] [Laughter] Look, one of the reasons why I'm working with the chairman of the Black Caucus in the Senate and the House and working with the—the elected officials, particularly—this guy is from Maryland. My father is from Maryland. But it's not Baltimore; it's Baltimore. [The President imitated a Baltimore accent.] [Laughter] Baltimore. And we're rebuilding a $60 zillion bridge in Baltimore. Look, here's the deal. I believe—and I think the Members of Congress who've worked with me know this—I believe that everybody deserves a shot, and I mean everybody—based on—it doesn't matter what your gender is, what your color is. And one of the reasons why things are moving the way they're moving is because I've insisted that—for example, I've—I'm listed as the most pro-union President in American history. I'm proud of that. But guess what? I also was very clear to the union presidents: You'd better hire more Blacks; you'd better hire more women. Not a joke. And you know it. And by the way, all the things she's bragging about, I did. [Laughter] Because, all kidding aside, there's nothing that can't be done—I really mean it—not a damn thing that can't be done. You know, and when we talk about small business—and I want to thank the owners here. You know, we talk about small business like it's small. It makes up 50 percent of our economy. Add the Fortune 500 companies, the small businesses equal their economic power. That's what they do: They equal their economic power. They employ more people than the Fortune 500 companies do. It's incredible what's done, and we underestimate it. And it's about time we stop just looking at this trickle-down economy, where you say, ""Okay, if the superwealthy do well, a lot will trickle down on a—our plates, and things will be well."" My dad used to say not a damn thing trickled down on his kitchen table. [Laughter] No, I'm serious. My dad worked like hell. My dad was a smart guy. He did well. But you know, it was always a struggle—always a struggle. I'm from—as you Pennsylvanians know, I'm from Scranton. [The President imitated a Scranton accent.] It's not Scranton; it's Scranton when you're from Scranton. But, all kidding aside, we're in a situation where—when coal died, we ended up—there were no—there was no work up there, and it died when I was in, like, second, third grade—fourth grade. And we moved—my dad moved us back down to where he had been raised in Wilmington—he was raised in Baltimore and then Wilmington. His father moved to Wilmington. And we moved down to Claymont, Delaware. Some of you know Claymont. It's about a good, long driver from here. And one of the things that occurred there was it used to be—they used to have 4,500 steelworkers in Worth Steel. And all of a sudden, it all dried up. There was no work. And one of the things we talked about—my dad used to say: ""A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about making sure you can look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and have a chance to mean it."" I mean this sincerely. Not a joke. And in Delaware—the reason I got elected when I was 29 years old to the Senate—we don't come from any money. We come from a three-bedroom house in a little development called Mayfield with a grandfather living with us, four kids. And one relative always—[inaudible]—beyond on my mom and dad. We weren't poor, but it was close family. [Laughter] And—but everybody thought it was a simple proposition: Just give them a chance—just a chance. And so I got involved as a kid in the civil rights movement because—the Philadelphians know this—at least the older ones do—Delaware was the only city in the—State in the Nation, Wilmington the only in city in America, occupied by the military for 9 months after Dr. King was assassinated. I was working for a fancy law firm. I had just gotten a job. And I quit and became a public defender, because there was a National Guard person standing on every single corner in Wilmington, Delaware, with a drawn bayonet—not a joke—a drawn bayonet. So I quit the fancy law firm I got a job with. I hadn't even gotten the first paycheck. And I became a public defender. The point was, my dad always talked about ""everybody deserves a shot""—everybody. And that's what it's all about. And it makes no distinction between whether you're a man or a woman, you're Black, you're White, you're—whatever the background is. Just flat out, everybody deserves a shot. I remember my dad, when—he—every once in a while, when I was practicing law and—as a public defender, my office was near the Du Pont Hotel, which used to be a four-star hotel down in Wilmington. And we—every once in a while, my dad would take me to the grill there for lunch. And so we were walking by one day, and the chairman of the board of DuPont Company came down the elevator. He comes into that lobby, and he said, ""Hello,"" and nodded at my dad. My dad said, ""Hello."" Then he immediately walked over to the shoeshine stand and thanked the shoeshine guys. And I said, ""Why?"" ""Everybody deserves to be treated with dignity—everybody."" I'm not making this up. That's how we were raised, how all of you were raised. Everybody deserves an even shot. And so that's what we're doing. And we're doing it with incredible help. You know, we're in a situation where not only are we dealing with the issue of whether or not Black women or women generally can get into fields they haven't been able to get into before, but guess what Jill is doing? My wife started this effort. We don't spend—we spend one-third as much on research—medical research for women as we do men. That's changing. It's changing. Everything is changing. I've got more women in my administration than I have men in my administration. [Laughter] No, fact. Fact. Fact. Okay? There's a simple reason for that: All the women in my family are smarter than all the men. [Laughter] But my—my point is, I just think what we're all about, cut it all away, it's about giving everybody just a shot. No one is asking for a free ride, just a shot. And that's what we're doing. And I think that's why we have—we have a long way to go. But we have literally the strongest economy in the world right now—in the whole damn world. We've got more to do. What we have to do is make sure that economy benefits everybody across the board, everybody has a shot. And that's why I've changed the way we look at things. We no longer think about building a trickle-down economy. Not a joke. In literal terms, it is you build from the middle out and the bottom up. When the middle class does well, the poor have a shot and the wealthy still do fine, as long as they start paying their taxes. No, I'm not—I'm not—that's not a joke. You know, all that stuff I got done—they told us we couldn't get anything done—I got it done with the Black Caucus and others helping me in the Congress. But guess what? We have a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill—$1.2 trillion. And guess what that means? Remember Trump had ""Infrastructure Month"" for 4 years, didn't build a damn thing. Well, we're changing the way in which everything works in this country. We're—how can you be the most powerful country in the world with a second rate infrastructure, whether it's your ports, highways, airports, et cetera. We're also in a situation where, in addition to that, we made sure that people have a shot to do the things they need to do. You know, I'm not trying to be nice to—I know a lot about HBCUs because Delaware State, which was a State—HBCU, was the place I got organized and started. I went to University of Delaware. But the fact is that—you know, the fact is that this is just people wanting to know that you just give them a shot. And so guess what? HBCUs don't have the money to put in the research labs and all the experimental stuff because they don't have the endowments they have. But those are all the jobs of the future. AI and all the rest cost billions of dollars to get it going. Well, guess what? They told me I couldn't do anything. I got 16 billion—with a ""b""—billion dollars this year—for HBCUs. And there's two reasons. It'd be a wasted asset if we didn't, but I want to prove to everybody there's not a damn thing that a White man can do that a Black man can't do or do better. I mean it sincerely. It's important to get it done. And you go down the list of all the things we're talking about, and one of the things is that a lot of—a lot of people don't know how to get to their—you know, the Government has some good programs, but sometimes, it's hard to figure out how they work. So what did we do? We have an entire staff designed to be able to go out to say to people: ""This is how you apply for this. This is how you do this. This is""—— [The microphone generated feedback.] Every time I walk next to you, DJ, this goes off. [Laughter] I don't know, man. That's one powerful sucker here, man. [Laughter] His program, I walk up, and he—my microphone goes off. But any rate, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I've never been more optimistic in my life, not because I'm President; because I see things changing. And I promise you—I promise you—it's going to seem to—this group will understand it and believe it. But the rest of the world looks to the United States. Imagine—answer the rhetorical question: If we weren't leading the world, who leads the world? Name me a country. Name me one single country that could possibly lead. So we pull the world together. No, I'm serious. And we have such enormous opportunities—such enormous opportunities to change the way in which we have been working, to build things that we've never been able to build. And look, I'll end by saying there's a phrase—I'm—I used to always get kidded at the United States Senate because I was always quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate. They thought I did it because I was Irish. That's not the reason. I did it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter] And there's a poet who wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And he said, ""Once in a lifetime, that longed-for opportunity rises up, and hope and history rhyme."" We have a shot to make hope and history rhyme. We really do. We really do.

And look, I'll end by saying there's a phrase—I'm—I used to always get kidded at the United States Senate because I was always quoting Irish poets on the floor of the Senate. They thought I did it because I was Irish. That's not the reason. I did it because they're the best poets in the world. [Laughter] And there's a poet who wrote a poem called ""The Cure at Troy."" And he said, ""Once in a lifetime, that longed-for opportunity rises up, and hope and history rhyme."" We have a shot to make hope and history rhyme. We really do. We really do. We've got to remember who in the hell we are. We're the United States of America. We have a value set that goes beyond the Constitution: just basic decency, honesty. It matters. It matters. And that's why I'm so excited about being with all of you. Like I said, in 1969 I got involved deeply in the civil rights movement, nineteen—and I—we used to—those of you Pennsylvanians know that Delaware used to be a slave State and a Southern State in its attitudes. I mean, for real. We have the eighth largest Black population as a percent of the population of any State in the Nation. And one of the things that I—that amazed me was how the community stepped up when you gave it a shot. We've gone from a red State to a blue, blue State, but the reason is—the reason I'm elected—Nixon won my State by 60 percent of the vote when I rate as a 29-year-old kid. You have to be 30 to be sworn in. You can be elected early; you can't be sworn in until then. And I wasn't intending to run. I was running because no one else would run, and they came to me and said, ""You run."" And I went to my—a professor I had at Delaware—University of Delaware. And he was my political philosophy professor. I said, ""What do you think I should do, Doctor?"" He said, ""I think you should""—he said, ""Remember what Plato said."" I mean, ""What the hell did Plato say?"" He said, ""The penalty good people pay for not being involved in politics is being governed by people worse than themselves."" It's really kind of basic. So I ran thinking I'd make a point. I wasn't even sure I could win. But I was smart enough to hire my sister. She and I went to school together. She was 3 years younger than me, 2 years behind me at the University of Delaware. She graduated Phi Beta. I graduated. You know? [Laughter] She managed all my campaigns—[laughter]—you know, so—I guess the point I'm trying to make is, I think we should shoot really high. We should aim high. And look at all that's been changed. For example, you know, the bridge went down over the Chesapeake. And we were there the next day. I was with the Governor. And it was billions of dollars. But guess what? We changed it. It's already cleared, the channel—already moving things. But they told us we can't do all that. Remember? Governor Westley W.O. ""Wes"" Moore of Maryland. That's right. The President. There's nothing we can't do. Remember when the highway—when the guy ran on the—the tractor-trailer took the—the bridge out here on 495? Well, guess what? Seven days. Seven days, because we can do anything when we put our mind to it. And so that's the only thing—I think what you do—those of you in the Black community who take the chances and open the business, take the chances on getting deeply engaged, you give people confidence. I mean, you give people confidence and make people believe we can do what we can do. So I came basically to say thank you. And I ain't going anywhere. Now—I did DJ's program this morning, and he made a good point. He said: ""You can't just talk in generalities and talk about democracy and all this. You've got to talk specifics, how people affect people."" But I figure this is one audience—the one audience I can talk about the general—the general things that have to be done. We need a value set. We have to be what we say we are, that we hold these truths self-evident. I know it sounds corny, but I really mean it. In every single major—I've known every major foreign leader in the last 40 years. I've known them personally just because of the nature my job. And so, when I became President, all these meetings with the G-7 and the G-20 and all these heads of state, there's not a single one that I leave that—one of those meetings overseas or here—that a leader doesn't come up to me—not a joke—as I'm leaving and go like this: ""Joe, you can't let that other guy win. My democracy is at stake""—not ours, his—""my democracy is at stake."" But if we win this and begin to keep this going, we can literally change the Nation and change the world. God love you all. Thank you.","['please', 'please', 'sit', 'audience', 'member', 'four', 'tell', 'hell', 'crew', 'isnt', 'audience', 'members', 'yes', 'im', 'afraid', 'look', 'reasons', 'im', 'working', 'chairman',

That's not hyperbole. Because you voted, Donald Trump is a defeated former President. And with your vote—with your vote—in 2024, we're going to make Donald Trump a loser again."", ""In 2020 and throughout my career—I know a lot of Philadelphians know this because I got so much help when I was running for the Senate in Delaware from Philly—Black voters placed enormous faith in me. I've tried to do my best to honor that trust, staying true to the value set that we share, and got me involved as a kid in the first place: Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, faith and family are everything, and we leave no one behind."", ""But, folks, I know it's natural to wonder if democracy—the democracy you hear about actually works for you. When justice is denied, how can it be working for you? When promises are broken, how can it be working for you? When you have to be 10 times better than everyone else to get the same shot, how can it be working for you?"", ""I get it. And I know there's a lot of misinformation out there. So I came today to speak the truth: the truth about promises made and promises kept."", 'Do you remember when the pandemic hit—when 20 million people were out of work, when businesses and schools shut down, emergency rooms were overwhelmed, and Black folks were hit harder than anyone else?

Another promise made and another promise kept."", 'I promised to protect your health care.

That is banning choke holds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, creating databases for police misconduct, and so much more.

And I'm going to get it reinstated in the second term."", ""Folks, Trump continues to lie by saying Black unemployment was at a record low on his watch. The fact is the record low unemployment happened on my watch, and we're going to keep it going."", ""Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate in 30 years because of what we've done.

We're doing everything we can to right that wrong."", ""And guess what? We're taking on corporate greed to bring down the price of gas, food, and rent; eliminating junk fees. Instead of getting charged 35 bucks for an overdraft, it's $3 now, not $35."", ""The bottom line is, we've invested more in Black America than any previous administration in history has. We're opening more doors for economic opportunity, including access to capital, entrepreneurship, workforce training so you can build a life of financial freedom and create generational wealth, all—all—while being the providers and leaders of your families and community. Another promise made and a promise kept."", ""We're just getting started. In the second term, we want to keep it going to level the playing field by making the wealthy begin to pay their fair tax. It ain't even close."", ""I said I'd not increase the tax of anybody making less than $400,000 a year. Well, guess who—how much—guess how much the average Federal tax rate is for a billionaire? We've got a thousand of them. Eight-point-three percent. Eight-point-three percent. It's outrageous. If the billionaires only had to pay 25 percent, it would raise forty—$400 billion.

It's good—it's good to be—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. [Laughter] It's good to be almost home. I just live down the road a little bit. [Laughter] Thank you, Kamala, for your partnership. And it is a partnership. And how about another round of applause for our great Vice President. Is she something else? It's great to see so many friends, including my fellow Scrantonian Senator Bobby Casey. Bobby, where are—where are you? There you are. Mayor Parker; Lieutenant Governor Davis; and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Steve Horsford; and members of the CBC who are here tonight, I'm a—if I introduced everybody, I'll be here all night. But look, while he couldn't be here, we're thinking of our dear friend Congressman Dwight Evans. He's recovering. And he's going to recover. He's doing well. And joining us are so many State and local officials from across the country, including a guy from my father's hometown, where he was born, Baltimore, Maryland. [At this point, the President briefly imitated a Baltimore accent.] They say it down—""Baltimore,"" not Baltimore. I want to introduce you to the mayor of—the mayor—the Governor of the great State of Maryland. Where are you, Gov? [Applause] In case you haven't noticed, he looks like he can still play too. [Laughter] It's great to be with you, Gov. Civil rights and community leaders from all across the country. Folks, if anyone whether—wonders whether their vote matters, remember this: Because Black America voted in 2020, I'm—please, have a seat, if you can, if you have a seat. Because Black Americans voted, Kamala and I are President and Vice President of the United States—because of you. That's not hyperbole. Because you voted, Donald Trump is a defeated former President. And with your vote—with your vote—in 2024, we're going to make Donald Trump a loser again. In 2020 and throughout my career—I know a lot of Philadelphians know this because I got so much help when I was running for the Senate in Delaware from Philly—Black voters placed enormous faith in me. I've tried to do my best to honor that trust, staying true to the value set that we share, and got me involved as a kid in the first place: Everyone is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect, faith and family are everything, and we leave no one behind. But, folks, I know it's natural to wonder if democracy—the democracy you hear about actually works for you. When justice is denied, how can it be working for you? When promises are broken, how can it be working for you? When you have to be 10 times better than everyone else to get the same shot, how can it be working for you? I get it. And I know there's a lot of misinformation out there. So I came today to speak the truth: the truth about promises made and promises kept. Do you remember when the pandemic hit—when 20 million people were out of work, when businesses and schools shut down, emergency rooms were overwhelmed, and Black folks were hit harder than anyone else? When Trump was President, he said—and he said this—he took responsibility for none of it—he said, ""It's none of my responsibility."" When I came into office, I promised we'd do everything we can to get us through that pandemic. And that's what we did. That, folks, was a promise made and a promise kept. I promised to put racial equality at the center of everything I do because I vowed I would have an administration that looked like America. Because you voted, we're invested more money than ever in the Black families and communities. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd start to reconnect Black and Brown and overlooked neighborhoods cut off by highways in the sixties and decades of disinvestment as a consequence of it, including here in Philly. But we're—changed that with the Recovery Act of—with the—in the—right now you see all the construction going on, on the highways around here. A promise made and a promise kept. Look, I said I'd remove every lead pipe in America so every child can drink clean water without fear of brain damage. We're doing it. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd also take the most significant action on environmental justice ever to remove the legacy of pollution that smothers fenceline communities, because every child, every American deserves to breathe clean and fresh air. We're doing it. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised to access affordable high-speed internet, because now internet is just as important as it was in the days of Franklin Roosevelt—electricity was generations ago. We're delivering now because no child should have to do their homework at McDonald's when things are shut down, sit in the parking lot with their parent to get it done. Another promise made and another promise kept. I promised to protect your health care. I protected and expanded the Affordable Health Care Act that was Obamacare—is still Obamacare—[applause]—saving millions of Americans an additional $800 a year in premiums. And, folks, the Affordable Care Act is still a big deal. As Kamala just explained, Senators with—debated this, but we finally got it done—we debated—seniors with diabetes are now paying $35 for insulin instead of $400. I'm determined to make that apply to every American, not just seniors, in the second term. We're capping—the bill we've already passed, we capped total out-of-pocket costs for drugs for seniors beginning next year at $2,000 a year total, excluding—including cancer drugs that cost $10-, $12-, $14,000 a year. You pay no more than $2,000 a year. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, it not only saves people money, it saves the taxpayers—guess what?—$160 billion cut in the deficit because Medicare doesn't have to pay those exorbitant prices. Folks, one of the reasons I got started and won the first time and subsequent times in Delaware is because of the best HBCU in America, Delaware State. Kamala—[applause]—Kamala says it's some school down in Washington. [Laughter] Anyway, HBCUs are incredible institutions, but they don't have the same endowments as other universities to fund research centers and to do so much more. Because you voted, I kept my commitment, and we're investing $16 billion—the most ever in the history of America—$16 billion. It will grow America. It will save America money. A promise made and a promise kept. I'm keeping my promises that no one should be in jail merely for using or possessing marijuana. I pardoned thousands of people incarcerated for the mere possession of marijuana—thousands. A promise made and a promise kept. And for—their records should be expunged as well, I might add. Folks, it wasn't easy to get a lot of this done. In fact, obstacles every step of the way, we faced. For example, Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But it didn't stop me from signing a historic Executive order requiring key elements of that bill for Federal enforcement. That is banning choke holds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, creating databases for police misconduct, and so much more. But we're still—[applause]—and we did it with the support of George Floyd's family, and we're going to finally get it all done. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd beat the NRA, and we did. As Kamala mentioned, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, I'm going to go back and once again ban assault weapons in America. I did it once; I'll do it again. The Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt, but they didn't stop me. So far, I've relieved student debt for nearly 5 million Americans—a significant number are Black borrowers—so you can chase your dreams, start a family, buy a first home, start a business, and so much more. And guess what? It grows the economy. It strengthens the economy. I'm going to keep it going. A promise made is a promise kept. But we're—speaking of the—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. ——speaking of the courts, because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. A promise made and a promise kept. And I appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than every other President in American history combined. Every single President combined. And overall, we've appointed 200 Black judges to the Federal—I mean, judges to the Federal bench. And guess what? The next President—they're going to be able to appoint a couple of Justices, and I'll be damned if they're not going to have—[applause]. Look, if in fact we're able to change some of the Justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we've always had, tell me that won't change your life when Trump Justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more. Are we going to let that happen? We can't. Audience members. No! The President. No, we—we really can't. Now, let's talk about Trump's MAGA lies. I don't have an hour, but we're going to shorten it. [Laughter] Trump takes credit for sending all the pandemic relief checks alone. It's a lie. The truth is, the Congressional Black Caucus got that money passed. And when Kamala and I came to office, with the help of the CBC, passed legislation to deliver more checks in the pockets to millions of Americans, including Black Americans—$1,400 checks from the American Rescue Plan we passed, and then $300 a month per child per family through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half for Black families. And I'm going to get it reinstated in the second term. Folks, Trump continues to lie by saying Black unemployment was at a record low on his watch. The fact is the record low unemployment happened on my watch, and we're going to keep it going. Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate in 30 years because of what we've done. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years because of our efforts. A promise made and a promise kept. I announced significant—the most significant housing plan in 50 years that includes first-time homebuyer's tax credit, building millions of affordable housing to bring rents down. New data shows a 40-percent cut in the gap between home appraisals in majority White communities versus those of color—in communities of color. You know, the same exact builder on either side of 95, build the same houses—if it's a Black community, it's lower—the value, from the very day it's built, ends up being lower than the exact same house across the highway in the White community. We're doing everything we can to right that wrong. And guess what? We're taking on corporate greed to bring down the price of gas, food, and rent; eliminating junk fees. Instead of getting charged 35 bucks for an overdraft, it's $3 now, not $35. The bottom line is, we've invested more in Black America than any previous administration in history has. We're opening more doors for economic opportunity, including access to capital, entrepreneurship, workforce training so you can build a life of financial freedom and create generational wealth, all—all—while being the providers and leaders of your families and community. Another promise made and a promise kept. We're just getting started. In the second term, we want to keep it going to level the playing field by making the wealthy begin to pay their fair tax. It ain't even close. I said I'd not increase the tax of anybody making less than $400,000 a year. Well, guess who—how much—guess how much the average Federal tax rate is for a billionaire? We've got a thousand of them. Eight-point-three percent. Eight-point-three percent. It's outrageous. If the billionaires only had to pay 25 percent, it would raise forty—$400 billion. We'd be able to do everything we're doing now and still reduce the debt. Look, billionaires pay their fair share, not only would it—not only reduce the deficit, but it could provide childcare, eldercare, paid leave, and so much more to change the lives of millions of Americans, as well as grow our economy. But, folks, all progress, all freedom, all opportunities are at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark and unsettling things were when he was President. But we'll never forget lying around and him—how he and—and us—him—him lying around, actually. [Laughter] And lying about how serious the pandemic was and say he had no responsibility for it. And telling Americans, ""Just inject a little bleach."" Remember that? The way he's acting, I think he injected a hell of a lot of bleach in himself. [Laughter] Trump—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] You've got it, kid. [Laughter] Trump and his MAGA extremists want to give power back to Big Pharma to charge—continue to charge exorbitant fees. Trump is still determined, in his own words, quote, to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more. During his Presidency, Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He racked up more Federal debt than any President did in any Presidential term in history. Tell me about the Republicans and balancing budgets. And now he wants to do it again. At the same time, he is determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. Audience members. Boo! The President. I have a better idea: Let's protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay for it. As Kamala said, Trump brags about gutting Roe v. Wade—standing there, ""I did this""—while he openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. Folks, reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and I will sign the John Lewis Voting Right Act and the Freedom To Vote Act tomorrow, and we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. It's within our power to do this. MAGA extremists ban books. Did you ever think—if you're anybody over 30 years old—you'd go through a period where we're banning books in America? They're trying to erase Black history. We're going to write Black history, because it's American history. It's American history. Together, we make history, not erase it. To me, the values of diversity, equality, inclusion are literally—and that's not kidding—the core strengths of America. That's why I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history that taps into the full talents of our country. And it starts at the top with the Vice President. On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a Black man—the highest order—the first Black Secretary of Defense; second Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Black women heads of military units who are overseeing the most diverse, strongest fighting force in the history of the world. And, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in this guy. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol ""patriots""—""patriots."" If reelected, he wants to pardon, quote, ""every one"" of them. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me ask you, what do you think he would have done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed it? Think about this: What do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don't think he'd be talking about pardons.

I pardoned thousands of people incarcerated for the mere possession of marijuana—thousands. A promise made and a promise kept. And for—their records should be expunged as well, I might add. Folks, it wasn't easy to get a lot of this done. In fact, obstacles every step of the way, we faced. For example, Senate Republicans blocked the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. But it didn't stop me from signing a historic Executive order requiring key elements of that bill for Federal enforcement. That is banning choke holds, greatly restricting no-knock warrants, creating databases for police misconduct, and so much more. But we're still—[applause]—and we did it with the support of George Floyd's family, and we're going to finally get it all done. A promise made and a promise kept. I promised we'd beat the NRA, and we did. As Kamala mentioned, I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. A promise made and a promise kept. And by the way, I'm going to go back and once again ban assault weapons in America. I did it once; I'll do it again. The Supreme Court blocked me from relieving student debt, but they didn't stop me. So far, I've relieved student debt for nearly 5 million Americans—a significant number are Black borrowers—so you can chase your dreams, start a family, buy a first home, start a business, and so much more. And guess what? It grows the economy. It strengthens the economy. I'm going to keep it going. A promise made is a promise kept. But we're—speaking of the—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. ——speaking of the courts, because you voted, I was able to keep my commitment to appoint the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. A promise made and a promise kept. And I appointed more Black women to the Federal circuit courts than every other President in American history combined. Every single President combined. And overall, we've appointed 200 Black judges to the Federal—I mean, judges to the Federal bench. And guess what? The next President—they're going to be able to appoint a couple of Justices, and I'll be damned if they're not going to have—[applause]. Look, if in fact we're able to change some of the Justices when they retire and put in really progressive judges like we've always had, tell me that won't change your life when Trump Justices are already gutting voting rights, overturning Roe, decimating affirmative action, and so much more. Are we going to let that happen? We can't. Audience members. No! The President. No, we—we really can't. Now, let's talk about Trump's MAGA lies. I don't have an hour, but we're going to shorten it. [Laughter] Trump takes credit for sending all the pandemic relief checks alone. It's a lie. The truth is, the Congressional Black Caucus got that money passed. And when Kamala and I came to office, with the help of the CBC, passed legislation to deliver more checks in the pockets to millions of Americans, including Black Americans—$1,400 checks from the American Rescue Plan we passed, and then $300 a month per child per family through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half for Black families. And I'm going to get it reinstated in the second term. Folks, Trump continues to lie by saying Black unemployment was at a record low on his watch. The fact is the record low unemployment happened on my watch, and we're going to keep it going. Black small businesses are starting up at a faster rate in 30 years because of what we've done. The racial wealth gap is the lowest it's been in 20 years because of our efforts. A promise made and a promise kept. I announced significant—the most significant housing plan in 50 years that includes first-time homebuyer's tax credit, building millions of affordable housing to bring rents down. New data shows a 40-percent cut in the gap between home appraisals in majority White communities versus those of color—in communities of color. You know, the same exact builder on either side of 95, build the same houses—if it's a Black community, it's lower—the value, from the very day it's built, ends up being lower than the exact same house across the highway in the White community. We're doing everything we can to right that wrong. And guess what? We're taking on corporate greed to bring down the price of gas, food, and rent; eliminating junk fees. Instead of getting charged 35 bucks for an overdraft, it's $3 now, not $35. The bottom line is, we've invested more in Black America than any previous administration in history has. We're opening more doors for economic opportunity, including access to capital, entrepreneurship, workforce training so you can build a life of financial freedom and create generational wealth, all—all—while being the providers and leaders of your families and community. Another promise made and a promise kept. We're just getting started. In the second term, we want to keep it going to level the playing field by making the wealthy begin to pay their fair tax. It ain't even close. I said I'd not increase the tax of anybody making less than $400,000 a year. Well, guess who—how much—guess how much the average Federal tax rate is for a billionaire? We've got a thousand of them. Eight-point-three percent. Eight-point-three percent. It's outrageous. If the billionaires only had to pay 25 percent, it would raise forty—$400 billion. We'd be able to do everything we're doing now and still reduce the debt. Look, billionaires pay their fair share, not only would it—not only reduce the deficit, but it could provide childcare, eldercare, paid leave, and so much more to change the lives of millions of Americans, as well as grow our economy. But, folks, all progress, all freedom, all opportunities are at risk. Trump is trying to make the country forget just how dark and unsettling things were when he was President. But we'll never forget lying around and him—how he and—and us—him—him lying around, actually. [Laughter] And lying about how serious the pandemic was and say he had no responsibility for it. And telling Americans, ""Just inject a little bleach."" Remember that? The way he's acting, I think he injected a hell of a lot of bleach in himself. [Laughter] Trump—— Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. [Laughter] You've got it, kid. [Laughter] Trump and his MAGA extremists want to give power back to Big Pharma to charge—continue to charge exorbitant fees. Trump is still determined, in his own words, quote, to ""terminate"" the Affordable Care Act, which would deny 3 million Black Americans health insurance, deny protections for preexisting conditions for millions more. During his Presidency, Trump enacted a $2 trillion tax cut overwhelmingly benefiting the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the Federal deficit. He racked up more Federal debt than any President did in any Presidential term in history. Tell me about the Republicans and balancing budgets. And now he wants to do it again. At the same time, he is determined to cut Social Security and Medicare. Audience members. Boo! The President. I have a better idea: Let's protect Social Security and Medicare and make the very wealthy begin to pay for it. As Kamala said, Trump brags about gutting Roe v. Wade—standing there, ""I did this""—while he openly encourages voter suppression and election subversion. Folks, reelect Kamala and me and a Democratic Congress, and I will sign the John Lewis Voting Right Act and the Freedom To Vote Act tomorrow, and we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. It's within our power to do this. MAGA extremists ban books. Did you ever think—if you're anybody over 30 years old—you'd go through a period where we're banning books in America? They're trying to erase Black history. We're going to write Black history, because it's American history. It's American history. Together, we make history, not erase it. To me, the values of diversity, equality, inclusion are literally—and that's not kidding—the core strengths of America. That's why I'm proud to have the most diverse administration in history that taps into the full talents of our country. And it starts at the top with the Vice President. On Memorial Day, I proudly stood with a Black man—the highest order—the first Black Secretary of Defense; second Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Black women heads of military units who are overseeing the most diverse, strongest fighting force in the history of the world. And, folks, the threat that Trump poses is greater in his second term than his first. It's clear that when he lost in 2020, something literally snapped in this guy. No, I'm serious. That's why January 6 happened, when he unleashed an insurrection. Now he's running again, and he's clearly unhinged. He calls the insurrectionists who stormed the Capitol ""patriots""—""patriots."" If reelected, he wants to pardon, quote, ""every one"" of them. Audience members. Boo! The President. Let me ask you, what do you think he would have done on January 6 if Black Americans had stormed it? Think about this: What do you think would have happened if Black Americans had stormed the Capitol? I don't think he'd be talking about pardons. This is the same guy who wanted to tear gas you as you peacefully protested George Floyd's murder. The same guy who still calls the Central Park Five ""guilty,"" even though they were exonerated. He's that landlord who denies housing applications because of the color of your skin. He's that guy who won't say ""Black lives matter"" and invokes neo-Nazi, Third Reich terms. And we all remember Trump is the same guy who unleashed birthism—the birtherism lie against Barack. And then Trump tells you he's the greatest President—I love this one. He says he's the greatest President for Black people in the history of America, including more than Abraham Lincoln. [The President made the sign of the cross.] Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, can you fathom that? Where in the hell—like I said, I think he injected too much of that bleach in his skin—into his brain. [Laughter] I think it affected his brain. Some lies are so foolish that you don't have to say anything about them at all. Maya Angelou said, ""When someone shows you who they are""—— Audience members. Believe them! The President. ——""believe them the first time."" You've got it, kid. [Laughter] You've got it. I've shown you who I am, and Trump has shown you who he is. And today, Donald Trump is pandering and peddling lies and stereotypes for your votes so he can win for himself, not for you. Well, Donald Trump, I have a message for you: Not in our house and not on our watch. Let me close with this. [Applause] Let me close with this. And, folks, I know we have a lot more to do. When the full promise of America is not available to every person in this country regardless of race, we've got work to do. But let's not lose sight of how far we've come. And the reason is you. The stakes in this election couldn't be higher. What's at stake is nothing less than the fundamental ideal of America—it defines America: that we're all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and should be treated that way throughout our lives. We've never lived up to it, but we've never, ever before completely walked away from it either. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump be the reason we stopped being America. I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump—[applause]—we're not going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place that doesn't believe in honesty, decency, and treating people with respect. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump turn America into a place filled with anger and resentment and hate. Folks, America has always been a place where we've worked toward a more perfect Union, where those who were excluded in the past are included in the promise in the country today. I still believe that. I'm still optimistic. But I need you. So my question for you is simple—a simple one: Are you with me? Audience members. Yes! The President. Talk to your family. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Spread the word. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. As the gospel song goes: ""We've come too far from where we started. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don't believe He brought me this far, though, to leave me."" My fellow Americans, I don't think the good Lord brought us this far to leave us behind. We just have to remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing—nothing, nothing—beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Every time—every time I walked out of my Grandfather Finnegan's house up in Scranton, he'd yell, ""Joey, keep the faith."" And my grandmother would yell, ""No, Joey, spread it."" Go spread the faith.","['hello', 'philadelphia', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'audience', 'members', 'four', 'four', 'four', 'almost',

We learned he still believes that politicians, not doctors and women, should make decisions about a woman's health. Audience members. Boo! The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v.—overturning Roe v. Wade was a beautiful thing. Audience members. Boo! The President. I think it was a nightmare. No, I really mean it. A nightmare. And I made it clear again last night that if you elect me and Kamala and you give us a Democratic Congress, we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. He continued to lie. He said I quadrupled taxes—where the hell has he been?—[laughter]—which is a simple lie. I didn't raise the tax on anyone in America that made less than $400,000 a year, and I won't in my second term either. We learned that Trump—who had the largest deficit of any President in 4 years because of the $2 trillion tax cut to the superwealthy—we learned that Trump wants to give another giant tax cut for the very wealthy and the biggest corporations. This time, $5 trillion—not a joke—$5 trillion. To pay for it, he's going to cut Medicare and Social Security. He'll cut health care. They'll do it all, with millions of working and middle class Americans all paying for another tax cut for the very wealthy. Then, to add insult to injury, he wants to raise taxes on the average family $2,500 a year. What amounts to a new 10-percent sales tax on all products imported in America—that's his new plan—for food, coffee, candy bars, and so much more. It's going to raise the tax on the average family $2,500 a year. And most dangerously, though, we learned that Donald Trump will not respect this year's election outcome. He's still not—he rejected the last time out. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, think about it. Every court in the land ruled that it was a fair election. He's still denying it, still telling lies. Three times, Trump was asked last night by the moderators: Would he respect the election results if he lost this time? Three times, he refused to answer. Three times. Folks, Donald Trump refused to accept the results in 2020, and we all saw what happened on January the 6th. It's a direct consequence of that. It was an international embarrassment. By the way, as I go these international meetings—I know every major world leader—I literally—because I've been around, as you might have noticed. [Laughter] But they ask, ""Does he really mean this?"" ""Is that—was this real?"" It caused a constitutional crisis and international embarrassment. Now, Trump is making it clear that if he doesn't win this time, there will be, in his words, ""bloodshed""—blood—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No President has ever said anything like that. No President. His words, not mine. Are we going to let Donald Trump attack our democracy again? Audience members. No! The President. I don't think so. Folks—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Folks, we've come a long way. We've come a long way from the mess that Donald Trump left us. We came out of the pandemic. We're a long way from where—Donald Trump telling us to inject bleach in our skin, that COVID is not that dangerous. Today, we have the strongest economy in the world without exception—15 million new jobs; 800,000 manufacturing jobs; unemployment under 4 percent for a record 2 years in a row—historic Black and Hispanic unemployment down; historic creation of small businesses—Black and all communities across the Nation, particularly in rural areas; historic economic growth; inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3, and it's still going down. I know we have more to do to get prices down. We have to take on corporate greed. They're making twice the profit they were before the pandemic. We've got to make housing more affordable, provide childcare, make the Tax Code fair. Sixteen Nobel winners of the economic—Nobel Prize have looked at my economy—economic plan. This week, they've issued a report. And on Trump's plan. Here's what they concluded. They said that my plan would continue to grow the economy and bring down inflation. Sixteen Nobel laureates. And that Trump's plan would send the Nation into recession and inflation soaring through the roof. Audience members. Boo! The President. But don't take my word for it. Folks, let me close with this. I know I'm not a young man—[laughter]—to state the obvious. Audience member. [Inaudible] The President. Well, I know. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Well—I don't—— Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Folks, I don't walk as easy as I used to. I don't speak as smoothly as I used to. I don't debate as well as I used to. But I know what I do know: I know how to tell the truth. I know—I know—I know right from wrong. And I know how to do this job. I know how to get things done. And I know like millions of Americans know: When you get knocked down, you get back up. I know what it took to take our economy from the depths of pandemic to where it is today: the strongest economy in the world. I know what it will take to bring this economy to everybody. I know what it will take to rally the world to stand up against Putin and defend freedom, not yield to him. And I know what it will take to keep the world safe and free for the years ahead. Folks, I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didn't believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job. Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high. Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! The President. The stakes are too high. Audience members. Yes, you can! Yes, you can! Yes, you can! The President. Donald Trump—Donald Trump is a genuine threat to this Nation. Audience members. Yes! The President. He is a threat to our freedom. Audience members. Yes! The President. He is a threat to our democracy. Audience members. Yes! The President. He's literally a threat for everything America stands for. Audience members. Yes! The President. Look, he doesn't understand what I think all of you do. America is the finest, the most unique nation in the world. We're the only nation in the world—and I mean this sincerely. It's a fact statement, not a hyperbolic statement. It's fact. We're the only nation in the world built on an idea. All other nations are built on ethnicity, geography, and other—religion. But we're built on an idea that we're all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives. We've never fully lived up, but I'll be damned in the year 2024, just 2 years—just 2 years before the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence that I'll let Donald Trump walk away from it. I give you my word—I give you my word as a Biden. We're still a nation—I believe our civilization believes in honesty, in decency, and treating people with respect. I still believe we're a nation that gives everyone a fair shot and leaves nobody behind. We are still a nation that gives hate no safe harbor. And we're still the beacon to the world. We can never give up what makes America America. Donald Trump is motivated by revenge and retribution. Well, revenge and retribution never built a damn thing. You and I, we Americans are a nation of hope, optimism, and possibilities. That's what always built America, and that's going to continue to build America today. The choice in this election is simple. Donald Trump will restore our democracy; I will defend it. [Applause] So, folks, are you with me? Donald Trump is the first President I've heard of that stood up there and running for President having been one—one term, saying, ""America is a failing nation."" Where the hell does he think he is? Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm serious. A failing—I don't know a President who wouldn't trade places with America in a heartbeat. He's dead wrong. America is not a losing nation. America is winning. As I stand here today, I can honestly say I've never been more optimistic about America's future in my whole career. We just have to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. And there is—there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity—nothing—when we act together. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. You've got it. Audience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! The President. So may God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Let's go get them, North Carolina. [The President gestured toward the First Lady.] She finally did marry me.","The President. Hello, hello, hello. Audience members. Joe! Joe! Joe! The President. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, North Carolina! And I'll get in trouble with my mom looking down in Heaven if I don't say please excuse my back, I apologize. [At this point, the President addressed audience members standing behind the podium.] [Inaudible] It's good knowing you—it's good knowing you have my back. Eric, thank you for that introduction. We had a wonderful time spending time with your sons Christian and Carter. They're going to grow up to be incredible young men. You would have been really impressed the way they talked about their dad, how informed they were about what was going on. I was truly impressed. And I ate two hamburgers. [Laughter] And a special thanks to Roy and Kristin Cooper. Roy, you've been a great Governor, which makes it all the more important that North Carolina elect a great Governor to replace you, Josh Stein. And when I'm reelected again with your help, I want you to know that I'm not promising not to take Roy away from North Carolina. Whether he'll come or not, I don't know. And thanks to all the State and local leaders here today and the great musicians and entertainers who performed earlier. Folks, let me tell you why I'm here in North Carolina. I'm here for one—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—war in Gaza. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. I'm here in North Carolina for one reason: Because I intend to win this State in November, and we're going to see that. I think we are. And Roy is right. We win here, we win the election. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for the women of America. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. We're going to stand up for the right to vote. And we're going to stand up for Medicare and Social Security. And we're going to fight for childcare, paid leave, and eldercare. And we're going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs, not just for seniors, but for every single American. We're going to keep protecting the Affordable Care Act, which is why more than 40 million Americans have health insurance today that didn't before. We're going to protect our children and get the weapons of war off our streets. We're going to provide clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, quality education for every child in America. We're going to secure our border and protect legal immigration. And unlike the other guy, we're going to stand up to dictators like Putin, because—America bows to no one—no one—no one ever. Folks—and we're going to keep dealing with the climate crisis. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Look, and more than—and more than anything, we're going to preserve, protect, and defend our democracy. Because more than anything else, that is what is at stake in America this election—your freedom, your democracy. America itself is at stake. Now, folks, I don't know what you did last night, but I spent 90 stages—90 minutes on a stage debating the guy who has the morals of an alley cat. [Laughter] Did you see Trump last night? My guess he set—and I mean this sincerely—a new record for the most lies told in a single debate. He lied about the great economy he created. He lied about the pandemic he botched, killing millions of people. He closed businesses. He closed schools. Losing their homes—people all over this country. America was flat on its back. So I told Trump that he was just one of two Presidents in American history who left office with fewer jobs than he started. Herbert Hoover was the other one. [Laughter] That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. And then he lied about how great he was for veterans. Audience members. Boo! The President. But then I told him how he had called a veteran who had given their lives in the country in World War I—he refused to go to the gravesites—he called them ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Audience members. Boo! The President. He tried to deny it. But let me ask you, are you going to believe a four-star Marine general, his own former Chief of Staff, John Kelly, who said he said that or the disgraced, defeated, and lying Donald Trump? My son was one of those people—not in World War I, but in the—— Folks, look, how about the fact that 44—— Audience member. [Inaudible] Audience members. Four more years! Four more year! Four more years! The President. How about the fact—— Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. That's okay. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. How about the fact that 40 out of his 44 top advisers, including the Vice President, aren't supporting him this time around? The people who know him best—40 of them said, ""I will not support the man I worked for this time around."" It tells you a lot about—the person who knows him. Look, he lied about how great he was on crime. I had to remind him that he oversaw a record increase of murder rates in 2020. And, on my watch, violent crime has hit a 50-year low. There's more to do, but it's a 50-year low. And then, I pointed out that the only convicted criminal on the stage last night was Donald Trump. When I've thought about his 34 felony convictions, his sexual assault on a woman in a public place, his being fined $400 million for business fraud, I thought to myself, ""Donald Trump isn't just a convicted felon. Donald Trump is a one-man crime wave."" And he's got more trials—he's got more trials coming up. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. Well, the time for that—[laughter]. Audience members. Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! The President. Look, the thing that bothers me maybe most about him: He has no respect for women or the law. He doesn't. And then, his biggest lie. He lied about how he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January the 6th. Audience members. Boo! The President. We all saw with our own eyes. We watched it on television. We saw thousands of insurrectionists attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Speaker Pelosi, gallows literally set up for Mike Pence. And then, he told them as he sat in the dining room—the one dining—the private dining one door off my Oval Office. He sat there for 3 hours watching the TV. He did not a single thing to stop it—nothing, nothing at all. And now—— Audience members. Boo! The President. And now, he wants to pardon all those convicted criminals. Audience members. Boo! The President. But, folks, for all his lies, we did learn some—we learned some important truths about Donald Trump last night. We learned he's still proud of being the person who killed Roe v. Wade. We learned—— Audience members. Boo! The President. No. We learned he's still proud about the pain and cruelty he's inflicted on America's women. Audience members. Boo! The President. We learned he still believes that politicians, not doctors and women, should make decisions about a woman's health. Audience members. Boo! The President. We learned that if he's elected again and the MAGA Republicans pass a national ban on abortion, he will sign it. Audience members. Boo! The President. Donald Trump says he thinks Roe v.—overturning Roe v. Wade was a beautiful thing. Audience members. Boo! The President. I think it was a nightmare. No, I really mean it. A nightmare. And I made it clear again last night that if you elect me and Kamala and you give us a Democratic Congress, we will make Roe v. Wade the law of the land again. He continued to lie.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Wisconsin—Wisconsin, Wisconsin! And I've got to thank somebody. Gaylord Nelson, I'm back. He first introduced me to Wisconsin a long time ago when I was a kid. I'm only 40 now, but I was a kid back then. Sabrina, thank you for the introduction—for the introduction and for the—volunteering for our campaign. And a special thanks to one of the best Governors that I've ever worked with in my life, Tony Evers. We've got a former Governor, Jim Doyle—[inaudible]. Madison—Rhodes—[applause]—the mayor, the mayor of this city. Look, we've got a guy who has a tough time winning elections. He only gets 70 percent of the vote. Congressman Mark Pocan. There he is. There's so many local leaders here today, including the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, Ben Wikler. Ben, where are you? [Applause] Hello, Ben. Folks, did you have a good Fourth of July? By the way, if you wondered whether Trump has it all together, did you ever hear how he explained the Fourth of July when he was President? No, I'm serious. This is true. His explanation of how America won the Revolutionary War. I'm not making this up. He said in his Fourth of July speech 5 years ago—he said George Washington's army won the Revolution by taking control the airports from the British. [Laughter] [At this point, the President made the sign of the cross.] They talk about me misspeaking. [Laughter] Airports and the British in 1776? [Laughter] It's true. He is a stable genius, this man. [Laughter] My friends, I'm in Wisconsin for one reason: because we're going to win Wisconsin again. [Applause] We're going to win it. And let me tell you how we're going to do it. You know the reason. We're going to do it because of you all in this room, to start with. Well, we're going to stand up for women in America. We're going to restore Roe v. Wade to the law of the land. We're going to stand up for the right to vote again. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security and childcare, eldercare, paid leave. All which grows economies. We're going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs and expand health care for everyone, not just—[applause]. Look, we're going to protect our children from—getting weapons of war off our streets. That's what we're going to do. The idea that more children die from gunshot wounds in America is so wrong. It's sick. It really is sick. We're going to keep confronting climate change. And more—[applause]. And most important, we're going to save our democracy. Now—[applause]. Now, you probably heard, we had a little debate last week. I can't say it was my best performance. Audience member. We love you, Joe! Audience member. That's okay, that's okay. The President. But ever since then, there's been a lot of speculation. ""What's Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race?"" Audience members. Yeah! The President. ""Is he going to drop out? What's he going to do?"" Well, here's my answer: I am running and going to win again. [Applause] Because—because—— Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. We're going to go. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Folks, I'm the sitting President of the United States of America in no small part because of you. Not—that's not a joke. In 2020, you came through for me. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party. I'm the nominee of this party because millions of Democrats like you just voted for me in primaries all across America. And you voted for me to be your nominee. No one else. You, the votes—the voters did that. And despite—despite—that some folks don't seem to care who you voted for—well, guess what? They're trying to push me out of the race. Audience member. No! The President. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm staying in the race. I'll beat Donald Trump. I will beat him again in 2020 [2024; White House correction]. Audience members. Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! Let's go, Joe! The President. Well, by the way, we're going to do it again in 2024. I learned long ago: When you get knocked down, you get back up. Audience members. Get back up! Get back up! Get back up! The President. And I'm let—I'm not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out 3½ years of work. As the Governor said, I've led this Nation from the depths of pandemic—from the depths of a pandemic to the strongest economy in the world. And that's literally true. And I and you are not finished yet. Now you probably also noticed a lot of discussion about my age. I know I look 40. [Laughter] I keep seeing all those stories about I'm being too old. Let me say something—— Audience members. Wisdom! Wisdom! The President. ——I was too old—I wasn't too old to—— Audience member. Experience! The President. I wasn't too old to create over 15 million new jobs; to make sure 21 million Americans are insured under the Affordable Care Act; to beat Big Pharma—the first one ever to do that—and lower the cost of insulin to $35 for seniors. Was I too old to relieve student debt for nearly 5 million Americans and grow the economy? Too old to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America? To sign the Respect for Marriage Act? Was I too old to sign the most significant gun safety law in 30 years? To pass the biggest climate bill in the history of the world—not here, in the history of the world? But then, my critics say: ""Sure, but—you did all that. But that was in the past. What about now?"" Well, how about the 200,000 jobs we announced yesterday? So let me ask you: What do you think? Do you think I'm too old to restore Roe v. Wade to the law of the land? Audience members. No! The President. Do you think I'm too old to ban assault weapons again? Audience members. No! The President. To protect Social Security and Medicare? Audience members. No! The President. To get childcare, eldercare for working families who needed it—nation? Audience members. No! The President. To make billionaires finally start to pay something beyond 8.2 percent of the tax rate? Audience members. No! The President. Let me ask you: Do you think I'm too old to beat Donald Trump? Audience members. No! The President. I can hardly wait. Anyway. [Laughter] Folks, let's focus on what really matters. We're running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat—no, really—the biggest liar and the biggest threat to our democracy in American history. That's not hyperbole. Audience member. Preach, brother! The President. Over 150 Presidential historians voted him the worst President in American history. No, the worst. As I've said before, he has the morals of an alley cat. [Laughter] He lies about the economy he created. The truth: He's one of only two American Presidents who left office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. You know who the other one was? Herbert Hoover. Audience members. Boo! The President. Fact. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. [Laughter] He lies about the pandemic he totally botched. The truth is over a million people went on to die. He told us what? To inject bleach in our arm. It wasn't serious. He lied about how great he was for veterans in his administration. The truth: He called veterans who gave their lives serving America—and I was just in Normandy, on the beaches of Normandy, and all through that area. And he said—I have trouble saying this because my son died as a consequence of Iraq. They gave their lives, and he called them, quote, ""suckers"" and ""losers."" Audience members. Boo! The President. By the way, I'll be damned—I'm glad I wasn't with him because I'll be damned to let him talk about my son that way. Audience member. That's right! The President. But how do we know he said—how do we know he said this, that I'm not making this up? A four-star Marine general—his own former Chief of Staff—was with him, and he told us that's what he said. But he's not the only former Trump official warning us about how bad Trump is, including the former Secretaries of Defense and even his own Vice President. They refused to endorse him. It says a lot about who Trump is and says a lot about what he isn't. By the way, I couldn't ponder—I guess I shouldn't say it—by the way, I couldn't be prouder to have your support and the support of our great Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. Trump is a convicted felon found guilty—34 felonies—— Audience member. Lock him up! The President. ——trying to hide hush money payments to a porn star. Another jury found Trump sexually assaulted a woman in a public place. And he's been fined $90 million for defaming her—$90 million. [Inaudible]—about 20 times, but I don't know. This so-called great businessman owes over $400 million in fines after being convicted in New York State of business fraud—already convicted. Fined $400 million. Donald Trump isn't just a convicted criminal, he's a one-man crime wave. But Trump's biggest lie of all is that he had nothing to do with the insurrection of January 6. We all saw it with our own eyes. We saw when he sent thousands to attack the Capitol. We saw police being attacked, the Capitol being ransacked, the mob hunting for Nancy Pelosi, gallows set up to hang Mike Pence. Let me ask you something.

And what's worse, the Supreme Court has just ruled that there are virtually no limits on the power of the Presidency. I know it sounds bizarre, but that's what they ruled. A frightening decision. According to an extreme majority of the Supreme Court, a President is now above the law. We just celebrated the Fourth of July saying we will not be ruled by a king. And this Supreme Court he appointed approved this new law. Audience member. Expand the Court! The President. It's a dangerous precedent, especially if Donald Trump is returned to the Presidency. Just think about it. The second term—this next term, whomever is the President is going to appoint at least two new appointees. A second Trump term, where there are no limits. Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor warned us about that in her dissent in that case. Here's what she said. She noted that based on the majority's decision, Trump can take out his opponents—I mean physically take them out; take bribes; lead a coup; and be immune to ever being held accountable for it if he did it while he was President, according to the Supreme Court. Audience members. Boo! The President. I mean, where the hell are we? So he really could become a dictator that he promised to be on day one. Audience member. Not on our watch. The President. For over two centuries, America has been a free, democratic nation. And I'll be damned if in the year 2024, just 2 years before our 250th anniversary as a nation, I'll let Donald Trump take this away. Folks, this is not hyperbole. This race is about our freedom. It's about our democracy. It's about the very soul of America. Audience members. Yes! The President. Are we prepared to fight for that? Audience members. Yes! The President. I know I am, and I will. And, folks, I have never been more optimistic about America's future, because the American people are decent, good, honorable. We just have to remember who in God's name we are. We're the United States of America. I mean it. Think about it. Think about it in literal terms. And there's nothing—nothing—beyond our capacity when we stand together. So let's stand together, win this election, and exile Donald Trump politically. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. I'm going to come to the overflow room. [The President left the podium and greeted audience members. He then spoke as follows.] Thank you. I won't forget this. God love you.","['hello', 'wisconsin', 'audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'audience', 'members', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'lets', 'joe', 'hello', 'wisconsin',

No, no—I was born and mostly raised in——"", '[At this point, the President briefly imitated a regional accent.]', 'Scranton—as we say in Scranton. And I married a Philly girl, Jilly from Philly.', 'But I tell you what, once—after our—I went to a local parade—a little parade in little place called Hockessin, Delaware, a little—right on the Pennsylvania border—after our son had passed. And I was sitting at home thinking he—it was his favorite parade. So I decided just to go into it.', 'And I was walking along in this small community, and three guys—four guys about your size came running up to me. I thought the Secret Service was going to kill them. And they came running up—swear to God, a true story—they said: ""Joe, what\'s all this damn stuff about Pennsylvania? You\'re from Delaware."" [Laughter] ""You\'re from Delaware."" Yes, but it never gets—it never leaves you. It never—anyway, thank you, thank you.', 'Look, folks, I make no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history.

I'm not going to make a campaign speech now, but just to say two things."", ""One: One of the things we're going to change in the second term is, we're going to have a fairer tax system. We got it a little fairer. We made those 55 companies that didn't pay a penny in taxes and made $40 billion—we made them pay, but it's only 23 percent, so they're not paying—or 15 percent.

Yes, but it never gets—it never leaves you. It never—anyway, thank you, thank you. Look, folks, I make no apologies for being the most pro-union President in American history. No, I mean it. You know, after we—anyway, you know, I've—you've heard me say it before, but I'll say it again and again and again: The middle class built this country, not Wall Street. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. And I know how to say ""union."" It's amazing how a lot of people talk about ""labor""—unions. Unions. AFSCME have been with me my entire career, and I've been with you my entire career. And by the way, I know there's a lot—you know, we have a lot to talk about. I'm not going to make a campaign speech now, but just to say two things. One: One of the things we're going to change in the second term is, we're going to have a fairer tax system. We got it a little fairer. We made those 55 companies that didn't pay a penny in taxes and made $40 billion—we made them pay, but it's only 23 percent, so they're not paying—or 15 percent. They're not paying enough. You've got—out there—literally, you've got a thousand billionaires in America—up to a thousand billionaires. You know what their average tax rate is? Eight-point-three percent. Audience members. Boo! The President. Well, I'll—no, what—but here's the point I want to make to you all. This is very serious. I'm not joking about this one. The fact of the matter is, Trump wants to give another—and he has said it—a $5 trillion tax cut over the next 5 years. Audience members. Boo! The President. No, I'm not joking. You know what we're going to do? We're going to stop it, and we're going to spend that money on childcare. We're spending that money—[applause]. No, I mean it. We're spending that money on eldercare. We're going to—look, folks, all of those things that people gave me credit for—or the critics said ""Biden is just a big spender"" and—first of all, we ended with actually a little bit of a surplus. But guess what? That other guy had the largest deficit any President ever had in history. But here's the deal. I asked the—I asked the Treasury Department to do a study: Was all my pro-union stuff and organizing and marching and being on picket lines with you all—is that good or bad for the economy? When unions do well, the entire economy and everybody's—nonunion does better—everybody. So I really mean it. I came to thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We're the most powerful country in the world. We have the best economy in the world. But now we've got to make sure that we start taking care of the families like Jill and I grew up. Jill is from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania; I'm from Wilmington area. And I tell you what, we lived in three—she lived in a—she had five sisters in a four-bedroom, split-level house. I was—I had four kids in my family in a three-bedroom house with a grandpop living with us—small house. I wonder—I've wondered how my mom and dad did it, now looking at it. But the point is, you know, at the end of the month, my dad used to say: ""Joey, a paycheck's about a lot—worth a lot more than the amount of money. I—it's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about whether you have any—you're able to look your kid in the eye at the end of the month and say, 'Honey, we're going to be okay. We're'—and mean it."" Folks, there's a lot of people still struggling, because since the—since we ended the pandemic—well, I'll be very blunt: Since I ended the pandemic—he didn't—[applause]—corporate profits have doubled—doubled. And we've got to do something about it. And one of the things—you know, when we did—when I first—the first bill that I got passed, and they—we—I didn't have a Congress to continue it—I made sure that we had payments for childcare, per child. And guess what? Based on income. And guess what? We cut child poverty in half—in half—[applause]—and the economy grew. When we have childcare, guess what? Mom or Dad can go to work and earn money. It grows the economy. This isn't a waste of money. It's growing the economy. Well, I'm getting too wrapped up here. Anyway—[laughter]—there's a lot we can do. I go all the way back to McEntee when I—since I was—oh, you think I'm kidding? I'm not. [Laughter] I got elected in large part because of AFSCME in my home State—in the home State of Delaware. So we've got a lot to do, folks, but we can do it. We're on the cusp of getting so much done. I really mean it. And with your help—I know we have your help. With my help, helping—us working together, we're going to get a hell of a lot done for the American people. And we're going to make sure these things are—so, anyway, I guess—if I stand here long enough, all those folks in the back are going to die of sunstroke. [Laughter] Well, I'm not going to do that. Anyway, I tell you what, I've got a young guy with me who is—if you're ever in a foxhole, you want him with you: Senator Fetterman. Senator John K. Fetterman. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say: How many union members here? The sacred—sacred—union way of life. There's one President that's going to protect that, and he's stood up for it every time, right there. And now, look at the size of this crowd. Look at the size of this crowd. That's not some kind of narrative that you not see enough of that. And now I'm about to point to the only person that's ever kicked Trump's ass in an election right now. [Sen. Fetterman gestured toward the President.] I hope the media is hearing that—remind you of that. Humiliated Trump. Broke him. And he had to lie about it. And his minions had to repeat that. And they all got charged and convicted of that. Fox had to cut a check for $800 million trying to talk about those kinds of lies. I am proud to stand right here next to this President right now. He's my President. He's your President. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Sen. Fetterman. Yes. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Sen. Fetterman. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Yes, let's talk about 4 years ago. We were all—you know, we were hoarding toilet paper. [Laughter] We'd all be on some big Zoom right now, but we're right here right now. Remember what that was like. Let's just—how great was I 2, 4 years ago? You want 4 years—you know, you want 4 more years of that mess and that kind of chaos? Audience members. No! Sen. Fetterman. Now a man is obsessed with revenge. You want that? You know what his plan 2025 is? His plan is retirement. And he's going to put him down, just like he's did it before in 2020, and he's going to do this right now. Joe Biden has held every line—every line—two wars, a pandemic. Look at our economy. All of those experts were going to say, ""It's going to be a recession,"" and ""Oh, no. We don't know."" But it's like, now our economy is the envy of the world right now. A couple days ago, 200,000 new jobs right now. This guy right here. Like I said, I am proud to be here, and I want to thank all of you for showing up. And this is the conversation I'm proud to have between now and November, because that's our guy. And that's the way it's going to stay. The President. Madeleine, you've got—— Representative Madeleine C. Dean. Mr. President. Mr. President, it is so hard to follow you, and then you put me behind Senator Fetterman? [Laughter] Are you kidding me? Hi, everybody. My name is Madeleine Dean. I'm a Member of Congress—[applause]—Member of Congress from the Philly suburbs. I see some of my friends here. I have friends here because I had the honor of serving here for 6½ years in the Pennsylvania House, in the seat, I might remind you, that was Josh Shapiro's. Lucky me. But now I have been 5½ years in Congress. I have had the opportunity, the honor—the historic honor of serving alongside this President for 3½ of those years. What an amazing run. Take a look at what has been accomplished under this President. And I can tell you, close up and personally, the contrast couldn't be greater. I served 2 years before you became President with the former guy. They were very dark days in our country. We cannot go back. It would only be worse. And I always say to people: We have two people who would be the nominees for President. We've seen them both perform as President. One with utter integrity, intellect, experience, wisdom, a heart bigger than all of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And the other, so, so seeded with corruption, self-serving, corrosiveness, criminality—self-serving to the core, doesn't know service at all—he knows only service to himself. So take a look at the records. I know you all know it. But this man knows exactly what he's doing. And we cannot risk going back. I see signs back here about our freedoms, our democracy. Remember, all of the freedoms you're fighting for, that we are fighting for stem from our democracy. I was there on January the 6th. I was taken out in a gas mask. I didn't know where we were going or who would be harmed or killed. I watched as Trump supporters, incited by that President, went to the Capitol and used Trump flags and grotesquely used American flags to beat police officers, to maim them. Five then died. Democracy is on the line. There's no greater patriot than Joe Biden to serve us. Thank you. The President. Now, since I'm in Harrisburg, the location of the Governor, we've got a Lieutenant Governor here. Gov. Lieutenant Governor Austin A. Davis of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. President. Are you all fired up? Are you ready to reelect Joe Biden? Look, I'm going to make it real clear and simple. There's so many young people that I see in the audience here today. And before we came out, I was telling the President, about 10 months ago, I was honored to become a dad for the first time. Look, that's what this election is about. This election is about making sure we have a President who cares about each and every one of us, making sure that we have a President who believes in the promise of America, and making sure that we have a President who will always stand up for our fundamental rights and our fundamental freedoms. I want my daughter to have the same rights that her mother came into the world with and have the same ability to live the American dream. I trust Joe Biden with my daughter's future. So what we need to do as Democrats, we need to not worry; we need to work. It's time for us to get on the doors. And you know what's going to happen if we do that? We're going to win. We're going to reelect Joe Biden. We're going to send Patty Kim to the State Senate. We're going to expand a Democratic majority in the statehouse. And we're going to deliver for working class people. The President. Thank you, thank you. Folks, with your permission, I'm going to find out whether you have any ice cream. [Laughter] You know, isn't it really dull when you have a President who is known for two things: Ray-Ban sunglasses and chocolate chip ice cream? [Laughter] But look, folks, I want to say hi to all of you. We're not going to make this any more formal than we already have. We're going to put the mike down, unless one of you steal it and want to make speech. And with that, why don't we get something to eat. Okay? Thank you.","Felicia Spriggs-Wilkerson. My name is Felicia Spriggs-Wilkerson. I am the president of AFSCME's Local 3130, as well as the District Council 90 Advisory Board for AFSCME. It is my honor and my privilege to ask you all to help me welcome the President of the United States, President Joe Biden. The President. My name is Joe Biden. I'm Jill Biden's husband. [Laughter] And I feel like—every time I come back to Pennsylvania, I feel like I'm coming home. No, no—I was born and mostly raised in—— [At this point, the President briefly imitated a regional accent.] Scranton—as we say in Scranton. And I married a Philly girl, Jilly from Philly. But I tell you what, once—after our—I went to a local parade—a little parade in little place called Hockessin, Delaware, a little—right on the Pennsylvania border—after our son had passed. And I was sitting at home thinking he—it was his favorite parade. So I decided just to go into it. And I was walking along in this small community, and three guys—four guys about your size came running up to me. I thought the Secret Service was going to kill them.

And so I'm counting on you. I'm heading from here to Harrisburg. By the way, no one has ever had as much organized labor support as I have. I'm going— [applause]—and they're full-bore in: operating engineers. [Applause] No, I'm serious. I'm the most pro-union Senator [President; White House correction] in the history of the United States of America. I make no damn apologies for it, because when they do well, everybody does well. But anyway, look, I just want to say thank you, thank you, thank you. It's all about touching people. It's all about talking, all about finding what's on their minds. That's the thing I miss most. I love the Secret Service, by the way. [Laughter] They're great. No, no, no. No, they really are. But I'm not able to do what I used to do. I'd be riding down the street in this—in the vehicle before and see a bunch of kids in the schoolyard waving, I'd stop and get out. Realistically, I can't do that anymore. It's just too dangerous what's going on out there. But the point is, we—I just—the thing I miss most is just looking people in the eye. If you want to know what someone is thinking, you say: ""My name is Joe Biden. What's on your mind, Nicole?"" And by the way—and by the way, you can tell by looking in their eyes. So, folks, let them know we care. You have all the details, all the—and by the way—— Audience member. We need Dark Brandon back. [Laughter] Audience member. He's got his glasses. Audience member. Oh, the glasses! The President. I've got my glasses and—well, I tell you what: Dark Brandon is coming back. He's here. And guess what? The next 120-something days or so, they're going to get a real good look at who Donald Trump is. Anyway, thank you, thank you, thank. Maybe I can just talk to you. Thank you. Audience members. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. By the way, folks, if you're in a—if you're ever in a foxhole, the guy you want next to you is this guy here, John. Senator John K. Fetterman. There is only one person in this room that kicked Trump's ass in an election. There is only one person in this State that has kicked Trump's ass in an election. There is only one person in the country that's ever kicked Trump's ass in an election, and that is your President. That's our President. That's your President. That's my President. Four years ago—4 years ago—we were hoarding toilet paper. We would all be doing this in Zoom right now. You know? Or if it wasn't for Joe Biden, Trump would be at the White House, and he'd be campaigning for his third term. You know, think about that—— Audience member. [Inaudible]—already installed himself there. Sen. Fetterman. Yes. It's just like, Joe Biden has held every line that he needed to do, and he has. I—am—I—you know, I know what it's like to have a rough debate, and I'm standing right here, you know, as your Senator. An amazing President—and I want to just say how I'm so proud I am to stand with the President, and I know all of you is in again. And we already knew this was going to be close. We knew is going to be close in 2016, going to be close in 2020. Twenty twenty-four, nothing has changed other than it's going to be close. And again, I want to remind everybody: There is only one guy that has ever beaten Trump, and he's going to do it twice and put him down for go. The President. And by the way, she may not be as tall. [Laughter] She—she may not be as powerful looking. But she's Irish, and so am I. [Laughter] And she's tough. Madeleine Dean. Representative Madeleine C. Dean. Oh, I am delighted to be here with the President of the United States, Pennsylvania's own Joseph R. Biden. I can't top what our beautiful introduction said, Noëlle—is it Noëlle? Noëlle, I can't top what you said. I really can't top what he said. But what I can tell you is my own experience. I have had the privilege of serving alongside this President for 3½ years. And before you became President, I had the turmoil of serving in Congress with the former guy. We know the contrast. This is not a guessing game. We know there's one man of character, integrity, and accomplishment. And we know there's one man who was a crook, a criminal, corrosive to our democracy. I was there on January 6 and had to be taken out of the Capitol in a gas mask to I don't know where as American citizens, incited by a President, came and attacked the Capitol, using the American flag, beating police officers. Democracy is on the line. There's one man who understands it. It's Joe Biden. The President. God love you. I just wanted to come out and say hi to all of you. Okay? Come on.","['hello', 'hello', 'hello', 'came', '38', 'headquarters', 'everybodys', 'home', 'im', 'scranton', 'coal', 'died', 'moved', 'dad', 'dad', 'moved', 'claymont', 'delaware', 'southern',

We're here to have a rally a little bit later on."", ""But, you know, John and the congresswoman and I got involved for the same reason. I come from a family that -- we weren't poor, but we were just a basic middle-class family, three-bedroom split-level home on a development of 45 homes all the same, and four kids and a grandpop living with us. And we were fine."", 'But my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It\'s about your dignity. It\'s about respect. It\'s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, \'Honey, it\'s going to be okay\' and mean it."" And that\'s what -- that\'s what it\'s all about.', ""You may recall -- and I'm not going to make this long, I promise you -- what -- the reason I decided to run back -- my -- my son died in 2015. He was a Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal, spent a year in Iraq, volunteered to go with his unit when the -- when he went he was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And so, I decided I wasn't going to get engaged in -- in public -- I -- I wasn't going to run again. I had been vice president. I was a professor -- a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time."", ""And what happened was that I -- I was going to stay out of it.

But we were -- but the way things were going, it just -- the -- the way we talk to one another in politics anymore, the way things have become so polarized."", 'And I said the second reason I was running was to deal with the issue of giving the middle class a fighting chance.', ""Like I said earlier, I come from one of those families. We weren't poor, but we weren't -- there was never anything left over at the end of the month. And, you know, the idea that the trickle-down economics -- and I -- I -- look, if you can make a -- go make a million bucks, make a million bucks. If you can make a -- $500 million, make it. Just pay your fair share as you go along. Just pay your taxes.

When I was vice president, I left, and they vote and say nice things about you. Well, one of the things said was that I was able to get more done than anybody in the Senate because I had relations with Democrats and Republicans across the aisle.', 'And -- and so, I said we got to bring the country together.

We\'re the most unique country in the w- -- every other country is organized based on either ethnicity, geography, religion. But we\'re the only country based on an idea -- not a joke, an idea. Only country in history.', ""And the idea was: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. We've never lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it."", 'But what I realized was, the other guy was walking away from it -- walking away from it. And so, we ran, and we were told we were going to lose in 2020. You remember? Well, we won. We were told we were going to have -- (applause) -- because of you. Because of you.', ""And, by the way, we're also -- we were also told that what was going to happen is the -- there -- there was no possibility of being able to get bipartisan legislation passed."", ""You know, remember, Trump used to always talk about all he was going to do in terms of -- of the whole idea of building bridges, roads, internet, and he had -- he had Infrastructure Month every month. He didn't build a thing. (Laughter.)"", ""But look what we're doing. We're rebuil- -- how can you be the most powerful country in the world and have bridges that don't work, highways that don't work, people -- look, the internet is as consequential to most people as the telephone used to be 50 years ago."", 'And so, the point is that we were able to put it together.', ""I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic. We've done -- I'm going to say something that's going to sound awful. The press is here, so I'm gong to say it in front of them. I think most of the political historians say I've gotten more done than most presidents have since Franklin Roosevelt in terms of fundamental changes and -- and, by the way, in the process, all this is going on, we saved money. We lowered the deficit. We gave people more jobs. It didn't do any of the thing -- remember, it was going to be this hard landing and nothing was going to happen? Well, guess what?"", ""I was worried -- today, the Wall Street Journal talks about how -- Wall Street Journal economists think I am better than Trump in terms of the economy. That's worrisome to me."", 'But all kidding aside, think about it. Because when you give people a fighting chance, everybody does better. Not a joke.', ""And the last example I'll give you is I've been fighting for years on -- taking on Big Pharma. I can put you in Air Force One with me as we flew up in, and -- and if you have a prescription by an American drug company, I can fly you to Toronto or to -- to Berlin or to London or to Rome; get you the same exact prescription from the same exact company for somewhere between 40 to 60 percent less."", ""For example, I was able to reduce the price of insulin for people who have serious problems they h- -- need on a regular basis were $400 a month to -- to $35 a month.

It cost them 10 bucks to make it. It cost them 10 bucks to make it."", 'And so, my point is what that did was -- everybody said, ""Biden is, you know, this big liberal,"" or are -- you know, ""This is going to cost us mo-"" -- guess what?

They were being -- they exported those jobs because they got cheaper labor."", 'And we have what they call -- anyway.', 'So, I went to Sou- -- I went to South Korea to get them to come back. And guess what? We got the -- all these companies to come back. Not come back -- reinvest in America.', 'I asked Samsung why are they going to invest $20 billion in Western Pennsylvania.

He said, ""There were very good people on both sides"" -- ""very good people."" And honest to God, that's when I decided to run. That's when I decided to run. And because, folks, there's a lot at stake. And I'll end with this. You know, there's -- probably every five or six generations, we reach an inflection point in history where what happens in the near term is going to determine what the next four or five decades look like. The post-war period is over. If we -- and look around the world. I just got finished having -- you may have seen on television, the -- dealing with NATO and all the foreign heads of state -- 32 of them here for four days. And, you know, ev- -- whether it's climate change, whether it's -- anyway, I won't go th- -- into it all, but -- but there's a lot -- there's a lot changing, not because of Joe Biden being president but just a time of significant movement we're in. And what happens in the next several years is going to determine what the next several decades look like. I mean, for real. Not a joke. We're either going to step up and do something about the environment. We're going to need to make sure that middle-class folks have a fighting chance to make it. We're going to either decide we're going to provide health care for people who need it. We're going to -- we have to -- and I think, when Debbie and I were -- these last three years, I think we've made a lot of progress. We've made a lot of progress. I remember everybody -- Hi, how are you? How old are you? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fourteen. THE PRESIDENT: Remember, no serious guys until you're 30. Okay? (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: All right. THE PRESIDENT: I told that to my daughter and granddaughter. It hadn't worked yet, but I'm working on it. (Laughter.) But, anyway, the -- the whole notion here is that we -- they told us when I ran -- and I'll end this. I ran in 2020 saying I ran for three reasons. And you may remember, I got roundly criticized. One was that I thought it was time to restore some -- some ethics to the politics, to -- you know, to restore the soul of the country. We're a good, decent people. The American people are good, decent, honorable people. But we were -- but the way things were going, it just -- the -- the way we talk to one another in politics anymore, the way things have become so polarized. And I said the second reason I was running was to deal with the issue of giving the middle class a fighting chance. Like I said earlier, I come from one of those families. We weren't poor, but we weren't -- there was never anything left over at the end of the month. And, you know, the idea that the trickle-down economics -- and I -- I -- look, if you can make a -- go make a million bucks, make a million bucks. If you can make a -- $500 million, make it. Just pay your fair share as you go along. Just pay your taxes. Just pay a -- a fair share. And -- (applause) -- and so, I decided I was going to end the trickle-down economics where, you know, if the -- if the wealthy do well, everybody else does well. That -- not a lot trickled down to my dad's kitchen table. And so, I decided we're going to build the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, the wealthy still do very well. I made a commitment that offended a lot of Democrats. I said, ""No -- I will not raise taxes on anybody had -- making less than $400,000."" So, I couldn't be accused of not wanting people to be able to make money. And we have -- and that's what we've done. Not a single penny of taxes have been raised by anybody making under $400,000. But in the meantime, what's happened? We've grown the middle class. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs, 1.6 million -- 1.6 million [16 million] new jobs -- more than any president has in American history in this -- in that period of time. We've moved our -- (applause) -- well, thank you, but we -- well, the other thing we've done is we provided heal- -- health care shouldn't be a -- an option. You know, we -- I was able to change the Affordable Care Act and another 800,000 [8 million] people -- anyway -- access to insurance, access to health care. (Applause.) I won't go into the -- and the last thing I said, which I really got clobbered by the press, as you recall -- and they're good folks; they -- they just thought I was naïve, even though I've been around 270 years. (Laughter.) I said, ""You know, we got to bring the country together."" Because when I left the Senate, I was honored to the vi- -- you know, they do this ceremony. When I was vice president, I left, and they vote and say nice things about you. Well, one of the things said was that I was able to get more done than anybody in the Senate because I had relations with Democrats and Republicans across the aisle. And -- and so, I said we got to bring the country together. They said, ""That's naïve. That used to be the case when Biden was a senator, but he can't do it anymore."" Well, guess what, folks? We're the most diverse country in the world. Not a joke. We're the most unique country in the w- -- every other country is organized based on either ethnicity, geography, religion. But we're the only country based on an idea -- not a joke, an idea. Only country in history. And the idea was: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, et cetera. We've never lived up to it, but we've never fully walked away from it. But what I realized was, the other guy was walking away from it -- walking away from it. And so, we ran, and we were told we were going to lose in 2020. You remember? Well, we won. We were told we were going to have -- (applause) -- because of you. Because of you. And, by the way, we're also -- we were also told that what was going to happen is the -- there -- there was no possibility of being able to get bipartisan legislation passed. You know, remember, Trump used to always talk about all he was going to do in terms of -- of the whole idea of building bridges, roads, internet, and he had -- he had Infrastructure Month every month. He didn't build a thing. (Laughter.) But look what we're doing. We're rebuil- -- how can you be the most powerful country in the world and have bridges that don't work, highways that don't work, people -- look, the internet is as consequential to most people as the telephone used to be 50 years ago. And so, the point is that we were able to put it together. I'm optimistic. I'm optimistic. We've done -- I'm going to say something that's going to sound awful. The press is here, so I'm gong to say it in front of them. I think most of the political historians say I've gotten more done than most presidents have since Franklin Roosevelt in terms of fundamental changes and -- and, by the way, in the process, all this is going on, we saved money. We lowered the deficit. We gave people more jobs. It didn't do any of the thing -- remember, it was going to be this hard landing and nothing was going to happen? Well, guess what? I was worried -- today, the Wall Street Journal talks about how -- Wall Street Journal economists think I am better than Trump in terms of the economy. That's worrisome to me. But all kidding aside, think about it. Because when you give people a fighting chance, everybody does better. Not a joke. And the last example I'll give you is I've been fighting for years on -- taking on Big Pharma. I can put you in Air Force One with me as we flew up in, and -- and if you have a prescription by an American drug company, I can fly you to Toronto or to -- to Berlin or to London or to Rome; get you the same exact prescription from the same exact company for somewhere between 40 to 60 percent less. For example, I was able to reduce the price of insulin for people who have serious problems they h- -- need on a regular basis were $400 a month to -- to $35 a month. I -- (applause) -- but here's the deal. Here's the deal. The reason I was able to do that -- guess what? The fact of the matter is they still make 3 and a -- 350 percent profit. It cost them 10 bucks to make it. It cost them 10 bucks to make it. And so, my point is what that did was -- everybody said, ""Biden is, you know, this big liberal,"" or are -- you know, ""This is going to cost us mo-"" -- guess what? It saved you, the taxpayer, $1.7 billion. And somebody -- (applause) -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm -- no, I'm serious. Because Medicare didn't have to pay these prices; they can negotiate it. My generic point is that all the stuff we've do- -- like, for example, I make no apologies: I'm the most pro-labor president in American history. (Applause.) I mean factually. I know how to say the worl- -- word ""union."" But here's the deal. I had the Treasury Department do a study: With an increase in union membership and the contracts like I -- I know I -- I got a lot of criticism because I walked the picket line with UAW; the only president who's ever done that. Well, guess what? What happened is, I asked them to do a study: What's the impact on the rest of the workers in America? Everybody does better. Everybody -- (applause) -- no, no, I'm serious. Got another $50 billion in investment from chips manufacturers. We invented those chips. In everything from a telephone to a rocket. And guess what? They're all -- they're all somewhere else. They were being -- they exported those jobs because they got cheaper labor. And we have what they call -- anyway. So, I went to Sou- -- I went to South Korea to get them to come back. And guess what? We got the -- all these companies to come back. Not come back -- reinvest in America. I asked Samsung why are they going to invest $20 billion in Western Pennsylvania. And they said, ""Simple reason"" -- that they are. ""One, you have the safest place in the world to invest. And two, you have the best workers in the world."" Everybody thinks, you know, you show up and you want to be an electrician, you say, ""I want to be an electrician."" You go like -- five years apprenticeship. It's like going back to college. My generic point is I'm convinced to give people a chance -- give people a chance. Everybody des- -- no guarantees. Just a chance. And that's what we've done. And we're -- and that's why I'm running again, to finish this job. There's more to do. I know I'm only 41. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT: God love you. You're like my sister. (Laughter.) Anyway. But, folks, this is a -- this an important moment. And I hope you -- I used to -- always when I finished my -- I got elected -- I was, for the longest time, I was too young, because I was the second-youngest man ever elected to the United States Senate. And -- anyway, and now I'm too old. But I know, hopefully, with a little bit of age comes a little bit of wisdom. And I -- hopefully that -- in this -- in this moment, I think the alternative is not much of an alternative. And I do think ethics matter. I do think decency matters. I do think we should reflect what the Ameri- -- we're an optimistic, we're a decent, we're an honorable coumtr- -- country. And I give you my word -- last thing I'll say -- I am -- never been more optimistic about America's possibilities than I am today. Every one of those foreign leaders you saw on television -- the 32 members of NATO -- I'm going to say something outrageous: I'm the guy that pulled NATO together. I'm -- literally, I ex- -- was able to expand it. Every time I leave them, they go, ""You -- you -- you got to win."" (Laughter.) Because the other guy wants to -- says -- anyway. But we have a -- we have real opportunities -- real opportunities. And so, we got to finish the job. And -- and I promise you, I am -- I'm okay. Thank you. (Applause.) I thought I'd walk around the tables and (inaudible). Is that okay? AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yeah!","THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to ruin her reputation, but lately, seriously, when she and I are together, she looks like my wife, Jill. And they go, ""Are you married?"" (Laughter.) And we bo- -- I say, ""Yeah,"" but I don't tell them who. (Laughter.) Anyway. Anyway, thank you, thank you. You all need this like you need another hole in your head on a beautiful day like this -- to come in to say hi, and I can't thank you enough. And you kids who got -- had to get dressed up, I owe you big. (Laughter.) We owe you big. Everybody knows I like kids better than people. (Laughter.) Look, folks, there's a lot going on. We're here to have a rally a little bit later on. But, you know, John and the congresswoman and I got involved for the same reason. I come from a family that -- we weren't poor, but we were just a basic middle-class family, three-bedroom split-level home on a development of 45 homes all the same, and four kids and a grandpop living with us. And we were fine. But my dad used to say, ""Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey, it's going to be okay' and mean it."" And that's what -- that's what it's all about. You may recall -- and I'm not going to make this long, I promise you -- what -- the reason I decided to run back -- my -- my son died in 2015. He was a Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal, spent a year in Iraq, volunteered to go with his unit when the -- when he went he was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. And so, I decided I wasn't going to get engaged in -- in public -- I -- I wasn't going to run again. I had been vice president. I was a professor -- a full professor at the University of Pennsylvania at the time. And what happened was that I -- I was going to stay out of it. But then what happened was, remember down in Charlottesville, Virginia, when those folks came out of the woods carrying torches and Nazi banners and literally singing the same Nazi c- -- anyway, the same songs sung in -- in Germany in the '30s? And a young woman was killed who was a -- a bystander. And that young woman, I met -- I talked to the mother. And the press contacted Trump and asked him -- they said, ""Well, what do you think?""

And because, folks, there's a lot at stake. And I'll end with this. You know, there's -- probably every five or six generations, we reach an inflection point in history where what happens in the near term is going to determine what the next four or five decades look like.

I just got finished having -- you may have seen on television, the -- dealing with NATO and all the foreign heads of state -- 32 of them here for four days.

We're going to make billionaires -- billionaires -- we have a thousand of them in America since the pandemic -- pay a minimum of income -- a minimum tax of 25 percent. You know what -- (applause) -- by the way, do you know what they pay now? A billionaire's federal tax is 8.2 percent."", 'AUDIENCE: Booo --', ""THE PRESIDENT: Not a joke. I'm not making this up."", ""Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse. (Applause.)

Well, I tell you what -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. And I love you back. Look, I wanted to -- I'm not going home unless we get one sign, and that is, ""Motown is Joetown."" And it is. (Applause.) You don't know how true that is. My dad sold automobiles -- got me through high school and college and law school -- and selling automobiles and everything. We always looked to Motown. (Applause.) UAW. (Applause.) By the way, Pastor Rudolph -- you just heard her. She's the AME Church. When I was a -- and, you know, I'm still a young guy. But I was a young fella -- (laughter) -- involved in the Civil Rights Movement in my state, which was segregated by law, I'd always start at Pastor Beaman -- now Bishop Beaman's Church, the AME Church in Wilmington. For real. I'd go to 7:30 mass, and then I'd go to 10 o'clock service, because we'd plan what we were going to do, how to desegregate the restaurants and the streets of our city. And I tell you what, now you know why I spent so much time in the AME church. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Pastor, thanks for that introduction and for your spiritual leadership in the community. And, by the way, we got a great crowd here tonight, to state the obvious. But my -- if I didn't do this, I'd get in trouble with my dad looking down on me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: My dad -- my dad would give me hell if I didn't turn and say, ""Excuse my back. I apologize."" (Laughter and applause.) Look, folks -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: -- members of Congress, Debbie S- -- Debbie -- AUDIENCE: We got your back! We got your back! We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: I've got your back. AUDIENCE: We got your back! We got your back! We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: And I've got -- I got your back as well. Members of Congress, Debbie, Haley, and Sh- -- and (inaudible). By the way, I want you know that I've spent a lot of time with Debbie. She's helped me, like, a lot. And last -- we were -- I forget which event we were at. And someone said, ""You- -- you're his wife, aren't you?"" (Laughter.) Because she looks like Jill, my wife. And, Shri, thank you very much. I want -- I can't tell you -- Look, we got state leaders: the Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, who is here somewhere. (Applause.) He's hard to miss; he's 7 foot 3. Secretary of State Benson. (Applause.) Lavora Barnes, Democratic charman [chair]. (Applause.) We got civil right leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, including SEIU, CWA, AFL-CIO. (Applause.) Thank you all. And, by the way, I don't call it ""labor."" It's -- it's simple: unions. (Applause.) I say the word. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And, folks, look, I'm here for one reason: Kamala and I won Michigan in 2020 because of you, and we're going to win it again in 2024. (Applause.) And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for women in America. (Applause.) We're going to protect contraception. We're going to protect IVF, and we're going to -- going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. (Applause.) I mean it. We're going to protect the right to vote. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security, not cut it like the other guy wants to do. (Applause.) And I'm going -- I promise you I'm going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs in America. (Applause.) We're going to keep expanding health care. (Applause.) No matter how many times Trump and his MAGA Republicans come after the Affordable Care Act, we will stop them and stop them and stop them. (Applause.) I mean it. Too many people are depending on it. We're going to protect our children. We're going to get weapons of war off the street. (Applause.) We're going to ban assault weapons. Folks, look, more children are killed by the -- a bullet than any other reason in America. They die for that -- from more than anything else, any disease, any problem. It's sick. And above all else, we're going to stand up for our Constitution and save our democracy. (Applause.) Folks, you probably noticed, there's been a -- a lot of speculation lately, ""What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?"" Well, here's what I say: I am running, and we're going to win. (Applause.) I'm not going to change that. In fact, just today, the Marist Poll released a national poll that has me beating Trump 50 to 48. (Applause.) I don't know where all this drop-off supposedly took place. There's so much of my narrative -- my campaign is falling apart, they say. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican who has beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again. (Applause.) I know him. Donald Trump is a loser. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE PRESIDENT: Well, folks -- folks, I'm the nominee. I'm the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me in the primaries. You made me the nominee, no one else -- not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors. You, the voters -- you decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere. (Applause.) I learned a long time ago that when you get knocked down, you get back up. (Applause.) I've led this nation from the depths of the pandemic to the strongest economy literally in the world. (Applause.) And we're not done yet. We're not done yet. We have to finish the job and do what -- I'm (inaudible) -- that's how we're going to do. Folks, let me tell you something about Donald Trump and his friends down in Mar-a-Lago. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Wall Street didn't build this country. You did. The working people and the middle class built this country. (Applause.) And unions built the middle class. (Applause.) That's a fact. That's a fact. Folks, I'm proud to say I'm the first and only president in American history to walk a picket line. (Applause.) Because I know labor -- when labor does well, everybody does well. That's not hyperbole. (Applause.) I came to Michigan to walk that picket line. I stood shoulder to shoulder with United Auto Workers, the greatest autoworkers in the world. (Applause.) And I want you to know, I promise you -- I give you my word as a Biden -- I will always have your back and -- because you've always had mine. (Applause.) Remember what Donald Trump did when I was here walking the picket line? He gave a speech at a non-union shop. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: So, when Trump comes here to tell you how great he is for the auto industry, remember this: When Trump was president, we lost 86,000 jobs in union. And I created 275,000 auto jobs in America. (Applause.) In fact, what's been true in the auto industry is true all over America. Since I became president, we've created nearly 16 million new jobs nationwide -- (applause) -- 390,000 of those jobs right here in Michigan. (Applause.) We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, including 24,000 in Michigan. (Applause.) Unemployment is down to 4 percent, record lows for more than two years. Historic-low unemployment for Hispanics, Black, Asian American, including here in Michigan. (Applause.) Look, just yesterday, it was reported, because of my economic plan, inflation is down again -- again. (Applause.) Overall prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in three years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of this year. We got more to do. We're going to keep working to take corporate greed -- take it on. (Applause.) You know, since the pandemic, corporations have doubled their profits. I understand corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. They have more corporations incorporated in my state than every other state in the Union combined. I'm not anti-corporation, but I'm anti-greed. That's what I'm anti. (Applause.) Meanwhile, Donald Trump -- other than riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball -- (laughter) -- he's calling for -- I'm serious, he's calling for -- this is the God's truth -- he's calling for a 10 percent tariff on everything we import, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other necessities. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: And the leading economists in this country tell us that his plan would cost working families $2,500 a year in a new tax. That -- no, that's a -- that's a fact. Not a joke. Folks, the vast majority agree, our economy is moving in the right direction. Jobs are up, wages are up, the economy continues to grow, and inflation is down. And I love telling Trump this, even though I don't own any stock: The stock market is a historic high. It closed at over 40,000, Donald. (Applause.) People are getting a little worried that so many moderate and mainstream Republican -- well, they're not all Republican -- mainstream economists support me. Look, there are more people that have more money in their 401(k)s than they ever did before. But, folks, you don't have to take my word for it. Sixteen Nobel laureates in ec- -- in economics agree: Under my economic plan, you know, they say we're going to continue to grow and keep inflation down. They say that Trump's plan would make -- put the economy in a recession. Because when -- 16 Nobel laureates last week say he would put us in recession and inflation would soar. Folks, look, in fact, I sh- -- I guess I should worry, but the new Wall Street Journal survey of economists says inflation would be worse under Trump. That's the Wall Street Journal. Great paper. They're usually not supportive of me. (Laughter.) Do you really want to go back to the chaos of Donald Trump as president -- AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: -- back when the United States lost 3 million jobs? AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way -- by the way, Donald Trump is the only president in American history other than Herbert Hoover who lost more jobs than he had when he came in. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. (Applause.) Remember the days when people were dying -- literally dying and we were pushing on the COVID effort? Well, guess what? He told us, ""You don't worry about the COVID. It's not that bad. Ju- -- just in blea- -- just inject some"" -- really -- ""inject bleach in your arm."" I think he missed; he hit his head. (Laughter.) Look, remember when Trump was transgressing peaceful protests across the White House lawn who were marching for justice. Look, folks, it just -- it's -- you know, if -- if it wasn't so serious, it would all -- (inaudible) like a made-up novel, what happened. Now, I'm not complaining; I'm just saying. You may have noticed that since the debate, the press -- and they're good guys and women up there -- they've been hammering me. I -- I make a lot of mistakes. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no, I -- I -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay. They -- they've been hammering me because I sometimes confuse names. I say that's Charlie instead of Bill. But guess what? Donald Trump has gotten a free pass. He hadn't done a damn thing until, like, a couple of days ago. He'd been riding around on his golf course -- golf cart in his course, filling out his scorecard before he picks up his club. Rambling about -- think of what he sees -- been talking about. Hannibal Lecter, he says, is a nice guy. (Laughter.) How Trump would rather be electrocuted than eaten by shark. You know, that whole thing? You remember that? Poor Donald. He can't even watch TV this week because it's ""Shark Week."" (Laughter and applause.) And, by the way, on a more serious note, I had 32 members of the -- of the -- and from -- mostly from Europe, but 32 members of NATO in Washington. And, by the way -- and the press has covered this. They give me credit for strengthening NATO, expanding NATO, making it what it is. (Applause.) But, look, this is deadly earnest. When that butcher, Putin, who I know and have known for a long time -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: When he invaded Ukraine, here's what Trump said -- I'm not making this up either. He called him a ""genius"" and said it was ""wonderful."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: What in the hell is going on? But people would rather talk about how I mix up names. I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ""Nancy Pelosi."" (Laughter.) Well, no -- (applause) -- no more. Donald, no more free passes. (Applause.) Today we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We're going to do what the press, so far, hasn't, but I think they're going to soon. We're going to say who he is, what he intends to do. Folks, Donald Trump is a -- Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. (Applause.) He is convicted. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE PRESIDENT: He was convicted by -- he was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felonies for paying hush money to a porn star and hiding it from voters in 2016. Donald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump's brushing it off. Here is what the judge wrote, quote -- the judge in that case wrote, ""Mr. Trump attempt to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous."" ""Mr. Trump 'raped' her"" -- (applause) -- no, let -- let me -- this is the judge's language, not mine -- ""'raped' her, as many people understand the word 'rape.'"" Folks, Donald Trump is a business fraud. (Applause.) He lost his license to do business in New York state -- (applause) -- has been fined over $400 million for giving false information to banks. (Applause.) And he still is facing charges for mishandling classified information, which is a criminal offense. He is still facing charges for his role in January 6th, trying to overthrow the outcome of the 2020 election. He is still facing charges in Georgia for election interference. Remember his phone call? ""I just need 11,780 votes."" Name me another president who has done any of that. Look, if you want to know how bad a businessman Trump really is, just think about this: He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed bankruptcy six times. (Applause.) He even went -- he went bankrupt -- even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was possible. AUDIENCE MEMBER: The house always wins! THE PRESIDENT: Doesn't the house always win in a casino? Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation. (Applause.) He led a violent mob on January 6th to overturn the 2020 election, to hold onto power. That I -- the election that I won by 7 million votes. (Applause.) Folks, and, by the way, he made these claims about stealing an election. Guess what? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! THE PRESIDENT: What happened was -- AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) By the -- by the way, no -- you -- you -- I know. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, hey, what do you say? These babies are dying every day! AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Folks -- folks -- (applause) -- look, give me -- give me one second. Folks, look, I understand her passion. I understand her passion. That's why I put together a detailed plan that the United Nations accepted, that the Israelis accepted, that the Palestinians have accepted to end this war. This war must end. (Applause.) It must end. Well, look, we saw with our own eyes -- we saw how he sent thousands of people to attack the Capitol -- Trump. We saw the police being attacked; the Capitol being ransacked; the mob hunting for the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; gallows set up to hang Vice President Pence. We saw -- we saw it here in Michigan in a stark attack on your state capitol, a horrendous plot to kidnap your governor; protests surround -- protesters surrounding your home -- her home -- the home of your secretary of state for simply doing her job. She is here tonight. Madam secretary, I'm proud of you. Where are you, madam secretary? (Applause.) That's why I bestowed on the secretary the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of the nation's highest honors in defense of democracy. (Applause.) Folks, and now Trump wants to pardon those January 6th insurrectionsts. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: It's outrageous. It's wrong. And I will never let it happen. (Applause.) No president has ever attempted to do what Trump tried to do. No president. But Trump is even more dangerous now. No, I'm serious. He's unhinged. He snapped. And he refuses this time around -- he -- he refuses this time around to say he'll accept the election -- of this election -- the results. Can you imagine that? Look, he says, if he loses, there will be a ""bloodbath"" when he loses. And the United States Supreme Court said there's virtually no limit on the power of a president. Trump said if he wins, he'll be a dictator on day one. He means it, folks. We're not going to let that happen. AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: Over my dead body will it happen. (Applause.) Folks, I don't want to complicate it, but just look at his right-wing Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Oh, but it's really focused on -- you heard about it? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: It's a blueprint for the second Trump term that every American should read and understand. Now, of course, Trump is lying about it now. He said -- tries to distance himself, just like he's trying to distance himself from overturning Roe v. Wade, because he knows how toxic it is. But we're not going to let that happen. And the press -- and the press shouldn't either. Project 2025 is run and paid for by Trump people: his top policy people, his campaign press secretary, his personal bag man in the White House, the biggest funders, and more. It was a project built for Trump. Folks, Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country. And here's the nightmare -- it would un- -- what it would unleash. Trump Project 2025 will criminalize the shipping of abortion medications -- medication anywhere -- anywhere to deny contraceptive covers [coverage], allow a ban nationwide. That's what Project 2024 is -- 2024 is -- -25 is calling about. Project 2025 will deploy the Department of Justice to prosecute Trump's energy -- Trump e- -- Trump's en- -- Trump's enemies, and that's a real deal. Trump's enemies. Trump himself calls his campaign -- the campaign -- this is what he calls it, ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" That's what he said. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, Trump's 2025 Project will eliminate the civil service. No, I'm serious. Not -- not a joke. Read it. And he will let -- and it will allow him to hire tens of thousands of civil servants that are running only because they support Trump. They have to take a loyalty oath to Trump beforehand. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Folks, that's not the United States of America. Trump's 2025 Project will cut Social Security and Medicare, rip away protections for preexisting health conditions. It'll eliminate $35-a-month cap on insulin, allowing drug companies to jack up the prices -- back up to 400 bucks a month; stop Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. And, by the way, I got criticized for taking on Medicare -- I mean, on -- taking on the drug companies and pharma for that. Well -- well it's -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's all right. THE PRESIDENT: Damn right, it's all right. (Laughter.) But, by the way, you know what it did? When I won, it cut the federal budget by $160 billion. (Applause.) Trump's Project 2025 would eliminate the Department -- he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. Not a joke. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: He wants to cut school lunch programs. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: I know this almost sounds like a joke, but it real. He wants to eliminate Head Start for low-income children. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: His project will allow him -- employers to stop paying overtime for hourly workers, but give -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: -- but -- but give the very wealthy another massive tax cut. The tax cut he's proposed is for $5 trillion over the next 10 years. Folks, Project 2025 -- you're going to let him round up over 10 million people in America and put them in detention camps. You heard him say it. You heard him say what he wants to do. That's what he says he is going to do. Ripping them away from their homes, their schools because Trump calls them ""animals"" who ""poison the blood"" of America. Look, folks, there's only one reason only some of Trump's plan of 202- -- it goes on for 900 pages. We've never seen anything like this. And it's not a joke. It's time for us to stop treating politics like entertainment and reality TV. (Applause.) Another four years of Donald Trump is deadly serious -- deadly serious. His proposals are deadly serious. America needs to wake up and realize that Trump and his MAGA Republicans -- what they're trying to do. We're going to join them, we're going to engage them, and we're going to stop them. (Applause.) And, folks, we all know it's not enough just to be against something; we have to be for something. So, I am -- today, I'm going to start by laying out the first 100 days in my second term. (Applause.) And here it is. The first bill I'm going to introduce will restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land. (Applause.) I will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we're not only going to stop Trump and the MAGA Republicans from cutting Social Security and Medicare, we'll expand and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. (Applause.) And here's how we're going to do it. The press always ask, ""How?"" Listen, press. By making the rich pay their fair share of Social Security. (Applause.) And we're going to -- we're going to end medical debt. By that I mean, we've already made sure medical debt can no longer be put on your credit report. (Applause.) We can wipe out it -- medical debt for pennies on the dollar. We're going to raise the federal minimum wage. (Applause.) We're going to pass the PRO Act, ending union busting once and for all. (Applause.) And I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I did it once, and I'm going to do it again. (Applause.) We're going to keep leading the world -- and we are -- on climate and clean energy. (Applause.) When I signed the American Rescue Plan, the law expanded Child Care Tax Credit to cut child poverty in half in America, and it did. (Applause.) Republicans let it expire. I'm going to make the Child Care Tax cut permanent. (Applause.) And, by the way, it increases economic growth; it doesn't increase the deficit. People can work when you have a child. No, I'm serious. That's the deal. We capped the cost of insulin for seniors at 35 bucks -- totaling cost. (Applause.) And no senior, beginning on 2025, is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their prescription drugs -- (applause) -- including cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 year. And my second term, here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to make that same plan available for every single American. (Applause.) Again, saving the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over time. We're going to make housing more affordable. (Applause.) That means taking on corporate greed and getting the rents down. (Applause.) We're going to build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5 percent a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they're doing. (Applause.) We can do this. We're going to end Trump's tax cuts for the very wealthy and the corporations to make the tax code fair. I kept my commitment. I thoug- -- I think a lot of you thought, ""Why is Biden doing what he said?"" Which is, I said, ""No one making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in federal taxes."" I don't know many people making $400,000. In my neighborhood, no one did. But I wanted to be clear that I wasn't going to be taxing anyone who was a working man or even close to it. (Applause.) But here is what we're going to do. We're going to make billionaires -- billionaires -- we have a thousand of them in America since the pandemic -- pay a minimum of income -- a minimum tax of 25 percent. You know what -- (applause) -- by the way, do you know what they pay now? A billionaire's federal tax is 8.2 percent. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Not a joke. I'm not making this up. Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse. (Applause.) It's ridiculous. That one thing alone would generate $500 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, allowing us to do more for childcare, eldercare, bring down the federal deficit, and do so much more. We're going to continue to secure the southern border. Look, after Trump killed the bipartisan effort we put together that a lot of Republicans supported as well, he called -- he got on the phone, and he called all his friends because he said, ""If in fact you vote for it, it -- it's going to be a win for Biden and loss for me, so don't do it."" Well, the Republican Par- -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: I got to have to admit to you, I was a little surprised the Republican Party walked away from it. So, that's when I took executive action. I said -- and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. (Applause.) And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for DREAMers. I made it clear, there are over a half a million spouses in America -- married to Americans -- who don't have a green card after 10 years here. They're now going to get their green card. (Applause.) Folks, the days of tric- -- failed trickle-down economics are over. My first hundred days of a second term is going to continue to be all about working people of this nation. (Applause.) Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil. I don't work for Big Pharma. I don't work for the National Rifle Association. I work for you, the American people. (Applause.) Everyone. Look -- AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: What's America all about? Everyone in America is entitled to a fair shot -- just a fair -- no guarantee, a fair shot. But in America, we're going to leave no one behind and give everybody a fair shot. That's all they are. (Applause.) Folks, let me close with this. I know I look 40 years old -- (laughter) -- but I'm a little bit older. Hopefully, with age comes a little wisdom. (Applause.) And here's what I know: I know how to tell the truth. (Applause.) I know right from wrong. (Applause.) I know how and I've demonstrated how to do this job. And I don- -- I know Americans want a president, not a dictator. (Applause.) And I also know no self-respecting American president would ever, ever, ever be put in -- Putin's puppy like this guy is. That's what he is. You know, Americans want to protect their freedom not give them up. I know what America stands for. We stand for the proposition that all -- all people are created equal and deserve an equal -- (applause) -- no, I mean it. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it though. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump walk this nation from -- away from it. (Applause.) Folks, this race is about your family. It's about your freedom. It's about democracy. Are you with me? (Applause.) Are we going to stop Donald Trump? (Applause.) Let's get this done. (Applause.) And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.) God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.)","THE PRESIDENT: Hello, hello, hello. (Applause.) Well, I tell you what -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. And I love you back. Look, I wanted to -- I'm not going home unless we get one sign, and that is, ""Motown is Joetown."" And it is. (Applause.) You don't know how true that is. My dad sold automobiles -- got me through high school and college and law school -- and selling automobiles and everything. We always looked to Motown. (Applause.) UAW. (Applause.) By the way, Pastor Rudolph -- you just heard her. She's the AME Church. When I was a -- and, you know, I'm still a young guy. But I was a young fella -- (laughter) -- involved in the Civil Rights Movement in my state, which was segregated by law, I'd always start at Pastor Beaman -- now Bishop Beaman's Church, the AME Church in Wilmington. For real. I'd go to 7:30 mass, and then I'd go to 10 o'clock service, because we'd plan what we were going to do, how to desegregate the restaurants and the streets of our city. And I tell you what, now you know why I spent so much time in the AME church. (Laughs.) (Applause.) Pastor, thanks for that introduction and for your spiritual leadership in the community. And, by the way, we got a great crowd here tonight, to state the obvious. But my -- if I didn't do this, I'd get in trouble with my dad looking down on me. AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: My dad -- my dad would give me hell if I didn't turn and say, ""Excuse my back. I apologize."" (Laughter and applause.) Look, folks -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: -- members of Congress, Debbie S- -- Debbie -- AUDIENCE: We got your back! We got your back! We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: I've got your back. AUDIENCE: We got your back! We got your back! We got your back! THE PRESIDENT: And I've got -- I got your back as well. Members of Congress, Debbie, Haley, and Sh- -- and (inaudible). By the way, I want you know that I've spent a lot of time with Debbie. She's helped me, like, a lot. And last -- we were -- I forget which event we were at. And someone said, ""You- -- you're his wife, aren't you?"" (Laughter.) Because she looks like Jill, my wife. And, Shri, thank you very much. I want -- I can't tell you -- Look, we got state leaders: the Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, who is here somewhere. (Applause.) He's hard to miss; he's 7 foot 3. Secretary of State Benson. (Applause.) Lavora Barnes, Democratic charman [chair]. (Applause.) We got civil right leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, including SEIU, CWA, AFL-CIO. (Applause.) Thank you all. And, by the way, I don't call it ""labor."" It's -- it's simple: unions. (Applause.) I say the word. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I really mean it. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And, folks, look, I'm here for one reason: Kamala and I won Michigan in 2020 because of you, and we're going to win it again in 2024. (Applause.) And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to stand up for women in America. (Applause.) We're going to protect contraception. We're going to protect IVF, and we're going to -- going to restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land. (Applause.) I mean it. We're going to protect the right to vote. And we're going to fight for Medicare and Social Security, not cut it like the other guy wants to do. (Applause.) And I'm going -- I promise you I'm going to keep lowering the cost of prescription drugs in America. (Applause.) We're going to keep expanding health care. (Applause.) No matter how many times Trump and his MAGA Republicans come after the Affordable Care Act, we will stop them and stop them and stop them. (Applause.) I mean it. Too many people are depending on it. We're going to protect our children. We're going to get weapons of war off the street. (Applause.) We're going to ban assault weapons. Folks, look, more children are killed by the -- a bullet than any other reason in America. They die for that -- from more than anything else, any disease, any problem. It's sick. And above all else, we're going to stand up for our Constitution and save our democracy. (Applause.) Folks, you probably noticed, there's been a -- a lot of speculation lately, ""What's Joe Biden going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out?"" Well, here's what I say: I am running, and we're going to win. (Applause.) I'm not going to change that. In fact, just today, the Marist Poll released a national poll that has me beating Trump 50 to 48. (Applause.) I don't know where all this drop-off supposedly took place. There's so much of my narrative -- my campaign is falling apart, they say. I'm the nominee of the Democratic Party, the only Democrat or Republican who has beaten Donald Trump ever. And I'm going to beat him again. (Applause.) I know him. Donald Trump is a loser. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE PRESIDENT: Well, folks -- folks, I'm the nominee. I'm the nominee of this party because 14 million Democrats like you voted for me in the primaries. You made me the nominee, no one else -- not the press, not the pundits, not the insiders, not donors. You, the voters -- you decided. No one else. And I'm not going anywhere. (Applause.) I learned a long time ago that when you get knocked down, you get back up. (Applause.) I've led this nation from the depths of the pandemic to the strongest economy literally in the world. (Applause.) And we're not done yet. We're not done yet. We have to finish the job and do what -- I'm (inaudible) -- that's how we're going to do. Folks, let me tell you something about Donald Trump and his friends down in Mar-a-Lago. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Wall Street didn't build this country. You did. The working people and the middle class built this country. (Applause.) And unions built the middle class. (Applause.) That's a fact. That's a fact. Folks, I'm proud to say I'm the first and only president in American history to walk a picket line. (Applause.) Because I know labor -- when labor does well, everybody does well. That's not hyperbole. (Applause.) I came to Michigan to walk that picket line. I stood shoulder to shoulder with United Auto Workers, the greatest autoworkers in the world. (Applause.) And I want you to know, I promise you -- I give you my word as a Biden -- I will always have your back and -- because you've always had mine. (Applause.) Remember what Donald Trump did when I was here walking the picket line? He gave a speech at a non-union shop. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: So, when Trump comes here to tell you how great he is for the auto industry, remember this: When Trump was president, we lost 86,000 jobs in union. And I created 275,000 auto jobs in America. (Applause.) In fact, what's been true in the auto industry is true all over America. Since I became president, we've created nearly 16 million new jobs nationwide -- (applause) -- 390,000 of those jobs right here in Michigan. (Applause.) We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide, including 24,000 in Michigan. (Applause.) Unemployment is down to 4 percent, record lows for more than two years. Historic-low unemployment for Hispanics, Black, Asian American, including here in Michigan. (Applause.) Look, just yesterday, it was reported, because of my economic plan, inflation is down again -- again. (Applause.) Overall prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in three years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of this year. We got more to do. We're going to keep working to take corporate greed -- take it on. (Applause.) You know, since the pandemic, corporations have doubled their profits. I understand corporations. I come from the corporate capital of the world: Delaware. They have more corporations incorporated in my state than every other state in the Union combined. I'm not anti-corporation, but I'm anti-greed. That's what I'm anti. (Applause.) Meanwhile, Donald Trump -- other than riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball -- (laughter) -- he's calling for -- I'm serious, he's calling for -- this is the God's truth -- he's calling for a 10 percent tariff on everything we import, including fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other necessities. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: And the leading economists in this country tell us that his plan would cost working families $2,500 a year in a new tax. That -- no, that's a -- that's a fact. Not a joke. Folks, the vast majority agree, our economy is moving in the right direction. Jobs are up, wages are up, the economy continues to grow, and inflation is down. And I love telling Trump this, even though I don't own any stock: The stock market is a historic high. It closed at over 40,000, Donald. (Applause.) People are getting a little worried that so many moderate and mainstream Republican -- well, they're not all Republican -- mainstream economists support me. Look, there are more people that have more money in their 401(k)s than they ever did before. But, folks, you don't have to take my word for it. Sixteen Nobel laureates in ec- -- in economics agree: Under my economic plan, you know, they say we're going to continue to grow and keep inflation down. They say that Trump's plan would make -- put the economy in a recession. Because when -- 16 Nobel laureates last week say he would put us in recession and inflation would soar. Folks, look, in fact, I sh- -- I guess I should worry, but the new Wall Street Journal survey of economists says inflation would be worse under Trump. That's the Wall Street Journal. Great paper. They're usually not supportive of me. (Laughter.) Do you really want to go back to the chaos of Donald Trump as president -- AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: -- back when the United States lost 3 million jobs? AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: And, by the way -- by the way, Donald Trump is the only president in American history other than Herbert Hoover who lost more jobs than he had when he came in. That's why I call him Donald ""Herbert Hoover"" Trump. (Applause.) Remember the days when people were dying -- literally dying and we were pushing on the COVID effort? Well, guess what? He told us, ""You don't worry about the COVID. It's not that bad. Ju- -- just in blea- -- just inject some"" -- really -- ""inject bleach in your arm."" I think he missed; he hit his head. (Laughter.) Look, remember when Trump was transgressing peaceful protests across the White House lawn who were marching for justice. Look, folks, it just -- it's -- you know, if -- if it wasn't so serious, it would all -- (inaudible) like a made-up novel, what happened. Now, I'm not complaining; I'm just saying. You may have noticed that since the debate, the press -- and they're good guys and women up there -- they've been hammering me. I -- I make a lot of mistakes. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no, I -- I -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: No, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay. They -- they've been hammering me because I sometimes confuse names. I say that's Charlie instead of Bill. But guess what? Donald Trump has gotten a free pass. He hadn't done a damn thing until, like, a couple of days ago. He'd been riding around on his golf course -- golf cart in his course, filling out his scorecard before he picks up his club. Rambling about -- think of what he sees -- been talking about. Hannibal Lecter, he says, is a nice guy. (Laughter.) How Trump would rather be electrocuted than eaten by shark. You know, that whole thing? You remember that? Poor Donald. He can't even watch TV this week because it's ""Shark Week."" (Laughter and applause.) And, by the way, on a more serious note, I had 32 members of the -- of the -- and from -- mostly from Europe, but 32 members of NATO in Washington. And, by the way -- and the press has covered this. They give me credit for strengthening NATO, expanding NATO, making it what it is. (Applause.) But, look, this is deadly earnest. When that butcher, Putin, who I know and have known for a long time -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: When he invaded Ukraine, here's what Trump said -- I'm not making this up either. He called him a ""genius"" and said it was ""wonderful."" AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: What in the hell is going on? But people would rather talk about how I mix up names. I guess they don't remember that Trump called Nikki Haley ""Nancy Pelosi."" (Laughter.) Well, no -- (applause) -- no more. Donald, no more free passes. (Applause.) Today we're going to shine a spotlight on Donald Trump. We're going to do what the press, so far, hasn't, but I think they're going to soon. We're going to say who he is, what he intends to do. Folks, Donald Trump is a -- Donald Trump is a convicted criminal. (Applause.) He is convicted. AUDIENCE: Lock him up! Lock him up! Lock him up! THE PRESIDENT: He was convicted by -- he was convicted by a jury of his peers of 34 felonies for paying hush money to a porn star and hiding it from voters in 2016. Donald Trump was found liable for sexual assault by a judge who told us not to be fooled by Trump's brushing it off. Here is what the judge wrote, quote -- the judge in that case wrote, ""Mr. Trump attempt to minimize sexual abuse finding it frivolous."" ""Mr. Trump 'raped' her"" -- (applause) -- no, let -- let me -- this is the judge's language, not mine -- ""'raped' her, as many people understand the word 'rape.'"" Folks, Donald Trump is a business fraud. (Applause.) He lost his license to do business in New York state -- (applause) -- has been fined over $400 million for giving false information to banks. (Applause.) And he still is facing charges for mishandling classified information, which is a criminal offense. He is still facing charges for his role in January 6th, trying to overthrow the outcome of the 2020 election. He is still facing charges in Georgia for election interference. Remember his phone call? ""I just need 11,780 votes."" Name me another president who has done any of that. Look, if you want to know how bad a businessman Trump really is, just think about this: He inherited millions of dollars only to squander it. He's filed bankruptcy six times. (Applause.) He even went -- he went bankrupt -- even went bankrupt running a casino. I didn't think that was possible. AUDIENCE MEMBER: The house always wins! THE PRESIDENT: Doesn't the house always win in a casino? Most importantly, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, Trump is a threat to this nation. (Applause.) He led a violent mob on January 6th to overturn the 2020 election, to hold onto power. That I -- the election that I won by 7 million votes. (Applause.) Folks, and, by the way, he made these claims about stealing an election. Guess what? AUDIENCE MEMBER: Free, free Palestine! Free, free Palestine! THE PRESIDENT: What happened was -- AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: (Inaudible.) By the -- by the way, no -- you -- you -- I know. AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hey, hey, what do you say? These babies are dying every day! AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: Folks -- folks -- (applause) -- look, give me -- give me one second. Folks, look, I understand her passion. I understand her passion. That's why I put together a detailed plan that the United Nations accepted, that the Israelis accepted, that the Palestinians have accepted to end this war. This war must end. (Applause.) It must end. Well, look, we saw with our own eyes -- we saw how he sent thousands of people to attack the Capitol -- Trump. We saw the police being attacked; the Capitol being ransacked; the mob hunting for the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi; gallows set up to hang Vice President Pence. We saw -- we saw it here in Michigan in a stark attack on your state capitol, a horrendous plot to kidnap your governor; protests surround -- protesters surrounding your home -- her home -- the home of your secretary of state for simply doing her job. She is here tonight. Madam secretary, I'm proud of you. Where are you, madam secretary? (Applause.) That's why I bestowed on the secretary the Presidential Citizens Medal, one of the nation's highest honors in defense of democracy. (Applause.) Folks, and now Trump wants to pardon those January 6th insurrectionsts. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: It's outrageous. It's wrong. And I will never let it happen. (Applause.) No president has ever attempted to do what Trump tried to do. No president. But Trump is even more dangerous now. No, I'm serious. He's unhinged. He snapped. And he refuses this time around -- he -- he refuses this time around to say he'll accept the election -- of this election -- the results. Can you imagine that? Look, he says, if he loses, there will be a ""bloodbath"" when he loses. And the United States Supreme Court said there's virtually no limit on the power of a president. Trump said if he wins, he'll be a dictator on day one. He means it, folks. We're not going to let that happen. AUDIENCE: Nooo -- THE PRESIDENT: Over my dead body will it happen. (Applause.) Folks, I don't want to complicate it, but just look at his right-wing Project 2025. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Oh, but it's really focused on -- you heard about it? AUDIENCE: Yes! THE PRESIDENT: It's a blueprint for the second Trump term that every American should read and understand. Now, of course, Trump is lying about it now. He said -- tries to distance himself, just like he's trying to distance himself from overturning Roe v. Wade, because he knows how toxic it is. But we're not going to let that happen. And the press -- and the press shouldn't either. Project 2025 is run and paid for by Trump people: his top policy people, his campaign press secretary, his personal bag man in the White House, the biggest funders, and more. It was a project built for Trump. Folks, Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed in the history of this country. And here's the nightmare -- it would un- -- what it would unleash. Trump Project 2025 will criminalize the shipping of abortion medications -- medication anywhere -- anywhere to deny contraceptive covers [coverage], allow a ban nationwide. That's what Project 2024 is -- 2024 is -- -25 is calling about. Project 2025 will deploy the Department of Justice to prosecute Trump's energy -- Trump e- -- Trump's en- -- Trump's enemies, and that's a real deal. Trump's enemies. Trump himself calls his campaign -- the campaign -- this is what he calls it, ""revenge"" and ""retribution."" That's what he said. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, Trump's 2025 Project will eliminate the civil service. No, I'm serious. Not -- not a joke. Read it. And he will let -- and it will allow him to hire tens of thousands of civil servants that are running only because they support Trump. They have to take a loyalty oath to Trump beforehand. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Folks, that's not the United States of America. Trump's 2025 Project will cut Social Security and Medicare, rip away protections for preexisting health conditions. It'll eliminate $35-a-month cap on insulin, allowing drug companies to jack up the prices -- back up to 400 bucks a month; stop Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices. And, by the way, I got criticized for taking on Medicare -- I mean, on -- taking on the drug companies and pharma for that. Well -- well it's -- AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's all right. THE PRESIDENT: Damn right, it's all right. (Laughter.) But, by the way, you know what it did? When I won, it cut the federal budget by $160 billion. (Applause.) Trump's Project 2025 would eliminate the Department -- he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. Not a joke. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: He wants to cut school lunch programs. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: I know this almost sounds like a joke, but it real. He wants to eliminate Head Start for low-income children. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: His project will allow him -- employers to stop paying overtime for hourly workers, but give -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: -- but -- but give the very wealthy another massive tax cut. The tax cut he's proposed is for $5 trillion over the next 10 years. Folks, Project 2025 -- you're going to let him round up over 10 million people in America and put them in detention camps. You heard him say it. You heard him say what he wants to do. That's what he says he is going to do. Ripping them away from their homes, their schools because Trump calls them ""animals"" who ""poison the blood"" of America. Look, folks, there's only one reason only some of Trump's plan of 202- -- it goes on for 900 pages. We've never seen anything like this. And it's not a joke. It's time for us to stop treating politics like entertainment and reality TV. (Applause.) Another four years of Donald Trump is deadly serious -- deadly serious. His proposals are deadly serious. America needs to wake up and realize that Trump and his MAGA Republicans -- what they're trying to do. We're going to join them, we're going to engage them, and we're going to stop them. (Applause.) And, folks, we all know it's not enough just to be against something; we have to be for something. So, I am -- today, I'm going to start by laying out the first 100 days in my second term. (Applause.) And here it is. The first bill I'm going to introduce will restore Roe v. Wade to make it the law of the land. (Applause.) I will sign the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. (Applause.) And we're not only going to stop Trump and the MAGA Republicans from cutting Social Security and Medicare, we'll expand and strengthen Social Security and Medicare. (Applause.) And here's how we're going to do it. The press always ask, ""How?"" Listen, press. By making the rich pay their fair share of Social Security. (Applause.) And we're going to -- we're going to end medical debt. By that I mean, we've already made sure medical debt can no longer be put on your credit report. (Applause.) We can wipe out it -- medical debt for pennies on the dollar. We're going to raise the federal minimum wage. (Applause.) We're going to pass the PRO Act, ending union busting once and for all. (Applause.) And I'm going to ban assault weapons again. I did it once, and I'm going to do it again. (Applause.) We're going to keep leading the world -- and we are -- on climate and clean energy. (Applause.) When I signed the American Rescue Plan, the law expanded Child Care Tax Credit to cut child poverty in half in America, and it did. (Applause.) Republicans let it expire. I'm going to make the Child Care Tax cut permanent. (Applause.) And, by the way, it increases economic growth; it doesn't increase the deficit. People can work when you have a child. No, I'm serious. That's the deal. We capped the cost of insulin for seniors at 35 bucks -- totaling cost. (Applause.) And no senior, beginning on 2025, is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year for all their prescription drugs -- (applause) -- including cancer drugs that are $10-, $12-, $14,000 year. And my second term, here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to make that same plan available for every single American. (Applause.) Again, saving the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over time. We're going to make housing more affordable. (Applause.) That means taking on corporate greed and getting the rents down. (Applause.) We're going to build 2 million housing units and cap rent increases at 5 percent a year so corporate landlords can no longer gouge everyone like they're doing. (Applause.) We can do this. We're going to end Trump's tax cuts for the very wealthy and the corporations to make the tax code fair. I kept my commitment. I thoug- -- I think a lot of you thought, ""Why is Biden doing what he said?"" Which is, I said, ""No one making less than $400,000 will pay a penny more in federal taxes."" I don't know many people making $400,000. In my neighborhood, no one did. But I wanted to be clear that I wasn't going to be taxing anyone who was a working man or even close to it. (Applause.) But here is what we're going to do. We're going to make billionaires -- billionaires -- we have a thousand of them in America since the pandemic -- pay a minimum of income -- a minimum tax of 25 percent. You know what -- (applause) -- by the way, do you know what they pay now? A billionaire's federal tax is 8.2 percent. AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: Not a joke. I'm not making this up. Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, or a nurse. (Applause.) It's ridiculous. That one thing alone would generate $500 billion in revenue over the next 10 years, allowing us to do more for childcare, eldercare, bring down the federal deficit, and do so much more. We're going to continue to secure the southern border. Look, after Trump killed the bipartisan effort we put together that a lot of Republicans supported as well, he called -- he got on the phone, and he called all his friends because he said, ""If in fact you vote for it, it -- it's going to be a win for Biden and loss for me, so don't do it."" Well, the Republican Par- -- AUDIENCE: Booo -- THE PRESIDENT: I got to have to admit to you, I was a little surprised the Republican Party walked away from it. So, that's when I took executive action. I said -- and since I did the border, encounters have gone down over 50 percent. (Applause.) And we're going to keep it going down, fixing our legal immigration and creating pathways for citizenship for DREAMers. I made it clear, there are over a half a million spouses in America -- married to Americans -- who don't have a green card after 10 years here. They're now going to get their green card. (Applause.) Folks, the days of tric- -- failed trickle-down economics are over. My first hundred days of a second term is going to continue to be all about working people of this nation. (Applause.) Unlike Donald Trump, I don't work for Big Oil. I don't work for Big Pharma. I don't work for the National Rifle Association. I work for you, the American people. (Applause.) Everyone. Look -- AUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: What's America all about? Everyone in America is entitled to a fair shot -- just a fair -- no guarantee, a fair shot. But in America, we're going to leave no one behind and give everybody a fair shot. That's all they are. (Applause.) Folks, let me close with this. I know I look 40 years old -- (laughter) -- but I'm a little bit older. Hopefully, with age comes a little wisdom. (Applause.) And here's what I know: I know how to tell the truth. (Applause.) I know right from wrong. (Applause.) I know how and I've demonstrated how to do this job. And I don- -- I know Americans want a president, not a dictator. (Applause.) And I also know no self-respecting American president would ever, ever, ever be put in -- Putin's puppy like this guy is. That's what he is. You know, Americans want to protect their freedom not give them up. I know what America stands for. We stand for the proposition that all -- all people are created equal and deserve an equal -- (applause) -- no, I mean it. We've never fully lived up to it, but we've never walked away from it though. And I'll be damned if I'm going to let Donald Trump walk this nation from -- away from it. (Applause.) Folks, this race is about your family. It's about your freedom. It's about democracy. Are you with me? (Applause.) Are we going to stop Donald Trump? (Applause.) Let's get this done. (Applause.) And let's remember who we are. We are the United States of America and there's nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together. (Applause.) God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Other countries were copying us.', 'We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn’t end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished – so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good.', 'But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country.', 'But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they’re bounced back from the COVID.', 'He has not done a good job. He’s done a poor job. And inflation’s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us.', 'Am I allowed to respond to him?', 'Not going to drive them higher. It’s just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China – it’s going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things.', 'But he – he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That’s why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he’s taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can’t do that.', 'He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn’t know what they were doing. And they don’t know what they were doing. It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There’s never been.', 'And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country’s life.', 'Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we’ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred.', 'Now, when we cut the taxes – as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country.', 'The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We – we gave him something great.', 'Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration.', 'He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job.', 'And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore.', 'We’re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he’s done, we’ve become like a Third World nation. And it’s a shame the damage he’s done to our country.', 'And I’d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country.', 'Well, he’s right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he’s destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they’re putting them on Medicare, they’re putting them on Social Security. They’re going to destroy Social Security.', 'This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they’re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it’s a shame.', 'What’s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries – I’m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We’re no longer respected. They don’t like us. We give them everything they want, and they – they think we’re stupid. They think we’re very stupid people.', 'What we’re doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal.', 'Correct.', 'First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it.', 'And if you look at this whole question that you’re asking, a complex, but not really complex – 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders.', 'And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.', 'Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that.', 'Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they’re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That’s the vote of the people.', 'Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it’s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people – you have to follow your heart. Some people don’t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it’s very important. Some people don’t. Follow your heart.', 'But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected.', 'The problem they have is they’re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth.', 'If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we’ll put the baby aside and we’ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we’ll kill the baby.', 'What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing.', 'There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that’s the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it’s a terrible thing.', 'As far as the abortion’s concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they – it’s, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it’s the opposite.', 'But they’re voting and it’s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn’t, but they would have – everybody want it brought back.', 'Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn’t able to get it.', 'Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it.', 'And again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that’s where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way.', 'So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor – former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it.', 'So he’s in – he’s willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.', 'Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen.', 'Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want.', 'We don’t think that’s a good thing. We think it’s a radical thing.

I don’t think he knows what he said either.', 'Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border – all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it.', 'He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists.

They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they’re pouring in. And this guy just left it open.', 'And he didn’t need legislation because I didn’t have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol – who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won’t say that. But they endorsed me for president.', 'Brandon, just speak to him.', 'But, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There’s never been anything like it.

The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything.', 'He’s the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We – we are living right now in a rat’s nest. They’re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don’t have borders anymore. Every state is now a border.', 'And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime.', 'They’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen before.

What’s taken place in our country, we’re literally an uncivilized country now.', 'He doesn’t want it to be. He just doesn’t know. He opened the borders nobody’s ever seen anything like.

They’re living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they’re dying, because he doesn’t care about our veterans. He doesn’t care.

He’s gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned.', 'We had, by far, the highest, and now it’s down in less than half because he’s done – all these great things that we did – and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy.

They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that’s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We’ve notified them.

There’s nobody that’s taken better care of our soldiers than I have.', 'To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers – we have 19 people that said it was never said by me.

Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn’t. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn’t Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now.', 'First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can’t stand this guy. They can’t stand him. They think he’s the worst commander in chief, if that’s what you call him, that we’ve ever had. They can’t stand him. So let’s get that straight.', 'And they like me more than just about any of them.

You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in.', 'I’ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he’s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals.', 'No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated.

I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never.', 'Just like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything.

No, they’re not acceptable.', 'But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war – he led everybody along. He’s given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He’s given $200 billion. That’s a lot of money. I don’t think there’s ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion.

You wouldn’t – they wouldn’t have any – they were going out of business. We were spending – almost 100 percent of the money was – it was paid by us.', 'He didn’t do that. He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them.', 'As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel’s the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one.

He’s a weak one.', 'I’d have to see.', 'But before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they’re about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were – no cars. No – they don’t want anything that we have. But we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that.', 'But the big thing I changed is they don’t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said – and he’s right about this, I said, no, I’m not going to support NATO if you don’t pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? – at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don’t pay, I won’t do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months.', 'But now, we’re in the same position.

We’re going to make it great again.']",Donald J. Trump,2024,,"We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every – everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn’t end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished – so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good. But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country. But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they’re bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He’s done a poor job. And inflation’s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us. Am I allowed to respond to him? Not going to drive them higher. It’s just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China – it’s going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things. But he – he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That’s why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he’s taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can’t do that. He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn’t know what they were doing. And they don’t know what they were doing. It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There’s never been. And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country’s life. Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we’ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes – as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We – we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore. We’re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he’s done, we’ve become like a Third World nation. And it’s a shame the damage he’s done to our country. And I’d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country. Well, he’s right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he’s destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they’re putting them on Medicare, they’re putting them on Social Security. They’re going to destroy Social Security. This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they’re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it’s a shame. What’s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries – I’m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We’re no longer respected. They don’t like us. We give them everything they want, and they – they think we’re stupid. They think we’re very stupid people. What we’re doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal. Correct. First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it. And if you look at this whole question that you’re asking, a complex, but not really complex – 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders. And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted. Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they’re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That’s the vote of the people. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it’s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people – you have to follow your heart. Some people don’t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it’s very important. Some people don’t. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected. The problem they have is they’re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth. If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we’ll put the baby aside and we’ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we’ll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing. There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that’s the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it’s a terrible thing. As far as the abortion’s concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they – it’s, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it’s the opposite. But they’re voting and it’s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn’t, but they would have – everybody want it brought back. Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn’t able to get it. Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it. And again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that’s where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way. So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor – former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it. So he’s in – he’s willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby. Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen. Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don’t think that’s a good thing. We think it’s a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans. I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border – all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it. He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world – not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they’re pouring in. And this guy just left it open. And he didn’t need legislation because I didn’t have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol – who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won’t say that. But they endorsed me for president. Brandon, just speak to him. But, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There’s never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans. Can I get one second? He said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything. He’s the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We – we are living right now in a rat’s nest. They’re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don’t have borders anymore. Every state is now a border. And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime. They’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen before. And you’re reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old. This is horrible what’s taken place. What’s taken place in our country, we’re literally an uncivilized country now. He doesn’t want it to be. He just doesn’t know. He opened the borders nobody’s ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they’re going to destroy our country. Just take a look at where they’re living. They’re living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they’re dying, because he doesn’t care about our veterans. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t like the military at all. And he doesn’t care about our veterans. Nobody’s been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He’s gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned. We had, by far, the highest, and now it’s down in less than half because he’s done – all these great things that we did – and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing… … all of these people to come in. And it’s a very sad day in America. First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that’s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We’ve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn’t say it. And think of this, who would say – I’m at a cemetery, or I’m talking about our veterans – because nobody’s taken better care – I’m so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There’s nobody that’s taken better care of our soldiers than I have. To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers – we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking. It’s the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn’t. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn’t Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now. First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can’t stand this guy. They can’t stand him. They think he’s the worst commander in chief, if that’s what you call him, that we’ve ever had. They can’t stand him. So let’s get that straight. And they like me more than just about any of them. And that’s based on every single bit of information. As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew – that was respected by Putin, he would have never – he would have never invaded Ukraine. A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in. I’ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he’s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind. When Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we’re going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror. That’s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him. I never said that. No, they’re not acceptable. No, they’re not acceptable. But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war – he led everybody along. He’s given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He’s given $200 billion. That’s a lot of money. I don’t think there’s ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He’s the greatest salesman ever. And I’m not knocking him, I’m not knocking anything. I’m only saying, the money that we’re spending on this war, and we shouldn’t be spending, it should have never happened. I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I’ll have that war settled. People being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I’ll get it settled fast, before I take office. Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn’t he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen. You wouldn’t – they wouldn’t have any – they were going out of business. We were spending – almost 100 percent of the money was – it was paid by us. He didn’t do that. He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them. As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel’s the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job. He doesn’t want to do it. He’s become like a Palestinian. But they don’t like him, because he’s a very bad Palestinian. He’s a weak one. I’d have to see. But before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they’re about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were – no cars. No – they don’t want anything that we have. But we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that. But the big thing I changed is they don’t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said – and he’s right about this, I said, no, I’m not going to support NATO if you don’t pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? – at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don’t pay, I won’t do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we’re in the same position. We’re paying everybody’s bills. Well, I don’t think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world. All over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we’re now laughed at, we’re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States’ reputation under this man’s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I’m sure at some point you’ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can’t beat him fair and square. Well, I didn’t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who’s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she’s saying, oh, no, it’s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of – in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they’re going to be there on January 6th. They’re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There’s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was – I don’t know, you can’t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th. What they’ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you’ve destroyed the lives of so many people. When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities – you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they’ve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed. When you look at all of the – they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately. What he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic. One other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they’d go to jail. Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We’re going to make this country successful again, because right now it’s a failing nation. My retribution’s going to be success. But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted. Going to be convicted probably numerous other times. He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things. But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he’s done. He’s done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we’re going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise, you’re not getting a billion dollars. If I ever said that, that’s quid pro quo. That – we’re not going to do anything, we’re not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son. This man is a criminal. This man – you’re lucky. You’re lucky. I did nothing wrong. We’d have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong. I didn’t have sex with a porn star, number one. Number two, that was a case that was started and moved – they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.’s office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one. We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people. And the – both the civil and the criminal. He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases – because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are. But when he – they – when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you’re reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we’ve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don’t think any campaign has ever taken. Hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it’s a scam and it’s a guy that’s after his political opponent because he can’t win fair and square. Jake, both of you know that story’s been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going. He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn’t run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at – he’s not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it. It’s ridiculous. We have a debate. We’re trying to justify his presidency. His presidency, his – without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn’t be having a debate about it. There’s nothing to debate. He made up the Charlottesville story and you’ll see it’s debunked all over the place. Every anchor has – every reasonable anchor has debunked it. And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It’s a nonsense story. He knows that. And he didn’t run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run. And he caused the inflation. He’s blaming inflation. And he’s right, it’s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it’s killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It’s killing people. They can’t buy groceries anymore. They can’t. You look at the cost of food where it’s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can’t live. They’re not living anymore. He caused this inflation. I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other – all this money that’s being thrown out the window. He caused inflation. As sure as you’re sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he’s allowed to come in through the border. They’re taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They’re taking black jobs and they’re taking Hispanic jobs and you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history. Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can’t, in the 1990s (ph), we can’t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they’ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that’s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they’re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they’re going to take the jobs? And it’s already started. And you haven’t seen anything yet. It’s a disaster. So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually. The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States. And I ended it because I didn’t want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones – it was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster. But, everything that he said just now, I’ll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I’m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we’re destroying our country. They’re taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they’re going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So I’ve dealt with politicians all my life. I’ve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I’ve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies – I’ve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So – and about so many other things, too. And we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned “Russia, Russia, Russia,” “Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.” And everything he does is a lie. It’s misinformation and disinformation. The “losers and suckers” story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It’s a disgrace. But Social Security, he’s destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they’re putting them on to Social Security; they’re putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They’re putting them in our hospitals. They’re taking the place of our citizens. They’re – what they’re doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. And it – it’s really coming back. I’ve never seen such anger in our country before. Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that’s why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn’t say it, and they’re very highly respected, much more so than him. The other thing is, he doesn’t fire people. He never fired people. I’ve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You’d pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn’t put him there. I didn’t put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him. This guy hasn’t fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan – the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn’t fire? Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that’s on the border, that’s allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn’t be a debate. He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he’s the worst president in the history of our country. He’s destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he’s trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out – came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It’s insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don’t think – we just can’t let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn’t have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won’t have a country left anymore. That’s how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far. Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do – they rate him the worst because what he’s done is so bad. And they rate me – yes, I’ll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK. And if I’m given another four years, I will be the best. I think I’ll be the best. Nobody’s ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He’s the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody’s taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before. All my life I’d grow up and I’d see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it. To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He’s a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he’s afraid to deal with him or something. But do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can’t because it’s too much money. It’s tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn’t done that. But he hasn’t cut the tariffs because he can’t, because it’s too much money. But he’s got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he’s got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they’re doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can’t let that happen. You’re destroying our country. Jake, we’re doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody’s ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was – the drugs pouring across the border, we’re – it started to increase. We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That’s the most incredible thing that you’ve ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had – we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers. Then he came along. The numbers – have you seen the numbers now? It’s not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don’t even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of – the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I’ve ever seen at numbers – nobody’s ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far. Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing. It’s just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a – every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he’s over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter. I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time. We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing. Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I’d like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn’t do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I’m in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn’t do it. He can’t hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can’t hit a ball 50 yards. I think I’m a very good shape. I feel that I’m in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I’m probably a little bit lighter. But I’m in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same. But I took – I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn’t do well – I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who’s a great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both – one of them said they’d never seen anybody ace them. (inaudible). (inaudible). That’s the biggest lie that he’s a 6 handicap, of all. Yeah. I’ve seen your swing, I know your swing. (CROSSTALK) Let’s not act like children. Well, I shouldn’t have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It’s totally unacceptable. And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it’s one of the strongest statements you’ve ever seen. In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I’ve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear. But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody. And I’ll tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldn’t be here right now. I’d be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn’t be under indictment because I wouldn’t have been his political appoint – you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent. I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that. I wouldn’t be here. I don’t mind being here, but the only reason I’m here is he’s so bad as a president that I’m going to make America great again. We’re going to make America great again. We’re a failing nation right now. We’re a seriously failing nation. And we’re a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They’re insane. These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we’re closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he’s driving us there. And Kim Jong-Un, and President Xi of China – Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, all of these – Putin – they don’t respect him. They don’t fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he’s going to drive us into World War Three. Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia – they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden. They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing. He knew not to do it. He’s not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games. He took nothing from me, but now, he’s going to take the whole thing from this man right here. That’s a war that should have never started. It would’ve never started ever with me. And he’s going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with – he’s got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine’s not winning that war. He said, I will never settle until such time – they’re running out of people, they’re running out of soldiers, they’ve lost so many people. It’s so sad. They’ve lost so many people and they’ve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions. Russia would’ve never attacked if I were president. If it’s a fair and legal and good election – absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we’ll have a news conference on it in a week or we’ll have another one of these on – in a week. But I will absolutely – there’s nothing I’d rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I’m running again. I wasn’t really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He’s destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent’s stuff, because it’s the only way he thinks he can win. But unfortunately, it’s driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it. We’ll see. Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn’t respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn’t stop – Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn’t do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn’t do it. For three-and-a-half years, we’re living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don’t respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don’t respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re – rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he’s got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he’s putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we’ve done, nobody’s ever – never seen anything like – even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you’re terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They’ve been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they’re living. And that’s why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things – we’re in a failing nation, but it’s not going to be failing anymore. We’re going to make it great again.","We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never done so well. Every – everybody was amazed by it. Other countries were copying us. We got hit with COVID. And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn’t end up in a Great Depression the likes of which we had in 1929. By the time we finished – so we did a great job. We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things. Everything was rocking good. But the thing we never got the credit for, and we should have, is getting us out of that COVID mess. He created mandates; that was a disaster for our country. But other than that, we had – we had given them back a – a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID, and nobody thought that was even possible. The only jobs he created are for illegal immigrants and bounceback jobs; they’re bounced back from the COVID. He has not done a good job. He’s done a poor job. And inflation’s killing our country. It is absolutely killing us. Am I allowed to respond to him? Not going to drive them higher. It’s just going to cause countries that have been ripping us off for years, like China and many others, in all fairness to China – it’s going to just force them to pay us a lot of money, reduce our deficit tremendously, and give us a lot of power for other things. But he – he made a statement. The only thing he was right about is I gave you the largest tax cut in history. I also gave you the largest regulation cut in history. That’s why we had all the jobs. And the jobs went down and then they bounced back and he’s taking credit for bounceback jobs. You can’t do that. He also said he inherited 9 percent inflation. No, he inherited almost no inflation and it stayed that way for 14 months. And then it blew up under his leadership, because they spent money like a bunch of people that didn’t know what they were doing. And they don’t know what they were doing. It was the worst – probably the worst administration in history. There’s never been. And as far as Afghanistan is concerned, I was getting out of Afghanistan, but we were getting out with dignity, with strength, with power. He got out, it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country’s life. Because the tax cuts spurred the greatest economy that we’ve ever seen just prior to COVID, and even after COVID. It was so strong that we were able to get through COVID much better than just about any other country. But we spurred – that tax spurred. Now, when we cut the taxes – as an example, the corporate tax was cut down to 21 percent from 39 percent, plus beyond that – we took in more revenue with much less tax and companies were bringing back trillions of dollars back into our country. The country was going like never before. And we were ready to start paying down debt. We were ready to start using the liquid gold right under our feet, the oil and gas right under our feet. We were going to have something that nobody else has had. We got hit with COVID. We did a lot to fix it. I gave him an unbelievable situation, with all of the therapeutics and all of the things that we came up with. We – we gave him something great. Remember, more people died under his administration, even though we had largely fixed it. More people died under his administration than our administration, and we were right in the middle of it. Something which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, but he had far more people dying in his administration. He did the mandate, which is a disaster. Mandating it. The vaccine went out. He did a mandate on the vaccine, which is the thing that people most objected to about the vaccine. And he did a very poor job, just a very poor job. And I will tell you, not only poor there, but throughout the entire world, we’re no longer respected as a country. They don’t respect our leadership. They don’t respect the United States anymore. We’re like a Third World nation. Between weaponization of his election, trying to go after his political opponent, all of the things he’s done, we’ve become like a Third World nation. And it’s a shame the damage he’s done to our country. And I’d love to ask him, and will, why he allowed millions of people to come in here from prisons, jails and mental institutions to come into our country and destroy our country. Well, he’s right: He did beat Medicaid (ph). He beat it to death. And he’s destroying Medicare, because all of these people are coming in, they’re putting them on Medicare, they’re putting them on Social Security. They’re going to destroy Social Security. This man is going to single-handedly destroy Social Security. These millions and millions of people coming in, they’re trying to put them on Social Security. He will wipe out Social Security. He will wipe out Medicare. So he was right in the way he finished that sentence, and it’s a shame. What’s happened to our country in the last four years is not to be believed. Foreign countries – I’m friends with a lot of people. They cannot believe what happened to the United States of America. We’re no longer respected. They don’t like us. We give them everything they want, and they – they think we’re stupid. They think we’re very stupid people. What we’re doing for other countries, and they do nothing for us. What this man has done is absolutely criminal. Correct. First of all, the Supreme Court just approved the abortion pill. And I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it. And if you look at this whole question that you’re asking, a complex, but not really complex – 51 years ago, you had Roe v. Wade, and everybody wanted to get it back to the states, everybody, without exception. Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back. Religious leaders. And what I did is I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted. Now, 10 years ago or so, they started talking about how many weeks and how many of this – getting into other things, But every legal scholar, throughout the world, the most respected, wanted it brought back to the states. I did that. Now the states are working it out. If you look at Ohio, it was a decision that was – that was an end result that was a little bit more liberal than you would have thought. Kansas I would say the same thing. Texas is different. Florida is different. But they’re all making their own decisions right now. And right now, the states control it. That’s the vote of the people. Like Ronald Reagan, I believe in the exceptions. I am a person that believes. And frankly, I think it’s important to believe in the exceptions. Some people – you have to follow your heart. Some people don’t believe in that. But I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I think it’s very important. Some people don’t. Follow your heart. But you have to get elected also and – because that has to do with other things. You got to get elected. The problem they have is they’re radical, because they will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth – after birth. If you look at the former governor of Virginia, he was willing to do this. He said, we’ll put the baby aside and we’ll determine what we do with the baby. Meaning, we’ll kill the baby. What happened is we brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue. It’s been a great thing. There have been many young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border. We have a border that’s the most dangerous place anywhere in the world – considered the most dangerous place anywhere in the world. And he opened it up, and these killers are coming into our country, and they are raping and killing women. And it’s a terrible thing. As far as the abortion’s concerned, it is now back with the states. The states are voting and in many cases, they – it’s, frankly, a very liberal decision. In many cases, it’s the opposite. But they’re voting and it’s bringing it back to the vote of the people, which is what everybody wanted, including the founders, if they knew about this issue, which frankly they didn’t, but they would have – everybody want it brought back. Ronald Reagan wanted it brought back. He wasn’t able to get it. Everybody wanted it brought back and many presidents had tried to get it back. I was the one to do it. And again, this gives it the vote of the people. And that’s where they wanted it. Every legal scholar wanted it that way. So that means he can take the life of the baby in the ninth month and even after birth, because some states, Democrat-run, take it after birth. Again, the governor – former governor of Virginia: put the baby down, then we decide what to do with it. So he’s in – he’s willing to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby. Nobody wants that to happen. Democrat or Republican, nobody wants it to happen. Under Roe v. Wade, you have late-term abortion. You can do whatever you want. Depending on the state, you can do whatever you want. We don’t think that’s a good thing. We think it’s a radical thing. We think the Democrats are the radicals, not the Republicans. I really don’t know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don’t think he knows what he said either. Look, we had the safest border in the history of our country. The border – all he had to do was leave it. All he had to do was leave it. He decided to open up our border, open up our country to people that are from prisons, people that are from mental institutions, insane asylum, terrorists. We have the largest number of terrorists coming into our country right now. All terrorists, all over the world – not just in South America, all over the world. They come from the Middle East, everywhere. All over the world, they’re pouring in. And this guy just left it open. And he didn’t need legislation because I didn’t have legislation. I said, close the border. We had the safest border in history. In that final couple of months of my presidency, we had, according to Border Patrol – who is great, and, by the way, who endorsed me for president. But I won’t say that. But they endorsed me for president. Brandon, just speak to him. But, look, we had the safest border in history. Now we have the worst border in history. There’s never been anything like it. And people are dying all over the place, including the people that are coming up in caravans. Can I get one second? He said we killed three people. The people we killed are al-Baghdadi and Salamani (sic), the two greatest terrorists, biggest terrorists anywhere in the world. And it had a huge impact on everything; not just border, on everything. He’s the one that killed people with the bad border, including hundreds of thousands of people dying, and also killing our citizens when they come in. We – we are living right now in a rat’s nest. They’re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union, because we don’t have borders anymore. Every state is now a border. And because of his ridiculous, insane and very stupid policies, people are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen. We call it migrant crime. I call it Biden migrant crime. They’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen before. And you’re reading it like these three incredible young girls over the last few days. One of them, I just spoke to the mother, and we just had the funeral for this girl, 12 years old. This is horrible what’s taken place. What’s taken place in our country, we’re literally an uncivilized country now. He doesn’t want it to be. He just doesn’t know. He opened the borders nobody’s ever seen anything like. And we have to get a lot of these people out and we have to get them out fast, because they’re going to destroy our country. Just take a look at where they’re living. They’re living in luxury hotels in New York City and other places. Our veterans are on the street, they’re dying, because he doesn’t care about our veterans. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t like the military at all. And he doesn’t care about our veterans. Nobody’s been worse. I had the highest approval rating for veterans, taking care of the V.A. He has the worst. He’s gotten rid of all the things that I approved, choice, that I got through Congress. All of the different things I approved, they abandoned. We had, by far, the highest, and now it’s down in less than half because he’s done – all these great things that we did – and I think he did it just because I approved it, which is crazy. But he has killed so many people at our border by allowing… … all of these people to come in. And it’s a very sad day in America. First of all, that was a made-up quote, suckers and losers. They made it up. It was in a third-rate magazine that’s failing, like many of these magazines. He made that up. He put it in commercials. We’ve notified them. We had 19 people that said I didn’t say it. And think of this, who would say – I’m at a cemetery, or I’m talking about our veterans – because nobody’s taken better care – I’m so glad this came up, and he brought it up. There’s nobody that’s taken better care of our soldiers than I have. To think that I would, in front of generals and others, say suckers and losers – we have 19 people that said it was never said by me. It was made up by him, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was made up, just like the 51 intelligence agents are made up, just like the new thing with the 16 economists are talking. It’s the same thing. Fifty-one intelligence agents said that the laptop was Russia disinformation. It wasn’t. That came from his son Hunter. It wasn’t Russia disinformation. He made up the suckers and losers, so he should apologize to me right now. First of all, our veterans and our soldiers can’t stand this guy. They can’t stand him. They think he’s the worst commander in chief, if that’s what you call him, that we’ve ever had. They can’t stand him. So let’s get that straight. And they like me more than just about any of them. And that’s based on every single bit of information. As far as Russia and Ukraine, if we had a real president, a president that knew – that was respected by Putin, he would have never – he would have never invaded Ukraine. A lot of people are dead right now, much more than people know. You know, they talk about numbers. You can double those numbers, maybe triple those numbers. He did nothing to stop it. In fact, I think he encouraged Russia from going in. I’ll tell you what happened, he was so bad with Afghanistan, it was such a horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, that when Putin watched that and he saw the incompetence that he should – he should have fired those generals like I fired the one that you mentioned, and so he’s got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind, we lost 13 beautiful soldiers and 38 soldiers were obliterated. And by the way, we left people behind too. We left American citizens behind. When Putin saw that, he said, you know what? I think we’re going to go in and maybe take my – this was his dream. I talked to him about it, his dream. The difference is he never would have invaded Ukraine. Never. Just like Israel would have never been invaded, in a million years, by Hamas. You know why? Because Iran was broke with me. I wouldn’t let anybody do business with them. They ran out of money. They were broke. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for anything. No money for terror. That’s why you had no terror at all during my administration. This place, the whole world is blowing up under him. I never said that. No, they’re not acceptable. No, they’re not acceptable. But look, this is a war that never should have started. If we had a leader in this war – he led everybody along. He’s given $200 billion now or more to Ukraine. He’s given $200 billion. That’s a lot of money. I don’t think there’s ever been anything like it. Every time that Zelenskyy comes to this country, he walks away with $60 billion. He’s the greatest salesman ever. And I’m not knocking him, I’m not knocking anything. I’m only saying, the money that we’re spending on this war, and we shouldn’t be spending, it should have never happened. I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on January 20th. I’ll have that war settled. People being killed so needlessly, so stupidly, and I will get it settled and I’ll get it settled fast, before I take office. Just going back to Ukraine for one second, we have an ocean separating us. The European nations together have spent $100 billion, or maybe more than that, less than us. Why doesn’t he call them so you got to put up your money like I did with NATO? I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. The secretary general of NATO said Trump did the most incredible job I’ve ever seen. You wouldn’t – they wouldn’t have any – they were going out of business. We were spending – almost 100 percent of the money was – it was paid by us. He didn’t do that. He is getting all – you got to ask these people to put up the money. We’re over $100 billion more spent, and it has a bigger impact on them, because of location, because we have an ocean in between. You got to ask them. As far as Israel and Hamas, Israel’s the one that wants to go – he said the only one who wants to keep going is Hamas. Actually, Israel is the one. And you should them go and let them finish the job. He doesn’t want to do it. He’s become like a Palestinian. But they don’t like him, because he’s a very bad Palestinian. He’s a weak one. I’d have to see. But before we do that, the problem we have is that we spend all the money. So they kill us on trade. I made great trade deals with the European nations, because if you add them up, they’re about the same size economically. Their economy is about the same size as the United States. And they were – no cars. No – they don’t want anything that we have. But we’re supposed to take their cars, their food, their everything, their agriculture. I changed that. But the big thing I changed is they don’t want to pay. And the only reason that he can play games with NATO is because I got them to put up hundreds of billions of dollars. I said – and he’s right about this, I said, no, I’m not going to support NATO if you don’t pay. They asked me that question: Would you guard us against Russia? – at a very secret meeting of the 28 states at that time, nations at that time. And they (sic) said, no, if you don’t pay, I won’t do that. And you know what happened? Billions and billions of dollars came flowing in the next day and the next months. But now, we’re in the same position. We’re paying everybody’s bills. Well, I don’t think too many believe that. And let me tell you about January 6th, on January 6th, we had a great border, nobody coming through, very few. On January 6th, we were energy independent. On January 6th, we had the lowest taxes ever, we had the lowest regulations ever. On January 6th, we were respected all over the world. All over the world we were respected, and then he comes in, and we’re now laughed at, we’re like a bunch of stupid people. What happened to the United States’ reputation under this man’s leadership is horrible, including weaponization, which I’m sure at some point you’ll be talking about, where he goes after his political opponent because he can’t beat him fair and square. Well, I didn’t say that to anybody. I said peacefully and patriotically. And Nancy Pelosi, if you just watch the news from two days ago, on tape to her daughter, who’s a documentary filmmaker, as they say, what she’s saying, oh, no, it’s my responsibility, I was responsible for this. Because I offered her 10,000 soldiers or National Guard, and she turned them down. And the mayor of – in writing, by the way, the mayor. In writing turned it down, the mayor of D.C. They turned it down. I offered 10,000 because I could see – I had virtually nothing to do. They asked me to go make a speech. I could see what was happening. Everybody was saying they’re going to be there on January 6th. They’re going to be there. And I said, you know what? There’s a lot of people coming, you could feel it. You could feel it too. And you could feel it. And I said, they ought to have some National Guard or whatever. And I offered it to her. And she now admits that she turned it down. And it was the same day. She was – I don’t know, you can’t be very happy with her daughter because it made her into a liar. She said, I take full responsibility for January 6th. What they’ve done to some people that are so innocent, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, what you have done, how you’ve destroyed the lives of so many people. When they ripped down Portland, when they ripped down many other cities – you go to Minnesota, Minneapolis, what they’ve done there with the fires all over the city. If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city would have been destroyed. When you look at all of the – they took over big chunks of Seattle. I was all set to bring in the National Guard. They heard that, they saw them coming and they left immediately. What he said about this whole subject is so off. Peacefully patriotic. One other thing, the unselect committee, which is basically two horrible Republicans that are all gone now, out of office, and Democrats, all Democrats, they destroyed and deleted all of the information they found, because they found out we were right. We were right. And they deleted and destroyed all of the information. They should go to jail for that. If a Republican did that, they’d go to jail. Well, I said my retribution is going to be success. We’re going to make this country successful again, because right now it’s a failing nation. My retribution’s going to be success. But when he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon at a very high level. His son is convicted. Going to be convicted probably numerous other times. He should have been convicted before, but his Justice Department let the statute of limitations lapse on the most important things. But he could be a convicted felon as soon as he gets out of office. Joe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he’s done. He’s done horrible things. All of the death caused at the border, telling the Ukrainian people that we’re going to want a billion dollars or you change the prosecutor, otherwise, you’re not getting a billion dollars. If I ever said that, that’s quid pro quo. That – we’re not going to do anything, we’re not going to give you a billion dollars unless you change your prosecutor having to do with his son. This man is a criminal. This man – you’re lucky. You’re lucky. I did nothing wrong. We’d have a system that was rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong. I didn’t have sex with a porn star, number one. Number two, that was a case that was started and moved – they moved a high-ranking official, a DOJ, into the Manhattan D.A.’s office to start that case. That case is going to be appealed in one. We had a very terrible judge, a horrible judge, Democrat. The prosecutor were all high-ranking Democrats, appointed people. And the – both the civil and the criminal. He basically went after his political opponent because he thought it was going to damage me. But when the public found out about these cases – because they understand it better than he does, he has no idea what these cases are. But when he – they – when they found out about these cases, you know what they did? My poll numbers went up way up. You know that because you’re reporting it. And we took in more money in the last two weeks than we’ve ever taken in in the history of any campaign, I don’t think any campaign has ever taken. Hundreds of millions of dollars came pouring in because the public knows it’s a scam and it’s a guy that’s after his political opponent because he can’t win fair and square. Jake, both of you know that story’s been totally wiped out. Because when you see the sentence, it said 100 percent exoneration on there. So he just keeps it going. He says he ran because of Charlottesville. He didn’t run because of Charlottesville. He ran because it was his last chance at – he’s not equipped to be president. You know it and I know it. It’s ridiculous. We have a debate. We’re trying to justify his presidency. His presidency, his – without question, the worst president, the worst presidency in the history of our country. We shouldn’t be having a debate about it. There’s nothing to debate. He made up the Charlottesville story and you’ll see it’s debunked all over the place. Every anchor has – every reasonable anchor has debunked it. And just the other day it came out where it was fully debunked. It’s a nonsense story. He knows that. And he didn’t run because of Charlottesville. He used that as an excuse to run. And he caused the inflation. He’s blaming inflation. And he’s right, it’s been very bad. He caused the inflation and it’s killing black families and Hispanic families and just about everybody. It’s killing people. They can’t buy groceries anymore. They can’t. You look at the cost of food where it’s doubled and tripled and quadrupled. They can’t live. They’re not living anymore. He caused this inflation. I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green new scam and all of the other – all this money that’s being thrown out the window. He caused inflation. As sure as you’re sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he’s allowed to come in through the border. They’re taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people. They’re taking black jobs and they’re taking Hispanic jobs and you haven’t seen it yet, but you’re going to see something that’s going to be the worst in our history. Well, let me just go back to what he said about the police, how close the police are to him. Almost every police group in the nation from every state is supporting Donald J. Trump, almost every police group. And what he has done to the black population is horrible, including the fact that for 10 years he called them super predators. We can’t, in the 1990s (ph), we can’t forget that. Super predators was his name. And he called it to them for 10, and they’ve taken great offense at it, and now they see it happening. But, when they see what I did for criminal justice reform and for the historically black colleges and universities, where I funded them and got them all funded, and the opportunity zones with Tim. As you know, Tim Scott was - incredible, he did a great job, a great Senator from South Carolina. He came to me with the idea and it was a great idea. It’s one of the most successful economic development acts ever in the country, opportunity zones. And the biggest beneficiary are blacks. And that’s why we have the best numbers with them in maybe ever, they’re saying ever, I read this morning, wherever, the best numbers, he has lost much of the black population because he has done a horrible job for black people. He has also done a horrible job for Hispanics. But, why do you see these millions of people pouring into our country and they’re going to take the jobs? And it’s already started. And you haven’t seen anything yet. It’s a disaster. So, I want absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air, and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever. And we did – we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet, during my four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever. And my top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on the stage, actually. The Paris Accord was going to cost us a trillion dollars, and China nothing, and Russia nothing, and India nothing. It was a ripoff of the United States. And I ended it because I didn’t want to waste that money because they treat us horribly. We were the only ones – it was costing us money. Nobody else was paying into it. And it was a disaster. But, everything that he said just now, I’ll give you an example. I heard him say before insulin, I’m the one that got the insulin down for the seniors. I took care of the seniors. What he is doing is destroying all of our medical programs because the migrants coming in. They want everybody. And look, I have the biggest heart on the stage. I guarantee you that. And I want to take care of people. But, we’re destroying our country. They’re taking over our schools, our hospitals, and they’re going to be taking over Social Security. He is destroying Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So I’ve dealt with politicians all my life. I’ve been on this side of the equation for the last eight years. I’ve never seen anybody lie like this guy. He lies – I’ve never seen it. He could look you in the face. So – and about so many other things, too. And we mentioned the laptop, We mentioned “Russia, Russia, Russia,” “Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine.” And everything he does is a lie. It’s misinformation and disinformation. The “losers and suckers” story that he made up is a total lie on the military. It’s a disgrace. But Social Security, he’s destroying it. Because millions of people are pouring into our country, and they’re putting them on to Social Security; they’re putting them on to Medicare, Medicaid. They’re putting them in our hospitals. They’re taking the place of our citizens. They’re – what they’re doing to the V.A., to our veterans, is unbelievable. Our veterans are living in the street and these people are living in luxury hotels. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. And it – it’s really coming back. I’ve never seen such anger in our country before. Just to go back. The general got fired because he was no good. And if he said that, that’s why he made it up. But we have 19 people that said I didn’t say it, and they’re very highly respected, much more so than him. The other thing is, he doesn’t fire people. He never fired people. I’ve never seen him fire anybody. I did fire a lot. I fired Comey because he was no good. I fired a lot of the top people at the FBI, drained the swamp. They were no good. Not easy to fire people. You’d pay a price for it, but they were no good. I inherited these people. I didn’t put him there. I didn’t put Comey there. He was no good. I fired him. This guy hasn’t fired anybody. He never fires. He should have fired every military man that was involved with that Afghan – the Afghanistan horror show. The most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. He didn’t fire? Did you fire anybody? Did you fire anybody that’s on the border, that’s allowed us to have the worst border in the history of the world? Did anybody get fired for allowing 18 million people, many from prisons, many from mental institutions? Did you fire anybody that allowed our country to be destroyed? Joe, our country is being destroyed as you and I sit up here and waste a lot of time on this debate. This shouldn’t be a debate. He is the worst president. He just said it about me because I said it. But look, he’s the worst president in the history of our country. He’s destroyed our country. Now, all of a sudden, he’s trying to get a little tough on the border. He come out – came out with a nothing deal, and it reduced it a little bit. A little bit, like this much. It’s insignificant. He wants open borders. He wants our country to either be destroyed or he wants to pick up those people as voters. And I don’t think – we just can’t let it happen. If he wins this election, our country doesn’t have a chance. Not even a chance of coming out of this rut. We probably won’t have a country left anymore. That’s how bad it is. He is the worst in history by far. Just you understand, we have polling. We have other things that do – they rate him the worst because what he’s done is so bad. And they rate me – yes, I’ll show you. I will show you. And they rate me one of the best. OK. And if I’m given another four years, I will be the best. I think I’ll be the best. Nobody’s ever created an economy like us. Nobody ever cut taxes like us. He’s the only one I know. He wants to raise your taxes by four times. He wants to raise everybody’s taxes by four times. He wants the Trump tax cuts to expire so everybody, including the two of you are going to pay four to five times. Nobody ever heard of this before. All my life I’d grow up and I’d see politicians talking about cutting taxes. When we cut taxes, as I said, we did more business. Apple and all these companies, they were bringing money back into our country. The worst president in history by far, and everybody knows it. To finish up, we now have the largest deficit in the history of our country under this guy, we have the largest deficit with China. He gets paid by China. He’s a Manchurian candidate. He gets money from China. So I think he’s afraid to deal with him or something. But do you notice? He never took out my tariffs because we bring in so much money with the tariffs that I imposed on China. He never took them away. He can’t because it’s too much money. It’s tremendous. And we saved our steel industries. And there was more to come, but he hasn’t done that. But he hasn’t cut the tariffs because he can’t, because it’s too much money. But he’s got the largest deficit in the history of our country and he’s got the worst situation with China. China is going to own us if you keep allowing them to do what they’re doing to us as a country. They are killing us as a country, Joe, and you can’t let that happen. You’re destroying our country. Jake, we’re doing very well at addiction until the COVID came along. We had the two-and-a-half, almost three years of like nobody’s ever had before, any country in every way. And then we had to get tough. And it was – the drugs pouring across the border, we’re – it started to increase. We got great equipment. We bought the certain dog. That’s the most incredible thing that you’ve ever seen, the way they can spot it. We did a lot. And we had – we were getting very low numbers. Very, very low numbers. Then he came along. The numbers – have you seen the numbers now? It’s not only the 18 million people that I believe is even low, because the gotaways, they don’t even talk about gotaways. But the numbers of – the amount of drugs and human trafficking in women coming across our border, the worst thing I’ve ever seen at numbers – nobody’s ever seen under him because the border is so bad. But the number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far. Because this does pertain to it. He ended remain in Mexico, he ended catch and release. I made it catch and release in Mexico, not catch and release here. We had so many things that we had done, hard negotiations with Mexico, and I got it all for nothing. It’s just like when you have a hostage, we always pay $6 billion for a – every time we sees hostage. Now we have a hostage. A Wall Street Journal reporter, I think a good guy, and he’s over there because Putin is laughing at this guy, probably asking for billions of dollars for the reporter. I will have him out very quickly, as soon as I take office, before I take office. I said by literally as soon as I win the election, I will have that reporter out. He should have had him out a long time ago. But Putin is probably asking for billions and billions of dollars because this guy pays it every time. We had two cases where we paid $6 billion for five people. I got 58 people out and I paid essentially nothing. Well, I took two tests, cognitive tests. I aced them, both of them, as you know. We made it public. He took none. I’d like to see him take one, just one, a real easy one. Like go through the first five questions, he couldn’t do it. But I took two cognitive tests. I took physical exams every year. And, you know, we knock on wood, wherever we may have wood, that I’m in very good health. I just won two club championships, not even senior, two regular club championships. To do that, you have to be quite smart and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn’t do it. He can’t hit a ball 50 yards. He challenged me to a golf match. He can’t hit a ball 50 yards. I think I’m a very good shape. I feel that I’m in as good a shape as I was 25, 30 years ago. Actually, I’m probably a little bit lighter. But I’m in as good a shape as I was years ago. I feel very good. I feel the same. But I took – I was willing to take a cognitive test. And you know what, if I didn’t do well – I aced them. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who’s a great guy, when he was White House doctor. And then I took another one, a similar one, and both – one of them said they’d never seen anybody ace them. (inaudible). (inaudible). That’s the biggest lie that he’s a 6 handicap, of all. Yeah. I’ve seen your swing, I know your swing. (CROSSTALK) Let’s not act like children. Well, I shouldn’t have to say that, but, of course, I believe that. It’s totally unacceptable. And if you would see my statements that I made on Twitter at the time, and also my statement that I made in the Rose Garden, you would say it’s one of the strongest statements you’ve ever seen. In addition to the speech I made, in front of, I believe, the largest crowd I’ve ever spoken to, and I will tell you, nobody ever talks about that. They talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol. And in many cases were ushered in by the police. And as Nancy Pelosi said, it was her responsibility, not mine. She said that loud and clear. But the answer is, if the election is fair free, and I want that more than anybody. And I’ll tell you something – I wish he was a great president because I wouldn’t be here right now. I’d be at one of my many places enjoying myself. I wouldn’t be under indictment because I wouldn’t have been his political appoint – you know, opponent. Because he indicted me because I was his opponent. I wish he was a great president. I would rather have that. I wouldn’t be here. I don’t mind being here, but the only reason I’m here is he’s so bad as a president that I’m going to make America great again. We’re going to make America great again. We’re a failing nation right now. We’re a seriously failing nation. And we’re a failing nation because of him. His policies are so bad. His military policies are insane. They’re insane. These are wars that will never end with him. He will drive us into World War Three and we’re closer to World War Three than anybody can imagine. We are very, very close to World War Three, and he’s driving us there. And Kim Jong-Un, and President Xi of China – Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, all of these – Putin – they don’t respect him. They don’t fear him. They have nothing going with this gentleman and he’s going to drive us into World War Three. Just to finish what he said, if I might, Russia – they took a lot of land from Bush. They took a lot of land from Obama and Biden. They took no land, nothing from Trump, nothing. He knew not to do it. He’s not going to play games with me. He knew that. I got along with him very well, but he knew not to play games. He took nothing from me, but now, he’s going to take the whole thing from this man right here. That’s a war that should have never started. It would’ve never started ever with me. And he’s going to take Ukraine and, you know, you asked me a question before, would you do this with – he’s got us in such a bad position right now with Ukraine and Russia because Ukraine’s not winning that war. He said, I will never settle until such time – they’re running out of people, they’re running out of soldiers, they’ve lost so many people. It’s so sad. They’ve lost so many people and they’ve lost those gorgeous cities with the golden domes that are 1,000-years-old, all because of him and stupid decisions. Russia would’ve never attacked if I were president. If it’s a fair and legal and good election – absolutely. I would have much rather accepted these but the fraud and everything else was ridiculous that if you want, we’ll have a news conference on it in a week or we’ll have another one of these on – in a week. But I will absolutely – there’s nothing I’d rather do. It would be much easier for me to do that than I’m running again. I wasn’t really going to run until I saw the horrible job he did. He’s destroying our country. I would be very happy to be someplace else, in a nice location someplace. And again, no indictments, no political opponent’s stuff, because it’s the only way he thinks he can win. But unfortunately, it’s driven up by numbers and driven it up to a very high level, because the people understand it. We’ll see. Like so many politicians, this man is just a complainer. He said we want to do this. We want to do that. We want to get rid of this tax, that tax, but he doesn’t do anything. He doesn’t do. All he does is make our country unsafe by allowing millions and millions of people to pour in. Our military doesn’t respect him. We look like fools in Afghanistan. We didn’t stop – Israel, it was such a horrible thing that would have never happened. It should have never happened. Iran was broke. Anybody that did business with Iran, including China, they couldn’t do business with the United States. They all passed. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hamas or Hezbollah, for terror, no money whatsoever. Again, Ukraine should have never happened. He talks about all this stuff, but he didn’t do it. For three-and-a-half years, we’re living in hell. We have the Palestinians and we have everybody else rioting all over the place. You talk about Charlottesville. This is 100 times Charlottesville, 1,000 times. The whole country is exploding because of you, because they don’t respect you. And they have to respect their president and they don’t respect you throughout the world. What we did was incredible. We re – rebuilt the military. We got the largest tax cut in history, the largest regulation cut in history. The reason he’s got jobs is because I cut the regulations that gave jobs, but he’s putting a lot of those regulations back on. All of the things that we’ve done, nobody’s ever – never seen anything like – even from a medical standpoint. Right to Try, where we can try Space Age materials instead of going to Asia or going to Europe and trying to get when you’re terminally ill. Now, you can go and you can get something. You sign a document. They’ve been trying to get it for 42 years. But you know what we did for the military was incredible. Choice for our soldiers, where our soldiers, instead of waiting for three months to see a doctor, can go out and get themselves fixed up and readied up, and take care of themselves and they’re living. And that’s why I had the highest approval rating of the history of the V.A. So, all of these things – we’re in a failing nation, but it’s not going to be failing anymore. We’re going to make it great again.","['greatest', 'economy', 'history', 'never', 'done', 'everybody', 'amazed', 'countries', 'copying', 'got', 'hit', 'covid', 'spent', 'money', 'necessary',

0,"January 02, 2021","[""White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Okay. Alright. Mr. President, everyone is on the line. This is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I'll turn it over to you."", ""The President. Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it's pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense."", ""But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn't been checked. We think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County — you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that's going to happen."", ""Another tremendous number. We're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate number will be given, but it's in the 50s of thousands — and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number's large. We'll have it for you. But it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That's something I think everyone — at least that's a number that everyone agrees on."", ""But that's the difference in the votes. But we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that's very, very, very, very sad."", ""We had, I believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. That's 18,325."", ""Smaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. We had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. That was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else."", ""Where they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — I think it was, Brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes."", ""They weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden."", ""You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326."", 'And you had dropboxes, which is very bad. You had dropboxes that were picked up. We have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people.', ""I don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, I mean the state is in turmoil over this."", ""And I know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, you know, and I didn't lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way. A lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the .\u2009.\u2009. As you know, every single state, we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days."", ""And we won the House, but we won every single statehouse, and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's a now difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more. But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election, that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose, and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said there's no way, that they've done many polls prior to the election, that there was no way that they won."", ""Ballots were dropped in massive numbers. And we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them."", ""They'll take a period of time. Certified. But but they're massive numbers. And far greater than the 11,779."", 'The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.', ""The bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas. And this may or may not be true .\u2009.\u2009. this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the Dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal."", 'And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it is a very sad situation.', ""But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. And those are numbers that are there, that exist. And that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil."", ""I mean there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one, I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. And this is something that — you know, as an example, I think it in Detroit, I think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had, I think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good."", ""In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had as an example, in Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was, I think, Mark, it was 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category."", 'And that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers.', ""So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line, and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people."", ""And, you know, they were shellshocked. I don't know if you call that provisional ballots. In some states, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on November 3 and they were already voted for."", ""So that's it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. And we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily, and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very certified, far more certified than we need. But we're getting additional numbers certified, too. And we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. Delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect."", ""Meadows. So, Mr. President, if I might be able to jump in, and I'll give Brad a chance. Mr. Secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted, and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office."", ""What I'm hopeful for is there some way that we can, we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know the president mentioned Fulton County."", ""But in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious?"", ""Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Well, I listened to what the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won. And we don't — I didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. I'll go through that point by point."", ""What we have done is we gave our state Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state House, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our U.S. congressmen, Republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines. Because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table."", ""I don't think there's an issue about that."", ""The President. Well, Brad. Not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven't felt we needed to go there. And just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. We have all the votes we need."", ""You know, we won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through, we have not gone through your Dominion. So we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we'll have to see."", ""But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have, we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible; we're many times, many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to, Mark, I don't think we have to go through .\u2009.\u2009."", 'Meadows. Right', ""The President. Because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. You know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won. You know in Alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia."", ""And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible. When I heard it was close, I said there's no way. But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. You know that, Brad. And that's what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too."", ""And so I just don't know, you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose. I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don't need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. You know, I mean, having the correct — the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night. Along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even. And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. I mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, etc. And even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half again, it's more votes than we need."", 'Raffensperger. Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised.', ""But they — I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that's wrong."", 'The President. Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? Maybe you tell me?', 'Attorney Cleta Mitchell. Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died.', ""But we don't have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary —"", ""The President. But, Cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. So I don't know — I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. I'm sure we do in Georgia, too."", 'But we\'re so far ahead. We\'re so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name] , known scammer. You know the Internet? You know what was trending on the Internet? ""Where\'s [name]?"" Because they thought she\'d be in jail. ""Where\'s [name]?"" It\'s crazy, it\'s crazy. That was. The minimum number is 18,000 for [name] , but they think it\'s probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let\'s face it, Brad, I mean. They did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.', ""So there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing: Here's ballot No 1. Here it is a second time, third time, next ballot."", ""I mean, look. Brad. We have a new tape that we're going to release. It's devastating. And by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. It's, you know, that one event was a disaster. And it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. It's magnified, and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot, and I don't know why. I don't know why three times. Why not five times, right? Go ahead."", ""Raffensperger. You're talking about the State Farm video. And I think it's extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. The next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —"", 'The President. But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there.', ""It was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But we're, if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where were the Democrat pollwatchers, because there were none."", 'And then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station.', ""When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those. They went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no Republican pollwatchers. And remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the Internet, Brad. She's known all over."", 'I\'m telling you, ""Where\'s [name] "" was one of the hot items .\u2009.\u2009. [name] They knew her. ""Where\'s [name]?"" So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I, you know, I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was — and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put \'em in three times.', 'Raffensperger. Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.', 'The President. Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. How come we had no security in the room. Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad. And they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes.', ""Raffensperger. Mr. President, we'll send you the link from WSB."", ""The President. I don't care about the link. I don't need it. Brad, I have a much better —"", ""Mitchell. I will tell you. I've seen the tape. The full tape. So has Alex. We've watched it. And what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave — we have sworn affidavits saying that. And then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don't know that. If you know that .\u2009.\u2009."", 'The President. It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times.', ""Mitchell. Well, I don't know about that."", 'The President. I do think we had ours magnified out.', ""Mitchell. I've watched the entire tape."", ""The President. Nobody can make a case for that, Brad. Nobody. I mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. Just a child."", 'Mitchell. How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then?', 'Raffensperger. We had GBI .\u2009.\u2009. investigate that.', 'General Counsel to the Georgia Secretary of State Ryan Germany. We had our — this is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was, who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them as well as FBI agents.', ""The President. Well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. They're either dishonest or incompetent, okay?"", 'Mitchell. Well, what did they find?', ""The President. There's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There's just no way. Look. There's no way. And on the other thing, I said too, there is no way. I mean, there's no way that these things could have been, you know, you have all these different people that voted, but they don't live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too."", ""Mitchell. The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia.

We've been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases —"", 'The President. How may people do that? They moved out, and then they said, ""Ah, to hell with it, I\'ll move back."" You know, it doesn\'t sound like a very normal .\u2009.\u2009. you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? It\'s crazy.', ""Germany. They moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate."", ""The President. Well, I don't know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia, and they voted. It didn't say they moved back in, Cleta, did it?"", ""Mitchell. No, but I mean, we're looking at the voter registration. Again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you investigated the allegations."", ""The President. Cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election."", ""I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes."", ""Do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that's what the rumor is.

This is Ryan Germany. No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County.', 'The President.

I'm sure, Mr. President."", 'The President. What about, what about the ballots. The shredding of the ballots. Have they been shredding ballots?', 'Germany. The only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections.', 'The President. It doesn\'t pass the smell test because we hear they\'re shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, and now what they\'re saying, ""Oh, we\'re just cleaning up the office.""

We believe that we do have an accurate election.', ""The President. No, no you don't. No, no you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — Okay. So you sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn't want to go into. And you said it would be open to the public. So we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. But we didn't want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn't give it to us. Now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public?"", ""And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything?

So why did you do Cobb County? We didn't even request — we requested Fulton County, not Cobb County. Go ahead, please. Go ahead."", ""Germany. We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done."", ""The President. No, but I told you. We're not, we're not saying that."", 'Mitchell. We did say that.', ""The President. Fulton County. Look. Stacey, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you .\u2009.\u2009. at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can't check signatures. I can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step."", ""And I hate to imagine what's going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it's very scary to people.

What's written on top of it?"", 'Raffensperger. Ryan?', ""Germany. I don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order."", ""The President. But Ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right?"", ""Germany. I don't. I don't. I don't believe so, but I don't have it in front of me."", ""The President. Okay, whatever, it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look. Here's the problem. We can go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. But you didn't do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever. Recently. And compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. And you'll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries."", 'Okay, you know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that. And you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt, and so is she totally corrupt.', ""And they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. And you've taken a state that's a Republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before.

We have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything .\u2009.\u2009. Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they're very substantial numbers. But I think you're going to fine that they — by the way, a little information — I think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt."", ""And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that's a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I've heard. And they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."", ""And flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. If it was a mistake, I don't know. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. It was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. I mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away."", ""Germany. This is Ryan. We're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned."", ""The President. Good. But if you find it, you've got to say it, Ryan."", ""Germany. .\u2009.\u2009. Let me tell you what we are seeing. What we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they're looking, and they're good. And that's not what they're seeing. And we'll keep looking, at all these things."", ""The President. Well, you better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I'm just telling you, Ryan. They're shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully. Because that's so illegal. You know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. But they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there .\u2009.\u2009. because we'll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it's never too late. .\u2009.\u2009. So, that's the story. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We'll have more and more. And .\u2009.\u2009. do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots?"", 'Raffensperger. Provisional ballots are allowed by state law.', 'The President. Sure, but I mean, are they counted, or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state?', ""Raffensperger. We'll get you that number."", 'The President. Because most of them are made out to the name Trump. Because these are people that were scammed when they came in. And we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were proudly going to vote on November 3. And they were told, ""I\'m sorry, you\'ve already been voted for, you\'ve already voted."" The women, men started screaming, ""No. I proudly voted till November 3."" They said, ""I\'m sorry, but you\'ve already been voted for, and you have a ballot."" And these people are beside themselves. So they went out, and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it.', 'And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent Trump. I mean 100 percent Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in, I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100 percent for Trump — for Biden — even though Trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100 percent for Biden. And do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it?', 'Mitchell. I know about it, but —', ""The President. Okay, Cleta, I'm not asking you, Cleta, honestly. I'm asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, I mean 100 percent, for Biden. Do you know about that?"", ""Germany. I don't know about that. I do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat. This was a mix of 'em."", ""The President. No, but this was. That's okay. But I got like 78 percent of the military. These ballots were all for .\u2009.\u2009. They didn't tell me overseas. Could be overseas, too, but I get votes overseas, too, Ryan, in all fairness. No they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for Biden. And that is criminal. You know, that's criminal. Okay. That's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here."", ""I don't know, look, Brad. I got to get .\u2009.\u2009. I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality."", ""But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it's very dangerous for you to say that."", ""I just, I just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. Like even you when you went and did that check. And I was surprised because, you know .\u2009.\u2009. And we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. So that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five, I don't know. Still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. And if you check with Fulton County, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it."", ""So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already.

I mean, I'll, I'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But, but [name] .\u2009.\u2009. I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. So that's, you know, a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. You know, [name] , the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important. You know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad?"", 'Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan?', ""Germany. That's not accurate, Mr. President."", 'The President. Huh. What is accurate?', 'Germany. The numbers that we are showing are accurate.', 'The President. No, about [name] . About early in the morning, Ryan. Where the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know, do you know who those ballots, do you know who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for?', 'Germany. No, not specifically.', 'The President. Did you ever check?', 'Germany. We did what I described to you earlier —', 'The President. No no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative, balloteer? Did ever check who those votes were for?', 'Germany. We looked into that situation that you described.', ""The President. No, they were 100 percent for Biden. 100 percent. There wasn't a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don't you want to find this, Ryan? What's wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name."", ""But, but I'm just curious, why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn't make sense. We're way over the 17,779, right? We're way over that number, and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three."", ""And every single ballot went to Biden, and you didn't know that, but now you know it. So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. For instance, I'm hearing Ryan that he's probably, I'm sure a great lawyer and everything, but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. But he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. But now I think he's less sure because the answer is, they all went to Biden, and that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know, so."", 'Raffensperger. Mr. President, you have people that submit information, and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court, and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.', 'The President. Why do you say that, though? I don\'t know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? First of all, they don\'t even assign us a judge. They don\'t even assign us a judge. But why wouldn\'t you .\u2009.\u2009. Hey Brad, why wouldn\'t you want to check out [name] ? And why wouldn\'t you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, you stick by, I mean I\'ve been watching you, you know, you don\'t care about anything. ""Your numbers are right."" But your numbers aren\'t right. They\'re really wrong, and they\'re really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — Look, ultimately, I win, okay? Because you guys are so wrong. And you treated this. You treated the population of Georgia so badly. You, between you and your governor, who is down at 21, he was down 21 points. And like a schmuck, I endorsed him, and he got elected, but I will tell you, he is a disaster.', ""The people are so angry in Georgia, I can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, I'll tell you that much right now.

Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been, Alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and I don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven't even assigned a judge. But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. And you have data and records that we don't have access to."", ""And you can keep telling us and making public statement that you investigated this and nothing to see here.

What I don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because .\u2009.\u2009. to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. You tell us that you had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don't have any report. I've never seen a report of investigation. I don't know that is. I've been pretty involved in this, and I don't know. And that's just one of 25 categories. And it doesn't even. And as I, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the Dominion issue. That's not part of our case. It's not part of, we just didn't feel as though we had any to be able to develop —"", ""The President. No, we do have a way, but I don't want to get into it. We found a way .\u2009.\u2009. excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it. I personally think they're corrupt as hell. But we don't need that. All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. So we don't need that. I'm not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. So we're not giving Dominion a pass on the record. We don't need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have."", ""Attorney Kurt Hilbert. Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert, if I might interject for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. We would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. And if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers."", 'The President. Certified accountants looked at them.', ""Hilbert. Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own secretary of state data. So that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. And if you can convince us that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. That's sufficient to change the results entirely in and of itself. So what would you say to that, Mr. Germany?"", ""Germany. I'm happy to get with our lawyers, and we'll set that up. That number is not accurate. And I think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. And so if that would be helpful, I'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys."", ""The President. Well, let me ask you, Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right?"", ""Hilbert. That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. Yet we have asked for it six times. I sent a letter over to .\u2009.\u2009. several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. So it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. That's the problem that we have."", ""Germany. Well, that's not the case, sir. There are things that you guys are entitled to get. And there's things that under law, we are not allowed to give out."", ""The President. Well, you have to. Well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, okay? You're not allowed to do that. And that's what you done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they're going to vote. And you would be respected. Really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And I think that it is really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. Because I know, Brad, that if you think we're right, I think you're going to say, and I'm not looking to blame anybody, I'm just saying, you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under new views, of the election results, we won the election. You know? It's very simple. We won the election. As the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody. Everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast."", ""Meadows. Mr. President, this is Mark. It sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours, to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct?"", ""Germany. No, that's not what I said. I'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong."", ""Meadows. So what you're saying, Ryan, let me let me make sure .\u2009.\u2009. so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong?"", ""Germany. I don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say —"", ""The President. But you're allowed to have a phony election? You're allowed to have a phony election, right?"", 'Germany. No, sir.', ""The President. When are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden, you're not doing it. When are you doing that?"", ""Germany. We are going to do that. We've announced —"", 'Hilbert. To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation?', ""The President. Well, I don't want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That's okay. I don't need to know names. But on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state."", ""Meadows. Yeah. So let me let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, I can you say they were only two dead people who would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. And that may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there are more than that. But at the same time, I think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that's the good next step. Hopefully we can, we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately."", ""The President. Well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. It will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. We don't want names. We don't care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about you. She's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she's done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you. And I only ran against her once. And that was with a guy named Brian Kemp, and I beat her. And if I didn't run, Brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. He was dead, dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was. But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. I would like you .\u2009.\u2009. for the attorneys .\u2009.\u2009. I'd like you to perhaps meet with Ryan, ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. They don't want to vote. They hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you, you know, they like you. They can't believe what they found. They want more people like you. So, look, can you get together tomorrow? And, Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple."", ""And everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. It's okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the real truth is, I won by 400,000 votes. At least. That's the real truth. But we don't need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. And are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan?"", ""Germany. I'll get with Chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with Kurt."", 'Raffensperger. Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time.', 'The President. Okay, thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Bye.']",Donald J. Trump,2024,0.0,"White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Okay. Alright. Mr. President, everyone is on the line. This is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I'll turn it over to you. The President. Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it's pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense. But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn't been checked. We think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County — you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that's going to happen. Another tremendous number. We're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate number will be given, but it's in the 50s of thousands — and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number's large. We'll have it for you. But it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That's something I think everyone — at least that's a number that everyone agrees on. But that's the difference in the votes. But we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that's very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. That's 18,325. Smaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. We had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. That was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else. Where they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — I think it was, Brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden. You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326. And you had dropboxes, which is very bad. You had dropboxes that were picked up. We have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people. I don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, I mean the state is in turmoil over this. And I know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, you know, and I didn't lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way. A lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the . . . As you know, every single state, we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House, but we won every single statehouse, and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's a now difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more. But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election, that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose, and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said there's no way, that they've done many polls prior to the election, that there was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers. And we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them. They'll take a period of time. Certified. But but they're massive numbers. And far greater than the 11,779. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas. And this may or may not be true . . . this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the Dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal. And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it is a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. And those are numbers that are there, that exist. And that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. I mean there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one, I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. And this is something that — you know, as an example, I think it in Detroit, I think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had, I think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good. In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had as an example, in Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was, I think, Mark, it was 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers. So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line, and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people. And, you know, they were shellshocked. I don't know if you call that provisional ballots. In some states, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on November 3 and they were already voted for. So that's it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. And we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily, and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very certified, far more certified than we need. But we're getting additional numbers certified, too. And we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. Delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect. Meadows. So, Mr. President, if I might be able to jump in, and I'll give Brad a chance. Mr. Secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted, and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office. What I'm hopeful for is there some way that we can, we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know the president mentioned Fulton County. But in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious? Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Well, I listened to what the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won. And we don't — I didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. I'll go through that point by point. What we have done is we gave our state Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state House, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our U.S. congressmen, Republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines. Because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table. I don't think there's an issue about that. The President. Well, Brad. Not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven't felt we needed to go there. And just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. We have all the votes we need. You know, we won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through, we have not gone through your Dominion. So we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we'll have to see. But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have, we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible; we're many times, many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to, Mark, I don't think we have to go through . . . Meadows. Right The President. Because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. You know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won. You know in Alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia. And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible. When I heard it was close, I said there's no way. But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. You know that, Brad. And that's what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too. And so I just don't know, you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose. I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don't need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. You know, I mean, having the correct — the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night. Along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even. And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. I mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, etc. And even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half again, it's more votes than we need. Raffensperger. Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised. But they — I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that's wrong. The President. Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? Maybe you tell me? Attorney Cleta Mitchell. Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died. But we don't have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary — The President. But, Cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. So I don't know — I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. But we're so far ahead. We're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name] , known scammer. You know the Internet? You know what was trending on the Internet? ""Where's [name]?"" Because they thought she'd be in jail. ""Where's [name]?"" It's crazy, it's crazy. That was. The minimum number is 18,000 for [name] , but they think it's probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let's face it, Brad, I mean. They did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before. So there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing: Here's ballot No 1. Here it is a second time, third time, next ballot. I mean, look. Brad. We have a new tape that we're going to release. It's devastating. And by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. It's, you know, that one event was a disaster. And it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. It's magnified, and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot, and I don't know why. I don't know why three times. Why not five times, right? Go ahead. Raffensperger. You're talking about the State Farm video. And I think it's extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. The next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know — The President. But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But we're, if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where were the Democrat pollwatchers, because there were none. And then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station. When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those. They went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no Republican pollwatchers. And remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the Internet, Brad. She's known all over. I'm telling you, ""Where's [name] "" was one of the hot items . . . [name] They knew her. ""Where's [name]?"" So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I, you know, I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was — and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put 'em in three times. Raffensperger. Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times. The President. Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. How come we had no security in the room. Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad. And they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes. Raffensperger. Mr. President, we'll send you the link from WSB. The President. I don't care about the link. I don't need it. Brad, I have a much better — Mitchell. I will tell you. I've seen the tape. The full tape. So has Alex. We've watched it. And what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave — we have sworn affidavits saying that. And then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don't know that. If you know that . . . The President. It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times. Mitchell. Well, I don't know about that. The President. I do think we had ours magnified out. Mitchell. I've watched the entire tape. The President. Nobody can make a case for that, Brad. Nobody. I mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. Just a child. Mitchell. How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then? Raffensperger. We had GBI . . . investigate that. General Counsel to the Georgia Secretary of State Ryan Germany. We had our — this is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was, who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them as well as FBI agents. The President. Well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. They're either dishonest or incompetent, okay? Mitchell. Well, what did they find? The President. There's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There's just no way. Look. There's no way. And on the other thing, I said too, there is no way. I mean, there's no way that these things could have been, you know, you have all these different people that voted, but they don't live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too. Mitchell. The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia. And so they had a date when they moved from Georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it's like 4,500, I don't have that number right in front of me. The President. And then they came back in, and they voted. Mitchell. And voted. Yeah. The President. I thought that was a large number, though. It was in the 20s. Germany. We've been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases — The President. How may people do that? They moved out, and then they said, ""Ah, to hell with it, I'll move back."" You know, it doesn't sound like a very normal . . . you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? It's crazy. Germany. They moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate. The President. Well, I don't know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia, and they voted. It didn't say they moved back in, Cleta, did it? Mitchell. No, but I mean, we're looking at the voter registration. Again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you investigated the allegations. The President. Cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election. I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes. Do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that's what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because that's illegal, right? Germany. This is Ryan Germany. No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County. The President. But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts? Germany. No. The President. Are you sure, Ryan? Germany. I'm sure. I'm sure, Mr. President. The President. What about, what about the ballots. The shredding of the ballots. Have they been shredding ballots? Germany. The only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections. The President. It doesn't pass the smell test because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, and now what they're saying, ""Oh, we're just cleaning up the office."" You know. Raffensperger. Mr. President, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything. The President. Oh this isn't social media. This is Trump media. It's not social media. It's really not; it's not social media. I don't care about social media. I couldn't care less. Social media is Big Tech. Big Tech is on your side, you know. I don't even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican. Raffensperger. We believe that we do have an accurate election. The President. No, no you don't. No, no you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — Okay. So you sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn't want to go into. And you said it would be open to the public. So we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. But we didn't want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn't give it to us. Now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public? And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? They don't want to find, you know they don't want to find anything. Someday you'll tell me the reason why, because I don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. But why don't you want to find? Germany. Mr. President, we chose Cobb County — The President. Why don't you want to find . . . What? Germany. Sorry, go ahead. The President. So why did you do Cobb County? We didn't even request — we requested Fulton County, not Cobb County. Go ahead, please. Go ahead. Germany. We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done. The President. No, but I told you. We're not, we're not saying that. Mitchell. We did say that. The President. Fulton County. Look. Stacey, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you . . . at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can't check signatures. I can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step. And I hate to imagine what's going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it's very scary to people. You know, when the ballots flow in out of nowhere. It's very scary to people. That consent decree is a disaster. It's a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it. Raffensperger. Harvesting is still illegal in the state of Georgia. And that settlement agreement did not change that one iota. The President. It's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. It even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? It uses the term consent decree. It doesn't say settlement agreement. It's a consent decree. It's a disaster. Raffensperger. It's a settlement agreement. The President. What's written on top of it? Raffensperger. Ryan? Germany. I don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order. The President. But Ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right? Germany. I don't. I don't. I don't believe so, but I don't have it in front of me. The President. Okay, whatever, it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look. Here's the problem. We can go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. But you didn't do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever. Recently. And compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. And you'll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries. Okay, you know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that. And you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt, and so is she totally corrupt. And they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. And you've taken a state that's a Republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. And I don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good. But I won't . . . this is never . . . this is . . . We have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything . . . Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they're very substantial numbers. But I think you're going to fine that they — by the way, a little information — I think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that's a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I've heard. And they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state. And flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. If it was a mistake, I don't know. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. It was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. I mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away. Germany. This is Ryan. We're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned. The President. Good. But if you find it, you've got to say it, Ryan. Germany. . . . Let me tell you what we are seeing. What we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they're looking, and they're good. And that's not what they're seeing. And we'll keep looking, at all these things. The President. Well, you better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I'm just telling you, Ryan. They're shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully. Because that's so illegal. You know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. But they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there . . . because we'll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it's never too late. . . . So, that's the story. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We'll have more and more. And . . . do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots? Raffensperger. Provisional ballots are allowed by state law. The President. Sure, but I mean, are they counted, or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state? Raffensperger. We'll get you that number. The President. Because most of them are made out to the name Trump. Because these are people that were scammed when they came in. And we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were proudly going to vote on November 3. And they were told, ""I'm sorry, you've already been voted for, you've already voted."" The women, men started screaming, ""No. I proudly voted till November 3."" They said, ""I'm sorry, but you've already been voted for, and you have a ballot."" And these people are beside themselves. So they went out, and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it. And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent Trump. I mean 100 percent Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in, I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100 percent for Trump — for Biden — even though Trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100 percent for Biden. And do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it? Mitchell. I know about it, but — The President. Okay, Cleta, I'm not asking you, Cleta, honestly. I'm asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, I mean 100 percent, for Biden. Do you know about that? Germany. I don't know about that. I do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat. This was a mix of 'em. The President. No, but this was. That's okay. But I got like 78 percent of the military. These ballots were all for . . . They didn't tell me overseas. Could be overseas, too, but I get votes overseas, too, Ryan, in all fairness. No they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for Biden. And that is criminal. You know, that's criminal. Okay. That's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here. I don't know, look, Brad. I got to get . . . I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality. But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it's very dangerous for you to say that. I just, I just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. Like even you when you went and did that check. And I was surprised because, you know . . . And we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. So that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five, I don't know. Still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. And if you check with Fulton County, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it. So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already. Or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of Georgia because they're going to see what happened, and they're going to see what happened. I mean, I'll, I'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But, but [name] . . . I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. So that's, you know, a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. You know, [name] , the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important. You know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad? Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan? Germany. That's not accurate, Mr. President. The President. Huh. What is accurate? Germany. The numbers that we are showing are accurate. The President. No, about [name] . About early in the morning, Ryan. Where the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know, do you know who those ballots, do you know who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for? Germany. No, not specifically. The President. Did you ever check? Germany. We did what I described to you earlier — The President. No no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative, balloteer? Did ever check who those votes were for? Germany. We looked into that situation that you described. The President. No, they were 100 percent for Biden. 100 percent. There wasn't a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don't you want to find this, Ryan? What's wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. But, but I'm just curious, why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn't make sense. We're way over the 17,779, right? We're way over that number, and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three. And every single ballot went to Biden, and you didn't know that, but now you know it. So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. For instance, I'm hearing Ryan that he's probably, I'm sure a great lawyer and everything, but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. But he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. But now I think he's less sure because the answer is, they all went to Biden, and that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know, so. Raffensperger. Mr. President, you have people that submit information, and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court, and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right. The President. Why do you say that, though? I don't know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? First of all, they don't even assign us a judge. They don't even assign us a judge. But why wouldn't you . . . Hey Brad, why wouldn't you want to check out [name] ? And why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, you stick by, I mean I've been watching you, you know, you don't care about anything. ""Your numbers are right."" But your numbers aren't right. They're really wrong, and they're really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — Look, ultimately, I win, okay? Because you guys are so wrong. And you treated this. You treated the population of Georgia so badly. You, between you and your governor, who is down at 21, he was down 21 points. And like a schmuck, I endorsed him, and he got elected, but I will tell you, he is a disaster. The people are so angry in Georgia, I can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, I'll tell you that much right now. But why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? 'Cause those numbers are so wrong? Mitchell. Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been, Alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and I don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven't even assigned a judge. But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. And you have data and records that we don't have access to. And you can keep telling us and making public statement that you investigated this and nothing to see here. But we don't know about that. All we know is what you tell us. What I don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because . . . to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. You tell us that you had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don't have any report. I've never seen a report of investigation. I don't know that is. I've been pretty involved in this, and I don't know. And that's just one of 25 categories. And it doesn't even. And as I, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the Dominion issue. That's not part of our case. It's not part of, we just didn't feel as though we had any to be able to develop — The President. No, we do have a way, but I don't want to get into it. We found a way . . . excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it. I personally think they're corrupt as hell. But we don't need that. All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. So we don't need that. I'm not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. So we're not giving Dominion a pass on the record. We don't need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have. Attorney Kurt Hilbert. Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert, if I might interject for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. We would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. And if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers. The President. Certified accountants looked at them. Hilbert. Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own secretary of state data. So that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. And if you can convince us that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. That's sufficient to change the results entirely in and of itself. So what would you say to that, Mr. Germany? Germany. I'm happy to get with our lawyers, and we'll set that up. That number is not accurate. And I think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. And so if that would be helpful, I'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys. The President. Well, let me ask you, Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right? Hilbert. That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. Yet we have asked for it six times. I sent a letter over to . . . several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. So it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. That's the problem that we have. Germany. Well, that's not the case, sir. There are things that you guys are entitled to get. And there's things that under law, we are not allowed to give out. The President. Well, you have to. Well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, okay? You're not allowed to do that. And that's what you done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they're going to vote. And you would be respected. Really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And I think that it is really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. Because I know, Brad, that if you think we're right, I think you're going to say, and I'm not looking to blame anybody, I'm just saying, you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under new views, of the election results, we won the election. You know? It's very simple. We won the election. As the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody. Everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast. Meadows. Mr. President, this is Mark. It sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours, to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct? Germany. No, that's not what I said. I'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. Meadows. So what you're saying, Ryan, let me let me make sure . . . so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong? Germany. I don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say — The President. But you're allowed to have a phony election? You're allowed to have a phony election, right? Germany. No, sir. The President. When are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden, you're not doing it. When are you doing that? Germany. We are going to do that. We've announced — Hilbert. To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation? The President. Well, I don't want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That's okay. I don't need to know names. But on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state. Meadows. Yeah. So let me let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, I can you say they were only two dead people who would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. And that may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there are more than that. But at the same time, I think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that's the good next step. Hopefully we can, we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately. The President. Well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. It will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. We don't want names. We don't care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about you. She's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she's done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you. And I only ran against her once. And that was with a guy named Brian Kemp, and I beat her. And if I didn't run, Brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. He was dead, dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was. But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. I would like you . . . for the attorneys . . . I'd like you to perhaps meet with Ryan, ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. They don't want to vote. They hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you, you know, they like you. They can't believe what they found. They want more people like you. So, look, can you get together tomorrow? And, Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple. And everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. It's okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the real truth is, I won by 400,000 votes. At least. That's the real truth. But we don't need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. And are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan? Germany. I'll get with Chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with Kurt. Raffensperger. Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time. The President. Okay, thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Bye.","White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Okay. Alright. Mr. President, everyone is on the line. This is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell — who is not the attorney of record but has been involved — myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I'll turn it over to you. The President. Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we've spent a lot of time on this, and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it's pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense. But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3 — anywhere from 250 to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn't been checked. We think that if you check the signatures — a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County — you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that's going to happen. Another tremendous number. We're going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants. But an accurate number will be given, but it's in the 50s of thousands — and that's people that went to vote and they were told they can't vote because they've already been voted for. And it's a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number's large. We'll have it for you. But it's much more than the number of 11,779 that's — the current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That's something I think everyone — at least that's a number that everyone agrees on. But that's the difference in the votes. But we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that's very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. That's 18,325. Smaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. We had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. That was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else. Where they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — I think it was, Brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden. You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326. And you had dropboxes, which is very bad. You had dropboxes that were picked up. We have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people. I don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, I mean the state is in turmoil over this. And I know you would like to get to the bottom of it, although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, you know, and I didn't lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way. A lot of the political people said that there's no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the . . . As you know, every single state, we won every state. We won every statehouse in the country. We held the Senate, which is shocking to people, although we'll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House, but we won every single statehouse, and we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there's a now difference of five. There was supposed to be a difference substantially more. But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that, that there was no way that they beat me in the election, that the people came out, in fact, they were expecting to lose, and then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said there's no way, that they've done many polls prior to the election, that there was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers. And we're trying to get to those numbers and we will have them. They'll take a period of time. Certified. But but they're massive numbers. And far greater than the 11,779. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas. And this may or may not be true . . . this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. They're changing the equipment on the Dominion machines and, you know, that's not legal. And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it is a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. And those are numbers that are there, that exist. And that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. I mean there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one, I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. And this is something that — you know, as an example, I think it in Detroit, I think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had, I think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good. In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had as an example, in Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was, I think, Mark, it was 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through, by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers. So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line, and provisional ballots, again, you know, you'll have to tell me about the provisional ballots, but we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren't able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people. And, you know, they were shellshocked. I don't know if you call that provisional ballots. In some states, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked in on November 3 and they were already voted for. So that's it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win the state. And we won the state, and we won it very substantially and easily, and we're getting, we have, much of this is a very certified, far more certified than we need. But we're getting additional numbers certified, too. And we're getting pictures of dropboxes being delivered and delivered late. Delivered three days later, in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect. Meadows. So, Mr. President, if I might be able to jump in, and I'll give Brad a chance. Mr. Secretary, obviously there is, there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted, and that's at odds with the representation from the secretary of state's office. What I'm hopeful for is there some way that we can, we can find some kind of agreement to look at this a little bit more fully? You know the president mentioned Fulton County. But in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead, and so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, you know, in the spirit of cooperation and compromise, is there something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward that's less litigious? Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Well, I listened to what the president has just said. President Trump, we've had several lawsuits, and we've had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don't agree that you have won. And we don't — I didn't agree about the 200,000 number that you'd mentioned. I'll go through that point by point. What we have done is we gave our state Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue and then on the state House, the government affairs committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time, going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our U.S. congressmen, Republican congressmen, and we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you've talked about here focused in on primarily, I believe, is the absentee ballot process. I don't believe that you're really questioning the Dominion machines. Because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table. I don't think there's an issue about that. The President. Well, Brad. Not that there's not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven't felt we needed to go there. And just to, you know, maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we'd like to go further, but we don't really need to. We have all the votes we need. You know, we won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. You know when you add them up, it's many more times, it's many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through, we have not gone through your Dominion. So we can't give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we'll have to see. But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have, with just what we have, we're giving you minimal, minimal numbers. We're doing the most conservative numbers possible; we're many times, many, many times above the margin. And so we don't really have to, Mark, I don't think we have to go through . . . Meadows. Right The President. Because what's the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. You know, one of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina and from other states, and they're saying it's impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won. You know in Alabama, we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it's not possible to have lost Georgia. And I could tell you by our rallies. I could tell you by the rally I'm having on Monday night, the place, they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible. When I heard it was close, I said there's no way. But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night. You know that, Brad. And that's what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified, too. And so I just don't know, you know, Mark, I don't know what's the purpose. I won't give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don't need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. You know, I mean, having the correct — the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night. Along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even. And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, you know, that you've recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots. I mean, they're all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, etc. And even if you cut 'em in half, cut 'em in half and cut 'em in half again, it's more votes than we need. Raffensperger. Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised. But they — I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that's wrong. The President. Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that? Maybe you tell me? Attorney Cleta Mitchell. Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, if you look, if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died. But we don't have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary — The President. But, Cleta, even before you do that, and not even including that, that's why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people. So I don't know — I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. I'm sure we do in Georgia, too. But we're so far ahead. We're so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of [name] , known scammer. You know the Internet? You know what was trending on the Internet? ""Where's [name]?"" Because they thought she'd be in jail. ""Where's [name]?"" It's crazy, it's crazy. That was. The minimum number is 18,000 for [name] , but they think it's probably about 56,000, but the minimum number is 18,000 on the [name] night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and stuffed, she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let's face it, Brad, I mean. They did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before. So there's a term for it when it's a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing: Here's ballot No 1. Here it is a second time, third time, next ballot. I mean, look. Brad. We have a new tape that we're going to release. It's devastating. And by the way, that one event, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we're talking about. It's, you know, that one event was a disaster. And it's just, you know, but it was, it was something, it can't be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven't seen, but it's magnified. It's magnified, and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot, and I don't know why. I don't know why three times. Why not five times, right? Go ahead. Raffensperger. You're talking about the State Farm video. And I think it's extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. The next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know — The President. But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But we're, if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where were the Democrat pollwatchers, because there were none. And then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station. When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those. They went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no Republican pollwatchers. And remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the Internet, Brad. She's known all over. I'm telling you, ""Where's [name] "" was one of the hot items . . . [name] They knew her. ""Where's [name]?"" So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I, you know, I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was — and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put 'em in three times. Raffensperger. Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times. The President. Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. How come we had no security in the room. Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad. And they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes. Raffensperger. Mr. President, we'll send you the link from WSB. The President. I don't care about the link. I don't need it. Brad, I have a much better — Mitchell. I will tell you. I've seen the tape. The full tape. So has Alex. We've watched it. And what we saw and what we've confirmed in the timing is that they made everybody leave — we have sworn affidavits saying that. And then they began to process ballots. And our estimate is that there were roughly 18,000 ballots. We don't know that. If you know that . . . The President. It was 18,000 ballots, but they used each one three times. Mitchell. Well, I don't know about that. The President. I do think we had ours magnified out. Mitchell. I've watched the entire tape. The President. Nobody can make a case for that, Brad. Nobody. I mean, look, you'd have to be a child to think anything other than that. Just a child. Mitchell. How many ballots, Mr. Secretary, are you saying were processed then? Raffensperger. We had GBI . . . investigate that. General Counsel to the Georgia Secretary of State Ryan Germany. We had our — this is Ryan Germany. We had our law enforcement officers talk to everyone who was, who was there after that event came to light. GBI was with them as well as FBI agents. The President. Well, there's no way they could — then they're incompetent. They're either dishonest or incompetent, okay? Mitchell. Well, what did they find? The President. There's only two answers, dishonesty or incompetence. There's just no way. Look. There's no way. And on the other thing, I said too, there is no way. I mean, there's no way that these things could have been, you know, you have all these different people that voted, but they don't live in Georgia anymore. What was that number, Cleta? That was a pretty good number, too. Mitchell. The number who have registered out of state after they moved from Georgia. And so they had a date when they moved from Georgia, they registered to vote out of state, and then it's like 4,500, I don't have that number right in front of me. The President. And then they came back in, and they voted. Mitchell. And voted. Yeah. The President. I thought that was a large number, though. It was in the 20s. Germany. We've been going through each of those as well, and those numbers that we got, that Ms. Mitchell was just saying, they're not accurate. Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately. And in many cases — The President. How may people do that? They moved out, and then they said, ""Ah, to hell with it, I'll move back."" You know, it doesn't sound like a very normal . . . you mean, they moved out, and what, they missed it so much that they wanted to move back in? It's crazy. Germany. They moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there's something about that data that, it's just not accurate. The President. Well, I don't know, all I know is that it is certified. And they moved out of Georgia, and they voted. It didn't say they moved back in, Cleta, did it? Mitchell. No, but I mean, we're looking at the voter registration. Again, if you have additional records, we've been asking for that, but you haven't shared any of that with us. You just keep saying you investigated the allegations. The President. Cleta, a lot of it you don't need to be shared. I mean, to be honest, they should share it. They should share it because you want to get to an honest election. I won this election by hundreds of thousands of votes. There's no way I lost Georgia. There's no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes. I'm just going by small numbers, when you add them up, they're many times the 11,000. But I won that state by hundreds of thousands of votes. Do you think it's possible that they shredded ballots in Fulton County? Because that's what the rumor is. And also that Dominion took out machines. That Dominion is really moving fast to get rid of their, uh, machinery. Do you know anything about that? Because that's illegal, right? Germany. This is Ryan Germany. No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County. The President. But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts? Germany. No. The President. Are you sure, Ryan? Germany. I'm sure. I'm sure, Mr. President. The President. What about, what about the ballots. The shredding of the ballots. Have they been shredding ballots? Germany. The only investigation that we have into that — they have not been shredding any ballots. There was an issue in Cobb County where they were doing normal office shredding, getting rid of old stuff, and we investigated that. But this stuff from, you know, from you know past elections. The President. It doesn't pass the smell test because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, and now what they're saying, ""Oh, we're just cleaning up the office."" You know. Raffensperger. Mr. President, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything. The President. Oh this isn't social media. This is Trump media. It's not social media. It's really not; it's not social media. I don't care about social media. I couldn't care less. Social media is Big Tech. Big Tech is on your side, you know. I don't even know why you have a side because you should want to have an accurate election. And you're a Republican. Raffensperger. We believe that we do have an accurate election. The President. No, no you don't. No, no you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — Okay. So you sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn't want to go into. And you said it would be open to the public. So we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. But we didn't want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn't give it to us. Now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public? And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? They don't want to find, you know they don't want to find anything. Someday you'll tell me the reason why, because I don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. But why don't you want to find? Germany. Mr. President, we chose Cobb County — The President. Why don't you want to find . . . What? Germany. Sorry, go ahead. The President. So why did you do Cobb County? We didn't even request — we requested Fulton County, not Cobb County. Go ahead, please. Go ahead. Germany. We chose Cobb County because that was the only county where there's been any evidence submitted that the signature verification was not properly done. The President. No, but I told you. We're not, we're not saying that. Mitchell. We did say that. The President. Fulton County. Look. Stacey, in my opinion, Stacey is as dishonest as they come. She has outplayed you . . . at everything. She got you to sign a totally unconstitutional agreement, which is a disastrous agreement. You can't check signatures. I can't imagine you're allowed to do harvesting, I guess, in that agreement. That agreement is a disaster for this country. But she got you somehow to sign that thing, and she has outsmarted you at every step. And I hate to imagine what's going to happen on Monday or Tuesday, but it's very scary to people. You know, when the ballots flow in out of nowhere. It's very scary to people. That consent decree is a disaster. It's a disaster. A very good lawyer who examined it said they've never seen anything like it. Raffensperger. Harvesting is still illegal in the state of Georgia. And that settlement agreement did not change that one iota. The President. It's not a settlement agreement, it's a consent decree. It even says consent decree on it, doesn't it? It uses the term consent decree. It doesn't say settlement agreement. It's a consent decree. It's a disaster. Raffensperger. It's a settlement agreement. The President. What's written on top of it? Raffensperger. Ryan? Germany. I don't have it in front of me, but it was not entered by the court, it's not a court order. The President. But Ryan, it's called a consent decree, is that right? On the paper. Is that right? Germany. I don't. I don't. I don't believe so, but I don't have it in front of me. The President. Okay, whatever, it's a disaster. It's a disaster. Look. Here's the problem. We can go through signature verification, and we'll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past. But you didn't do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever. Recently. And compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago, you know, or even one. And you'll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren't even signed and you have many that are forgeries. Okay, you know that. You know that. You have no doubt about that. And you will find you will be at 11,779 within minutes because Fulton County is totally corrupt, and so is she totally corrupt. And they're going around playing you and laughing at you behind your back, Brad, whether you know it or not, they're laughing at you. And you've taken a state that's a Republican state, and you've made it almost impossible for a Republican to win because of cheating, because they cheated like nobody's ever cheated before. And I don't care how long it takes me, you know, we're going to have other states coming forward — pretty good. But I won't . . . this is never . . . this is . . . We have some incredible talent said they've never seen anything . . . Now the problem is they need more time for the big numbers. But they're very substantial numbers. But I think you're going to fine that they — by the way, a little information — I think you're going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned. The ballots are corrupt, and they're brand new, and they don't have seals, and there's a whole thing with the ballots. But the ballots are corrupt. And you are going to find that they are — which is totally illegal — it is more illegal for you than it is for them because, you know, what they did and you're not reporting it. That's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. And you can't let that happen. That's a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. And that's a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I've heard. And they are removing machinery, and they're moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds. And you can't let it happen, and you are letting it happen. You know, I mean, I'm notifying you that you're letting it happen. So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state. And flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is — it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. If it was a mistake, I don't know. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake. It was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away. I mean, you know, it's not a problem that's going away. Germany. This is Ryan. We're looking into every one of those things that you mentioned. The President. Good. But if you find it, you've got to say it, Ryan. Germany. . . . Let me tell you what we are seeing. What we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. These are investigators from our office, these are investigators from GBI, and they're looking, and they're good. And that's not what they're seeing. And we'll keep looking, at all these things. The President. Well, you better check on the ballots because they are shredding ballots, Ryan. I'm just telling you, Ryan. They're shredding ballots. And you should look at that very carefully. Because that's so illegal. You know, you may not even believe it because it's so bad. But they're shredding ballots because they think we're going to eventually get there . . . because we'll eventually get into Fulton. In my opinion, it's never too late. . . . So, that's the story. Look, we need only 11,000 votes. We have are far more than that as it stands now. We'll have more and more. And . . . do you have provisional ballots at all, Brad? Provisional ballots? Raffensperger. Provisional ballots are allowed by state law. The President. Sure, but I mean, are they counted, or did you just hold them back because they, you know, in other words, how many provisional ballots do you have in the state? Raffensperger. We'll get you that number. The President. Because most of them are made out to the name Trump. Because these are people that were scammed when they came in. And we have thousands of people that have testified or that want to testify. When they came in, they were proudly going to vote on November 3. And they were told, ""I'm sorry, you've already been voted for, you've already voted."" The women, men started screaming, ""No. I proudly voted till November 3."" They said, ""I'm sorry, but you've already been voted for, and you have a ballot."" And these people are beside themselves. So they went out, and they filled in a provisional ballot, putting the name Trump on it. And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent Trump. I mean 100 percent Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in, I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100 percent for Trump — for Biden — even though Trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100 percent for Biden. And do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it? Mitchell. I know about it, but — The President. Okay, Cleta, I'm not asking you, Cleta, honestly. I'm asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, I mean 100 percent, for Biden. Do you know about that? Germany. I don't know about that. I do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat. This was a mix of 'em. The President. No, but this was. That's okay. But I got like 78 percent of the military. These ballots were all for . . . They didn't tell me overseas. Could be overseas, too, but I get votes overseas, too, Ryan, in all fairness. No they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for Biden. And that is criminal. You know, that's criminal. Okay. That's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here. I don't know, look, Brad. I got to get . . . I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality. But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it's very dangerous for you to say that. I just, I just don't know why you don't want to have the votes counted as they are. Like even you when you went and did that check. And I was surprised because, you know . . . And we found a few thousand votes that were against me. I was actually surprised because the way that check was done, all you're doing, you know, recertifying existing votes and, you know, and you were given votes and you just counted them up, and you still found 3,000 that were bad. So that was sort of surprising that it came down to three or five, I don't know. Still a lot of votes. But you have to go back to check from past years with respect to signatures. And if you check with Fulton County, you'll have hundreds of thousands because they dumped ballots into Fulton County and the other county next to it. So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already. Or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of Georgia because they're going to see what happened, and they're going to see what happened. I mean, I'll, I'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But, but [name] . . . I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. So that's, you know, a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. You know, [name] , the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important. You know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad? Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan? Germany. That's not accurate, Mr. President. The President. Huh. What is accurate? Germany. The numbers that we are showing are accurate. The President. No, about [name] . About early in the morning, Ryan. Where the woman took, you know, when the whole gang took the stuff from under the table, right? Do you know, do you know who those ballots, do you know who they were made out to, do you know who they were voting for? Germany. No, not specifically. The President. Did you ever check? Germany. We did what I described to you earlier — The President. No no no — did you ever check the ballots that were scanned by [name] , a known political operative, balloteer? Did ever check who those votes were for? Germany. We looked into that situation that you described. The President. No, they were 100 percent for Biden. 100 percent. There wasn't a Trump vote in the whole group. Why don't you want to find this, Ryan? What's wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. But, but I'm just curious, why wouldn't, why do you keep fighting this thing? It just doesn't make sense. We're way over the 17,779, right? We're way over that number, and just if you took just [name] , we're over that number by five, five or six times when you multiply that times three. And every single ballot went to Biden, and you didn't know that, but now you know it. So tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers. For instance, I'm hearing Ryan that he's probably, I'm sure a great lawyer and everything, but he's making statements about those ballots that he doesn't know. But he's making them with such — he did make them with surety. But now I think he's less sure because the answer is, they all went to Biden, and that alone wins us the election by a lot. You know, so. Raffensperger. Mr. President, you have people that submit information, and we have our people that submit information. And then it comes before the court, and the court then has to make a determination. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right. The President. Why do you say that, though? I don't know. I mean, sure, we can play this game with the courts, but why do you say that? First of all, they don't even assign us a judge. They don't even assign us a judge. But why wouldn't you . . . Hey Brad, why wouldn't you want to check out [name] ? And why wouldn't you want to say, hey, if in fact, President Trump is right about that, then he wins the state of Georgia, just that one incident alone without going through hundreds of thousands of dropped ballots. You just say, you stick by, I mean I've been watching you, you know, you don't care about anything. ""Your numbers are right."" But your numbers aren't right. They're really wrong, and they're really wrong, Brad. And I know this phone call is going nowhere other than, other than ultimately, you know — Look, ultimately, I win, okay? Because you guys are so wrong. And you treated this. You treated the population of Georgia so badly. You, between you and your governor, who is down at 21, he was down 21 points. And like a schmuck, I endorsed him, and he got elected, but I will tell you, he is a disaster. The people are so angry in Georgia, I can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, I'll tell you that much right now. But why wouldn't you want to find the right answer, Brad, instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? 'Cause those numbers are so wrong? Mitchell. Mr. Secretary, Mr. President, one of the things that we have been, Alex can talk about this, we talked about it, and I don't know whether the information has been conveyed to your office, but I think what the president is saying, and what we've been trying to do is to say, look, the court is not acting on our petition. They haven't even assigned a judge. But the people of Georgia and the people of America have a right to know the answers. And you have data and records that we don't have access to. And you can keep telling us and making public statement that you investigated this and nothing to see here. But we don't know about that. All we know is what you tell us. What I don't understand is why wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to try to get to the bottom, compare the numbers, you know, if you say, because . . . to try to be able to get to the truth because we don't have any way of confirming what you're telling us. You tell us that you had an investigation at the State Farm Arena. I don't have any report. I've never seen a report of investigation. I don't know that is. I've been pretty involved in this, and I don't know. And that's just one of 25 categories. And it doesn't even. And as I, as the president said, we haven't even gotten into the Dominion issue. That's not part of our case. It's not part of, we just didn't feel as though we had any to be able to develop — The President. No, we do have a way, but I don't want to get into it. We found a way . . . excuse me, but we don't need it because we're only down 11,000 votes, so we don't even need it. I personally think they're corrupt as hell. But we don't need that. All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes. So we don't need that. I'm not looking to shake up the whole world. We won Georgia easily. We won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But if you go by basic, simple numbers, we won it easily, easily. So we're not giving Dominion a pass on the record. We don't need Dominion because we have so many other votes that we don't need to prove it any more than we already have. Attorney Kurt Hilbert. Mr. President and Cleta, this is Kurt Hilbert, if I might interject for a moment. Ryan, I would like to suggest that just four categories that have already been mentioned by the president that have actually hard numbers of 24,149 votes that were counted illegally. That in and of itself is sufficient to change the results or place the outcome in doubt. We would like to sit down with your office, and we can do it through purposes of compromise and just like this phone call, just to deal with that limited category of votes. And if you are able to establish that our numbers are not accurate, then fine. However, we believe that they are accurate. We've had now three to four separate experts looking at these numbers. The President. Certified accountants looked at them. Hilbert. Correct. And this is just based on USPS data and your own secretary of state data. So that's what we would entreat and ask you to do, to sit down with us in a compromise and settlements proceeding and actually go through the registered voter IDs and the registrations. And if you can convince us that 24,149 is inaccurate, then fine. But we tend to believe that is, you know, obviously more than 11,779. That's sufficient to change the results entirely in and of itself. So what would you say to that, Mr. Germany? Germany. I'm happy to get with our lawyers, and we'll set that up. That number is not accurate. And I think we can show you, for all the ones we've looked at, why it's not. And so if that would be helpful, I'm happy to get with our lawyers and set that up with you guys. The President. Well, let me ask you, Kurt, you think that is an accurate number. That was based on the information given to you by the secretary of state's department, right? Hilbert. That is correct. That information is the minimum, most conservative data based upon the USPS data and the secretary of state's office data that has been made publicly available. We do not have the internal numbers from the secretary of state. Yet we have asked for it six times. I sent a letter over to . . . several times requesting this information, and it's been rebuffed every single time. So it stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there's something to hide. That's the problem that we have. Germany. Well, that's not the case, sir. There are things that you guys are entitled to get. And there's things that under law, we are not allowed to give out. The President. Well, you have to. Well, under law, you're not allowed to give faulty election results, okay? You're not allowed to do that. And that's what you done. This is a faulty election result. And honestly, this should go very fast. You should meet tomorrow because you have a big election coming up, and because of what you've done to the president — you know, the people of Georgia know that this was a scam — and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote. And a lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president. Okay? They hate it. And they're going to vote. And you would be respected. Really respected, if this thing could be straightened out before the election. You have a big election coming up on Tuesday. And I think that it is really is important that you meet tomorrow and work out on these numbers. Because I know, Brad, that if you think we're right, I think you're going to say, and I'm not looking to blame anybody, I'm just saying, you know, and, you know, under new counts, and under new views, of the election results, we won the election. You know? It's very simple. We won the election. As the governors of major states and the surrounding states said, there is no way you lost Georgia. As the Georgia politicians say, there is no way you lost Georgia. Nobody. Everyone knows I won it by hundreds of thousands of votes. But I'll tell you it's going to have a big impact on Tuesday if you guys don't get this thing straightened out fast. Meadows. Mr. President, this is Mark. It sounds like we've got two different sides agreeing that we can look at those areas, and I assume that we can do that within the next 24 to 48 hours, to go ahead and get that reconciled so that we can look at the two claims and making sure that we get the access to the secretary of state's data to either validate or invalidate the claims that have been made. Is that correct? Germany. No, that's not what I said. I'm happy to have our lawyers sit down with Kurt and the lawyers on that side and explain to him, hey, here's, based on what we've looked at so far, here's how we know this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong, this is wrong. Meadows. So what you're saying, Ryan, let me let me make sure . . . so what you're saying is you really don't want to give access to the data. You just want to make another case on why the lawsuit is wrong? Germany. I don't think we can give access to data that's protected by law. But we can sit down with them and say — The President. But you're allowed to have a phony election? You're allowed to have a phony election, right? Germany. No, sir. The President. When are you going to do signature counts, when are you going to do signature verification on Fulton County, which you said you were going to do, and now all of a sudden, you're not doing it. When are you doing that? Germany. We are going to do that. We've announced — Hilbert. To get to this issue of the personal information and privacy issue, is it possible that the secretary of state could deputize the lawyers for the president so that we could access that information and private information without you having any kind of violation? The President. Well, I don't want to know who it is. You guys can do it very confidentially. You can sign a confidentiality agreement. That's okay. I don't need to know names. But on this stuff that we're talking about, we got all that information from the secretary of state. Meadows. Yeah. So let me let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together, you know, when we get off of this phone call, if you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we've got with your attorneys where we can we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, I can you say they were only two dead people who would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. And that may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there are more than that. But at the same time, I think it's important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that's the good next step. Hopefully we can, we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately. The President. Well, why don't my lawyers show you where you got the information. It will show the secretary of state, and you don't even have to look at any names. We don't want names. We don't care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about you. She's going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she's done to this party is unbelievable, I tell you. And I only ran against her once. And that was with a guy named Brian Kemp, and I beat her. And if I didn't run, Brian wouldn't have had even a shot, either in the general or in the primary. He was dead, dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was. But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. I would like you . . . for the attorneys . . . I'd like you to perhaps meet with Ryan, ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you're going to have people just not voting. They don't want to vote. They hate the state, they hate the governor, and they hate the secretary of state. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you, you know, they like you. They can't believe what they found. They want more people like you. So, look, can you get together tomorrow? And, Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple. And everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes out. It's okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. And the real truth is, I won by 400,000 votes. At least. That's the real truth. But we don't need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. And are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan? Germany. I'll get with Chris, the lawyer who's representing us in the case, and see when he can get together with Kurt. Raffensperger. Ryan will be in touch with the other attorney on this call, Mr. Meadows. Thank you, President Trump, for your time. The President. Okay, thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.

I won both of them. It\'s amazing. [cheers and applause] And I actually did much better on the second one. It\'s great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country.

One of the most important elections, really. It\'s really not runoff. It\'s elections because it\'s a biggie. Our country\'s depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. And you\'ve gotta swamp them because everything\'s so crooked around. I mean not, and not here. They were saying, ""Oh, he\'s complaining about Georgia."" No, no. I\'m complaining about eight different states, uh, and I think we\'re gonna win them all. You\'re gonna get everyone you know. You\'re gonna show up at the polls in record numbers. You gotta swamp \'em and together we\'re gonna defeat the Democrat extremists and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue. And where\'s David? David, David. He—we love our David. I know David so well. He\'s respected and loved by everyone. And someone that has really been a star in Washington, Kelly Loeffler.

One thing I've learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don't have? They never forget. They never forget. And people are gonna find that out because, uh, we have to go and we have to go all the way and that's what's happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks.

They wanna go and vote and make sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don\'t let you say, ""I\'m sorry, somebody else has already voted for you.""

Now they don\'t wanna talk about it. Unless they can say something bad about you, they don\'t wanna talk about it. So, if we talk about certain subjects, that you\'ve been watching over the last six months, all of a sudden, they were getting clobbered, so they went tone—stone cold silent. Big tech, the fake news media, they go silent anymore. They don\'t talk about it, and that is the beginning of communism. That\'s exactly what happens.', ""Because I think they hate our country, and they despise Georgia values. And I think a lot of you despise them.

One of the largest–actually–the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won, went to a second term, or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That\'s a record, and they said we didn\'t win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. And I think we have one that we\'re waiting for, right? Did you see the one in–hello, Mike. How are you, Mike? Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman–they keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. ""She\'s up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes."" That\'s ahhh— same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead–and Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man.

Then your wacky Secretary of State said two people, two people. Now, I don\'t know how many people are on that list, but it\'s a lot of people. Two thousand, five hundred and six ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren\'t all there, but they did a lot of work. I paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. Four thousand five hundred and two illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state\'s voter rolls. Well, that\'s sort of strange. Eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-five illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can\'t believe that happened. Sixty-six thousand votes—you have to understand, we\'re down by a little more than 11,000. So, every one of these is determinative. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don\'t know. I mean, I can\'t tell. They moved out, ah, let\'s go back. Usually takes a little time, right? You know. We moved out. Let\'s go back, darling.', ""Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. Forty-eight out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by for [sic]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I'm going over individual. In all of the swing states. Now they'll check this out and that's fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent officials suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in.

Georgia Secretary of State agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody's ever seen one like this. I want, I wanna just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners.

But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your President? I don\'t think it should. I don\'t think it should. I don\'t think that Kelly feels it should. I don\'t think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots were illegally harvested. Can\'t do that.

In addition, Democrat state Supreme Court judges and Democrat Secretary of State effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines, and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat-controlled areas. And I say this because you can't let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There's an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can't explain it. Four hundred thousand previously unreported mail-in ballots magically appeared. They couldn't explain it.

In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, were processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa Clause, and it wouldn't pick it up.

I wanna read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. ""Dear Mr. President, as chairman of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia.""', ""You don't hear this from your Secretary of State, and you don't hear this from your Governor, and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you. But the Governor won't let 'em hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia's 2020 general election. The Committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, discussed in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the Committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd, 2020, general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don't know where they come from."", ""The Committee then heard—and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives—the Committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion's voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing stand out and require a forensic audor [sic] of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted. The Governor will not let us do it. We've been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election. He won't let us do it. Why won't he let us do it? There's only one reason I can think of. First, the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That's the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's intent. So, they're going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I, you know, I think that voter meant something other. He doesn't want Trump. Let's just switch it around. Think of that. They're trying to determine the voter's intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody. [cheers and applause]"", ""Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a–I don't say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. [cheers and applause] I don't say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second, and Biden came in waaaay low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can't get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn't come in first. That's why."", 'Second, again from this very respected political leader, ""Second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County,"" anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. ""President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,218. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with President Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391."" [booing] That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, ""During this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet."" Now, anything connected to the internet, that\'s not good. But this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they\'re connected to the internet. Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time, in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former Vice President Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we\'re talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable. An immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion\'s voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow\'s race. You\'ve gotta be very careful. [cheers and applause]', 'And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, Chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. ""Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity, more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results. In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed or tabulated in Maricopa County officials. Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony. For example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system."" Think of that. No, but think of this.', ""Also, and you know, the press won't report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don't like this. They don't like this. They don't wanna talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don't like my phone call; everyone loved my phone call. They don't like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%–think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that's a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And nobody has a 100% voting."", ""For all of these people who think it's too late, does that mean that we're forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities?"", 'Crowd. No!!!!!', ""The President. I don't think so. I don't think so. I wanna thank those two great political leaders. And, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing.

By the way, there's no way we lost Georgia. There's no way. [cheers and applause] Rigged—that was a rigged, that was a rigged election, but we're still fighting it and you'll see what's gonna happen. We'll talk about it. And I just wanna thank you. This is some crowd. You know, Biden was here today, also. [booing] They had 14 people in three cars. No, there was no way. And I just wanna thank you. You know, I've had two elections. I won both of them. It's amazing. [cheers and applause] And I actually did much better on the second one. It's great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country. [cheers and applause] Tomorrow, each of you is gonna vote in one of the most important runoff elections of the history of our country. We're—frankly, forget about runoff. One of the most important elections, really. It's really not runoff. It's elections because it's a biggie. Our country's depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. And you've gotta swamp them because everything's so crooked around. I mean not, and not here. They were saying, ""Oh, he's complaining about Georgia."" No, no. I'm complaining about eight different states, uh, and I think we're gonna win them all. You're gonna get everyone you know. You're gonna show up at the polls in record numbers. You gotta swamp 'em and together we're gonna defeat the Democrat extremists and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue. And where's David? David, David. He—we love our David. I know David so well. He's respected and loved by everyone. And someone that has really been a star in Washington, Kelly Loeffler. Where is Kelly? [cheers and applause] Where is our Kelly? What a job you've done. Thank you. And we'll tell you about Kelly. Crowd. [chanting] Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! The President. Kelly fights for me. David fights for me, that I can tell you. And I will also say, you know, the Republicans, you have to understand, for the people that don't fight, not for me, fighting for us because we have a lot of corrupt things that happen when they don't fight. One thing I've learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don't have? They never forget. They never forget. And people are gonna find that out because, uh, we have to go and we have to go all the way and that's what's happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks. You watch what's gonna come out. Watch what's gonna be revealed. You watch. [cheers and applause] And I have to tell you that the stakes of this election could not be higher. You vote tomorrow. You wanna go out tomorrow. People wanna go out. They don't wanna do the ballot thing. Don't wanna do it unless it's the other side, in which case they just print them out. They don't wanna do it. They wanna go and vote and make sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don't let you say, ""I'm sorry, somebody else has already voted for you."" Your vote tomorrow will decide which party controls the United States Senate. The radical Democrats are trying to capture Georgia's Senate seats so they can wield unchecked, unrestrained, absolute power over every aspect of your lives. [booing] If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House–and they're not taking this White House. We're gonna fight like hell, I'll tell you right now. [cheers and applause] You know, I was telling Kelly before, you can lose and that's acceptable. You lose, you lose. You go, and you go wherever you're going, and you go and say, ""Maybe I'll do it again sometime, or maybe I won't or I'll get back to life."" But when you win in a landslide, and they steal it, and it's rigged, it's not acceptable. Not acceptable. Then you have a, a country that would be run, if these two don't win, and if we don't take the presidency, you have a country that would be run by Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden. [booing] The people of Georgia will be at the mercy of the left wing, socialist, communist, Marxists. And that's where it's going. You know, we don't like to use the word communist. How about the press? Look at 'em back there. Look at all of 'em. How about the press? [booing] That's a lot of press. Oh, boy. That's a lot of press. But, you know, they've gone silent now. They have a new thing. They used to fight me left, right. I'd go, they'd go. You know, you'd fight. I'd win. They'd win. Who knows who wins? But people would hear. Now they don't wanna talk about it. Unless they can say something bad about you, they don't wanna talk about it. So, if we talk about certain subjects, that you've been watching over the last six months, all of a sudden, they were getting clobbered, so they went tone—stone cold silent. Big tech, the fake news media, they go silent anymore. They don't talk about it, and that is the beginning of communism. That's exactly what happens. Because I think they hate our country, and they despise Georgia values. And I think a lot of you despise them. As you know there's nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they're trying to do with us. We're not gonna let it happen over the past. And I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. [cheers and applause] I hope that our great Vice President, our great Vice President comes through for us. He's a great guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much. [laughter] No, Mike is a great guy. He's a, he's a, he's a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he's gonna have a lot to say about it. And he, one thing with him, you're gonna get straight shots. He's gonna call it straight. Over the past few weeks, we've demonstrated that we won the election in a landslide. Almost 75 million people voted for me—[cheers and applause]—the most of any incumbent president in the history of our country. We won over 11 million, close to 12 million, more votes than 2016. One of the largest–actually–the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won, went to a second term, or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That's a record, and they said we didn't win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. And I think we have one that we're waiting for, right? Did you see the one in–hello, Mike. How are you, Mike? Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman–they keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. ""She's up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes."" That's ahhh— same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead–and Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man. My coattails, we swept our Republican House candidates to victory, we have a couple of great ones with us tonight, and the Democrats lost 14 seats. It was supposed to be the other way around. [cheers and applause] And when that happens, no president loses unless they play games. You don't lose. They play games. The fact is we won the presidential election. We won it big, and we're gonna win tomorrow. We're gonna win it really big. We have to. [applause] We have to. People have no idea how important that is. Tonight, our mission here in Georgia is to make sure the radical left cannot rob you of your voice and your votes in Washington. You can't lose these two people. And I really know 'em well. They're the most respected people. They're great people, and they really do have a voice and they love their state, and they love their country. The Democrats are trying to steal the White House. You cannot let them. You just can't let them steal the U.S. Senate. You can't let it happen. You can't let it happen. David and Kelly are running against the most extreme liberal candidates in the history of your state, probably in the history of our country, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. [booing] Well, you know, I beat Ossoff once running against a very fine woman, Karen, who you know, and, ah, he was at 57 and I got involved, and we drove him down to 49 and then he ended up in a runoff, and she ended up winning. Now I have to beat him a second time. And this is gonna be, hopefully, easy because when you know what he stands for, when you know what Warnock stands for, it really should be easy. Cast deciding votes to rubber stamp the agenda of AOC and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. Stacey Abrams. What's with this Stacey Abrams? [booing] You know, your Governor and your Secretary of State, they're petrified of Stacey Abrams. [booing] What's that all about? Did you see this consent decree they signed with signature verification? You can forget about it. What they have done to your state. I think most people have no idea what they've done to your state. That consent decree and these two people. I don't know. They say they're–they say they're Republicans. I really don't think they are. They can't be. Like if we wanna have a special session, because your legislature's excellent, they wanna have a spec–why wouldn't they let us have a special session? If they wanna check signatures in Fulton County, not in Cobb County. We didn't ask for Cobb County. They said, ""We'll do Cobb first and then we'll do Fulton."" They do Cobb. Then they never get to Fulton. Why wouldn't they do that? Why wouldn't they do that? That's a positive thing. Anyway, the Democrats wanna turn America. I'll be here in about a year and a half campaigning against your Governor, I guarantee you that. [cheers and applause] I shouldn't say this. I shouldn't say this because, I just don't want you to tell anybody outside of this room, other than the millions of people [pointing to media]—naw, but, you know, I endorsed him. He was in last place, and I endorsed him. He went to first place, very, like immediately, and then he won the primary, and then I gave him a couple of rallies, which I don't like doing for other people. I was telling Kelly, ""I don't do rallies for other people. I do them for me, right?"" Not that easy, a crowd like this. They say over 25,000 people. Over what? Over a couple of days' notice. And—is everybody glad you're here, right? [cheers and applause] I think so. There is no place like a Trump rally, but you know what? This is a Kelly rally and a David rally. And I wouldn't do it unless I loved 'em both. I wouldn't do it. But I'm gonna be here in a year and a half and I'm gonna be campaigning against your Governor and your crazy Secretary of State, that I can tell you. [cheers and applause] And you have great candidates. They wanna turn, the Democrats do, America into Venezuela with no jobs, no prosperity, no rights, no freedom, no future for you and your family. Here is exactly what the radical left will do if they win this runoff election, which we can't let them do tomorrow. Tomorrow's a big day. I guess we have to get over a million votes tomorrow, right, Kelly? Over a million. Alright. That's a lot of votes, Kelly, but we'll do it. And the one thing I know, if they win, I'll get no credit, and if they lose they're gonna blame Trump, these people [gestures to media]. And Kelly won't let that happen. Please win tomorrow. You're gonna win so big it's gonna be—great story. It's a great story, a very important story for our country, long beyond Georgia for our country. It's such a big story. They'll massively raise your taxes on the middle class to pay for socialism. The U.S. military, which we rebuilt. We've totally rebuilt the U.S. military, much of it coming right out of Georgia. [cheers and applause] We built it right out of Georgia, a lot of it. You have incredible contractors in Georgia, military contractors, and they got plenty of our money. Spent $2.5 trillion. When I took over the military, it was absolutely a mess. It was depleted. Now it's the opposite of depleted. The U.S. military will be gutted and military families across the street and all over the state will be betrayed. Their benefits and opportunities will be slashed. Fort Benning, Fort Gordon and other Georgia military institutions will be the first on the chopping block. And by the way, they'll be forced to change the names of the bases where generations of American patriots—[booing]—trained to win two World Wars. I don't know. Fort Benning. Let's see. Give me a couple of names. I could give you some. I don't wanna give 'em the credit, but you'll name 'em. You'll name 'em after other people. [points toward crowd member] Fort Trump. Yeah. How about that? I like that. [cheers and applause] Yeah, let's change the name. Let's change it. Kelly let's change it. If they name it Trump, let's change it. No. Now they're gonna go back and say, ""He wants to have Fort Benning changed to Trump."" Watch, they'll say, ""He's asking, he's begging for Fort Benning to be changed to Trump."" No, no. I don't want that. The Democrats will surrender the entire U.S. manufacturing industry to China. You notice they never criticize China, right? They never criti–it's Russia, Russia, Russia. I saw it today again. Russia, Russia. Oh, Russia. Here we go. That was another great scam. I've been involved in the two greatest scams in American history, the Russian hoax, and now they are trying to steal an election from us. And we won not by a little bit. We won in numbers like nobody's seen before. [cheers and applause] If Ossoff and Warnock are elected, they will immediately threeall [sic], and you know what's gonna happen. They'll throw open American borders and allow tens of millions of illegal immigrants to pour into our country from every corner of the globe. Your schools, your hospitals and your communities will be overwhelmed. And the wall, the wall, the wall. Remember, we'll build a wall. We're gonna build a wall. And that's right, Mexico is paying for the wall. If I were here, they would be, because we were gonna charge them a nice fee, right at the entry points. And they were paying for the wall. They paid for 28,000 troops along the wall and along the border, which we don't need so much anymore, but we built almost 500 miles of wall, and they wanna rip down the wall. They wanna rip down. It's why the numbers have been so great. But now everyone's coming back up because they think this guy's gonna win. And if he wins, it's gonna be everything that they could dream for, dream up. And you know, we wanna help other people, but we can't afford to do it. We can't afford to do it. So, they're coming up now, the caravans. Remember the caravans? The caravans are starting to form. Here they come. But uh, let's, uh, let's keep this thing going. We have great support in Congress. We have good support in the Senate. I wouldn't say great. Could be better. But people will remember the people that don't support us. If they win this race, Democrats will implement nationwide catch-and-release. You know what that is? You catch a criminal, and you take his name. You say, ""You're released into our country."" I ended it. You're released. Come back in four years. We're gonna take you to court. So far nobody's ever shown up. I mean, literally, they almost don't show up. And turn our–that's when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, ""No, they don't."" I turned out to be right. Did they apologize? I don't think so. And turn our entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, setting loose tens of thousands of dangerous offenders, and putting MS-13 gang members straight into your children's schools. And you know, we've removed thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members. And I wanna thank ICE and I wanna thank Border Patrol, and I wanna thank our great law enforcement. Incredible people. They're incredible. [cheers and applause] And the people that understand those values are Kelly and David. They understand those values. And, you're with our law enforcement, right? A hundred percent. I don't have to ask her that. They'll allow heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs to flood across our borders again and poison our youth. They'll take away your healthcare. They'll eliminate private insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private insurance. You can forget about it. And you'll lose your doctor. Remember President Obama said, ""You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan."" Guess what? He said it 28 times. That was a lie. That was a lie. That turned out to be a big, great scam lie. And remember, I got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, [cheers] fighting a lot of different fronts, which really doesn't make it Obamacare anymore, by the way. They'll resume the war on Christians and attack Catholic organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor. They will ban voter ID. We want voter ID. Is that so much to ask? [cheers and applause] And institute universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting in every state. They will never be—I'll tell you this. If we don't do something fast, there will never be another fair election in America. You know, we're known for elections, and now we're being laughed at all over the world about this last election. And you've gotta swarm it tomorrow. Now, the good thing about tomorrow, it's one state so you have a lot of eyeballs watching. It's tougher than when you have 50 states ,and they do it to various, various states. I've never seen anything like it. You know, I was leading in Pennsylvania by hundreds of thousands of votes. All of a sudden, I was tied. I said, ""What happened?"" They'll make Washington DC and other liberal places the 51st, 52nd, 53rd States of the Union guaranteeing the radical left a permanent majority of the U.S. Senate and the House and the electoral college. It will make it, really, a one-party country, and the party will be the wrong party. They will pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists, and I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not stepping up to the plate. They're not stepping up. [booing] How 'bout that? We don't have—look at the Supreme Court. President of the United States. I wanna file suit. I wanna do—And they say, ""Sir, you can't, you really can't do that."" Why? So, they have legal reasons, complex legal reasons. It's wrong. If you're the President of the United States, and you get defrauded out of an election, you should be able to file a suit, but we can't do that. [cheers and applause] They say, ""Sir, you don't have standing."" How about that? I'm the President, seven states, you know, I was winning by a lot. And then all of a sudden, I was losing by a little, tiny bit, just a little, they could only go so far. They had no idea we were gonna do the kind of numbers, so that printing press was really moving. And they say, I don't have standing to bring a suit. What kind of a legal system is that? But the Supreme Court has let us down so far. Who knows? Maybe they'll come back. Maybe they'll come back. They'll pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists. Then they'll be saying, ""You know, I should have done something about this."" When they start having 24, 25, 26 justices, and they wanna have the justices rotate to the lowest courts. So, they'll rotate. These nine justices will have a great time rotating, but they're bent on destroying our Constitution and overthrowing America's founding. If the left wins these Senate seats, they will abolish the Senate--you know this. The filibuster, they will knock it out. Well, I've been saying, to be honest with you for a long time, they're gonna do that, at some point, they're gonna do that. And why don't we do it first? I said it. If they're gonna do it, you might as well do it first. And now everybody said, ""You were right."" But you know what? I wanna be wrong, because I want these two to win. Because if they win, we don't wanna do it. It's a bad thing for our country. But that would give them the power to ram through every deluded piece of left-wing legislation that they've ever wanted, that they've ever dreamt up. Your religious liberty will be gone. Your Second Amendment will be gone. Your borders and great new world will be gone. Your police departments will be gone as we know them, and your life savings will be gone. We'll be like a large-scale version of so many other countries that you look at. That are poverty. America as you know it will be over. And it will never, I believe, be able to come back again. It will be too far gone. Your vote tomorrow could lose, and it could be your last chance to save the America that we love. That's why I'm here. I don't wanna do rallies for other people. I told you. I'm here because of that. Because of David and Kelly. The far left wants to destroy our country, demolish our history, and erase everything that we hold dear. This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life. It really could be. This is so important. I mean, think of it. It's so important. It's amazing actually, that in one state you have two races simultaneously. I don't think a thing like that's ever happened before. If you don't show up, the radical Democrats will win. A lot of people say, ""Oh, well, Trump, maybe he wants it that way."" No. You know what I want? I want a great country. I want these two very special people to be elected. And I wanna be clear. You know, if those of you that know how badly screwed, we got, I wanna be clear that we can't let that happen again. We can't let that happen again. We're gonna come back, and I really believe we're gonna take what they did to us on November 3rd. We're gonna take it back. But these two people, they can't go through this. They can't go through it. [cheers and applause] If you don't go and vote, the socialists, the Marxists, will be in charge of our country. If you don't fight to save your country with everything you have, you're not gonna have a country left. I love this state. This state's been very good to me. We've had a lot of victories in this state, just had one on November 3rd actually. And, I love the people of this state. We can't let that happen. The damage they do will be permanent and will be irreversible. Can't let it happen. Nothing and no one will be able to stop them. These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense. Now I must preface that by saying, because they'll say [gestures to media], ""He just conceded."" No, no, I don't concede. [cheers and applause] So, Kelly, if I might add, I think we're gonna win, in which case we'll be the last line of defense, it's called veto, veto, veto. Veto. So tomorrow, you must get out and vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Over the last four years, David Purdue has been one of our greatest allies and strongest defenders in Washington. He's a great gentlemen. David was a critical vote in the right to pass the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We did that together—we got it done—launching an incredible economic boom. The greatest tax cuts in the history of our country, think of it. And the greatest restrictions, we were so restricted we couldn't breathe in this country. That's one of the big, I think it might've been more important in many ways than the tax cuts. You would know that [gestures toward Perdue] being one of the great businessmen of our world, right. I think it was maybe more important. When Georgia needed a strong voice in Washington after Hurricane Michael, remember Hurricane Michael? And I was down here with David, but David Purdue led the charge to get the workers and farmers of your state the relief you deserved. He said, ""Sir, can we get a billion dollars?"" And I said, ""We're gonna get it David."" And we got it very fast. And there was no mechanism to get it. You got hit with a hurricane the—like you have never seen before, came in from a location that is just very unique. It was a horrible thing. I was here for a long time with David, and he worked and he, and his uh, his kin, you know, his kin, the great Sonny Perdue, our Department of Agriculture, our Secretary of Agriculture was fantastic also. But we worked very hard, and we got the farmers and the businesses the money that they had to have. And now they're thriving. David has also been one of the most courageous advocates fighting for an immigration system that defends American workers, American wages, American families, and American jobs. He led the effort in Congress to build the wall. That's right. And Kelly helped on that she's a little bit newer to the Senate, but she helped a lot. Those last moments you were there, without you it wouldn't 've happened, actually. Cracked down on deadly sanctuary cities, and chain migration and institute on parallel protection for our great citizens. He fought to help us replaced NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA, they said it couldn't be done. A giant victory for Georgia, for workers, and for farmers all over our country. NAFTA was the worst trade deal probably ever signed. And that maybe has to exclude some of the crazy deals and things they did with China. We voted to confirm nearly 300 federal judges. We have a record on federal judges, and three Supreme Court justices, which is a tremendous thing. We have almost 300 federal judges committed to interpreting our Constitution as written. No one fights harder for the people of Georgia than David Purdue. David's opponent, Jon Ossoff is an unhinged radical leftist. He's not a Senator. He's not a Senator. That's, that's not a Senator. Ossoff said that he's very proud to be endorsed by socialist crazy Bernie Sanders. He's weak on China. He promoted Chinese propaganda, and then he failed to disclose his business ties to the Chinese communist party. Other than that, he's a wonderful guy, right? Ossoff supports the largest tax hike in American history. If they get in, Warnock and Ossoff, if they get in, you're gonna have the largest tax increase that you've ever had. It'll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country. For what? The Green New Deal. Let's rip down a building because its windows are too big. Let's build a building with no windows. Among many other things. He supports the insane Green New Deal, which would crush middle-class parents trying to raise a family. He will support the socialist takeover of American healthcare, which will lead to rationing poverty and death. Ossoff also backed the radical left-wing crusade to defund police. The last summer, he proudly joined the anti-police mob, he didn't like the police. He doesn't like our police. We love our police. [cheers and applause] Slandering our brave men and women in blue. If you vote for Jon Ossoff, he will attack our heroes. He will destroy our economy, and he will betray you and your family. And it'll happen very quickly. That's why you must vote. And really importantly, get out tomorrow. Vote for David Perdue. He's a great gentleman. He loves you. Georgia has another fantastic champion in Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly is a staunch defender of our incredible military. I'm so proud of our military. She supports the wall, and she always stands with the heroes of law enforcement, ICE, and border patrol. I hated it, Kelly, when we got ballots in from the military with Trump all over it, and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump. Boom goes into the river. That was just one of many instances of problem. Kelly is also a committed protector of your second amendment rights. With Kelly's vote, we confirmed our third new Supreme Court justice Amy Coney Barrett. [applause] Working with David, Kelly helped rescue the US economy from the China virus, passing nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saving over 1.5 million Georgia jobs, and rescuing countless small businesses all across your state—businesses that now are doing really well. And you know, we also came up with a vaccine. Nobody else would have done that. They would have done that in 10 years. Kelly and David also both strongly support my efforts to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to hardworking Americans across Georgia, and across the nation. And my reasoning is simple. I mean, we're conservative with money, but my reasoning is simple. You didn't cause this problem; this problem was caused by China. Kelly is running against a hard left extremist named Raphael Warnock. [booing] Warnock is the most radical and dangerous left-wing candidate ever to seek this office, and certainly in the state of Georgia, and he does not have your values. Warnock has publicly declared his support for socialism, and he once welcomed the anti-American communist dictator, Fidel Castro to his church. He wanted him here. He liked Castro. Thought Castro was a nice guy. Warnock said that quote, ""Nobody can serve both God and the military."" [booing] A vicious smear against thousands of patriotic service members across the state of Georgia. He wants to abolish cash bail. You see how that's working in New York City, right? Not working too well. He has called for quote, ""opening up the jails,"" and he slandered our police offices as gangsters, thugs, and bullies. The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are fringe extremists, who would wreck everything Georgia patriots hold dear to their hearts. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue share your values, and you know that. They share your values like nobody shares your values. I can tell you; they share your values. They wanna defend your interest. And they will always put America first. Did you see the other day? What a great name, America First. They announced they don't wanna do the America First policy. How crazy? Even if you're not gonna do it, which is basically protect us. We come first, right. But even, and that includes financially in every other way. Even if you don't believe it, you don't say we're gonna end America First. They want to end America First. Kelly, I'd love you to just come up and say a few words. Would that be, okay? Kelly. [cheers and applause] Crowd. [chanting] Kelly! Kelly! Kelly! Senator Kelly Loeffler. Hello, Georgia. Woo! Thank you, Georgia. I have an announcement, Georgia. On January 6th, I will object to the electoral college vote. [cheers and applause] That's right. That's right. Thank you. We're gonna get this done. All right, Georgia. But I have a very important question for you. Are you ready to show America that Georgia's a red state? [cheers and applause] That's right. That's right. Look, this President fought for us, we're fighting for him. He put America first. He put the American worker first. Thank you, Mr. President. He stood with our men and women of law enforcement. He restored our military. My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, he attacked, [booing] yeah, our police, our military. He spoke out against Israel, evangelicals, small businesses. Georgia, we have to hold the line. You have to get out and vote. Tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Georgia, we are the firewall to socialism. We have to get it done. I love you guys. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia. [cheers and applause] The President. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. That was nice. I'm glad I invited her up. Kelly, I'm glad I invited you up. That was great. Thank you, darlin'. Crowd. [chanting] Stop the steal! Stop the steal! Stop the steal! The President. That was so great. Crowd. [chanting] Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! The President. Thank you. Thank you. You know, it really is—it's fight for our country. It's really fight for our country, not fight for Trump. It's fight for our country, 'cause that's what we're fighting for. Also joining us tonight are Georgia representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene. I love Marjorie Taylor too. [cheers and applause] Where are you? Come up here. Kelly wants you to come up here. Come up. Don't mess with her. Don't mess with her. [cheers and applause] Marjorie Taylor Greene. Hello, Northwest Georgia. All right. Let me tell you something. I'm so fired up to hear Senator Kelly Loeffler. She's going to object on January 6th. [cheers and applause] Yeah! This is, this is why I believe in her. You see, when you have a strong Senator Kelly Loeffler from Georgia fighting for you, and fighting for your President, and protecting your vote, this is why you have to turn out tomorrow, right? [cheers and applause] Yes. We have to save our Senate sets—Senate seats. We have to save America and stop socialism. This is the last line. We aren't gonna hand over our Senate seats to a pastor who preaches abortion from the pulpit. [booing] No. He's, he's preaching murder of God's creation in the womb, holding a Bible in his hand. If anything, go out there and vote for the unborn tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Right. We've had enough. We're not gonna let Georgia go to two radical socialists. No. I need you all to go out there and vote. Our district has to show up. We've gotta stop this attack. Stop our Senate seats from being hand over to these radicals. And we're gonna fight for President Trump on January 6th. [cheers and applause] God bless Georgia, God bless America. Let's do this. [cheers and applause] Crowd. [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! The President. I also wanna introduce two great warriors, friends of mine, Andrew Clyde and Jody Hice. Jody, thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. Great job. We have another friend of ours, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [cheers and applause] And Mike Lee is here too, but I'm a little angry at him today. Where's Mike Lee, where is he? I'm a little angry at you today, but that's okay. State representative Vernon Jones. What a great guy he is. [applause] A great man. And an early supporter of mine who's also on the ballot tomorrow, Public Service Commissioner Bubba McDonald. Bubba. [cheers and applause] Good. You're gonna do great. Crowd. [chanting] Bubba! Bubba! Bubba! Bubba! The President. Great guy. Thank you, Bubba. Thank you. Good luck tomorrow. You'll do well. Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Schaefer, and he's fighting. He's out there. He is fighting. He is fighting. By the way, I also wanna say hello to, Kelly's husband is one of the great entrepreneurs in our country. He's respected by everybody. He's a tough guy, but he is a sweetheart, and he loves your state. I just wanna say hello. Do you mind? Okay. He doesn't want that. He doesn't want it, but I will tell, you he's respected as a businessman, respected by everybody, and gives tremendous amounts of money to charity and everything else. Thank you very much. Also, uh, a friend of mine, and you know, I don't know what it is. I'm not so good with the bikes. You know, I sort of say, maybe I stay away from it a little bit, but Chris Cox is Bikers for Trump. And he's the founder, and he had more people show up for me. Whenever I saw, I'd go to places, I'd have two, three, 4,000 bikes, and Secret Service would go crazy. I'd say, ""No, I'm so happy."" And they wouldn't do it for any other reason. They just wanted to protect their future President. This was before I won, they were with me for whatever reason, bikers like me. And I like them. Chris Cox, wherever you are Chris Cox. [cheers and applause] Where is Chris? Right? I don't know why the bikers like me, Chris, but they do. But I like you guys a lot, and you're great. We go to speeches, and we'd be packed, and we couldn't even get them, they didn't even wanna be inside. They stood outside. And they were protecting their President when I became President, I never felt safer in my life. Thank you. True. That's true. Another man who's, uh, respected by everybody, a friend of mine. David McIntosh, Club for Growth. David, David. Thank you, David. Respected by everybody. And I wanna thank Don Jr. Did he do a good job tonight? I watched. [cheers and applause] Where is Don? Don is great. I love Don. He sorta has—they love our Don, but he's, uh, he's working hard, and I wanna thank Don and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has been incredible. And I also, uh, came with somebody who people like a lot, people like her a lot. I don't know. She doesn't really like the concept of running for office. She says, ""What do I need it for, Dad?"" Ivanka. Where's Ivanka? [cheers and applause] Come on, come, come. Should we get Ivanka up yes, right? [cheers and applause] Come on up here, honey. Ivanka Trump. Hello Georgia. It is so incredible to be back here with so many amazing, hardworking Georgia families who are fighting for our children's future. Each one of you. And it's so great to be back in Georgia with this warrior, my father, the people's President. [cheers and applause] He is a tireless, a tireless champion for all of you, and he will never stop fighting. And by his side are two amazing Senators that we have to send back to the Senate and send a resounding message that patriotism is alive and well in Georgia. [cheers and applause] And Georgia is gonna keep freedom alive in America. Please vote. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia, and God bless America. And God bless our President. [cheers and applause] The President. Thank you, Ivanka. Thanks, Don. Kimberly, everybody. Thank you all. Tomorrow our entire nation is counting on the people of Georgia. In a way, the world is counting on the people of Georgia. The fate of our country is at stake. It's in your hands. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away. We have all [laughs; points to individual on his left]– he goes—they'll be trying though, I'll tell you that. We have all seen what our opponents are capable of doing. I ran two elections. I won both of them. [cheers] Second one, much more successful than the first. But we can't let this happen any longer. On election night, we were leading by so much. We're not gonna have that tomorrow. We're not gonna have that tomorrow night, where you're leading and then all of a sudden, boom, it's gone like magic. We won Florida and Ohio in record numbers. We won Iowa by 8.2%. Nobody's ever won those three States and lost. Never happened before. It's almost impossible unless people do a lot of–either get very lucky or they cheat. We're up 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Washington. In Wisconsin we were way up, 356,000 votes, in Georgia, 356,000. And 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It was over. I should have run up to the podium and said, thank you very much for this wonderful victory. Then maybe they wouldn't have had time to close those booths, right, the counting rooms, and do what they did. But then it all started to disappear. And I tell this story because we can't let this happen tomorrow, Kelly. So, keep your eyes open. Since the election, we have put forth indisputable evidence documenting the rampant fraud, which will be announced on Wednesday as you know. [cheers and applause] And I wanna thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that have stepped up to fight, because they've seen what happens. They know it's a fraud and not just here. You know, I watched some of the people on Fox. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to. [booing] I didn't have enough channels. And they said, ""Why is he fighting for Georgia? It's not enough."" No, I need three. I'm fighting in eight, actually, but six, and we're gonna win 'em all. [cheering] But they said, ""Why?"" So, one of the people, a very fine woman actually, but she said, ""Why is he fighting Georgia? It doesn't get him there."" I said, ""No, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me there. And we have six and maybe eight, if you look at 'em and we were leading all of them by a lot, until, like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear."" Right here in Georgia there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We were up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. Then your wacky Secretary of State said two people, two people. Now, I don't know how many people are on that list, but it's a lot of people. Two thousand, five hundred and six ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren't all there, but they did a lot of work. I paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. Four thousand five hundred and two illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's voter rolls. Well, that's sort of strange. Eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-five illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can't believe that happened. Sixty-six thousand votes—you have to understand, we're down by a little more than 11,000. So, every one of these is determinative. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don't know. I mean, I can't tell. They moved out, ah, let's go back. Usually takes a little time, right? You know. We moved out. Let's go back, darling. Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. Forty-eight out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by for [sic]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I'm going over individual. In all of the swing states. Now they'll check this out and that's fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent officials suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago. They don't wanna do it. The Secretary of State and your incompetent Governor. Although he thinks I've been a great President. [booing] They illegally flooded their States with absentee ballots, and they deployed hundreds of elicit ballot drop boxes in corrupt Democrat-run cities, among many other flagrant violations of law. They put these drop boxes there. And in a number of cases, they'd be gone for three days. They'd take them up, and where are they? Where are they? They were gone. Georgia Secretary of State agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody's ever seen one like this. I want, I wanna just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners. [booing] That drastically and illegally changed the states election procedures. They never got the mandated approval from your state legislature, who by the way, you have some great people in your legislature. Some great, great people who agree with what we're saying and even more so. But think of it. They never got the approval. You have to by law, under the Constitution, you can't just do these deals and not get the approval. And your Secretary of State or whoever it was, made this horrible consent decree, horrible, which got rid of so much safety. It's a disgraceful thing. And it was only approved by your local politicians, him, and local judges. You can't do that. You have to have your state legislatures do it. That's true with all States. Tens of thousands of votes are missing. We go all over the world telling people how to run their elections, and we don't even know how to run ours. The most unhappy person right now, anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton. Because she's asking the Democrat party, why the hell didn't you do this for me? [laughter] True. Why didn't you do it for me Crowd. [chanting] Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! The President. Why the hell didn't you? You notice how quiet she's been? I shouldn't have said that, now tonight she'll–but you notice how quiet–she's furious, because she said, ""Don't forget, I won Michigan by 10,000 votes."" We did much better. As I said, this time. Much, much better, but I won Michigan from her by 10,000 votes. I won Wisconsin by a small, you know—I mean, they couldda done that one and not get caught. We caught 'em, we caught 'em. And I say to people like Mike Lee, that are here and Lindsey, I say, if they got approved and verified, they use the word verified, votes that are fraudulent. And then we find out after, 'cause you can't do it that quickly. It doesn't go that quickly. It's a lot of work and a lot of votes and a lot of people. And then we find out that they were frauds like in one state where you had, let's say you lost by 25,000 votes. They verify it. And that's supposed to be the end. But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your President? I don't think it should. I don't think it should. I don't think that Kelly feels it should. I don't think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots were illegally harvested. Can't do that. Not allowed to. Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal unmanned drop boxes were put out statewide. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under Wisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally. By the way, I lost the–it was razor thin. There's 170,000 votes. The margin in Wisconsin is only 20,000 votes. So, this issue alone would have won that state for us many times over, we were leading at 10 o'clock in the evening by a lot. In Pennsylvania, there were 205,000 more ballots cast than there were voters. How do you get around that one? Which remains completely unexplained. You have great senators and representatives there and nobody can explain it but think of that. And in other places too, you had more ballots than you had voters. You had more votes, think of it, then you had voters by a lot. In addition, Democrat state Supreme Court judges and Democrat Secretary of State effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines, and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat-controlled areas. And I say this because you can't let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There's an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can't explain it. Four hundred thousand previously unreported mail-in ballots magically appeared. They couldn't explain it. And all of a sudden, they just happened to find 400,000. That's a lot of people. Amazing. [booing] And the Pennsylvania legislature is not happy. Pennsylvania also had an estimated 8,000 dead voters, 55,000 ballots received back before they were even sent. How about that? The ballots were received, but they weren't sent yet. Oh, get them out fast please. Many more with no mail date and 14,000 ballots illegally cast by out-of-state voters. Those are numbers, and those are numbers we got from them. So, they can't say, oh, the numbers aren't so good. In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, were processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa Clause, and it wouldn't pick it up. Didn't pick up anything. More than 42,000 people in Nevada double voted. That's more than we needed, by far. In Arizona more than 36,000 votes were cast by non-citizens. And there were 11,000 more ballots than there were voters. It seems to be a trait, doesn't it? This was like at the Super Bowl, where you have 15 cameras and they'd say camera number four, you're on. Camera number three, you're on. In Michigan, according to one analyst, over 35,000 ballots listed no address, over 13 ballots were cast by non-residents and an estimated 17,000 ballots were cast by dead people. Some dead people, by the way, also requested an application it's true. Those are the ones that really bothered me. They not only vote, but they request an application. That's a double. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting machines. [booing] And I want you to watch this very carefully tomorrow everybody, you have to watch it carefully. I wanna read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. ""Dear Mr. President, as chairman of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia."" You don't hear this from your Secretary of State, and you don't hear this from your Governor, and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you. But the Governor won't let 'em hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia's 2020 general election. The Committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, discussed in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the Committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd, 2020, general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don't know where they come from. The Committee then heard—and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives—the Committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion's voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing stand out and require a forensic audor [sic] of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted. The Governor will not let us do it. We've been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election. He won't let us do it. Why won't he let us do it? There's only one reason I can think of. First, the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That's the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's intent. So, they're going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I, you know, I think that voter meant something other. He doesn't want Trump. Let's just switch it around. Think of that. They're trying to determine the voter's intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody. [cheers and applause] Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a–I don't say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. [cheers and applause] I don't say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second, and Biden came in waaaay low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can't get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn't come in first. That's why. Second, again from this very respected political leader, ""Second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County,"" anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. ""President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,218. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with President Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391."" [booing] That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, ""During this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet."" Now, anything connected to the internet, that's not good. But this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they're connected to the internet. Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time, in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former Vice President Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we're talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable. An immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion's voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow's race. You've gotta be very careful. [cheers and applause] And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, Chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. ""Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity, more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results. In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed or tabulated in Maricopa County officials. Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony. For example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system."" Think of that. No, but think of this. Also, and you know, the press won't report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don't like this. They don't like this. They don't wanna talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don't like my phone call; everyone loved my phone call. They don't like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%–think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that's a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And nobody has a 100% voting. For all of these people who think it's too late, does that mean that we're forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities? Crowd. No!!!!! The President. I don't think so. I don't think so. I wanna thank those two great political leaders. And, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing. Hundreds of thousands of votes are missing. The only way to combat the Democrat fraud is to flood your polling places with a historic tidal wave of Republican voters tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Because at a certain point, the machines are gonna explode. They almost did with me, unfortunately they didn't quite get there, but we'll figure that out. And I just want Mike Lee to listen to this when I'm talking, because you know what? We need his vote. This election is your chance to stand up to the corrupt Democrat machine and show them that the American people are still in charge. [cheers and applause] With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been anything like this. Kelly, when did I say, we'll do this, like two days ago, three days ago, right? And look at this, and we love you all for being here, we really do. [cheers and applause] I'm glad the weather's good, we love you all. But there's never been a movement like this. I say it all the time, and the politicians, the lame stream medias, I call them affectionately, if that weren't true, they'd say, ""That's wrong."" There's never been a movement like this. I mean, you have people that won one state, and they become world-famous for the rest of their lives. You have people that came in second in New Hampshire and their world–we won everything, and we won it now a second time. Hate to bore you with that expression. But we won it now a second time. And I don't wanna win it a third time, I really wanna win it the second time—it's a lot easier[?]. [cheers and applause] Somebody came up to me today, Kelly, and they said, ""Sir, you're way up in four years, nobody can come close to me."" I said, ""I'm not interested in four years, I'm interested in like eight weeks ago."" [cheers and applause] Four years. Four years is a long time. It's actually two and two, you know, we'll take back the House for Kevin—and Marjorie. Jodi. We'll bring back the House, right? We'll bring back the House. Crowd. [chanting] Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Now, if we didn't win, I'd be all upset. Of course, If I didn't win, you probably wouldn't want me, you know in all fairness. A big difference between losing and winning and having it stolen. No, but they talk about four years, Sir, you have it made, nobody can come close, and I say, ""Nope, we're gonna—we go this way first."" And I think we're gonna do it. I really believe, because there's no way we could have won every single state, and for Fox, not one state, this is one of many. We win every state, and they're gonna have this guy be president and he can't speak, he can't talk. Already, we've achieved more than anyone thought possible. And we are just getting started. And, and honestly, it's you, it's amazing what happened. I don't even know why the hell I say let's have a rally. We have a rally and thousands and thousands of people. [cheers and applause] Honestly, there's never been—I'll go out on the extreme—there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. And, the election is over, the presidential election, and we have a big one tomorrow, but there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. Our economy is coming back. It's roaring back. Our stock market is an all-time high. Who would have thought that? We're rounding the turn because of, the turn because of what we did with the vaccines. And nobody else would have done it, it would have taken so long. The economy boomed at 33.4% last quarter, that's the fastest rate ever recorded. And we're talking about pandemic, during a pandemic. We've already slashed the unemployment rate in half. And for decades, our politicians spend trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. You know, we're bringing many of our great troops home. I mean, I hate to say it, [cheers] but—gotta do it. We've been in Afghanistan for 19 years; I think that's enough. I think that's enough. We've got um a lot of—very few left and, uh, very proud. Nothing worse than going to Dover and meeting the parents of our great warriors that have fallen, our great warriors coming home so badly wounded or dead. And, on countries that many of you have never even heard about. So, we bring our soldiers home. We've been incredible warriors; we can beat anybody. Nobody has our equipment, nobody has our military, nobody has our people, but we aren't over there to be policemen. We're not over there to be policing, they're warriors, they're fighters, and that's what we want them for. That's what we have to have them for. But we brought a lot of 'em home. We are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we're bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back to the USA where they belong. [cheers and applause] But everything that we've achieved together is on the line tomorrow. Our fight to take back our country from the big donors, the big media, and the horrendous big tech giants that our politicians, not these two politicians, are afraid to attack. Section 230, we have to get rid of Section 230, politicians—[cheers and applause]—or you're not gonna have a country very long, taking away all your rights. If you wanna send a message to the powerful forces that are trying to control your country, you must get out and vote tomorrow for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. [cheers and applause] With your help, we're gonna continue our mission to save America, and we're gonna continue our mission of America first. It's very simple. [cheers and applause] Each of us here tonight is united by the same core vision, and the same timeless American values. We love our country. Together, we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the center of American life. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, which they wanna take away from you. [cheers and applause] And, we will always support the heroes of law enforcement. [cheers and applause] We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will preserve peace through strength. You know when I first got elected, and before I got elected, in 2015 and 2016, before they were in debates and everyone said, ""Oh, he's gonna cause Wars, he's gonna cause wars."" I think I'm the only president in many, many decades that didn't get into a war, right. [cheers and applause] Remember North Korea was gonna be a tremendous nuclear fight, and all this, what happened with that? I got along very well with Kim Jong-un. I don't think that Joe's going to based on what I've heard, but, but I got along very well with him. And, you know, people say, ""Whatever happened with North Korea,"" we got along well. But, you know, they all said that, with my personality, I'll be in a big war very soon within the first two weeks. What happened? What happened? And they don't wanna mess with us either, that I can tell you. David and Kelly will protect Social Security and Medicare, and they will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. [cheers and applause] We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. [cheers and applause] And, we will live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, and it'll stay that way. [cheers and applause] From Atlanta to Augusta, to Savannah, to Columbus, from Athens—And, I wanna say hello to Herschel Walker, Athens. [cheers and applause] Herschel. 10.2 yards a carry for a while, he made a lot of quarterbacks look very good. We love Herschel. To right here in Dalton, Georgia, we inherit the legacy of generations of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, and won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. [cheers and applause] And proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny and dignity has only just begun. We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. [cheers and applause] Because we are Americans, and we are from Georgia—[cheers and applause]—and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. [cheers and applause] We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market. We have made America strong again, look at that arm, look at that. We have made America proud again, we're proud of our country. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Go get 'em, David, go get 'em, Kelly, go get 'emm tomorrow. [cheers and applause] [Music: Village People ""YMCA""]","[Music: Lee Greenwood, ""God Bless the U.S.A.""] Crowd. [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! The President. Well, I wanna thank you very much. Hello, Georgia. By the way, there's no way we lost Georgia. There's no way. [cheers and applause] Rigged—that was a rigged, that was a rigged election, but we're still fighting it and you'll see what's gonna happen. We'll talk about it. And I just wanna thank you. This is some crowd. You know, Biden was here today, also. [booing] They had 14 people in three cars. No, there was no way. And I just wanna thank you. You know, I've had two elections. I won both of them. It's amazing. [cheers and applause] And I actually did much better on the second one. It's great to be back in this incredible state, the home of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family and country. [cheers and applause] Tomorrow, each of you is gonna vote in one of the most important runoff elections of the history of our country. We're—frankly, forget about runoff. One of the most important elections, really. It's really not runoff. It's elections because it's a biggie. Our country's depending on you. The whole world is watching the people of Georgia tomorrow. And you've gotta swamp them because everything's so crooked around. I mean not, and not here. They were saying, ""Oh, he's complaining about Georgia."" No, no. I'm complaining about eight different states, uh, and I think we're gonna win them all. You're gonna get everyone you know. You're gonna show up at the polls in record numbers. You gotta swamp 'em and together we're gonna defeat the Democrat extremists and deliver a thundering victory to David Perdue. And where's David? David, David. He—we love our David. I know David so well. He's respected and loved by everyone. And someone that has really been a star in Washington, Kelly Loeffler. Where is Kelly? [cheers and applause] Where is our Kelly? What a job you've done. Thank you. And we'll tell you about Kelly. Crowd. [chanting] Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! The President. Kelly fights for me. David fights for me, that I can tell you. And I will also say, you know, the Republicans, you have to understand, for the people that don't fight, not for me, fighting for us because we have a lot of corrupt things that happen when they don't fight. One thing I've learned about Republicans, they have some difficulties, but you know a difficulty that they don't have? They never forget. They never forget. And people are gonna find that out because, uh, we have to go and we have to go all the way and that's what's happening. You watch what happens over the next couple of weeks. You watch what's gonna come out. Watch what's gonna be revealed. You watch. [cheers and applause] And I have to tell you that the stakes of this election could not be higher. You vote tomorrow. You wanna go out tomorrow. People wanna go out. They don't wanna do the ballot thing. Don't wanna do it unless it's the other side, in which case they just print them out. They don't wanna do it. They wanna go and vote and make sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don't let you say, ""I'm sorry, somebody else has already voted for you."" Your vote tomorrow will decide which party controls the United States Senate. The radical Democrats are trying to capture Georgia's Senate seats so they can wield unchecked, unrestrained, absolute power over every aspect of your lives. [booing] If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House–and they're not taking this White House. We're gonna fight like hell, I'll tell you right now. [cheers and applause] You know, I was telling Kelly before, you can lose and that's acceptable. You lose, you lose. You go, and you go wherever you're going, and you go and say, ""Maybe I'll do it again sometime, or maybe I won't or I'll get back to life."" But when you win in a landslide, and they steal it, and it's rigged, it's not acceptable. Not acceptable. Then you have a, a country that would be run, if these two don't win, and if we don't take the presidency, you have a country that would be run by Schumer, Pelosi, and Biden. [booing] The people of Georgia will be at the mercy of the left wing, socialist, communist, Marxists. And that's where it's going. You know, we don't like to use the word communist. How about the press? Look at 'em back there. Look at all of 'em. How about the press? [booing] That's a lot of press. Oh, boy. That's a lot of press. But, you know, they've gone silent now. They have a new thing. They used to fight me left, right. I'd go, they'd go. You know, you'd fight. I'd win. They'd win. Who knows who wins? But people would hear. Now they don't wanna talk about it. Unless they can say something bad about you, they don't wanna talk about it. So, if we talk about certain subjects, that you've been watching over the last six months, all of a sudden, they were getting clobbered, so they went tone—stone cold silent. Big tech, the fake news media, they go silent anymore. They don't talk about it, and that is the beginning of communism. That's exactly what happens. Because I think they hate our country, and they despise Georgia values. And I think a lot of you despise them. As you know there's nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they're trying to do with us. We're not gonna let it happen over the past. And I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. [cheers and applause] I hope that our great Vice President, our great Vice President comes through for us. He's a great guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much. [laughter] No, Mike is a great guy. He's a, he's a, he's a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he's gonna have a lot to say about it. And he, one thing with him, you're gonna get straight shots. He's gonna call it straight. Over the past few weeks, we've demonstrated that we won the election in a landslide. Almost 75 million people voted for me—[cheers and applause]—the most of any incumbent president in the history of our country. We won over 11 million, close to 12 million, more votes than 2016. One of the largest–actually–the single largest increase in the history of our country. No person that won, went to a second term, or went through an election where he got nearly 12 million votes. Nope. It never happened before. Never happened before. We made historic gains among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and we won the largest share of non-white vote of any Republican president in 60 years. We also won 18 out of 19 bellwether counties. Now, when you win just a few bellwether counties, you always win the election. We won 18 out of 19. That's a record, and they said we didn't win. We won 25 of 26 toss-up House races. And I think we have one that we're waiting for, right? Did you see the one in–hello, Mike. How are you, Mike? Did you see the one in New York where Claudia, good woman–they keep finding votes. They keep finding votes. ""She's up by 18. Oh, we just found 19 votes."" That's ahhh— same kind of stuff. Democrats were projected to gain 15 House seats and instead–and Kevin McCarthy gives us the credit. Good man. Very good man. My coattails, we swept our Republican House candidates to victory, we have a couple of great ones with us tonight, and the Democrats lost 14 seats. It was supposed to be the other way around. [cheers and applause] And when that happens, no president loses unless they play games. You don't lose. They play games. The fact is we won the presidential election. We won it big, and we're gonna win tomorrow. We're gonna win it really big. We have to. [applause] We have to. People have no idea how important that is. Tonight, our mission here in Georgia is to make sure the radical left cannot rob you of your voice and your votes in Washington. You can't lose these two people. And I really know 'em well. They're the most respected people. They're great people, and they really do have a voice and they love their state, and they love their country. The Democrats are trying to steal the White House. You cannot let them. You just can't let them steal the U.S. Senate. You can't let it happen. You can't let it happen. David and Kelly are running against the most extreme liberal candidates in the history of your state, probably in the history of our country, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. [booing] Well, you know, I beat Ossoff once running against a very fine woman, Karen, who you know, and, ah, he was at 57 and I got involved, and we drove him down to 49 and then he ended up in a runoff, and she ended up winning. Now I have to beat him a second time. And this is gonna be, hopefully, easy because when you know what he stands for, when you know what Warnock stands for, it really should be easy. Cast deciding votes to rubber stamp the agenda of AOC and Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. Stacey Abrams. What's with this Stacey Abrams? [booing] You know, your Governor and your Secretary of State, they're petrified of Stacey Abrams. [booing] What's that all about? Did you see this consent decree they signed with signature verification? You can forget about it. What they have done to your state. I think most people have no idea what they've done to your state. That consent decree and these two people. I don't know. They say they're–they say they're Republicans. I really don't think they are. They can't be. Like if we wanna have a special session, because your legislature's excellent, they wanna have a spec–why wouldn't they let us have a special session? If they wanna check signatures in Fulton County, not in Cobb County. We didn't ask for Cobb County. They said, ""We'll do Cobb first and then we'll do Fulton."" They do Cobb. Then they never get to Fulton. Why wouldn't they do that? Why wouldn't they do that? That's a positive thing. Anyway, the Democrats wanna turn America. I'll be here in about a year and a half campaigning against your Governor, I guarantee you that. [cheers and applause] I shouldn't say this. I shouldn't say this because, I just don't want you to tell anybody outside of this room, other than the millions of people [pointing to media]—naw, but, you know, I endorsed him. He was in last place, and I endorsed him. He went to first place, very, like immediately, and then he won the primary, and then I gave him a couple of rallies, which I don't like doing for other people. I was telling Kelly, ""I don't do rallies for other people. I do them for me, right?"" Not that easy, a crowd like this. They say over 25,000 people. Over what? Over a couple of days' notice. And—is everybody glad you're here, right? [cheers and applause] I think so. There is no place like a Trump rally, but you know what? This is a Kelly rally and a David rally. And I wouldn't do it unless I loved 'em both. I wouldn't do it. But I'm gonna be here in a year and a half and I'm gonna be campaigning against your Governor and your crazy Secretary of State, that I can tell you. [cheers and applause] And you have great candidates. They wanna turn, the Democrats do, America into Venezuela with no jobs, no prosperity, no rights, no freedom, no future for you and your family. Here is exactly what the radical left will do if they win this runoff election, which we can't let them do tomorrow. Tomorrow's a big day. I guess we have to get over a million votes tomorrow, right, Kelly? Over a million. Alright. That's a lot of votes, Kelly, but we'll do it. And the one thing I know, if they win, I'll get no credit, and if they lose they're gonna blame Trump, these people [gestures to media]. And Kelly won't let that happen. Please win tomorrow. You're gonna win so big it's gonna be—great story. It's a great story, a very important story for our country, long beyond Georgia for our country. It's such a big story. They'll massively raise your taxes on the middle class to pay for socialism. The U.S. military, which we rebuilt. We've totally rebuilt the U.S. military, much of it coming right out of Georgia. [cheers and applause] We built it right out of Georgia, a lot of it. You have incredible contractors in Georgia, military contractors, and they got plenty of our money. Spent $2.5 trillion. When I took over the military, it was absolutely a mess. It was depleted. Now it's the opposite of depleted. The U.S. military will be gutted and military families across the street and all over the state will be betrayed. Their benefits and opportunities will be slashed. Fort Benning, Fort Gordon and other Georgia military institutions will be the first on the chopping block. And by the way, they'll be forced to change the names of the bases where generations of American patriots—[booing]—trained to win two World Wars. I don't know. Fort Benning. Let's see. Give me a couple of names. I could give you some. I don't wanna give 'em the credit, but you'll name 'em. You'll name 'em after other people. [points toward crowd member] Fort Trump. Yeah. How about that? I like that. [cheers and applause] Yeah, let's change the name. Let's change it. Kelly let's change it. If they name it Trump, let's change it. No. Now they're gonna go back and say, ""He wants to have Fort Benning changed to Trump."" Watch, they'll say, ""He's asking, he's begging for Fort Benning to be changed to Trump."" No, no. I don't want that. The Democrats will surrender the entire U.S. manufacturing industry to China. You notice they never criticize China, right? They never criti–it's Russia, Russia, Russia. I saw it today again. Russia, Russia. Oh, Russia. Here we go. That was another great scam. I've been involved in the two greatest scams in American history, the Russian hoax, and now they are trying to steal an election from us. And we won not by a little bit. We won in numbers like nobody's seen before. [cheers and applause] If Ossoff and Warnock are elected, they will immediately threeall [sic], and you know what's gonna happen. They'll throw open American borders and allow tens of millions of illegal immigrants to pour into our country from every corner of the globe. Your schools, your hospitals and your communities will be overwhelmed. And the wall, the wall, the wall. Remember, we'll build a wall. We're gonna build a wall. And that's right, Mexico is paying for the wall. If I were here, they would be, because we were gonna charge them a nice fee, right at the entry points. And they were paying for the wall. They paid for 28,000 troops along the wall and along the border, which we don't need so much anymore, but we built almost 500 miles of wall, and they wanna rip down the wall. They wanna rip down. It's why the numbers have been so great. But now everyone's coming back up because they think this guy's gonna win. And if he wins, it's gonna be everything that they could dream for, dream up. And you know, we wanna help other people, but we can't afford to do it. We can't afford to do it. So, they're coming up now, the caravans. Remember the caravans? The caravans are starting to form. Here they come. But uh, let's, uh, let's keep this thing going. We have great support in Congress. We have good support in the Senate. I wouldn't say great. Could be better. But people will remember the people that don't support us. If they win this race, Democrats will implement nationwide catch-and-release. You know what that is? You catch a criminal, and you take his name. You say, ""You're released into our country."" I ended it. You're released. Come back in four years. We're gonna take you to court. So far nobody's ever shown up. I mean, literally, they almost don't show up. And turn our–that's when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, ""No, they don't."" I turned out to be right. Did they apologize? I don't think so. And turn our entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, setting loose tens of thousands of dangerous offenders, and putting MS-13 gang members straight into your children's schools. And you know, we've removed thousands and thousands of MS-13 gang members. And I wanna thank ICE and I wanna thank Border Patrol, and I wanna thank our great law enforcement. Incredible people. They're incredible. [cheers and applause] And the people that understand those values are Kelly and David. They understand those values. And, you're with our law enforcement, right? A hundred percent. I don't have to ask her that. They'll allow heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, and other deadly drugs to flood across our borders again and poison our youth. They'll take away your healthcare. They'll eliminate private insurance. We have 180 million people that love their private insurance. You can forget about it. And you'll lose your doctor. Remember President Obama said, ""You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan."" Guess what? He said it 28 times. That was a lie. That was a lie. That turned out to be a big, great scam lie. And remember, I got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, [cheers] fighting a lot of different fronts, which really doesn't make it Obamacare anymore, by the way. They'll resume the war on Christians and attack Catholic organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor. They will ban voter ID. We want voter ID. Is that so much to ask? [cheers and applause] And institute universal, unsolicited mail-in balloting in every state. They will never be—I'll tell you this. If we don't do something fast, there will never be another fair election in America. You know, we're known for elections, and now we're being laughed at all over the world about this last election. And you've gotta swarm it tomorrow. Now, the good thing about tomorrow, it's one state so you have a lot of eyeballs watching. It's tougher than when you have 50 states ,and they do it to various, various states. I've never seen anything like it. You know, I was leading in Pennsylvania by hundreds of thousands of votes. All of a sudden, I was tied. I said, ""What happened?"" They'll make Washington DC and other liberal places the 51st, 52nd, 53rd States of the Union guaranteeing the radical left a permanent majority of the U.S. Senate and the House and the electoral college. It will make it, really, a one-party country, and the party will be the wrong party. They will pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists, and I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They are not stepping up to the plate. They're not stepping up. [booing] How 'bout that? We don't have—look at the Supreme Court. President of the United States. I wanna file suit. I wanna do—And they say, ""Sir, you can't, you really can't do that."" Why? So, they have legal reasons, complex legal reasons. It's wrong. If you're the President of the United States, and you get defrauded out of an election, you should be able to file a suit, but we can't do that. [cheers and applause] They say, ""Sir, you don't have standing."" How about that? I'm the President, seven states, you know, I was winning by a lot. And then all of a sudden, I was losing by a little, tiny bit, just a little, they could only go so far. They had no idea we were gonna do the kind of numbers, so that printing press was really moving. And they say, I don't have standing to bring a suit. What kind of a legal system is that? But the Supreme Court has let us down so far. Who knows? Maybe they'll come back. Maybe they'll come back. They'll pack the Supreme Court with crazed extremists. Then they'll be saying, ""You know, I should have done something about this."" When they start having 24, 25, 26 justices, and they wanna have the justices rotate to the lowest courts. So, they'll rotate. These nine justices will have a great time rotating, but they're bent on destroying our Constitution and overthrowing America's founding. If the left wins these Senate seats, they will abolish the Senate--you know this. The filibuster, they will knock it out. Well, I've been saying, to be honest with you for a long time, they're gonna do that, at some point, they're gonna do that. And why don't we do it first? I said it. If they're gonna do it, you might as well do it first. And now everybody said, ""You were right."" But you know what? I wanna be wrong, because I want these two to win. Because if they win, we don't wanna do it. It's a bad thing for our country. But that would give them the power to ram through every deluded piece of left-wing legislation that they've ever wanted, that they've ever dreamt up. Your religious liberty will be gone. Your Second Amendment will be gone. Your borders and great new world will be gone. Your police departments will be gone as we know them, and your life savings will be gone. We'll be like a large-scale version of so many other countries that you look at. That are poverty. America as you know it will be over. And it will never, I believe, be able to come back again. It will be too far gone. Your vote tomorrow could lose, and it could be your last chance to save the America that we love. That's why I'm here. I don't wanna do rallies for other people. I told you. I'm here because of that. Because of David and Kelly. The far left wants to destroy our country, demolish our history, and erase everything that we hold dear. This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life. It really could be. This is so important. I mean, think of it. It's so important. It's amazing actually, that in one state you have two races simultaneously. I don't think a thing like that's ever happened before. If you don't show up, the radical Democrats will win. A lot of people say, ""Oh, well, Trump, maybe he wants it that way."" No. You know what I want? I want a great country. I want these two very special people to be elected. And I wanna be clear. You know, if those of you that know how badly screwed, we got, I wanna be clear that we can't let that happen again. We can't let that happen again. We're gonna come back, and I really believe we're gonna take what they did to us on November 3rd. We're gonna take it back. But these two people, they can't go through this. They can't go through it. [cheers and applause] If you don't go and vote, the socialists, the Marxists, will be in charge of our country. If you don't fight to save your country with everything you have, you're not gonna have a country left. I love this state. This state's been very good to me. We've had a lot of victories in this state, just had one on November 3rd actually. And, I love the people of this state. We can't let that happen. The damage they do will be permanent and will be irreversible. Can't let it happen. Nothing and no one will be able to stop them. These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense. Now I must preface that by saying, because they'll say [gestures to media], ""He just conceded."" No, no, I don't concede. [cheers and applause] So, Kelly, if I might add, I think we're gonna win, in which case we'll be the last line of defense, it's called veto, veto, veto. Veto. So tomorrow, you must get out and vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Over the last four years, David Purdue has been one of our greatest allies and strongest defenders in Washington. He's a great gentlemen. David was a critical vote in the right to pass the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We did that together—we got it done—launching an incredible economic boom. The greatest tax cuts in the history of our country, think of it. And the greatest restrictions, we were so restricted we couldn't breathe in this country. That's one of the big, I think it might've been more important in many ways than the tax cuts. You would know that [gestures toward Perdue] being one of the great businessmen of our world, right. I think it was maybe more important. When Georgia needed a strong voice in Washington after Hurricane Michael, remember Hurricane Michael? And I was down here with David, but David Purdue led the charge to get the workers and farmers of your state the relief you deserved. He said, ""Sir, can we get a billion dollars?"" And I said, ""We're gonna get it David."" And we got it very fast. And there was no mechanism to get it. You got hit with a hurricane the—like you have never seen before, came in from a location that is just very unique. It was a horrible thing. I was here for a long time with David, and he worked and he, and his uh, his kin, you know, his kin, the great Sonny Perdue, our Department of Agriculture, our Secretary of Agriculture was fantastic also. But we worked very hard, and we got the farmers and the businesses the money that they had to have. And now they're thriving. David has also been one of the most courageous advocates fighting for an immigration system that defends American workers, American wages, American families, and American jobs. He led the effort in Congress to build the wall. That's right. And Kelly helped on that she's a little bit newer to the Senate, but she helped a lot. Those last moments you were there, without you it wouldn't 've happened, actually. Cracked down on deadly sanctuary cities, and chain migration and institute on parallel protection for our great citizens. He fought to help us replaced NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA, they said it couldn't be done. A giant victory for Georgia, for workers, and for farmers all over our country. NAFTA was the worst trade deal probably ever signed. And that maybe has to exclude some of the crazy deals and things they did with China. We voted to confirm nearly 300 federal judges. We have a record on federal judges, and three Supreme Court justices, which is a tremendous thing. We have almost 300 federal judges committed to interpreting our Constitution as written. No one fights harder for the people of Georgia than David Purdue. David's opponent, Jon Ossoff is an unhinged radical leftist. He's not a Senator. He's not a Senator. That's, that's not a Senator. Ossoff said that he's very proud to be endorsed by socialist crazy Bernie Sanders. He's weak on China. He promoted Chinese propaganda, and then he failed to disclose his business ties to the Chinese communist party. Other than that, he's a wonderful guy, right? Ossoff supports the largest tax hike in American history. If they get in, Warnock and Ossoff, if they get in, you're gonna have the largest tax increase that you've ever had. It'll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country. For what? The Green New Deal. Let's rip down a building because its windows are too big. Let's build a building with no windows. Among many other things. He supports the insane Green New Deal, which would crush middle-class parents trying to raise a family. He will support the socialist takeover of American healthcare, which will lead to rationing poverty and death. Ossoff also backed the radical left-wing crusade to defund police. The last summer, he proudly joined the anti-police mob, he didn't like the police. He doesn't like our police. We love our police. [cheers and applause] Slandering our brave men and women in blue. If you vote for Jon Ossoff, he will attack our heroes. He will destroy our economy, and he will betray you and your family. And it'll happen very quickly. That's why you must vote. And really importantly, get out tomorrow. Vote for David Perdue. He's a great gentleman. He loves you. Georgia has another fantastic champion in Senator Kelly Loeffler. Kelly is a staunch defender of our incredible military. I'm so proud of our military. She supports the wall, and she always stands with the heroes of law enforcement, ICE, and border patrol. I hated it, Kelly, when we got ballots in from the military with Trump all over it, and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump. Boom goes into the river. That was just one of many instances of problem. Kelly is also a committed protector of your second amendment rights. With Kelly's vote, we confirmed our third new Supreme Court justice Amy Coney Barrett. [applause] Working with David, Kelly helped rescue the US economy from the China virus, passing nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saving over 1.5 million Georgia jobs, and rescuing countless small businesses all across your state—businesses that now are doing really well. And you know, we also came up with a vaccine. Nobody else would have done that. They would have done that in 10 years. Kelly and David also both strongly support my efforts to provide $2,000 stimulus checks to hardworking Americans across Georgia, and across the nation. And my reasoning is simple. I mean, we're conservative with money, but my reasoning is simple. You didn't cause this problem; this problem was caused by China. Kelly is running against a hard left extremist named Raphael Warnock. [booing] Warnock is the most radical and dangerous left-wing candidate ever to seek this office, and certainly in the state of Georgia, and he does not have your values. Warnock has publicly declared his support for socialism, and he once welcomed the anti-American communist dictator, Fidel Castro to his church. He wanted him here. He liked Castro. Thought Castro was a nice guy. Warnock said that quote, ""Nobody can serve both God and the military."" [booing] A vicious smear against thousands of patriotic service members across the state of Georgia. He wants to abolish cash bail. You see how that's working in New York City, right? Not working too well. He has called for quote, ""opening up the jails,"" and he slandered our police offices as gangsters, thugs, and bullies. The choice for the voters of Georgia could not be more clear. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock are fringe extremists, who would wreck everything Georgia patriots hold dear to their hearts. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue share your values, and you know that. They share your values like nobody shares your values. I can tell you; they share your values. They wanna defend your interest. And they will always put America first. Did you see the other day? What a great name, America First. They announced they don't wanna do the America First policy. How crazy? Even if you're not gonna do it, which is basically protect us. We come first, right. But even, and that includes financially in every other way. Even if you don't believe it, you don't say we're gonna end America First. They want to end America First. Kelly, I'd love you to just come up and say a few words. Would that be, okay? Kelly. [cheers and applause] Crowd. [chanting] Kelly! Kelly! Kelly! Senator Kelly Loeffler. Hello, Georgia. Woo! Thank you, Georgia. I have an announcement, Georgia. On January 6th, I will object to the electoral college vote. [cheers and applause] That's right. That's right. Thank you. We're gonna get this done. All right, Georgia. But I have a very important question for you. Are you ready to show America that Georgia's a red state? [cheers and applause] That's right. That's right. Look, this President fought for us, we're fighting for him. He put America first. He put the American worker first. Thank you, Mr. President. He stood with our men and women of law enforcement. He restored our military. My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, he attacked, [booing] yeah, our police, our military. He spoke out against Israel, evangelicals, small businesses. Georgia, we have to hold the line. You have to get out and vote. Tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Georgia, we are the firewall to socialism. We have to get it done. I love you guys. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia. [cheers and applause] The President. Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. That was nice. I'm glad I invited her up. Kelly, I'm glad I invited you up. That was great. Thank you, darlin'. Crowd. [chanting] Stop the steal! Stop the steal! Stop the steal! The President. That was so great. Crowd. [chanting] Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! The President. Thank you. Thank you. You know, it really is—it's fight for our country. It's really fight for our country, not fight for Trump. It's fight for our country, 'cause that's what we're fighting for. Also joining us tonight are Georgia representatives, Marjorie Taylor Greene. I love Marjorie Taylor too. [cheers and applause] Where are you? Come up here. Kelly wants you to come up here. Come up. Don't mess with her. Don't mess with her. [cheers and applause] Marjorie Taylor Greene. Hello, Northwest Georgia. All right. Let me tell you something. I'm so fired up to hear Senator Kelly Loeffler. She's going to object on January 6th. [cheers and applause] Yeah! This is, this is why I believe in her. You see, when you have a strong Senator Kelly Loeffler from Georgia fighting for you, and fighting for your President, and protecting your vote, this is why you have to turn out tomorrow, right? [cheers and applause] Yes. We have to save our Senate sets—Senate seats. We have to save America and stop socialism. This is the last line. We aren't gonna hand over our Senate seats to a pastor who preaches abortion from the pulpit. [booing] No. He's, he's preaching murder of God's creation in the womb, holding a Bible in his hand. If anything, go out there and vote for the unborn tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Right. We've had enough. We're not gonna let Georgia go to two radical socialists. No. I need you all to go out there and vote. Our district has to show up. We've gotta stop this attack. Stop our Senate seats from being hand over to these radicals. And we're gonna fight for President Trump on January 6th. [cheers and applause] God bless Georgia, God bless America. Let's do this. [cheers and applause] Crowd. [chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA! The President. I also wanna introduce two great warriors, friends of mine, Andrew Clyde and Jody Hice. Jody, thank you. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you very much. Great job. We have another friend of ours, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [cheers and applause] And Mike Lee is here too, but I'm a little angry at him today. Where's Mike Lee, where is he? I'm a little angry at you today, but that's okay. State representative Vernon Jones. What a great guy he is. [applause] A great man. And an early supporter of mine who's also on the ballot tomorrow, Public Service Commissioner Bubba McDonald. Bubba. [cheers and applause] Good. You're gonna do great. Crowd. [chanting] Bubba! Bubba! Bubba! Bubba! The President. Great guy. Thank you, Bubba. Thank you. Good luck tomorrow. You'll do well. Georgia Republican Party Chairman David Schaefer, and he's fighting. He's out there. He is fighting. He is fighting. By the way, I also wanna say hello to, Kelly's husband is one of the great entrepreneurs in our country. He's respected by everybody. He's a tough guy, but he is a sweetheart, and he loves your state. I just wanna say hello. Do you mind? Okay. He doesn't want that. He doesn't want it, but I will tell, you he's respected as a businessman, respected by everybody, and gives tremendous amounts of money to charity and everything else. Thank you very much. Also, uh, a friend of mine, and you know, I don't know what it is. I'm not so good with the bikes. You know, I sort of say, maybe I stay away from it a little bit, but Chris Cox is Bikers for Trump. And he's the founder, and he had more people show up for me. Whenever I saw, I'd go to places, I'd have two, three, 4,000 bikes, and Secret Service would go crazy. I'd say, ""No, I'm so happy."" And they wouldn't do it for any other reason. They just wanted to protect their future President. This was before I won, they were with me for whatever reason, bikers like me. And I like them. Chris Cox, wherever you are Chris Cox. [cheers and applause] Where is Chris? Right? I don't know why the bikers like me, Chris, but they do. But I like you guys a lot, and you're great. We go to speeches, and we'd be packed, and we couldn't even get them, they didn't even wanna be inside. They stood outside. And they were protecting their President when I became President, I never felt safer in my life. Thank you. True. That's true. Another man who's, uh, respected by everybody, a friend of mine. David McIntosh, Club for Growth. David, David. Thank you, David. Respected by everybody. And I wanna thank Don Jr. Did he do a good job tonight? I watched. [cheers and applause] Where is Don? Don is great. I love Don. He sorta has—they love our Don, but he's, uh, he's working hard, and I wanna thank Don and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who has been incredible. And I also, uh, came with somebody who people like a lot, people like her a lot. I don't know. She doesn't really like the concept of running for office. She says, ""What do I need it for, Dad?"" Ivanka. Where's Ivanka? [cheers and applause] Come on, come, come. Should we get Ivanka up yes, right? [cheers and applause] Come on up here, honey. Ivanka Trump. Hello Georgia. It is so incredible to be back here with so many amazing, hardworking Georgia families who are fighting for our children's future. Each one of you. And it's so great to be back in Georgia with this warrior, my father, the people's President. [cheers and applause] He is a tireless, a tireless champion for all of you, and he will never stop fighting. And by his side are two amazing Senators that we have to send back to the Senate and send a resounding message that patriotism is alive and well in Georgia. [cheers and applause] And Georgia is gonna keep freedom alive in America. Please vote. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Georgia, and God bless America. And God bless our President. [cheers and applause] The President. Thank you, Ivanka. Thanks, Don. Kimberly, everybody. Thank you all. Tomorrow our entire nation is counting on the people of Georgia. In a way, the world is counting on the people of Georgia. The fate of our country is at stake. It's in your hands. You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheat it away. We have all [laughs; points to individual on his left]– he goes—they'll be trying though, I'll tell you that. We have all seen what our opponents are capable of doing. I ran two elections. I won both of them. [cheers] Second one, much more successful than the first. But we can't let this happen any longer. On election night, we were leading by so much. We're not gonna have that tomorrow. We're not gonna have that tomorrow night, where you're leading and then all of a sudden, boom, it's gone like magic. We won Florida and Ohio in record numbers. We won Iowa by 8.2%. Nobody's ever won those three States and lost. Never happened before. It's almost impossible unless people do a lot of–either get very lucky or they cheat. We're up 293,000 votes in Michigan, 112,000 votes in Washington. In Wisconsin we were way up, 356,000 votes, in Georgia, 356,000. And 700,000 votes in Pennsylvania. It was over. I should have run up to the podium and said, thank you very much for this wonderful victory. Then maybe they wouldn't have had time to close those booths, right, the counting rooms, and do what they did. But then it all started to disappear. And I tell this story because we can't let this happen tomorrow, Kelly. So, keep your eyes open. Since the election, we have put forth indisputable evidence documenting the rampant fraud, which will be announced on Wednesday as you know. [cheers and applause] And I wanna thank Senator Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz and all of the incredible senators that have stepped up to fight, because they've seen what happens. They know it's a fraud and not just here. You know, I watched some of the people on Fox. I had no choice. I had no choice. I had to. [booing] I didn't have enough channels. And they said, ""Why is he fighting for Georgia? It's not enough."" No, I need three. I'm fighting in eight, actually, but six, and we're gonna win 'em all. [cheering] But they said, ""Why?"" So, one of the people, a very fine woman actually, but she said, ""Why is he fighting Georgia? It doesn't get him there."" I said, ""No, but Georgia and Pennsylvania and one other get me there. And we have six and maybe eight, if you look at 'em and we were leading all of them by a lot, until, like a miracle, it started to quickly disappear."" Right here in Georgia there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that. And here are just a few examples. Watch this for tomorrow. We were up 10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. Then your wacky Secretary of State said two people, two people. Now, I don't know how many people are on that list, but it's a lot of people. Two thousand, five hundred and six ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches an incarcerated felon in a Georgia prison. Maybe they aren't all there, but they did a lot of work. I paid a lot of money to a lot of people. I can tell you that. Four thousand five hundred and two illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's voter rolls. Well, that's sort of strange. Eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-five illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service. At least 86,880 ballots were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated. Oh, I can't believe that happened. Sixty-six thousand votes—you have to understand, we're down by a little more than 11,000. So, every one of these is determinative. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3rd election, or maybe they moved back in. I don't know. I mean, I can't tell. They moved out, ah, let's go back. Usually takes a little time, right? You know. We moved out. Let's go back, darling. Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3% in 2016, and then went down very low to almost zero now. Think of it, almost zero. If you multiply that out. And this is with many, many more ballots pouring in. Went to almost zero. Forty-eight out of 159 counties in Georgia rejected no ballots at all. These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted. There were more absentee ballots in 2020 than ever before by for [sic]. But magically far fewer ballots were rejected. This alone is more than enough to swing the election to us. This one thing. I'm going over individual. In all of the swing states. Now they'll check this out and that's fine, but you take a look at it. Officials, egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent officials suspended signature verification. I said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures, because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago. They don't wanna do it. The Secretary of State and your incompetent Governor. Although he thinks I've been a great President. [booing] They illegally flooded their States with absentee ballots, and they deployed hundreds of elicit ballot drop boxes in corrupt Democrat-run cities, among many other flagrant violations of law. They put these drop boxes there. And in a number of cases, they'd be gone for three days. They'd take them up, and where are they? Where are they? They were gone. Georgia Secretary of State agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody's ever seen one like this. I want, I wanna just tell you that Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners. [booing] That drastically and illegally changed the states election procedures. They never got the mandated approval from your state legislature, who by the way, you have some great people in your legislature. Some great, great people who agree with what we're saying and even more so. But think of it. They never got the approval. You have to by law, under the Constitution, you can't just do these deals and not get the approval. And your Secretary of State or whoever it was, made this horrible consent decree, horrible, which got rid of so much safety. It's a disgraceful thing. And it was only approved by your local politicians, him, and local judges. You can't do that. You have to have your state legislatures do it. That's true with all States. Tens of thousands of votes are missing. We go all over the world telling people how to run their elections, and we don't even know how to run ours. The most unhappy person right now, anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton. Because she's asking the Democrat party, why the hell didn't you do this for me? [laughter] True. Why didn't you do it for me Crowd. [chanting] Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! The President. Why the hell didn't you? You notice how quiet she's been? I shouldn't have said that, now tonight she'll–but you notice how quiet–she's furious, because she said, ""Don't forget, I won Michigan by 10,000 votes."" We did much better. As I said, this time. Much, much better, but I won Michigan from her by 10,000 votes. I won Wisconsin by a small, you know—I mean, they couldda done that one and not get caught. We caught 'em, we caught 'em. And I say to people like Mike Lee, that are here and Lindsey, I say, if they got approved and verified, they use the word verified, votes that are fraudulent. And then we find out after, 'cause you can't do it that quickly. It doesn't go that quickly. It's a lot of work and a lot of votes and a lot of people. And then we find out that they were frauds like in one state where you had, let's say you lost by 25,000 votes. They verify it. And that's supposed to be the end. But shortly thereafter, we find out that we actually won the state by 250,000 votes. Does that mean that that state plus others adds up to being your President? I don't think it should. I don't think it should. I don't think that Kelly feels it should. I don't think that Marjorie feels it should. In Wisconsin over 90,000 ballots were illegally harvested. Can't do that. Not allowed to. Through so-called human drop boxes and over 500 illegal unmanned drop boxes were put out statewide. In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted that are blatantly illegal under Wisconsin law and should never have been included in the tally. By the way, I lost the–it was razor thin. There's 170,000 votes. The margin in Wisconsin is only 20,000 votes. So, this issue alone would have won that state for us many times over, we were leading at 10 o'clock in the evening by a lot. In Pennsylvania, there were 205,000 more ballots cast than there were voters. How do you get around that one? Which remains completely unexplained. You have great senators and representatives there and nobody can explain it but think of that. And in other places too, you had more ballots than you had voters. You had more votes, think of it, then you had voters by a lot. In addition, Democrat state Supreme Court judges and Democrat Secretary of State effectively abolished the signature verification process right here. They counted ballots cast after deadlines, and they allowed ballots to be illegally fixed in Democrat-controlled areas. And I say this because you can't let this happen tomorrow. And I hope all the politicians are listening. There's an unexplained 400,000 vote discrepancy between the number of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania sent out reported on November 2nd, 2020. And the number reported on November 4th. They can't explain it. Four hundred thousand previously unreported mail-in ballots magically appeared. They couldn't explain it. And all of a sudden, they just happened to find 400,000. That's a lot of people. Amazing. [booing] And the Pennsylvania legislature is not happy. Pennsylvania also had an estimated 8,000 dead voters, 55,000 ballots received back before they were even sent. How about that? The ballots were received, but they weren't sent yet. Oh, get them out fast please. Many more with no mail date and 14,000 ballots illegally cast by out-of-state voters. Those are numbers, and those are numbers we got from them. So, they can't say, oh, the numbers aren't so good. In Clark County, Nevada, over 130,000 ballots, this is far, just so you know, all these numbers, these are far more than we need, were processed on machines where the signature matching threshold was intentionally lowered to a level that you could sign your name, Santa Clause, and it wouldn't pick it up. Didn't pick up anything. More than 42,000 people in Nevada double voted. That's more than we needed, by far. In Arizona more than 36,000 votes were cast by non-citizens. And there were 11,000 more ballots than there were voters. It seems to be a trait, doesn't it? This was like at the Super Bowl, where you have 15 cameras and they'd say camera number four, you're on. Camera number three, you're on. In Michigan, according to one analyst, over 35,000 ballots listed no address, over 13 ballots were cast by non-residents and an estimated 17,000 ballots were cast by dead people. Some dead people, by the way, also requested an application it's true. Those are the ones that really bothered me. They not only vote, but they request an application. That's a double. In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion voting machines. [booing] And I want you to watch this very carefully tomorrow everybody, you have to watch it carefully. I wanna read you from a letter from Georgia state Senator William Ligon. You know who he is, right? Highly respected guy. ""Dear Mr. President, as chairman of the Georgia Senate Judiciary Committee on elections. I request that you immediately send an outside team of cyber experts to investigate potential hacking and other irregularities associated with Dominion voting systems, scanners, ballot marking devices, ballots, polling pads used in the 2020 general election in Georgia."" You don't hear this from your Secretary of State, and you don't hear this from your Governor, and you do have a great legislature. I have to tell you. But the Governor won't let 'em hold the session to decertify. On December 30th, 2020, the committee held a hearing investigating potential fraud and other irregularities during Georgia's 2020 general election. The Committee first unanimously approved a report dated December 17th, 2020, discussing a myriad of voting irregularities and potential fraud in Georgia 2020 general election, discussed in an earlier hearing held on December 3rd. Notably the Committee stated in the executive summary that the November 3rd, 2020, general election was chaotic and reported results must be viewed as untrustworthy. They are untrustworthy, despite the line of crap that you hear from these people that represent you. I don't know where they come from. The Committee then heard—and this is from one of your most highly respected political representatives—the Committee then heard additional testimony concerning voting irregularities during the 2020 general election, including testimony and a real time test demonstrating serious irregularities with Dominion's voting machines. Three events discussed at this hearing stand out and require a forensic audor [sic] of the Dominion voting machines in Georgia to be immediately conducted. The Governor will not let us do it. We've been asking them now since November 4th, the day after the election. He won't let us do it. Why won't he let us do it? There's only one reason I can think of. First, the Dominion voting machines employed in Fulton County. That's the home of Stacey. Had an astounding 93.67 error rate. 93.67 error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's intent. So, they're going to a voter intent. What did the voter mean by this vote? Somebody votes for Trump. I, you know, I think that voter meant something other. He doesn't want Trump. Let's just switch it around. Think of that. They're trying to determine the voter's intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots. This is from your representative, highly respected. The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1.2%. So, that was 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or designated to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter. This is what I have. There was no way. Look at this crowd we have here. Biden came here. He had nobody. [cheers and applause] Gallup, Gallup. You know, the Gallup poll. They did a–I don't say this braggingly, the most admired man in the world or the country. [cheers and applause] I don't say it. I say it for a different reason. So, I came in first. Obama came in second, and Biden came in waaaay low. Then I say, and they say, and people have said, how is it possible that a guy who got 80 million votes can't get any votes for the most admired man. You know why? Because he didn't come in first. That's why. Second, again from this very respected political leader, ""Second, there is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties throughout Georgia. For example, in Bibb County,"" anybody live in Bibb County? Bibb, Bibb, B-I-B-B. ""President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 PM, while simultaneously former Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,218. Minutes later at the next update these vote numbers switched with President Trump now having 17,000. And Biden now having 29,391."" [booing] That was a switch of over 12,000 votes. It was like a miracle. Third, ""During this hearing, a presenter demonstrated that a Dominion Poll could be hacked into in real time because it was connected to the internet."" Now, anything connected to the internet, that's not good. But this demonstration proved that these machines could allow votes to be siphoned off or added during the voting process because they're connected to the internet. Cybersecurity experts agree that voting machines should not be connected to the internet at any time, in any way, shape or form. Did you see that during the hearing? This guy sitting there. Well, can you connect into the machines? Yes. How do you do that? Within about 25 seconds, he controlled the internet. Former Vice President Biden led Georgia by only 11,779 votes. Every one of the things I told you about almost is more votes than what we're talking about. The crime that was committed in this state is immeasurable. An immediate forensic audit of an appropriate sampling of Dominion's voting machines and related equipment is critical to determine the level of illegal fraudulent ballots, improperly counted in Georgia during the 2020 general election and during tomorrow's race. You've gotta be very careful. [cheers and applause] And, let me also quickly read a letter from Mark Finchem, Chairman of the Arizona House, a very respected man, Federal Relations Committee. ""Dear Mr. President, subsequent to the election, members of the legislature were inundated with complaints from constituents relating to the intensity of the general election, and the integrity, more important than anything else, and the accuracy of canvassed results. In many instances, constituents reported that their earlier in-person ballots may not have been correctly processed or tabulated in Maricopa County officials. Members of the legislature have conducted two public hearings in recent weeks during which significant evidence of fraudulent and illegal voting in Arizona has been demonstrated through expert and eyewitness testimony. For example, in Pima County and Maricopa County, it appears that 143,000 illegal votes were actually injected into the ballot system."" Think of that. No, but think of this. Also, and you know, the press won't report this, they probably turn it off, oh, we don't like this. They don't like this. They don't wanna talk about numbers. They talked about my phone call. They don't like my phone call; everyone loved my phone call. They don't like talking about numbers, because nobody knew the numbers were so egregious. Also, an expert mathematician concluded that the only explanation for the actual voting results in Arizona is that 100%–think of this, 130% of Democrats voted for candidate Biden, and a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers 130% of the voters, that's a little tough to get, okay, had to vote for him, and minus 30 had to vote for me, and that gets you to a 100%. And nobody has a 100% voting. For all of these people who think it's too late, does that mean that we're forced to approve a fraudulent election or an election with massive irregularities? Crowd. No!!!!! The President. I don't think so. I don't think so. I wanna thank those two great political leaders. And, but we have many other letters just like that. Same thing. Hundreds of thousands of votes are missing. The only way to combat the Democrat fraud is to flood your polling places with a historic tidal wave of Republican voters tomorrow. [cheers and applause] Because at a certain point, the machines are gonna explode. They almost did with me, unfortunately they didn't quite get there, but we'll figure that out. And I just want Mike Lee to listen to this when I'm talking, because you know what? We need his vote. This election is your chance to stand up to the corrupt Democrat machine and show them that the American people are still in charge. [cheers and applause] With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. There's never been anything like this. Kelly, when did I say, we'll do this, like two days ago, three days ago, right? And look at this, and we love you all for being here, we really do. [cheers and applause] I'm glad the weather's good, we love you all. But there's never been a movement like this. I say it all the time, and the politicians, the lame stream medias, I call them affectionately, if that weren't true, they'd say, ""That's wrong."" There's never been a movement like this. I mean, you have people that won one state, and they become world-famous for the rest of their lives. You have people that came in second in New Hampshire and their world–we won everything, and we won it now a second time. Hate to bore you with that expression. But we won it now a second time. And I don't wanna win it a third time, I really wanna win it the second time—it's a lot easier[?]. [cheers and applause] Somebody came up to me today, Kelly, and they said, ""Sir, you're way up in four years, nobody can come close to me."" I said, ""I'm not interested in four years, I'm interested in like eight weeks ago."" [cheers and applause] Four years. Four years is a long time. It's actually two and two, you know, we'll take back the House for Kevin—and Marjorie. Jodi. We'll bring back the House, right? We'll bring back the House. Crowd. [chanting] Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! The President. Now, if we didn't win, I'd be all upset. Of course, If I didn't win, you probably wouldn't want me, you know in all fairness. A big difference between losing and winning and having it stolen. No, but they talk about four years, Sir, you have it made, nobody can come close, and I say, ""Nope, we're gonna—we go this way first."" And I think we're gonna do it. I really believe, because there's no way we could have won every single state, and for Fox, not one state, this is one of many. We win every state, and they're gonna have this guy be president and he can't speak, he can't talk. Already, we've achieved more than anyone thought possible. And we are just getting started. And, and honestly, it's you, it's amazing what happened. I don't even know why the hell I say let's have a rally. We have a rally and thousands and thousands of people. [cheers and applause] Honestly, there's never been—I'll go out on the extreme—there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. And, the election is over, the presidential election, and we have a big one tomorrow, but there's never been anything like this in the history of our country. Our economy is coming back. It's roaring back. Our stock market is an all-time high. Who would have thought that? We're rounding the turn because of, the turn because of what we did with the vaccines. And nobody else would have done it, it would have taken so long. The economy boomed at 33.4% last quarter, that's the fastest rate ever recorded. And we're talking about pandemic, during a pandemic. We've already slashed the unemployment rate in half. And for decades, our politicians spend trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. You know, we're bringing many of our great troops home. I mean, I hate to say it, [cheers] but—gotta do it. We've been in Afghanistan for 19 years; I think that's enough. I think that's enough. We've got um a lot of—very few left and, uh, very proud. Nothing worse than going to Dover and meeting the parents of our great warriors that have fallen, our great warriors coming home so badly wounded or dead. And, on countries that many of you have never even heard about. So, we bring our soldiers home. We've been incredible warriors; we can beat anybody. Nobody has our equipment, nobody has our military, nobody has our people, but we aren't over there to be policemen. We're not over there to be policing, they're warriors, they're fighters, and that's what we want them for. That's what we have to have them for. But we brought a lot of 'em home. We are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we're bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back to the USA where they belong. [cheers and applause] But everything that we've achieved together is on the line tomorrow. Our fight to take back our country from the big donors, the big media, and the horrendous big tech giants that our politicians, not these two politicians, are afraid to attack. Section 230, we have to get rid of Section 230, politicians—[cheers and applause]—or you're not gonna have a country very long, taking away all your rights. If you wanna send a message to the powerful forces that are trying to control your country, you must get out and vote tomorrow for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. [cheers and applause] With your help, we're gonna continue our mission to save America, and we're gonna continue our mission of America first. It's very simple. [cheers and applause] Each of us here tonight is united by the same core vision, and the same timeless American values. We love our country. Together, we believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the center of American life. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, which they wanna take away from you. [cheers and applause] And, we will always support the heroes of law enforcement. [cheers and applause] We will maintain America's unrivaled military might, and we will preserve peace through strength. You know when I first got elected, and before I got elected, in 2015 and 2016, before they were in debates and everyone said, ""Oh, he's gonna cause Wars, he's gonna cause wars."" I think I'm the only president in many, many decades that didn't get into a war, right. [cheers and applause] Remember North Korea was gonna be a tremendous nuclear fight, and all this, what happened with that? I got along very well with Kim Jong-un. I don't think that Joe's going to based on what I've heard, but, but I got along very well with him. And, you know, people say, ""Whatever happened with North Korea,"" we got along well. But, you know, they all said that, with my personality, I'll be in a big war very soon within the first two weeks. What happened? What happened? And they don't wanna mess with us either, that I can tell you. David and Kelly will protect Social Security and Medicare, and they will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. [cheers and applause] We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. [cheers and applause] And, we will live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, and it'll stay that way. [cheers and applause] From Atlanta to Augusta, to Savannah, to Columbus, from Athens—And, I wanna say hello to Herschel Walker, Athens. [cheers and applause] Herschel. 10.2 yards a carry for a while, he made a lot of quarterbacks look very good. We love Herschel. To right here in Dalton, Georgia, we inherit the legacy of generations of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat and tears to defend our country and to defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, and won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. [cheers and applause] And proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country, our fight to drain the Washington swamp and reclaim America's destiny and dignity has only just begun. We will not bend, we will not break, we will not yield. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. [cheers and applause] Because we are Americans, and we are from Georgia—[cheers and applause]—and our hearts bleed red, white and blue. [cheers and applause] We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Georgia, we have made America powerful again, our military. We have made America wealthy again, our stock market. We have made America strong again, look at that arm, look at that. We have made America proud again, we're proud of our country. We have made America safe again. And we will make America great again. Go get 'em, David, go get 'em, Kelly, go get 'emm tomorrow.

This is a fantastic state. This is a great, great state. You know, we won New Hampshire three times now--three. And we win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We\'ve won it and it\'s, uh, a very, very special place to me, it\'s very important. If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner. We won by 21 points and it was great. And, uh, today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, ""Wow, what a great victory."" But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely--when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it\'s at 14--but she ran up when it was seven and, you know, we have to do what\'s good for our party. And she was up and I said, ""Wow, she\'s doing, uh, like a speech like she won."" She didn\'t win, she lost.', 'And, you know, last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, ""Didn\'t she come in third?"" Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most winnability, who\'s gonna win? And I had one put up, I don\'t know if you see it, but I have one put up. We\'ve won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn\'t win those polls. [cheering] And she doesn\'t win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let\'s not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night.', 'And you, uh, you have the now very unpopular governor of this state-- this guy he\'s got to be on something. [booing] I\'ve never seen anybody with energy. He\'s like, uh, hopscotch. And, uh, you know, I\'m watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, ""We\'re gonna win. We\'re gonna win in a landslide. We\'re gonna win."" About three days ago he started saying, ""Well, we wanna do well."" That\'s a big difference.', ""But I walked out just now, we're 14 points up and I don't know what it's gonna be, but when she was up here, it was like six or seven and you know with like 7% of the vote counted. Now, uh, let me just tell you, we, uh, had an unbelievable week last week. And Iowa, we set a record. [cheering]"", 'It was the best in the history of the caucus, in the history! And, uh, I remember I sorta had the same feeling. I\'m up and I\'m watching and I said, ""She\'s taking a victory lap."" And we ki—we beat her so badly, she was-- But Ron beat her also. You know, Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she\'s still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don\'t know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out, because in this state--because you have a Governor that doesn\'t frankly know what the hell he\'s doing--in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrots—Democrats--before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they\'re only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in two thousand twenty. [cheering] By more! And we did much better in two thousand twenty than we did in two thousand sixteen.', 'But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can\'t let that happen. You know, you have to have people that speak up. I said, I can go up and I can say to everybody, ""Oh, thank you for the victory, it\'s wonderful, it\'s what--"" Or I can go up and say, ""Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory?"" She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, ""She\'s gonna to win, she\'s gonna to win, she\'s gonna to win."" Then she, she failed badly. Now, I have here, if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let\'s say me, but I don\'t get too angry. I get even. [laughter, cheering] The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me.', 'And we don\'t have to talk about Tim Scott, who by the way just got engaged. We have to tell you. [Turns to Scott standing behind him, cheering] And that\'s more important than all of this stuff. But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek [Ramaswamy]. I said, Vivek. I said, ""Vivek, go up and say a few words about it."" He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we\'re gonna just say, ""We had one hell of a night tonight."" And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? [points to his left.] We\'re gonna put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, ""Who can\'t? Who da hell can\'t?"" The man can\'t put two sentences together. He can\'t find the stairs off a stage. Who can\'t? But Vivek, one minute or less, go do it, Vivek. [cheering]', ""VIVEK RAMASWAMY: What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last. That's what we saw tonight. If you want America Last, you can go to Joe Biden. You've got another candidate still apparently in the Republican primary, cut your social security to fork over more money to Ukraine so some kleptocrat can buy a bigger house. Go to Nikki Haley. But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight?--it is a double-digit victory as of right now--is this man Donald J. Trump the leader of America First. And that means something. [cheering] Now, USA and Donald Trump, America First. Now, I've got 30 seconds left. I want to make this point, here, OK? We gotta to say this, we gotta say this right. What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the megadonors are trying to do one thing when we the people say another."", 'And it\'s up to us, to we the people, to at long last say, ""Hell, no. We the people create a government that is accountable to us."" And we, the people have said tonight, ""We want again, as we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump."" And so you want to actually speak truth, that\'s the truth tonight. And the only thing they\'re rooting for is an ugly thing that we don\'t wanna see happen. That\'s what these people are rooting for, is playin\' to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet. We say no to that vision. I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide. God bless you, Donald J. Trump. Vote Trump USA. [cheering, embraces Trump]', ""TRUMP: Very nice. Wasn't that nice? So this was a great evening and I wanna thank everybody in the audience, and I wanna thank the people that are standing behind me. You know, uh, I--I think we called it right, immigration's a big deal, a big deal, a very big deal. We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally. We have no idea who the hell they are. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it's gonna—it's just killing our country. And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they're everybody. And they come in just like, walking right through. There's nobody to check, and there's nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is—[cheering] central casting, he's central casting. And I'd like you to say a few words about the border, and who's gonna solve that problem, and how quick are we gonna do it, Tom. Go ahead, please. [applause]"", ""TOM HOMAN: Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secure border in my lifetime. [applause] The most secure border we've ever seen. And Donald Trump's goin' a do it again. We're gonna lock the border down, and we're gonna protect Americans. Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There's one man who's proven he can secure the border and he's standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He's gonna do it again. [cheering]"", 'TRUMP: Thank you very much, Tom. So, this is an evening, uh, that I will not forget because it\'s the third time, but more importantly, uh, I think it\'s gonna be—it\'s gonna be the most important time. We won, uh, both—it was I think they said--somebody said, ""you rarely--if you win both--"" they\'ve never had a loser, let me put it that way. When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they\'ve never had a loss. There\'s never been. So we\'re not gonna be the first, I can tell you. And I just, I just do wanna reiterate the polls--we\'re way up on everybody. We\'re way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check--and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, ""Oh, what does he know about elections? He\'s not gonna win. He can\'t win.

Then I said, ""Wait a minute, we can add another five."" They would not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country. They would not have done the damage. There\'s never been anything like it. And you say, ""Are they stupid people?"" I don\'t think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they\'re stupid. Do they hate our country? They must hate our country because there\'s no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look, the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four.

This is a fantastic state. This is a great, great state. You know, we won New Hampshire three times now--three. And we win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals. We've won it and it's, uh, a very, very special place to me, it's very important. If you remember in 2016, we came here and we needed that winner. We won by 21 points and it was great. And, uh, today, I have to tell you, it was very interesting because I said, ""Wow, what a great victory."" But then somebody ran up to the stage all dressed up nicely--when it was at seven, but now I just walked up and it's at 14--but she ran up when it was seven and, you know, we have to do what's good for our party. And she was up and I said, ""Wow, she's doing, uh, like a speech like she won."" She didn't win, she lost. And, you know, last week we had a little bit of a problem. And if you remember, Ron was very upset because she ran up and she pretended she won Iowa. And I looked around, I said, ""Didn't she come in third?"" Yeah, she came in third. And then I looked at the polls. She was talking about most winnability, who's gonna win? And I had one put up, I don't know if you see it, but I have one put up. We've won almost every single poll in the last three months against Crooked Joe Biden, almost every poll. And she doesn't win those polls. [cheering] And she doesn't win those. This is not your typical victory speech, but let's not have somebody take a victory when she had a very bad night, she had a very bad night. And you, uh, you have the now very unpopular governor of this state-- this guy he's got to be on something. [booing] I've never seen anybody with energy. He's like, uh, hopscotch. And, uh, you know, I'm watching this guy and two weeks ago he said, ""We're gonna win. We're gonna win in a landslide. We're gonna win."" About three days ago he started saying, ""Well, we wanna do well."" That's a big difference. But I walked out just now, we're 14 points up and I don't know what it's gonna be, but when she was up here, it was like six or seven and you know with like 7% of the vote counted. Now, uh, let me just tell you, we, uh, had an unbelievable week last week. And Iowa, we set a record. [cheering] It was the best in the history of the caucus, in the history! And, uh, I remember I sorta had the same feeling. I'm up and I'm watching and I said, ""She's taking a victory lap."" And we ki—we beat her so badly, she was-- But Ron beat her also. You know, Ron came in second and he left. She came in third and she's still hanging around. The other thing, she only got 25% of the Republican votes. I don't know if you saw that. Tremendous numbers of Independents came out, because in this state--because you have a Governor that doesn't frankly know what the hell he's doing--in this state, in the Republican primary, they accept Democrats to vote. In fact, I think they had 4,000 Democrots—Democrats--before October 6th. They already voted. Now, they're only voting because they want to make me look as bad as possible because if you remember, we won in 2016, and if you really remember it, if you want to play it straight, we also won in two thousand twenty. [cheering] By more! And we did much better in two thousand twenty than we did in two thousand sixteen. But as they said, we lost by a whisker, just by a whisker. No, no, no. But we can't let that happen. You know, you have to have people that speak up. I said, I can go up and I can say to everybody, ""Oh, thank you for the victory, it's wonderful, it's what--"" Or I can go up and say, ""Who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and, like, claimed a victory?"" She did very poorly actually. She had to win. The governor said, ""She's gonna to win, she's gonna to win, she's gonna to win."" Then she, she failed badly. Now, I have here, if he promises to do it in a minute or less, but the only person more angry than let's say me, but I don't get too angry. I get even. [laughter, cheering] The only person, because he was there and he did fantastically well by the way, then he endorsed me. And we don't have to talk about Tim Scott, who by the way just got engaged. We have to tell you. [Turns to Scott standing behind him, cheering] And that's more important than all of this stuff. But a man that got to know her very well is Vivek [Ramaswamy]. I said, Vivek. I said, ""Vivek, go up and say a few words about it."" He has to do it in one minute or less, and then we're gonna just say, ""We had one hell of a night tonight."" And one other thing before Vivek comes. Do you see that poll? [points to his left.] We're gonna put it up. We have beaten Biden. You could almost say, ""Who can't? Who da hell can't?"" The man can't put two sentences together. He can't find the stairs off a stage. Who can't? But Vivek, one minute or less, go do it, Vivek. [cheering] VIVEK RAMASWAMY: What we saw tonight is America first defeating America last. That's what we saw tonight. If you want America Last, you can go to Joe Biden. You've got another candidate still apparently in the Republican primary, cut your social security to fork over more money to Ukraine so some kleptocrat can buy a bigger house. Go to Nikki Haley. But you know who delivered a double-digit victory tonight?--it is a double-digit victory as of right now--is this man Donald J. Trump the leader of America First. And that means something. [cheering] Now, USA and Donald Trump, America First. Now, I've got 30 seconds left. I want to make this point, here, OK? We gotta to say this, we gotta say this right. What we see right now with her continuing in this race is the ugly underbelly of American politics where the megadonors are trying to do one thing when we the people say another. And it's up to us, to we the people, to at long last say, ""Hell, no. We the people create a government that is accountable to us."" And we, the people have said tonight, ""We want again, as we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump."" And so you want to actually speak truth, that's the truth tonight. And the only thing they're rooting for is an ugly thing that we don't wanna see happen. That's what these people are rooting for, is playin' to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet. We say no to that vision. I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide. God bless you, Donald J. Trump. Vote Trump USA. [cheering, embraces Trump] TRUMP: Very nice. Wasn't that nice? So this was a great evening and I wanna thank everybody in the audience, and I wanna thank the people that are standing behind me. You know, uh, I--I think we called it right, immigration's a big deal, a big deal, a very big deal. We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally. We have no idea who the hell they are. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it's gonna—it's just killing our country. And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they're everybody. And they come in just like, walking right through. There's nobody to check, and there's nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is—[cheering] central casting, he's central casting. And I'd like you to say a few words about the border, and who's gonna solve that problem, and how quick are we gonna do it, Tom. Go ahead, please. [applause] TOM HOMAN: Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secure border in my lifetime. [applause] The most secure border we've ever seen. And Donald Trump's goin' a do it again. We're gonna lock the border down, and we're gonna protect Americans. Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There's one man who's proven he can secure the border and he's standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He's gonna do it again. [cheering] TRUMP: Thank you very much, Tom. So, this is an evening, uh, that I will not forget because it's the third time, but more importantly, uh, I think it's gonna be—it's gonna be the most important time. We won, uh, both—it was I think they said--somebody said, ""you rarely--if you win both--"" they've never had a loser, let me put it that way. When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they've never had a loss. There's never been. So we're not gonna be the first, I can tell you. And I just, I just do wanna reiterate the polls--we're way up on everybody. We're way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check--and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, ""Oh, what does he know about elections? He's not gonna win. He can't win. He can't w--"" We won, and we got millions, and you can check this, and I hope the cameras don't turn off 'cause they hate this, but we got millions and millions of more votes the second time, right, Mr. Congressman? Millions and millions of more votes, and, ah, but we had COVID, and they use COVID to cheat, and they did a lot of other things, too. We're not gonna let that happen, and that's still—and that's still goin' along. You can't forget--you can never forget history because if you forget, you never, you never recover from it and you repeat, you repeat. And we're not gonna repeat. We're gonna have the greatest election success. We're gonna turn our country around. And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this not great country right now, it's a country in decline, it's a troubled country, it's a failing country frankly.

They call it a renovation. If there's two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, ""Oh, that was a renovation."" These are very dishonest people and you're always fighting them. And just a little note to Nikki: She's not gonna win. [laughter] She's not gonna win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about.

And we, the people have said tonight, ""We want again, as we did in Iowa, Donald J. Trump."" And so you want to actually speak truth, that's the truth tonight. And the only thing they're rooting for is an ugly thing that we don't wanna see happen. That's what these people are rooting for, is playin' to say long enough so the Reid Hoffmans and the ugly Democratic George Soros Juniors, who are funding the lawsuits against Trump, can prop up their puppet. We say no to that vision. I say the general election begins tonight, and this man will win it in a landslide. God bless you, Donald J. Trump. Vote Trump USA. [cheering, embraces Trump] TRUMP: Very nice. Wasn't that nice? So this was a great evening and I wanna thank everybody in the audience, and I wanna thank the people that are standing behind me. You know, uh, I--I think we called it right, immigration's a big deal, a big deal, a very big deal. We have millions and millions of people flowing into our country illegally. We have no idea who the hell they are. They come from prisons and they come from mental institutions, and it's gonna—it's just killing our country. And I'm talking about millions and millions and millions. They are drug dealers, they're everybody. And they come in just like, walking right through. There's nobody to check, and there's nobody to vet, and we have a man with us tonight, Tom Homan, who is—[cheering] central casting, he's central casting. And I'd like you to say a few words about the border, and who's gonna solve that problem, and how quick are we gonna do it, Tom. Go ahead, please. [applause] TOM HOMAN: Look, I worked for six presidents starting with Ronald Reagan, and every president I ever worked for did something to secure the border, but no one did more than President Trump. The most secure border in my lifetime. [applause] The most secure border we've ever seen. And Donald Trump's goin' a do it again. We're gonna lock the border down, and we're gonna protect Americans. Because what's happening at the border right now, a record number Americans have died from fentanyl poisoning, a record number migrants have died. A record number of women and children to sex traffic, a record number known suspected terrorists across the border. There's one man who's proven he can secure the border and he's standing to my left, Donald J. Trump. He's gonna do it again. [cheering] TRUMP: Thank you very much, Tom. So, this is an evening, uh, that I will not forget because it's the third time, but more importantly, uh, I think it's gonna be—it's gonna be the most important time. We won, uh, both—it was I think they said--somebody said, ""you rarely--if you win both--"" they've never had a loser, let me put it that way. When you win Iowa and you win New Hampshire, they've never had a loss. There's never been. So we're not gonna be the first, I can tell you. And I just, I just do wanna reiterate the polls--we're way up on everybody. We're way up on Biden. And over the last couple of months, if you check--and you have to remember in 2016, they were saying, ""Oh, what does he know about elections? He's not gonna win. He can't win. He can't w--"" We won, and we got millions, and you can check this, and I hope the cameras don't turn off 'cause they hate this, but we got millions and millions of more votes the second time, right, Mr. Congressman? Millions and millions of more votes, and, ah, but we had COVID, and they use COVID to cheat, and they did a lot of other things, too. We're not gonna let that happen, and that's still—and that's still goin' along. You can't forget--you can never forget history because if you forget, you never, you never recover from it and you repeat, you repeat. And we're not gonna repeat. We're gonna have the greatest election success. We're gonna turn our country around. And if you take a look throughout the history of our country, if you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of this not great country right now, it's a country in decline, it's a troubled country, it's a failing country frankly. But if you took the 10 worst presidents and put 'em together--the 10 worst, absolutely 10 worst. I used to say five. Remember I started, I'd say five. Then I said, ""Wait a minute, we can add another five."" They would not have done the damage that crooked Joe Biden has done to our wonderful country. They would not have done the damage. There's never been anything like it. And you say, ""Are they stupid people?"" I don't think so, because nobody can cheat that well if they're stupid. Do they hate our country? They must hate our country because there's no other reason that they can be doing the things they do. Take a look, the taxes, they want to raise your taxes times four. They want to let the Trump Tax cuts-- the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country--they want them to expire. Your taxes are gonna go through the roof. You take a look at regulations, they're throwing regulations. You can't breathe. You can't even breathe with what they're doing. You take a look at our border, so bad, there's never been a border like this in the world. Four years ago we had the safest, best border in the United States. I built hundreds of miles of border wall. And they always say, ""Oh, he didn't build hundreds of miles,"" because if there's a board laying on the ground, they say ""That's a renovation."" They call it a renovation. If there's two nails laying from 50 years ago, they say, ""Oh, that was a renovation."" These are very dishonest people and you're always fighting them. And just a little note to Nikki: She's not gonna win. [laughter] She's not gonna win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes, and I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about. But she will be under investigation within minutes and so would Ron have been, but he decided to get out. He decided to get out. Now, Vivek, I don't think would be at all because he's perfect, right? [cheers] And Tim Scott, I know would never--that's no chance. Hey, Tim. Do you wanna say something? Come on, come on. I want him to say something. [applause] TIM SCOTT: Le--New Hampshire, the President said a double-digit win in New Hampshire and you delivered a double-digit win for President Trump. [cheering] But I'm gonna invite you to my home state startin' tomorrow. [cheering] Where this election--is over! It is time for the Republican Party to coalesce around our nominee and the next President of the United States, Donald Trump. Let's get that party started tonight. [cheering] TRUMP: What a good guy. What a good man he is. But just remember, I did hear Nikki say, ""And now it's off to South Carolina."" Well, I love South Carolina. Audience: We love you. TRUMP: I love it. But she forgot one thing. She forgot one thing. Next week it's Nevada. Next week it's Nevada, it's not South Carolina. We love South Carolina, but next week it's Nevada. And I'm pleased to announce we just won Nevada. [cheering] We just won, 100%. Because all of 'em, they looked at it, and they took polls, and I was polling at 95% to 4 or 5%, and they decided not to play in Nevada. So we just won Nevada. We have a man from Nevada here, Steve Wynn, wherever he may be. And John Paulson, the great John Paulson made plenty of money in Nevada. Doesn't live there, but he makes a hell of a lot of money. He makes money everywhere he goes, actually. So, money machine. Maybe we'll put you--you know what? Put him at Treasury. You want to make a little money? Let's put-- Anyways, good to have you guys. Uh, but we go to Nevada and that's been won, so we pick up all of those delegates. And then we do go to South Carolina where we've done really well, where I've done well. We have a great governor and lieutenant governor and great everything, because almost every one of them have endorsed me--two great Senators--which is hard. I mean, did you ever think that--she actually appointed you, Tim? And [laughs] think of it, appointed and you're the senator of the state and she endorsed me. You must really hate her. Naw, it's a shame. It's a shame—[Tim Scott steps forward to Trump's left shoulder] Uh-oh. [laughter] SCOTT: I just love you. [applause] TRUMP: No, that's-- That's why he's a great politician. [applause] That's why he's a great politician. So this is a great evening and it is-- We are going to Nevada for a little while. We're not gonna have to do too much. We have a great team there. But it's a team that uh we can now send someplace else. They did a fantastic job but, uh, we--and it's a fantastic place, really a fantastic place. But we'll be leaving there very quickly. We'll head out to South Carolina where I think we're gonna win easily. I think we're 50 points up, five-oh, five-oh. Fifty points up on a person that was governor, that tells you something. But I felt I should do this because I find in life you can't let people get away with bullshit, OK, you can't. [shouts and cheering] You just can't do that. And when I watched her in the fancy dress that probably wasn't so fancy-- come up-- I said, ""What's she doing, we won?"" And she did the same thing last week, but he was much more angry about it than I was. I said, ""Get up there and you let them know."" We are going to win this, we have no choice. If we don't win, I think our country is finished, I do. I believe our country is finished. We have an opportunity to do something so amazing. And the good news, and the reason we have such support--the best numbers I've ever had--the reason we have support is because they are so bad at what they're doing and so evil. And they're destroying our country. So I wanna thank everybody for being here. I wanna thank this group of people [gestures at crowd in front of him]. We will never forget you. We will never forget. [cheering] And I made a pledge—I made a pledge to your state that you have the highest energy costs in the country. In the first year, they're gonna be reduced by 50% because we are gonna drill, baby drill. Drill, baby drill. Inflation is going to come way down. But in the first year, your energy costs are going down by 50%. Thank you very much. We love you. Thank you very much. We'll see you soon. We'll see you on the trail. And thank you everybody, thank you very much. We will see you on the trail. Thanks.
