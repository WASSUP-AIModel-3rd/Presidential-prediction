0,Herbert Hoover ,"August 11, 1932","['Mr. Chairman and my fellow citizens:', 'In accepting the great honor that you have brought to me, I desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the United States who may hear or read my words cannot misunderstand.', 'The last 3 years have been a time of unparalleled economic calamity. They have been years of greater suffering and hardship than any which have come to the American people since the aftermath of the Civil War. As we look back over these troubled years we realize that we have passed through two different stages of dislocation and distress.', 'Before the storm broke we were steadily gaining in prosperity. Our wounds from the war were rapidly healing. Advances in science and invention had opened vast vistas of new progress. Being prosperous, we became optimistic--all of us. From optimism some of us went to overexpansion in anticipation of the future, and from overexpansion to reckless speculation. In the soil poisoned by speculation grew those ugly weeds of waste, exploitation, and abuse of financial power. In this overproduction and speculative mania we marched with the rest of the whole world. Then 3 years ago came retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of goods, in prices, and employment. At that juncture it was the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as we have witnessed a score of times in our national history. Through such depressions we have always passed safely after a relatively short period of losses, of hardship, and of adjustment. We have adopted policies in the Government which were fitting to the situation. Gradually the country began to right itself. Eighteen months ago there was a solid basis for hope that recovery was in sight.', 'Then, there came to us a new calamity, a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the Republic. The countries of Europe proved unable to withstand the stress of the depression. The memories of the world had ignored the fact that the insidious diseases left by the Great War had not been cured. The skill and intelligence of millions in Europe had been blotted out by battle, by disease, and by starvation. Stupendous burdens of national debt had been built up. Poisoned springs of political instability lay in the treaties which closed the war. Fear and hates held armament to double those before the great conflict. Governments were fallaciously seeking to build back by enlarged borrowing, by subsidizing industry and employment from taxes that slowly sapped the savings upon which industry and rejuvenated commerce must be built. Under these strains the financial systems of foreign countries crashed one by one.', 'New blows with decreasing world consumption of goods and from failing financial systems rained upon our people. We are a part of the world the disturbance of whose remotest populations affects our financial system, our employment, our markets, and the prices of our farm products. Thus beginning 18 months ago, the worldwide storm grew rapidly to hurricane force and the greatest economic emergency in all the history of the world. Unexpected, unforeseen, violent shocks with every month brought new dangers and new emergencies to our country. Fear and apprehension gripped the heart of our people in every village and city.', 'If we look back over the disasters of these 3 years, we find that three-quarter of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution. Many nations have been subject to constant change and vacillation of government. Others have resorted to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempts to preserve some kind of social order.', 'I may pause for one short illustration of the character of one single destructive force arising from these causes which we have been compelled to meet. That was its effect upon our financial structure. Foreign countries, in the face of their own failures, the failures of their neighbors, not believing that we had either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis, withdrew from the United States over $2,400 million, including a billion of gold. Our own alarmed citizens withdrew over $1,600 million of currency from our banks into hoarding. These actions, combined with the fears that they generated, caused a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several times even these vast sums. Its visible expression was the failures of banks and business, the demoralization of security and real property values, of the commodity prices, and of employment. And that was but one of the invading forces of destruction that we have been compelled to meet in the last 18 months.', 'Two courses were open to us. We might have done nothing. That would have been utter ruin. Instead, we met the situation with proposals to private business and to the Congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the Republic. We put that program in action.', 'Our measures have repelled these attacks of fear and panic. We have maintained the financial integrity of the Government. We have cooperated to restore and stabilize the situation abroad. As a nation we have paid every dollar demanded of us. We have used the credit of the Government to aid and protect our institutions, both public and private. We have provided methods and assurances that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst our people. We have instituted measures to assist our farmers and our homeowners. We have created vast agencies for employment. Above all, we have maintained the sanctity of the principles upon which this Republic has grown great.', 'In a large sense the test of the success of our program is simple. Our people, while suffering great hardships, have been and will be cared for. In the long view our institutions have been sustained intact and are now functioning with increasing confidence for the future. As a nation we are undefeated and unafraid. And again above all, government by the people has not been defiled.', 'With the humility of one who by necessity has stood in the midst of this storm I can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishments belongs not to the Government or to any individual. It is due to the intrepid soul of our people. It is to their character, their fortitude, their initiative, and their courage that we owe these results. We of this generation did not build this great Ship of State. But the policies that we have inaugurated have protected and aided its navigation in this terrible storm. These policies and programs have not been partisan. I gladly give tribute to those members of the Democratic Party in the Congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition has assisted in a score of great undertakings. I likewise give credit to Democratic as well as Republican leaders among our citizens for their cooperation and their help.', 'A record of these dangers and these policies of the last 3 years will be set down in the books. Much of it is of interest only to history. Our interest now is in the future. I dwell upon these policies and these programs and problems only where they illustrate the questions of the day and our course for the future. As a government and as a people we still have much to do. We must continue the building of our measures of restoration. We must profit by the lessons of this experience.', 'Before I enter upon a discussion of these policies I wish to say something of my conception of the relations of our Government to the people and the responsibilities of both, particularly as applied to these times. The spirit and the devising of this Government by the people was to sustain a dual purpose--on the one hand to protect our people amongst nations and in domestic emergencies by great national power, and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self-government.', 'The function of the Federal Government in these times is to use its reserve powers and its strength for the protection of citizens and local governments by the support to our institutions against forces beyond their control. It is not the function of the Government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors, or to relieve private institutions of their responsibilities to the public, or the local government to the States, or the responsibilities of State governments to the Federal Government. In giving that protection and that aid the Federal Government must insist that all of them exert their responsibilities in full. It is vital that the programs of the Government shall not compete with or replace any of them but shall add to their initiative and to their strength. It is vital that by the use of public revenues and public credit in emergencies that the Nation shall be strengthened and not weakened.', 'And in all these emergencies and crises, and in all our future policies, we must also preserve the fundamental principles of our social and our economic system. That system was rounded upon a conception of ordered freedom. The test of that freedom is that there should be maintained an equality of opportunity to every individual so that he may achieve for himself the best to which his character, ability, and ambition entitle him. It is only by the release of initiative, this insistence upon individual responsibility, that we accrue the great sums of individual accomplishment which carry this Nation forward. This is not an individualism which permits men to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for others. It permits no violation of ordered liberty. In the race after false gods of materialism men and groups have forgotten their country. Equality of opportunity contains no conception of exploitation by any selfish, ruthless, class-minded men or groups. They have no place in the American system. As against these stand the guiding ideals and the concepts of our Nation. I propose to maintain them.', 'The solution of our many problems which arise from the shifting scene of national life is not to be found in haphazard experimentation or by revolution. It must be through organic development of our national life under these ideals. It must secure that cooperative action which brings initiative and strength outside of the Government. It does not follow, because our difficulties are stupendous, because there are some souls timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideals and our system, that we must turn to a State-controlled or State-directed social or economic system in order to cure our troubles. That is not liberalism; that is tyranny. It is the regimentation of men under autocratic bureaucracy with all its extinction of liberty, of hope, and of opportunity. Of course, no man of understanding says that our system works perfectly. It does not for the human race is not yet perfect. Nevertheless, the movement of true civilization is towards freedom rather than regimentation. And that is our ideal.', 'Ofttimes the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger is to strike blindly, to listen to demagogues and to slogans, all of which destroy and do not save. We have refused to be stampeded into such courses. Ofttimes democracy elsewhere in the world has been unable to move fast enough to save itself in emergency. There have been disheartening delays and failures in legislation and private action which -have added to the losses of our people, yet this democracy of ours has proved its ability to act.', 'Our emergency measures of the last 3 years form a definite strategy dominated in the background by these American principles and ideals, forming a continuous campaign waged against the forces of destruction on an ever-widening and a constantly shifting front.', 'Thus we have held that the Federal Government should in the presence of great national danger use its powers to give leadership to the initiative, the courage, and the fortitude of the people themselves, but that it must insist upon individual, community, and State responsibility. That it should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great existing agencies, governmental and private, for economic and humanitarian action. That where it becomes necessary to meet emergencies beyond the power of these agencies by the creation of new governmental instrumentalities, that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken, but rather to supplement and strengthen, the initiative and enterprise of our people. That they must, directly or indirectly, serve all of the people. And above all, that they should be set up in such form that once the emergency is past they can and must be demobilized and withdrawn, leaving our governmental, economic, and social structure strong and whole.', 'We have not feared boldly to adopt unprecedented measures to meet unprecedented violences of the storm. But, because we have kept ever before us these eternal principles of our Nation, the American Government in its ideals is the same as it was when the people gave the Presidency to my trust. We shall keep it so. We have resolutely rejected the temptation, under pressure of immediate events, to resort to those panaceas and short cuts which, even if temporarily successful, would ultimately undermine and weaken what has slowly been built and molded by experience and effort throughout these 150 years.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that at the first stage of the depression I called upon the leaders of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with me and induced them, by their own initiative, to organize against the panic with all its devastating destruction; to uphold wages until the cost of living was adjusted; to spread existing employment through shortened hours; and to advance construction work against future need.', 'It was in pursuance of that same policy that I have each winter thereafter assumed the leadership in mobilizing all of the voluntary and official organizations throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold, and to protect millions of families stricken by drought. And when it became advisable to strengthen the States who could no longer carry the full burden of relief to distress, it was in accordance with these principles that we held that the Federal Government should do so through loans to the States and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the States themselves. We stopped the attempt to turn this effort to the politics of selfish sectional demands, and we kept it based upon human need.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that, in aid to unemployment, we expend some $600 millions in Federal construction of such public works as can be justified as bringing early and definite returns. We have opposed the distortion of these needed works into pork-barrel nonproductive works which impoverish the Nation.', 'It is in accord with these principles and these purposes that we have made provision for $1,500 millions of loans to self-supporting works so that we may increase employment in productive labor. We rejected projects of wasteful nonproductive work allocated for purposes of attracting votes instead of affording relief. Thereby, instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer, we secured the return of their cost to Government agencies and at the same time we increased the wealth of the Nation.', ""It was in accordance with these principles that we have strengthened the capital of the Federal land banks--that, on the one hand, confidence in their securities should not be impaired, and that on the other, the farmers indebted to them should not be unduly deprived of their homes. It was in accordance with these purposes that the Farm Board by emergency loan to farmers' cooperatives served to stem panics in agricultural prices and saved hundreds of thousands of farmers and their creditors from bankruptcy. It was in accord with these ideas that we have created agencies to prevent bankruptcy and failure in their cooperative organizations; that we are erecting new instrumentalities to give credit facilities for their livestock growers and their orderly marketing of their farm products."", 'It is in accordance with these principles that in the face of the looming European crises we sought to change the trend of European economic degeneration by our proposals of the German moratorium and the standstill agreements on German private debts. We stemmed the tide of collapse in Germany and the consequent ruin of its people. In furtherance of world stability we have made proposals to reduce the cost of world armaments by $1 billion a year.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that I first secured the creation by private initiative of the National Credit Association, whose efforts prevented the failure of hundreds of banks, and the loss to countless thousands of depositors who had loaned all of their savings to them.', 'It was in accord with these ideas that as the storm grew in intensity we created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with a capital of 2 billions more to uphold the credit structure of the Nation, and by thus raising the shield of Government credit we prevented the wholesale failure of banks, of insurance companies, of building and loan associations, of farm mortgage associations, and of railroads in all of which the public interest is paramount. This disaster has been averted through the saving of more than 5,000 institutions and the knowledge that adequate assistance was available to tide others over the stress. This has been done not to save a few stockholders, but to save 25 millions of American families, every one of whose very savings and employment might have been wiped out and whose whole future would have been blighted had these institutions gone down.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that we expanded the functions and the powers of the Federal Reserve banks that they might counteract the stupendous shrinkage of credit due to fear and to hoarding and the foreign withdrawal of our resources.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that we are now in process of establishing a new system of home loan banks so that through added strength and through cooperation between the building and loan associations, the savings banks and other institutes we may relax the pressures on forfeiture of homes and procure the release of new resources for the construction of more homes and the employment of more men.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that we have insisted upon a reduction of governmental expenses, for no country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruins of its taxpayers. And it was in accordance with these purposes that we have sought new revenues to equalize the diminishing income of the Government in order that the power of the Federal Government to meet the emergency should be impregnable.', 'It was in accordance with these principles that we have joined in the development of a world economic conference to bulwark the whole international fabric of finance, of monetary values, and the expansion of world commerce.', 'It was in accordance with these principles and these policies that I am today organizing the private industrial and financial resources of the country to cooperate effectively with the vast governmental instrumentalities which we have in motion, so that through their united and coordinated efforts we may move from defense to a powerful attack upon the depression along the whole national front.', 'These programs, unparalleled in the history of depressions of any country and in any time, to care for distress, to provide employment, to aid agriculture, to maintain the financial stability of the country, to safeguard the savings of the people, to protect their homes, are not in the past tense--they are in action. I shall propose such other measures, public and private, as may be necessary from time to time to meet the changing situations that may occur and to further speed our economic recovery. That recovery may be slow, but we shall succeed.', 'And come what may, I shall maintain through all these measures the sanctity of the great principles under which the Republic over a period of 150 years has grown to be the greatest Nation of the Earth.', 'I should like to digress a second for an observation on the last 3 years which should exhilarate the faith of every American--and that is the profound growth of the sense of social responsibility in our Nation which this depression has demonstrated.', 'No Government in Washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in such times. Despite hardships, the devotion of our men and women to those in distress is demonstrated by the national averages of infant mortality, general mortality, and sickness, which are less today than in times even of prosperity. For the first time in the history of depressions, dividends and profits and the cost of living have been reduced before wages have been sacrificed. We have been more free from industrial conflict through strikes and lockouts and all forms of social disorder than even in normal times. The Nation is building the initiative of men and of women toward new fields of social cooperation and new fields of endeavor.', 'So much for the great national emergency and the principles of government for which we stand and their application to the measures we have taken.', 'There are national policies wider than the emergency, wider than the economic horizon. They are set forth in our platform. Having had the responsibility of this office, my views upon most of them are clearly and often set forth in public record. I may, however, summarize some of them.', 'First: I am squarely for a protective tariff. I am against the proposal of ""a competitive tariff for revenue"" as advocated by our opponents. That would place our farmers and our workers in competition with peasant and sweated-labor products from abroad.', 'Second: I am against their proposals to destroy the usefulness of the bipartisan Tariff Commission, the establishment of whose effective powers we secured during this administration just 25 years after it was first advocated by President Theodore Roosevelt. That instrumentality enables us to correct any injustice and to readjust the rates of duty to shifting economic change, without constant tinkering and orgies of logrolling by Congress. If our opponents will descend from the vague generalization to any particular schedule, if it be higher than necessary to protect our people or insufficient for their protection, it can be remedied by this bipartisan Commission without a national election.', 'Third: My views in opposition to the cancellation of the war debt are a matter of detailed record in many public statements and in a recent message to the Congress. They mark a continuity of that policy maintained by my predecessors. I am hopeful of such drastic reduction of world armament as will save the taxpayers in debtor countries a large part of the cost of their payments to us. If for any particular annual payment we were offered some other tangible form of compensation, such as the expansion of markets for American agriculture and labor, and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity, then I am sure our citizens would consider such a proposal. But it is a certainty that these debts must not be canceled or these burdens transferred to the backs of the American people.', 'Fourth: I insist upon an army and navy of a strength which guarantees that no foreign soldier will land upon the American soil. That strength is relative to other nations. I favor every arms reduction which preserves that relationship.', 'I favor rigidly restricted immigration. I have by executive direction in order to relieve us of added unemployment, already reduced the inward movement to less than the outward movement. I shall adhere to that policy.', 'Sixth: I have repeatedly recommended to the Congress a revision of railway transportation laws, in order that we may create greater stability and greater assurance of that vital service in our transportation. I shall Persist in it.', 'I have repeatedly recommended the Federal regulation of interstate power. I shall persist in that. I have opposed the Federal Government undertaking the operation of the power business. I shall continue in that opposition.', 'I have for years supported the conservation of national resources. I have made frequent recommendations to the Congress in respect thereto, including legislation to correct the waste and destruction of these resources through the present interpretations of the antitrust laws. I shall continue to urge such action.', 'This depression has exposed many weaknesses in our economic system. There has been exploitation and abuse of financial power. We will fearlessly and unremittingly reform these abuses. I have recommended to the Congress the reform of our banking laws. Unfortunately this legislation has not yet been enacted. The American people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system. They must be relieved from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country to be made available without check for wholesale speculation in securities with ruinous consequence to millions of our citizens and to our national economy. I have recommended to Congress methods of emergency relief to the depositors of closed banks. For 7 years I have repeatedly warned against private loans abroad for nonproductive purposes. I shall persist in all those matters.', 'I have insisted upon a balanced budget as the foundation of all public and private financial stability and of all public confidence. I shall insist on the maintenance of that policy. Recent increases in revenues, while temporary, should be again examined, and if they tend to sap the vitality of industry, and thus retard employment, they should be revised.', 'The first necessity of the Nation, the wealth and income of whose citizens has been reduced, is to reduce the expenditures on government-national, State, and local. It is in the relief of taxes from the backs of men through which we liberate their powers. It is through lower expenditures that we get lower taxes. This must be done. A considerable reduction in Federal expenditures has been attained. If we except those extraordinary expenditures imposed upon us by the depression, it will be found that the Federal Government is operating some $200 million less annually today than 4 years ago. The Congress rejected recommendations from the administration which would have saved an additional $150 million this fiscal year. The opposition leadership insisted, as the price of vital reconstruction legislation and over the protest of our leaders, upon adding $300 million of costs to the taxpayer through public works inadvisable at this time. I shall repeat these proposals for economy. The opposition leadership in the House of Representatives in the last 4 months secured the passage by that House of $3 billion in raids upon the Public Treasury. They have been stopped, and I shall continue to oppose such raids.', 'I have repeatedly for 7 years urged the Congress either themselves to abolish obsolete bureaus and commissions and to reorganize the whole Government structure in the interest of economy, or to give someone the authority to do it. I have succeeded partially in securing that authority, but I regret that no great act under it can be effective until after the approval of the next Congress.', ""With the collapse of world prices and the depreciated currencies the farmer was never so dependent upon his tariff protection for recovery as he is at the present time. We shall hold to that as a national policy. We have enacted many measures of emergency relief to agriculture. They are having their effect. I shall keep them functioning until the strain is past. The original purpose of the Farm Board was to strengthen the efforts of the farmer to establish his own farmer-owned, farmer controlled marketing agencies. It has greatly succeeded in this purpose, even in these times of adversity. The departure of the Farm Board from its original purpose by making loans to farmers' cooperatives to preserve prices from panic served an emergency, but such an action in normal times is absolutely destructive of the farmers' own interest."", 'We still have vast problems to solve in agriculture. But no power on Earth can restore prices except by restoration of the general recovery and by restoration of markets. Every measure that we have taken looking to general recovery is of benefit to the farmer. There is no relief to the farmer by extending governmental bureaucracy to control his production and thus to curtail his liberties, nor by subsidies that bring only more bureaucracy and their ultimate collapse. And I shall continue to opposethem.', 'The most practicable relief to the farmer today aside from general economic recovery is a definite program of readjustment and coordination of national, State, and local taxation which will relieve real property, especially the farms, from the unfair burdens of taxation which the current readjustment in values have brought about. To that purpose I propose to devote myself.', 'I have always favored the development of rivers and harbors and highways. These improvements have been greatly expedited in the last 30 years. We shall continue that work to completion. After 20 years of discussion between the United States and our great neighbor to the north, I have signed a treaty for the construction of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence seaway. That treaty does not injure the Chicago to the Gulf waterway, the work upon which, together with the whole Mississippi system, I have expedited, and in which I am equally interested. We shall undertake this great seaway, the greatest public improvement ever undertaken upon our continent, with its consequent employment of men as quickly as that treaty can be ratified.', 'Our views upon sound currency require no elucidation. They are indelibly a part of Republican history and policies. We have affirmed them by preventing the Democratic majority in the House from effecting wild schemes of uncontrolled inflation in the last 4 months.', 'There are many other important subjects set forth in the platform and in my public statements in the past for which I will not take your time. There are one or two others that do merit some emphasis.', 'The leadership of the Federal Government is not to be confined to economic and international questions. There are problems of the home and the education of children and of citizenship. They are the most vital of all to the future of the Nation. Except in the case of aids to States which I have recommended for stimulation of the protection and health of children, they are not matters of legislation. We have given leadership to the initiative of our people for social advancement through this organization against illiteracy, through the White House conferences on the protection and health of children, through the national conferences on homeownership, through the stimulation of social and recreational agencies. These are the visible evidences of spiritual leadership in the Government. They will be continued, and they will be constantly invigorated.', 'My foreign policies have been devoted to strengthening the foundations of world peace. We inaugurated the London Naval Treaty which reduced arms and limited the ratios between the fleets of the three powers. We have made concrete proposals at Geneva to reduce the armaments of the world by one-third. It would save the taxpayers of the world a billion a year. We could save ourselves 200 millions a year. It would reduce fear and danger of war. We have expanded the arbitration of disputes. I have recommended joining the World Court under proper reservations preserving our freedom of action. Above all, we have given leadership in the transforming of the Kellogg-Briand Pact from an inspiring outlawry of war to an organized instrument for peaceful settlements backed by definite mobilized world public opinion against aggression. We shall, under the spirit of that pact, consult with other nations in time of emergency to promote world peace. We shall enter into no agreements committing us to any future course of action or which call for use of force in order to preserve peace.', 'I have projected a new doctrine into international affairs--the doctrine that we do not and never will recognize title to the possession of territory gained in violation of the peace pacts which were signed with us. That doctrine has been accepted by all the nations of the world on a recent critical occasion, and within the last few days has been again accepted by all the nations of the Western Hemisphere. That is public opinion made tangible and effective.', 'The world needs peace. It must have peace with justice. I shall continue to strive unceasingly, with every power of mind and spirit, to explore every possible path that leads towards a world in which right triumphs over force, in which reason rules over passion, in which men and women may rear their children not to be devoured by war but to pursue in safety the nobler arts of peace.I shall continue to build upon these designs.', ""Across the path of the Nation's consideration of these vast problems of economic and social order there has arisen a bitter controversy over the control of the liquor traffic. I have always sympathized with the high purpose of the 18th amendment, and I have used every power at my command to make it effective over this entire country. I have hoped that it was the final solution of the evils of the liquor traffic against which our people have striven for generations. It has succeeded in great measure in those many communities where the majority sentiment is favorable to it. But in other and increasing numbers of communities there is a majority sentiment unfavorable to it. Laws which are opposed by the majority sentiment create resentments which undermine enforcement and in the end produce degeneration and crime."", 'Our opponents pledge the members of their party to destroy every vestige of constitutional and effective Federal control of the traffic. That means that over large areas the return of the saloon system with its corruption, its moral and social abuse which debauched the home, its deliberate interference with the States endeavoring to find honest solution, its permeation of political parties, its perversion of legislatures, which reached even to the Capital of the Nation. The 18th amendment smashed that regime as by a stroke of lightning. I cannot consent to the return of that system again.', 'We must recognize the difficulties which have developed in making the 18th amendment effective and that grave abuses have grown up. In order to secure the enforcement of the amendment under our dual form of government, the constitutional provision called for concurrent action on one hand by the State and local authorities and on the other by the Federal Government. Its enforcement requires, therefore, independent but coincident action of both agencies. An increasing number of States and municipalities are proving themselves unwilling to engage in that enforcement. Due to these forces there is in large sections increasing illegal traffic in liquor. But worse than this there has been in those areas a spread of disrespect not only for this law but for all laws, grave dangers of practical nullification of the Constitution, an increase in subsidized crime and violence. I cannot consent to a continuation of that regime.', 'I refuse to accept either of these destinies, on the one hand to return to the old saloon with its political and social corruption, or on the other to endure the bootlegger and the speakeasy with their abuses and crime. Either of them are intolerable, and they are not the only ways out.', 'Now, our objective must be a sane solution, not a blind leap back to old evils. Moreover, a step backwards would result in a chaos of new evils not yet experienced, because the local systems of prohibition and controls which were developed over generations have been in a large degree abandoned under this amendment.', 'The Republican platform recommends submission of the question to the States and that the people themselves may determine whether they desire a change, but insists that this submission shall propose a constructive and not a destructive change. It does not dictate to the conscience of any member of the party.', 'The first duty of the President of the United States is to enforce the laws as they exist. That I shall continue to do to the best of my ability. Any other course would be the abrogation of the very guarantees of liberty itself.', 'Now, the Constitution gives the President no power or authority with respect to changes in the Constitution itself; nevertheless, my countrymen have a right to know my conclusions upon this question. They are based upon the broad facts that I have stated, upon my experience in this high office, and upon my deep conviction that our purpose must be the elimination of the evils of this traffic from this civilization by practical measures.', 'It is my belief that in order to remedy present evils a change is necessary by which we resummon a proper share of initiative and responsibility which the very essence of our Government demands shall rest upon the States and the local authorities. That change must avoid the return of the saloon.', 'It is my conviction that the nature of this change, and one upon which all reasonable people can find common ground, is that each State shall be given the right to deal with the problem as it may determine, but subject to the absolute guarantees in the Constitution of the United States to protect each State from interference and invasion by its neighbors, and that in no part of the United States shall there be a return of the saloon system with its inevitable political and social corruption and its organized interference with other States and other communities.', 'American statesmanship is capable of working out such a solution and making it effective.', 'My fellow citizens, the discussion of great problems of economic life and of government seem abstract and cold. But within their right solution lies the happiness and the hope of a great people. Without such solution all else is mere verbal sympathy.', ""Today millions of our fellow countrymen are out of work. Prices of farmers' products are below a living standard. Many millions more who are in business or hold employment are haunted by fears for the future. No man with a spark of humanity can sit in my place without suffering from the picture of their anxieties and hardships before him day and night. They would be more than human if they were not led to blame their condition upon the government in power. I have understood their sufferings and have worked to the limits of my strength to produce action that would be of help to them."", 'Much remains to be done to attain recovery. We have had a great and unparalleled shock. The emergency measures now in action represent an unparalleled use of national power to relieve distress, to provide employment, to serve agriculture, to preserve the stability of the Government, and to maintain the integrity of our institutions. Our policies prevent unemployment caused by floods of imported goods and of laborers. Our policies preserve peace in the world. They embrace cooperation with other nations in those fields in which we can serve. With patience and perseverance these measures will succeed.', 'Despite the dislocation of economic life our great tools of production and distribution are more efficient than ever before; our fabulous national resources, our farms and homes and our skill are unimpaired. From the hard-won experience of this depression we shall build stronger methods of prevention and stronger methods of protection to our people from abuses that have become evident. We shall march to a far greater accomplishment.', 'With the united effort we can and will turn the tide towards the restoration of business, of employment, and of agriculture. It does call for the utmost devotion and the utmost wisdom. Every reserve of American courage and vision must be called upon to sustain us and to plan wisely for the future.', 'Through it all our first duty is to preserve unfettered that dominant American spirit which has produced our enterprise and our individual character. That is the bedrock of the past, and it is the sole guarantee of the future. Not regimented mechanisms but free men are our goal. Herein is the fundamental issue. A representative democracy, progressive and unafraid to meet its problems, but meeting them upon the foundations of experience and not upon the wave of emotion or the insensate demands of a radicalism which grasps at every opportunity to exploit the sufferings of a people.', 'With these courses we shall emerge from this great national strain with our American system of life and government strengthened. Our people will be free to reassert their energy and their enterprise in a society eager to reward in full measure those whose industry serves its well-being. Our youth will find the doors of equal opportunity still open.', 'The problems of the next few years are not only economic. They are also moral and spiritual. The present check to our material success must deeply stir our national conscience upon the purposes of life itself. It must cause us to revalue and reshape our drift from materialism to a higher note of individual and national ideals.', 'Underlying every purpose is the spiritual application of moral ideals which are the fundamental basis of the happiness of a people. This is a land of homes and of churches and schoolhouses dedicated to the sober and enduring satisfactions of family life and the rearing of children in an atmosphere of ideals and of religious faith. Only with those ideals and those high standards can we hold society together, and only from them can government survive and business prosper. They are the sole insurance to the safety of our children and to the continuity of the Nation.', 'If it shall appear that while I have had the honor of the Presidency that I have contributed to the part required from this high office to bringing the Republic through this dark night, and if in my administration we shall see the break of dawn of the better day, I shall have done my part in the world. No man can have a greater honor than that.', 'I have but one desire: that is, to see my country again on the road to prosperity which shall be more sane and lasting through the lessons of this experience, to see the principles and ideals of the American people perpetuated.', 'I rest the case of the Republican Party upon the intelligence and the just discernment of the American people. Should my countrymen again place upon me the responsibilities of this high office, I shall carry forward the work of reconstruction. I shall hope long before another 4 years have passed to see the world prosperous and at peace and every American home again in the sunshine of genuine progress and of genuine prosperity. I shall seek to maintain untarnished and unweakened those fundamental traditions and principles upon which our Nation was rounded, upon which it has grown. I shall invite and welcome the help of every man and woman in the preservation of the United States for the happiness of its people. This is my pledge to the Nation and my pledge to the Almighty God.']"
1,Herbert Hoover ,"October 04, 1932","['[1.] ROCK ISLAND, ILLINOIS (11:15 a.m.)', 'I deeply appreciate the cordiality and enthusiasm of your reception. It is most heartening. My many friends in Rock Island have extended most hospitable invitations to me during the past 2 years to visit your city. I regret exceedingly that I have not been able to do so. I know you all realize the difficulties with which the country has been confronted and appreciate that the greatly enlarged burdens upon the office of the President have made it impossible for me to accept such pleasures. Indeed, the duties of my office are still so pressing that I shall have the opportunity to visit but few parts of our country during this campaign to talk directly to the people about the problems before us and the work of the administration.', 'I should like to have had this personal contact, but I am sure you and our other cities and States will realize that the work of the Government with its vast reconstruction program and greatly enlarged administrative responsibilities must be given complete precedence in these difficult times.', 'Your city is directly participating in many ways in the reconstruction work of the Government, not only in speeding up of public buildings, but as you know, I have been intensely interested in the development of waterways for many years.', 'Two years ago we passed the necessary legislation authorizing construction of the full 9-foot channel for the upper Mississippi to Minneapolis and St. Paul. The first point of attack on this great project has been at Rock Island. I have been keeping track of the progress of the work. We have expedited it even more rapidly than originally intended in order to aid unemployment. The War Department informs me that the new locks are nearly completed and while the other works at Rock Island were contracted to be completed in March 1934, they will most likely be completed at a much earlier date. We are also expediting work on the river above, and we will see the full 9-foot waterway from St. Paul and Minneapolis to New Orleans completed much earlier than originally anticipated. Full 9-foot transportation between Rock Island and the other cities on the Mississippi River system cannot fail to advance prosperity of your city.', 'I shall not attempt to discuss national issues with you in so short a time as this. I trust you may be able to listen this evening to my statement at Des Moines. I wish you to know how deeply I appreciate your coming to meet me and the encouragement you give.', '[2.] DAVENPORT, IOWA (11:25 a.m.)', 'I deeply appreciate your reception upon my entry to my native State. It gives me a glow of happiness and encouragement.', 'Davenport is one of the towns which I visited as a boy in this State. If I were able to go through the town today, I would not be able to recognize a single part because of its growth and improvement.', 'A moment ago at your sister city across the river, I referred to the relation to you of the great reconstruction program which the Government is putting forward in aid to recovery from the depression. You in Davenport are equally interested in the legislation passed 2 years ago for the construction of the 9-foot channel in the upper Mississippi to Minneapolis and St. Paul. Here has been the first point of major attack in that great construction work. We have greatly speeded it up as an aid to employment. The whole of this improved waterway in which your city is so much interested will be completed long before originally anticipated.', 'There is another point at which the reconstruction program of the Government touches your community deeply. Well do I remember a visit from your citizens in presenting to me the plight of the leading banking institution of your city which had been compelled to suspend, not because of mismanagement, not because of lack of validity of its assets, but because of the impossibility of instantly realizing these deposits and assets to meet demands of depositors. With the assistance we were able to give through the Reconstruction Corporation to the patriotic effort of your citizens that bank has been reopened; thousands of depositors have been saved. The pressure has been removed from thousands of borrowers that they should instantly pay their loans. The institution has been constructively functioning in your community.', 'These examples better than words of mine indicate the solicitude which I and my colleagues have had for you in these times.', 'I thank you for the welcome you have accorded me to the State where I was born. I deeply appreciate your encouragement and your support.', '[3.] WEST LIBERTY, IOWA (12:30 p.m.)', ""I am deeply affected by the cordiality and generous welcome which you have given me. I am glad to make even this short visit to the town where I was carried as occasional baggage during my boyhood. It has been an especial pleasure to meet old friends of my boyhood and especially Mrs. Carran, the devoted and self-sacrificing teacher of my first schooling. It all brings back recollections of all those adventures and joys of living that come to childhood. These adventures on an American farm in an American village are the stimulus in life I could wish for every boy and girl. Working with one's hands in the growing crops, the harvest, the preparation for winter, new discoveries and adventures in the streams and the hills with every changing season--all build for health and the understanding of life which is denied many of our city children."", ""No food will ever taste so good as the family supper of those days; no sport will ever equal the mud-lined swimming hole; no speed will ever seem so great as sliding down hills on one's tummy. No prowess in ascendancy over wild animals will ever equal the rabbit tracked through the snow to his lair; no deed of valor so great as to bring him back alive."", 'I deeply appreciate your reception and thank you for the warmth of your greeting.']"
2,Herbert Hoover ,"October 04, 1932","['My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate the welcome which you have given me this evening. I am unable to speak of the depth of feeling that I have for the reception which I have received from the hour that I stepped foot on my native State.', ""I am glad, as a son of the soil of this State, to come back to where I was born and where I spent the first 10 years of my boyhood. My parents and my grandparents came to Iowa in the covered wagon--' pioneers in this community. They lie buried in your soil. They broke the prairie into homes of independent living. They worshiped God; they did their duty to their neighbors. They toiled to bring to their children greater comfort, better education, and to open to them a wider opportunity than had been theirs."", 'It was my destiny in the solicitude for an orphaned family to be taken by the old emigrant railway train westward to the Pacific coast and ultimately to fix my home and hopes in California. My sons fly those journeys in a span of daylight.', 'These contrasts of a half century are a vivid picture of the change and the progress of American life.', 'My experiences of later years have in no way diminished my memories and my gratitude to my native State. It was here that the doors of opportunity were first opened to me. It was here that I was given that tender care of mind and body, those first steps in education, that knowledge of poverty and struggle for family betterment which contribute to a real understanding of American life.', 'And with it all, even in those days, a boy had his first contact with the wider life of the Nation. Not that childhood grasps or understands these questions, but great forces, then as now, touched every home and farm in our country.', 'As a boy I walked alongside the torchlight procession in the Garfield campaign. I was awed by the whispered anxiety when the President was shot by an assassin and by the genuine grief of every person in that village when the flag was placed at half-mast on his passing.', 'I have been accorded the highest honor which my country can bestow--that is to lead it amongst the nations of the world in the paths of peace and to serve in the stern duty of the battle against the invisible forces of a great world calamity.', 'It was in this community, in this State that I came in contact with my first economic depression. I was born in the midst of the terrible times of the seventies, with their poverty and their difficulties. And only in that period has our Nation had to meet a situation in any degree comparable with that with which we now contend. That was the economic storm which broke upon us when the aftermath of the Civil War coincided with the wars of Europe. But in those days agriculture and industry were less dependent upon each other, and there was far less interdependence amongst the nations of the world, and thus the violence of the storm in human suffering and loss was infinitely less disastrous.', 'Not that I would suggest that at that age I knew what an economic depression was or that I had ever heard the words, but I do vividly recollect a Christmas upon that farm when the sole resources of joy were popcorn balls, sorghum, and hickory nuts; when for a flock of disappointed children there were no store toys, no store clothes; when it was carefully explained that because of the hard times everything must be saved for the mortgage. The word ""mortgage"" became for me a dreaded and haunting fear from that day to this.', 'I know now from reading history that that Christmas was also a time when the country was coming out of a great depression. The Democratic Party was still coquetting with the panacea of that time--greenbacks. I did not then know what greenbacks were, but I do know that that family tightened its belt and, with confidence, voted for James A. Garfield, a Republican President.', 'My purpose tonight is to deal with some of the problems of the day. Seldom in our history have we gone through greater dangers, or have the difficulties before the Nation been of such gravity. They attain this gravity not only because of the unprecedented dislocation in our domestic life but because our problems are worldwide.', 'Aside from the value of truth, the causes and origins of this unparalleled storm are of importance only as they indicate the policies we must pursue to attain our safety. I say to you that a storm which embraces the whole world, which ramifies to every village in China, every sheep ranch in patagonia, every factory in Germany, every mine in Australia, every countinghouse in England, every farm in the State of Iowa, is the result of a terrific disruption in civilization itself. Something infinitely deeper and of greater portent has happened in the world than any reaction from our own reckless speculation and our own reckless exploitation. We are contending today with forces at home and abroad that still threaten the very safety of civilization.', 'I know it seems a far cry to the village home of America from the effect of the 40 million people who were killed, starved, or maimed in the Great War, with all its loss in skill and character. It seems a far cry from the increase in debt of governments from $20 billion before the war to $220 billion immediately after or an amount equal to nearly two-thirds the value of the whole United States. It seems a far cry from the effect of an increase in the peace armies of the world in 20 years from 2 million of men to 5 million of men with the hate and suspicion that they excite. It seems a far cry from the last 12 years of frantic political and financial policies of foreign nations, with the ultimate collapse of governments and revolutions and dictatorships.', 'You can test the part which the Great War played in the difficulties in your own home and their relation to the gravity of the situation today right at your own doors.', 'You will recollect that the values of land in this State doubled and trebled under the transitory demands of the Great War. You will recollect the expansion of mortgages, the collapse in values immediately thereafter, the doubling of taxation, the aftermaths--all of which are still a part of the problems you are struggling with. You know the stifling of your markets from the collapse of other nations under the calamities they have inherited from the war.', 'Now, we have fought an unending war against the effect of these calamities upon our people in America. This is no time to recount the battles on a thousand fronts. We have fought the fight to protect our people in a thousand cities from hunger and cold.', 'We have carried on an unceasing campaign to protect the Nation from those unhealing class bitternesses which arise from strikes and lockouts and industrial conflict. We have accomplished this through the willing agreement of employer and labor which placed humanity before money through the sacrifice of profits and dividends before wages.', 'We have defended millions from the tragic result of droughts. We have mobilized a vast expansion of public construction to make work for the unemployed. We fought the battle to balance the budget. We have defended the country from being forced off the gold standard, with its crushing effect upon all who might be in debt. We have battled to provide a supply of credits to merchants and farmers and industries. We have fought to retard falling prices. We have struggled to save homes and farms from foreclosure of mortgages, battled to save millions of depositors and borrowers from the ruin caused by the failure of banks, fought to assure the safety of millions of policyholders from failure of their insurance companies, and fought to save commerce and employment from the failure of railways.', 'We have fought to secure the disarmament and to maintain the peace of the world. We have fought for stability in other countries whose failure would inevitably injure us. And, above all, we have fought to preserve the safety, the principles, and the ideals of American life. We have builded the foundations of recovery.', 'Now, all these battles, related and unrelated, have had a single strategy and a single purpose. That was to protect your living, your comfort, and the safety of your fireside. They have been waged and have succeeded in protecting you from infinitely greater harm that might have come to you.', 'Thousands of our people in their bitter distress and losses today are saying that ""things could not be worse."" No person who has any remote understanding of the forces which confronted this country during these last 18 months ever utters that remark. Had it not been for the immediate and unprecedented actions of our Government things would be infinitely worse today.', 'Instead of moving forward we would be degenerating for years to come, even if we had not gone clear over the precipice, with the total destruction of every ideal we hold dear.', 'Let no man tell you that it could not be worse. It could be so much worse that these days now, distressing as they are, would look like veritable prosperity.', 'In all these great efforts there has been a constant difficulty of translating the daily action into terms of public understanding. The forces in motion have been so gigantic, so complex in character, the instrumentalities and actions that we must undertake to deal with them have been so involved, the figures we must use are so astronomical as to seem to have but little relation to the family in the apartment or the cottage or on the farm.', 'Many of these battles have had to be fought in silence, without the cheers of the limelight or the encouragement of public support, because the very disclosure of the forces opposed to us would have undermined the courage of the weak and induced panic in the timid and would have destroyed the very basis of success.', 'Hideous misrepresentation and unjustified complaint have had to be accepted in silence for the national good. It has been as if a great battle in war should be fought without public knowledge of any incident except the stream of the dead and the wounded from the front. There has indeed been much of tragedy, but there has been but little public evidence of the dangers and enormous risks from which a great national victory has been achieved.', 'I have every confidence that the whole American people know in their hearts that there has been but one test in my mind, one supreme object in the measures and policies we have forged to win in this war against depression: that test was the interest of the people in the homes and at the firesides of our country. I have had before me but one vision: that is, the vision of the millions of homes of the type which I knew as a boy in this State.', 'I wish to describe one of the battles we have fought to save this Nation from a defeat that would have dragged farmers and city dwellers alike down to a common ruin. I know that it is the most involved of economics and the most complex of descriptions to attempt. But I shall try it if you will have patience. That battle was fought parallel with other battles on other fronts. Much of what I will tell you has been hitherto undisclosed. It had to be fought in silence, for it will be evident to you that had the whole of the forces in motion been made public at that time there would have been no hope of victory because of the panic through fear and the destruction of confidence that very disclosure would have brought. Happily we have won this battle. There is no longer any danger from disclosure.', 'Our own speculative boom had weakened our own economic structure, but the critical assaults and dangers swept upon us from foreign countries. We were therefore plunged into a battle against invading forces of destruction from abroad, a battle to preserve the financial integrity of our Government, to counteract the terrific forces of deflation aligned against us, to protect the debtor class who were being strangled by the contraction of credit and the demands for payment of debt, to prevent our being pushed off the gold standard, which in our country would have meant disaster to every person who owed money, and finally to preserve the savings of the American people.', 'We were fighting to hold the Gibraltar of world stability, because only by holding this last fortress could we be saved from a crashing world with a decade of misery and the very destruction of our form of government and our ideals of national life.', 'When 18 months ago the financial systems of Europe were no longer able to stand the strain of their war inheritances and of their after-war economic and political policies, of their debt and their political and military actions, an earthquake ran through 40 nations. Financial panics; governments unable to meet their obligations; banks unable to pay their depositors; their citizens, fearing inflation of currency, seeking to export their savings to foreign countries for safety; citizens of other nations demanding payment of their loans; financial and monetary systems either in collapse or remaining only in appearance. The shocks of that earthquake ran from Vienna to Berlin, from Berlin to London, from London to Asia and to South America. From all those countries they came to this country, to every city and farm in it.', 'First one and then another of those 40 nations either abandoned payment in gold of their obligations to other countries, or restricted payments by their citizens to foreign countries, so as to practically amount to at least a temporary or a partial repudiation of public and private debts. Every one of them, in a frantic endeavor to reduce the expenditures of their citizens, imposed drastic restrictions upon their imports of goods. These events were not as children playing with blocks. They brought revolutions, mutinies, riots, downfalls of governments, and a seething of despair which threatened civilization itself.', 'In order to prevent total collapse of the German people and its inevitable effect upon us, I brought about the German moratorium and the so-called German standstill agreements by which Europe was given a breathing spell in which to arrange and stabilize its affairs. But the shocks grew in violence, and finally, at the end of September a year ago, the difficulties of Europe culminated with the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England, followed by many other nations. With no stability in foreign currencies trade again slackened because merchants could not calculate. the amount they might realize when they shipped their goods.', 'Now, an amazing statement was made a few days ago in this State that the passage of the Tariff Act of 1930 ""started such a drain on the gold reserves of the principal commercial countries as to force practically all of them off the gold standard."" The facts are that the Tariff Act was not passed until nearly a year after this depression began.', 'This earthquake started in Europe. The gold of Europe was not drained and never has been drained. It has increased in total every year since the passage of the Tariff Act and is right now $1,500 million greater than when the act was passed, and the tariff is still operating. It has been my daily task to analyze and to know the forces which brought these calamities. I have to look them in the face. They require far more penetration than such assertions as this would indicate.', 'The shocks which rocked these nations came from profound depths; their spread gave fearful blows to our own system, finally culminating October last in what, had they not been courageously met with unprecedented measures, would, because of our peculiar situation, have brought us to greater collapse than many of the countries of Europe.', 'The first effect of these shocks on us was from foreign dumping of American securities on our markets which demoralized prices upon our exchanges, depreciated the securities and investments held by our insurance companies and our trusts, foreign buying power stagnated because of their internal paralysis and this in turn stifled the markets for our farms and factories; it increased our unemployment and by piling up our surpluses demoralized our agricultural prices even further.', 'The frantic restrictive measures on exchanges which they took and the abandonment of gold standards made it impossible for American citizens to collect billions of the moneys due to us for goods which our citizens had sold abroad, or short-term loans they had made to facilitate commerce. At the same time citizens of those foreign countries demanded payment from our citizens of the moneys due for goods which they had sold to our merchants and for securities they had sold in our country.', 'Before the end foreign countries drained nearly a billion dollars of gold and a vast amount of other exchange from our coffers.', 'We had also to meet an attack upon our own flank from some of our own people who, becoming infected with world fear and panic, withdrew vast sums from our own banks and hoarded it from the use of our own people, to the amount of nearly $1,500 million. This brought its own train of failures and bankruptcies. Even worse, many of our less patriotic citizens started to export their money to foreign countries for fear we should be forced onto a paper money basis.', 'Now, all this cataclysm did not develop at once. It came blow by blow. Its effect upon us grew steadily, and our difficulties mounted higher day by day.', 'This is no time to trace its effect stage by stage. No statement of mine is needed to portray the effects which you have felt at your own door. No statement could portray the full measure of perils which threatened us as a nation.', 'Three of the great perils were invisible except to those who had the responsibility of dealing with the situation.', 'The first of these perils was the steady strangulation of credit through the removal of $3 billions of gold and currency by foreign drains and by the hoarding of our own citizens from the channels of our commerce and business. And let me remind you that credit is the lifeblood of business, the lifeblood of prices and of jobs.', 'Had the consequences of this action, of that drain been allowed to run their full extent, it would have resulted, under our system of currency and banking, in the deflation of credit anywhere from $20 to $25 billions, or the destruction of nearly one-half of the immediate working capital of the country. There would have been almost a universal call for the payment of debts which would have brought about inevitable universal bankruptcy because property could not be converted into cash, no matter what its value.', 'There .were other forces equally dangerous. The tax income of the Federal Government is largely based upon profits and income. As these profits and income disappeared, the Federal resources fell by nearly one-half, and thus the very stability of the Federal Treasury was imperiled. The Government was compelled to borrow enormous sums to meet current expenses.', 'The third peril, which we escaped only by the most drastic action, was that of being forced off of the gold standard. I would like to make clear to you what that would have meant had we failed in that sector of the battle. Going off the gold standard in the United States would have been a most crushing blow to most of those with savings and those who owed money, and it was these we were fighting to protect.', 'Going off the gold standard is no academic matter. By going off that standard, gold goes to a premium, and the currency dollar becomes depreciated. In our country, largely as a result of fears generated by the experience after the Civil War and by the Democratic free-silver campaign in 1896, our people have long insisted upon writing a large part of their long-term debtor documents as payable in gold.', 'A considerable part of farm mortgages, most of our industrial and all of our Government, most of our State and municipal bonds, and most other long-term obligations are written as payable in gold.', 'This is not the case in foreign countries. They have no such practice. Their obligations are written in currency. When they abandon the gold standard and gold goes to a premium, the relation of their domestic debtors and creditors is unchanged because both he who pays and he who receives use the same medium. But if the United States had been forced off the gold standard, you in this city would have sold your produce for depreciated currency. You would be paid your bank deposits and your insurance policy in currency, but you would have to pay a premium on such of your debts as are written in gold. The Federal Government, many of the States, the municipalities, to meet their obligations, would either need to increase taxes which are payable in currency, or alternatively, to have repudiated their obligations.', 'Now, I believe I can also make it clear to you why we were in danger of being forced off the gold standard, even with our theoretically large stocks of gold. I have told you of the enormous sums of gold and exchange that were drained from us by foreigners. You will realize also that our citizens who hoard Federal Reserve and our other forms of currency are in effect hoarding gold because under the law we must maintain 40 percent gold reserve behind such currency. Owing to the lack in the Federal Reserve System of the kind of securities required by the law for the additional 60 percent of coverage of the currency, the Reserve System was forced to increase their gold reserve up to 75 percent. Thus with $1,500 million of hoarded currency, there was in effect over $1 billion of gold hoarded by our own citizens.', 'These drains had at one moment reduced the amount of gold we could spare for current payments to a point where the Secretary of the Treasury informed me that, unless we could put into effect a remedy, we could not hold to the gold standard in the United States for 2 weeks longer because of inability to meet the demands of foreigners and our own citizens for gold.', 'Being forced off the gold standard in the United States means chaos. Never was our Nation in greater peril, not alone in banks and financial systems, money and currency, but that forebode dangers--moral and social--with years of conflict and disarrangement.', 'In the midst of this hurricane the Republican administration kept a cool head, and it rejected every counsel of weakness and cowardice. Some of the reactionary economists urged that we should allow the liquidation to take its course until it had found its own bottom. Some people talked of vast issues of paper money. Some talked of suspending payments of Government issues. Some talked of setting up a Council of National Defense. Some talked foolishly of dictatorship--any one of which ideas would have produced panic in itself. Some assured me that no administration could propose increased taxes in the United States to balance the budget in the midst of a depression and survive an election.', 'However, we determined that we would not enter the morass of using the printing press for currency or bonds. All human experience has demonstrated that that path once taken cannot be stopped, and that the moral integrity of the Government would be sacrificed because ultimately both currency and bonds must become valueless.', 'We determined that we would not follow the advice of the bitter-end liquidationists and see the whole body of debtors of the United States brought to bankruptcy and the savings of our people brought to destruction.', 'We determined we would stand up like men and render the credit of the United States Government impregnable through the drastic reduction of Government expenditures and increased revenues until we balanced that budget. We determined that if necessary we should lend the full credit of the Government thus made impregnable to aid private institutions to protect the debtor and the savings of our people.', 'We decided, if necessary, upon changes in the Federal Reserve System which would make our gold active in commercial use, and that we would keep the American dollar ringing true in every city in America and every country in the world. We determined that we would expand credit to offset the contraction brought about by hoarding and foreign withdrawals; that we would strengthen the Federal land banks and all other mortgage institutions; that we would lend to the farmers for Production; that we would protect the insurance companies, the building and loan associations, the savings banks, the country banks, and every other point of weakness in this Nation.', 'We determined to place the shield of the Federal Government in front of those local communities in protection of those in distress, and that we would increase employment through profitable construction work with the aid of Government credit.', 'On the 3d of October last year, I called to Washington the leading bankers of the country and secured from them an agreement to combine the resources of the banks to stem the tide. They pledged themselves to $500 million for this purpose. On October 6, I called in the leaders of both political parties. I placed before them the situation at home and abroad. I asked for unity of national action. That unity was gladly given. We published a united determination to the country to meet the situation. Our people drew a breath of relief. The ship swung to a more even keel.', 'But by the 1st of December the storm had grown in further intensity abroad, and the menace became more serious than ever before. With the opening of Congress in December, I laid before it a program of unprecedented dimensions to meet our unprecedented situation.', 'Now, the battalions and regiments and armies which we thus mobilized for this great battle turned the tide toward victory by July. The foreigners drew out most of the money that they could get, but finding that the American dollar rang honest, they gained in confidence, and they are now sending it back. Since June, $275 million of gold has flowed back to us from abroad. Hoarders in our own country, finding our institutions safeguarded and safe, have returned $250 million to the useful channels of business. The securities held by our insurance companies, our savings banks, and our benevolent trusts have recovered in value.', ""The rills of credit are expanding. The pressure on the debtor to sacrifice his all in order to pay his debts is steadily relaxing. Men are daily being reemployed. If we calculate the values of this year's agricultural products compared with the low points, the farmers as a whole, despite the heartbreaking distress which still exists, are a billion dollars better off. Prices have a long way to go before the farmer has an adequate return, but at least the turn is toward recovery."", 'Now, I have been talking of gold and of currency, of credit and of banks and bonds and insurance policies and of loans. Do not think these things have no human interpretation. The happiness of 120 million people was at stake in the measure to enable the Government to meet its debts and obligations, to save the gold standard, in enabling 5,500 banks, insurance companies, building and loan associations, and a multitude of other institutions to pay their obligations and ease their pressure upon their debtors. These institutions have been rendered safe and with them several million depositors, policyholders, and borrowers.', 'More than half of all of them were in the Midwest--500 in your own State of Iowa. Had they gone down, the shock of their failure would have carried down with them every man and institution who owed money and the whole employment and marketing fabric of the United States into chaos.', 'I wish I could translate what these perils, had they not been overcome, would have meant to each person in the United States. The financial system is not alone intrusted with your savings. Its failure means that the manufacturer cannot pay his worker, the worker cannot pay his grocer, the merchant cannot buy his stock of goods, the farmer cannot sell his products. The great clock of economic life stops. Had we failed, disaster would have translated itself into despair in every home, every village, and every farm.', 'Now, we won this great battle to protect our people at home. We held the Gibraltar of world stability. The world today has a chance. It is growing in strength. Let that man who complains that things could not be worse thank God for this victory and make reverent acknowledgement to the courage and stamina of a great democracy.', 'Let him also be thankful for the presence in Washington of a Republican administration. I say this with full consideration of its portent, for I wish to call your attention to the part which the dominating leadership, the majority of the Democratic Party has played in this crisis. I wish to bring before you the real doctrines and programs of the men who then and now and in the future will dominate that party.', 'You will recollect that the congressional election 2 years ago gave the control of the lower House of Congress to our opponents. They were also in position to control the policies of the Senate. After that election their leaders announced to the world that their party would present a program to restore prosperity. One year later, when the new Congress assembled last December in the midst of this crisis, they presented no program.', 'The administration did present a program which has saved the country from disaster. That program was patriotically supported by many members of the Democratic Party who joined in enactment of these measures. To these men, who placed patriotism above party, I pay tribute, but later in that session of Congress the opposition majority of the House of Representatives could not restrain the real purposes and doctrines of their party. It is of importance to the country to realize what that program was, for the American people are asked to intrust the future of the United States into the hands of these same men and to these policies.', 'At a time when the most vital need was for the reduction of expenditures and the balancing of the budget to preserve the stability of the Federal Government as the keystone of all stability, they produced a program of pork-barrel legislation in the sum of $1,200 million for nonproductive and unnecessary works at the expense of the American taxpayer. They produced the cash bonus bill. They passed that through the House of Representatives by their leadership. I opposed it. It failed in the Senate. Under that bill it was proposed to expend $2,300 million. Worse still, the bill that they passed provided the bonus should be paid through the creation of sheer fiat money. They would have made our currency a football to every speculator and every vicious element in the financial world at the very time when we were fighting for the honesty of the American dollar.', 'I can do no better than to quote Daniel Webster, who, 100 years ago, made one of the most prophetic statements ever made when he said:', '""He who tampers with the currency robs labor of its bread. He panders, indeed, to greedy capital, which is keen-sighted and may shift for itself, but he beggars labor, which is unsuspecting and too busy with the pursuit: of the present to calculate for the future. The prosperity of the workpeople lives, moves and has its being in established credit and steady medium of payment.""', ""The experience of scores of governments in the world since that day has confirmed Webster's statement, and yet the dominant leadership of the Democratic Party--and I am not accusing the Democratic minority who stood out against these things--but that dominant leadership passed that measure to issue paper money through the Democratic House of Representatives."", 'And, further, the administration proposed economy measures to bring about reduction in specialized governmental expenditures by $250 to $300 million. When those recommendations had passed through the filter of the Democratic majority of the House, only $50 million of savings were left, and yet we hear a multitude of speeches from them on the subject of governmental economy.', 'They passed a bill to destroy the effectiveness of the Tariff Commission. I vetoed that bill. They passed a price-fixing bill creating what might be colloquially called the ""rubber dollar."" I opposed that also. They passed a provision for loans to corporations and everybody else, whether they were affected and guarded by public interest or not. It would have made the Government the most gigantic pawnbroker of history. I vetoed that. They passed other measures with this same reckless disregard for the safety of the Nation.', 'All this undermined public confidence and delayed all the efforts of the administration and the powerful instrumentalities which we had placed in action to save the country. Those of you who will recollect will realize that last March there was a period of upward trend, and after that we descended again into the abyss through these destructive actions. These measures represented the dominant Democratic control, and they brought discouragement and delay to recovery.', 'That recovery began the moment when it was certain that these destructive measures of this Democratically-controlled House of Representatives had been stopped. Had that program passed, it would have been the end of recovery, and if it ever passes, it will end hope of recovery. These measures were not simply gestures for vote-catching. These ideas and measures represented the true sentiments and doctrines of the majority of the men who control the Democratic Party. A small minority of Democratic Members of the House and the Senate disapproved of these measures. These men obviously no longer voice the control of that party. This program was passed through the Democratic House of Representatives under the leadership of the gentleman who has been nominated the Democratic candidate for Vice-President, and thus these measures and policies were approved by that party.', 'At no time in public discussion of the vital issues of this campaign has any Democratic candidate, high or low, disavowed these destructive acts which must again emerge if they come to power. I ask you to compare this actual Democratic program and these Democratic actions with the constructive program produced by the administration to meet the emergency. And I ask: Do you propose to place these men in power and subject this country to that sort of measures and policies ? It is by their acts .in Congress and their leadership that you shall know them.', 'Now, of vital concern to you and to all the Nation are the difficulties of agriculture. They have been of vital concern to me for the whole of these difficult years. I have been at the post to which the first news of every disaster is delivered and to which no detail of human suffering is ever spared. I have heard the cries of distress, and not only as a sympathetic listener but as one oppressed by a deep sense of responsibility to do all that human ingenuity could devise. I wish to speak directly to those of my hearers who are farmers of what is on my mind, of what is in my heart, to tell you the conclusions that I have reached from this bitter experience of the years in dealing with these problems which affect agriculture at home and their relations abroad.', 'That agriculture is prostrate needs no proof. You have saved and economized and worked to reduce costs, but with all this, yours is a story of suffering and distress.', 'What the farmer wants and needs is higher prices, and in the meantime to keep from being dispossessed from his farm, to have a fighting chance to save his home. The immediate and pressing question is how these two things are to be attained. Every decent citizen wants to see the farmer receive higher prices and wants to see him keep his home. Every citizen realizes that the general recovery of the country cannot be attained unless these things are secured to the farmer.', 'Every thinking citizen knows that most of these low price levels and most of this distress, except in one or two commodities where there is an unwieldy surplus, are due to the decreased demand for farm products by our millions of unemployed and by foreign countries. Every citizen knows that part of this unemployment is due in turn to the inability of the farmer to buy the products of the factory. Every thinking citizen knows that the farmer, the worker, and the businessman are in the same boat and must all come to shore together.', 'Every citizen who stretches his vision across the whole United States realizes that for the last 3 years we have been on this downward spiral owing to the destructive forces some of which I have already described. If he has this vision, he today takes courage and hope because he also knows that these destructive forces have been stopped; that the spiral is now moving upward; that more men are being employed and are able to consume more agricultural products.', 'The policies of the Republican Party and the unprecedented instrumentalities and measures which have been put in motion--many of which are designed directly for agriculture--are winning out. If we continue to fight along these lines we shall win.', 'There are 12 facets of this subject, 12 parts of the problem that I should like to discuss with you. The first is that the very basis of safety to American agriculture is the protective tariff.', ""The Republican Party originated and proposes to maintain the protective tariff on agricultural products. We will even widen that tariff further if it is necessary to protect agriculture. Ninety percent of the farmer's market is at home, and we propose to reserve that market to him."", 'Now, has the Democratic Party ever proposed or supported a protective tariff on farm products ? Has it ever given one single evidence of protection of this home market to the American farmer from the products raised by peasant labor on cheap land abroad ?', 'The Democratic Party, as you know, took the tariff off a large part of farm products in 1913, and put them on the free list. A Republican Congress passed the emergency farm tariff in 1921, and a Democratic President vetoed it. The Democratic minority in the next Congress in 1921 voted against the revived emergency farm tariff. The Republican majority passed it, and the Republican President signed it.', 'The Democratic minority voted against the increase of agricultural tariffs in the Republican tariff of 1922. Most of the Democratic Members of Congress voted against the increases in the tariff bill of 1930. Their platform enunciates the principle of ""a competitive tariff for revenue."" What that competition must mean is peasant labor and cheap lands. That is the kind of competition we don\'t want. Their candidate states that: ""We sit on a high wall of a Hawley-Smoot tariff; .... sealed by the highest tariffs in the history of the world""--which incidentally isn\'t true--""a wicked and exorbitant tariff."" He calls it: ""a ghastly jest,"" and states that ""our policy declares for lowered tariffs."" This is surely a promise of reducing farm tariffs. They will reduce farm tariffs if they come to power.', 'When you return to your homes you can compare prices with foreign countries and count up this proposed destruction at your own firesides. There are at this minute 2 million cattle in the northern States of Mexico seeking a market. The price is about $2.50 per 100 pounds on the south bank of the Rio Grande. It is $4.50 on the north bank--and only the tariff wall in-between.', 'Bad as our prices are, if we take comparable prices of farm products today in the United States and abroad, I am informed by the Department of Agriculture that you will find that, except for the guardianship of the tariff, butter could be imported for 25 percent below your prices, pork products for 30 percent below your prices, lamb and beef products from 30 to 50 percent below, flaxseed for 35 percent below, beans for 40 percent below, and wool 30 percent below your prices, Both corn and wheat could be sold in New York from the Argentine at prices below yours at this moment were it not for the tariff. I suppose these are ghastly jests.', 'Now, the removal of or reduction of the tariff on farm products means a flood of them into the United States from every direction, and either you would be forced to further reduce your prices, or your products would rot in your barns.', 'The opposition party has endeavored to persuade our farmers that increased tariffs abroad are the result of reprisals against the United States. There are a half dozen suppressions of truth in that statement that are of profound interest especially to the farmer. The first is that many increases in tariffs abroad took place before, and not after, our farm tariffs were increased. The second is that the restrictions on imports in most cases are not directed at the United States. They are for the purpose of reducing all expenditure of their people during their financial crises. The third is that if we survey the growls of some nations when our tariffs were changed, we find the objections in overwhelming majority were directed at the increase in our agricultural tariffs. American farmers are entitled to know this. The very object of our increases was to protect them in our home market.', 'The main thing that those countries want is entrance for their surplus agricultural products into our markets. Many of those countries would decrease their tariffs against our industrial goods tomorrow in exchange for reduction on their farm products to us, but that is no help to our farmer.', ""Now, the Democratic Party proposes that they would enter into bargaining tariffs to secure special concessions from other countries for the entry of American goods. They represent this to be in the farmer's interest. But I may tell you here and now that the largest part of the whole world desires to make only one bargain with the United States. The bargain these countries wish to make is to lower our tariff on agricultural products in exchange for lowering their tariffs on our industrial goods. American industrial leaders, realizing the needs of the American farmer, do not want to be a part of such bargains."", 'Now, all tariff acts contain injustices and inequities. That is the case in the last tariff bill. I have never said that tariff bill was perfect. Some people get too much, and some people get too little. But those of you who have followed the accomplishments of this administration will recollect that I secured in the last tariff act, 25 years after it had originally been advocated by President Theodore Roosevelt, the adoption of effective flexible tariff provisions to be administered by a bipartisan body. That authority of a bipartisan Tariff Commission to revise the tariff is based upon a definite principle of protection to our people, and it is one of the most progressive acts which have been secured in the history of all American tariff legislation.', 'By maintaining that reform the country need no longer be faced with heartbreaking logrolling, selfishness, and greed which come to the surface on every occasion when Congress tries to revise the tariff.', 'This bipartisan Commission has now been engaged for over 18 months in an effective revision of the tariff. It has heard every complaint. It has found that many rates were just. It found some were too high and some too low. But if there are tariffs which are too high and result in damage to the American people, those tariffs can be readjusted by mere application to the Commission and the presentation of the evidence thereof. That tribunal is open to all the people.', 'Now, our opponents opposed this reform in tariff legislation. They passed a bill last session to destroy the independence of the Commission. They propose in their platform to destroy it. The reasons for this action are obvious. The bipartisan Tariff Commission has proved a serious political embarrassment to them. Either one of the Houses of Congress has the right to call upon the Tariff Commission for reconsideration of any schedule by a mere resolution. Notwithstanding their outcries against the 1930 tariff act, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, after being in session for 7 months, did not pass a single resolution requesting readjustment of a single commodity or a single schedule.', 'What the Democratic Party proposes is to reduce your farm tariffs. Aside from ruin to agriculture, such an undertaking in the midst of the depression will disturb every possibility of recovery.', ""Now, 4 years ago organized agriculture requested the passage of an agricultural marketing act. I called a special session of Congress to pass such an act and to increase tariffs on farm products. A distinguished board of men recommended by organized agriculture was appointed to administer the act, and they were given a capital of $500 million to use for the benefit of the American farmer. Those portions of the Board's activities which directed themselves to the support and expansion of cooperative marketing organizations have proved of great benefit to the farmer. Today over a million farm families participate in the benefits and organizations which flow from the Farm Board."", 'Now, I wish to state frankly the difficulties that have arisen under some other portions of the act. They arise mostly from the so-called stabilization provisions which never were and are not now the major purpose of the Farm Board. Even indirect purchase and sale of commodities is absolutely opposed to my own theory of government.', 'When the panic struck agricultural prices some 2 years ago, the Board determined that unless the markets were supported hundreds of thousands of farmers would be bankrupt by the sale of their products at less than the money they owed, less than the money they had already borrowed upon and that a thousand country banks would likely be closed and that a general panic was possible.', 'As a result of emergency purchases which they undertook, the prices of farm commodities were temporarily held and their fall cushioned. The farmers secured hundreds of millions of dollars of income which they would not otherwise have received.', 'Experience has shown that the patent weakness of such actions is the damaging aftermath which accompanies disposal of these products. I am convinced that the act should be revised in the interest of the farmer, in the light of our 3 years of experience, and that this particular provision should be repealed.', 'Now, for several years the United States Department of Agriculture has studied the complex social and economic problems which lie bedded in the general problem of land use. About a year ago these studies had reached such a point that the Secretary of Agriculture felt justified in calling a nationwide conference of farm leaders, economists, agricultural college authorities, to formulate a practical means of action. The broad objective of such a program is to promote the reorganization of agriculture so as to divert lands from unprofitable to Profitable use and to avoid the cultivation of lands the chief return on which is the poverty and misery of those who live upon them. The Republican platform contains a plank which constitutes the first declaration upon that subject. I shall be happy to support any sound program.', 'Now, 4 years ago, in this State, I gave assurance to the farmers and to our own people at large that one of the first policies of my administration would be the vigorous prosecution and completion of the inland waterway system and advancement of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence seaway as a fundamental relief to Midwest business and agriculture. I am glad to report to you that more than twice the amount of work has been done on the waterways in the last 3 years than in any similar period in the history of the United States. I am also glad to report that after 20 years of discussion, of examination, and intermittent negotiation a treaty has been signed with Canada which only awaits ratification of the United States Senate and the Dominion Parliament for us to undertake that great contribution to the strengthening of the Midwest in its reaching out to world markets.', 'We have suffered from unprecedented droughts both to the north and to the south of you. Some other sections have been unable to obtain credit for seed and feed for livestock. Through various governmental agencies loans to the amount of about $120 million have been made to over 900,000 of our families to rehabilitate their production and ameliorate that situation. Some of these families are in difficulties in making immediate repayment because of demoralized prices. I have seen to it that they are not unduly pressed.', 'Last April, I delivered an address to the conference of the Governors of the various States. I stated in effect that the most inflexible tax in our country is the tax on land and on real property generally. It is the least adaptable to the varying income of the taxpayers. I stated that in the present situation the taxes upon farms and homes and real property have become almost unbearable and that such taxes are wholly out of proportion to other forms of taxes. I stated then emphatically that there is no farm relief more needed today than readjustment of land taxes.', 'Now, the Federal Government collects no direct property taxes, but at that meeting I proposed that we should review the whole relations of our tax system between the Federal, State, and local governments and seek a basis of taxation for each that would give opportunity for readjustments between our different forms of government. Such readjustments should be found which would enable the States to find other sources of tax revenue and would more equitably distribute the burden over the whole people. I announced last April that I would call tax experts of the Nation together to determine the methods we should pursue. I shall do so as soon as the national election is out of the way, and I shall then recommend methods to Congress.', 'The very first necessity in preventing collapse and securing recovery in agriculture is to keep open to the farmer the banking and other sources from which to make short-term loans for planting, harvesting, feeding livestock, and other production necessities. That has been accomplished indirectly in a large measure through the increased authority to the Federal Reserve System and its expansion of credits-also indirectly through the Reconstruction Corporation loans to your banks. It has been aided directly through the intermediate credit banks and especially through the 10 new agricultural credit associations which alone can command over $300 million credit and which are now being erected and within the next week will be operating in all parts of the country. We are thus rapidly everywhere restoring normal short-term credits to agriculture.', 'In another direction upon my recommendation the Reconstruction Corporation has been authorized to make credit available to processors to purchase and carry their usual stocks of agricultural products and thus relieve a burden which was resting on farm prices because the farmer was forced to carry these stocks himself. But even more important than that, at my recommendation that Corporation has been authorized to make credits available for sales of farm products in new markets abroad. This is today and will, with increasing activity, I believe, extend immediate markets in relief of farmers and the price of products.', 'Now, the mortgage situation--that is, long-term credits--is one of our most difficult problems. On the 6th of October a year ago, I secured and published an undertaking from the leaders of both political parties that we should extend aid in this situation. In December we appropriated $125 million directly to increase the capital of the Federal land banks, and we provided further capital to these banks through the authority of the Reconstruction Corporation to purchase their bonds when needed. The purpose was to enable the Federal land banks to expand their activities and to give humane and constructive consideration to those indebted to them who were in difficulties. In the large sense, it has pursued that policy. A little over 1 percent of the farms held under mortgage by the Federal land bank system today are under foreclosure, and these are mostly cases where men wished to give up.', 'The character of the organization of the joint stock land banks whose business methods are not controlled by the Federal Farm Loan Board has resulted in unjust pressure for payments in some of those banks. The basis of that organization should be remedied. We have sought to further aid the whole mortgage situation by loans from the Reconstruction Corporation to banks, mortgage companies, and insurance companies generally, to enable them to transmit consideration to their borrowing farmers. Indeed, as a result of these actions hundreds of thousands of foreclosures have been prevented.', 'But despite the relief afforded by these measures, the mortgage situation has become more acute. There must be more effective relief. In it lies a primary social problem.', 'I conceive that in this civilization of ours, and more particularly under our distinctive American system, there is one primary necessity to its permanent success. That is, we must build up men and women in their own homes, on their own farms, where they may find their own security and express their own individuality.', 'Now, a nation on such foundations is a nation where the real satisfactions of life and happiness thrive. It is where real freedom of mind and aspiration secure that individual progress in morals, in spirit and accomplishment, the sum of which makes up the greatness of American life. Some will say this is a mere ideal. I am not ashamed of ideals. America was rounded upon them, but they must be the premise for practical action.', 'And for prompt and practical action I have, during the last month, or at least in the developments of the last 2 months, finally secured definite and positive steps in coordination of the policies not only of the Federal agencies but of the important private mortgage agencies as well. These agencies have undertaken to give you their help in the solution of this problem.', 'But further and more definitely than this, I shall propose to Congress at the next session that we further reorganize the Federal land banks, and that we give to them the resources and liberty of action, which they do not today possess, which may be necessary to enable them definitely and positively to expand in the refinancing of the farm-mortgage situation where it is necessary to give men who want to fight for it a chance to hold their homes.', 'I cannot overemphasize the importance of the element of world stability in the recovery and expansion of our agricultural and other markets. This involves the promotion of good will, of disarmament, and of maintenance of peace. It requires the rebuilding of the credit structure within nations which have been forced off the gold standard or compelled to default or to restrict exchange. Until that is done there is a definite blockade upon the movement of commodities and upon the market for farm products. We have given aid in these things. That we may get to grips with these questions in the interest of agriculture and all of our industry and in the interest of world progress itself, I am participating in the organization of a world economic conference to be held late this year. Every intelligence the world can command will be concentrated on the rehabilitation of economic stability.', 'I shall send a representative of agriculture as a member of that world conference.', 'And in connection with agriculture, I may mention the question of war debts. I do not approve cancellation of these debts. I certainly do not approve the proposal of our opponents to lower our tariffs in order that by profits gained from a flood of goods into the United States this debt should be transferred to our workers by putting them out of employment and to our farmers by forcing their produce to rot in their barns. It would be better to cancel the debts than to do that.', 'In my acceptance address I stated the reverse of that proposal. I said that:', '""If for some particular annual payment we are offered some other tangible form of compensation, such as the expansion of markets for American agriculture and labor and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity, then I am sure our citizens would consider such a proposal.""', 'I am prepared to go farther. I am prepared to recommend that any annual payment on the foreign debt be used for the specific purpose of securing an expansion and an opening of the foreign markets for American agricultural products. There is justice in that, for the difficulties inherited from the war are part of the agricultural difficulties at this moment. Now, that is a proposal of more importance to the farmer than many a panacea.', ""In the advancement of agricultural prices from the depression the first fortress to 'take and to hold was the increased tariffs on farm products. This is, of course, what would be surrendered if our opponents had their way. The next move in the battle for improved prices was to stop the general deflation. By deflation I mean the lessening of market values and prices for land, products of the land, manufactures, and securities and everything we possess. That battle has been won. The next attack on this front is to reverse these processes of deflation and bring things back to their real values. That battle is in progress, and we must all move together."", 'The Government is giving aid by its vast constructive program for agriculture, for commerce, and for industry. Through the renewed flow of credit for industry and by direct measures of employment, by the great cooperative movements which we have instituted in commerce and industry, for attacks all along the line, we are returning men to work. Every new man reemployed is a greater purchaser of farm products. Wherever we properly can, without entangling ourselves in political difficulties, we are and should join in the rehabilitation of the world and thereby the foreign markets for agricultural products. Now, I come to you with no economic patent medicine especially compounded for farmers. I refuse to offer the counterfeit currency or false hopes. I will not make any pledge which I cannot fulfill.', 'As I have stated often before, in the shifting battle against depression we shall need to adopt new measures and new tactics as the battle moves on. The essential thing is that we should build solidly and soundly for the future. My solicitude and willingness to advance and protect the interests of agriculture is shown by the record. Protection and advancement of this industry will have my continued deepest concern, for in it lies the progress of all America. It was in this industry that I was born.', 'The battle against depression is making progress. We are still faced with forces which render 10 million men idle and agriculture prostrate. We have forged new weapons, we have turned the tide from defense to attack. I shall continue that fight. It calls for that cooperation, for that courage and patience and fortitude with which our fathers conquered these prairies.', 'Now, in conclusion, my friends, there are many other subjects of vast importance to our country. The farmers of America are not selfishly interested in their own industry alone. They are Americans with the same concern for the welfare of the Nation in its multitude of other problems at home and abroad. Time does not permit of their exposition tonight. The issues are grave; the stake is great.', 'These issues rise above the concern of an ordinary campaign. Our cause is not alone the restoration of prosperity. It is to soundly and sanely correct the weaknesses in our system which this depression has brought to the surface. It is the maintenance of courageous integrity in political action and in government. It is the holding of this Nation to the principles and ideals which it has had from its very beginning. It is to make a nation of free men and women.', 'Finally, let me deal for a moment with an ultimate reality. I have had to describe the complicated processes of currencies and taxation and other dreary things. They are but the tools we use to manage the processes by which we answer the old, old question, wherewithal shall we live? They are necessary tools, but they are not an end in themselves. Our toils and cares are for a higher purpose.', 'We are not a nation of 120 million solitary individuals, we are a nation of 25 million families dwelling in 25 million homes, each warmed by the fires of affection and cherishing within it a mutual solicitude for kinfolk and children. Their safety is what we are striving for. Their happiness is our real concern. Our most solemn hope for them is that they may share richly in a spiritual life as well, that puts them not only at peace with their fellows but also in harmony with the will of a beneficent Providence.', 'Out of our strivings for material blessings must come safety for homes and schools and churches and holding of national ideals and the forming of national character. These are the real aspirations of the American people. These are the promises of America, and these promises must be fulfilled.']"

In the reception I have had from the people of my own State, I have seen evidence of that friendliness which warms one's heart. Firs in the escort provided by the veterans from every town and village in the State, the splendid reception at the Coliseum, and now your own gathering, and if I might judge from the response to my remarks, they are all good, hard-working Republicans."", 'BY STANDER.

In the enthusiasm of the many receptions on this trip and in the remarkable reception in Des Moines yesterday, I see a rising resolution and a stern determination to fight to a finish for the continuation of constructive action in this emergency and for the preservation of fundamentals in our Government. That is a mission for every one of you individually.', 'I wish to take the occasion of this meeting to say a word to you and to all the people of the great Midwest. During my public life, I have believed that sportsmanship and statesmanship called for the elimination of harsh personalities between opponents. On this journey, however, I have received a multitude of reports as to the widespread personal misrepresentations which have been promulgated in the Midwest in the past few weeks. I regret that the character of these personalities necessitates a direct word from me.', 'I shall say now the only harsh word that I have uttered in public office. I hope it will be the last I shall have to say. When you are told that the President of the United States, who by the most sacred trust of our Nation is the President of all the people, a man of your own blood and upbringing, has sat in the White House for the last 3 years of your misfortune without troubling to know your burdens, without heartaches over your miseries and casualties, without summoning every avenue of skillful assistance irrespective of party or view, without using every ounce of his strength and straining his every nerve to protect and help, without using every possible agency of democracy that would bring aid, without putting aside personal ambition and humbling his pride of opinion, if that would serve--then I say to you that such statements are deliberate, intolerable falsehoods.']"

There is no State I know that has such a varied beauty and such a varied character of industry and where the people are more self-reliant and self-sufficient than those in West Virginia. It is generous of you to come out to greet me this morning, to give to me the encouragement of your presence here and this promise that you are actively participating in this campaign and this assurance of the reelection of the Republican Party on November 8.', 'I deeply appreciate your coming. It is heartening, and I thank you for it.', '[2.] CUMBERLAND, MARYLAND ( 10:35 a.m.)', 'Even if no other reminder were needed, the mills of Cumberland would recall the importance of the protective tariff. If it were not for that Republican policy these Celanese mills would be closed down this minute.', 'The people of Maryland are vastly interested in maintaining the protective tariff. You have taken an active interest in it ever since the founding of this Republic.', 'The people of Maryland had a large part in the passage of the first protective tariff in our country. On April 11, 1789, a group of manufacturing workers and others of Baltimore joined in a petition to President Washington and the first session of the First Congress. It was indeed the first petition filed with the Congress.', 'They prayed that the new government would render the country ""independent in fact as well as in name"" and give early attention to ""the encouragement and protection of American manufacturers and workmen by invoking upon all foreign articles which can be made in America such duties as would give a just and decided preference to their labors and thereby discontinue that trade which tended to so materially injure them.""', 'President Washington responded to that petition, and the first piece of legislation passed by the Congress and signed by the first President was a protective tariff.', 'From that day to this the State of Maryland has had this independence which its citizens demanded. It has grown constantly in strength. And not only are the industries of Maryland today dependent on protective tariff but a large part of her agriculture as well. Your dairy products, truck products, wheat, corn, livestock are so near the seaboard that the countries of cheap production could penetrate your markets and do great injury to your farming industry. You will find that today practically every farm article produced in the State of Maryland could be imported for less than the present price, depressed as those prices may be.', 'The Democratic Party is opposed to a protective tariff. It proposes to reduce these tariffs. In its platform in lieu of a protective tariff, it proposes a competitive tariff for revenue. It denounces the present tariffs as exorbitant. Their candidates and supporting orators demand reduction in the face of depreciating currencies in foreign countries during the last 12 months which have resulted in still further reduction of their living standards. Indeed, the increase in imports into our country of certain lines of manufacture by virtue of this depreciation is already beginning to displace our workmen in certain localities. I would submit to the thoughtful citizens of Maryland that your first interest lies in sustaining the party whose policies and whose candidates alone can be relied upon to maintain protection to your jobs, your farms, and your industries from destruction through imports of cheap goods and the products of cheap land.', '[3.] MEYERSDALE, PENNSYLVANIA (11:47 a.m.)', ""It is a great pleasure to meet you, I assure you.

But when I deliver it tonight I shall remember your friendly faces and shall imagine that you are listening at your radios--so I shall feel that you are in my audience after all.', 'Again, I thank you for coming here to greet me and to wish me good luck.', '[7.] ZELIENOPLE, PENNSYLVANIA (3:58 p.m.)', 'I deeply appreciate the greeting which you have extended to me. It is encouraging and heartening. It is a good sign of your support. This is not an occasion on which to endeavor to talk to you about great national issues. I am going to talk to you tonight. I hope many of you will be able to listen in. I shall remember your faces and this platform when I discuss the matter before the Cleveland audience. I find difficulty in expressing what I feel for the support you are giving by coming here this afternoon.', 'Thank you.', '[8.] NEW CASTLE, PENNSYLVANIA (4:30 p.m.)My dear friends:', 'I deeply appreciate this greeting which you have given to Mrs. Hoover and myself. I know of nothing that is more encouraging, that is more stimulating, and more heartening than the manner in which we have been received on this journey by the people of southwestern Pennsylvania. It is not an occasion on which to speak of national issues, during a short stop in your town, but I am in hopes you may be able-many of you--to listen in this evening when I shall make an effort to explain to you the major purposes of my administration and the service which the Republican Party is giving and can give to this Nation.', 'Your coming here this afternoon is evidence of your support, and it is evidence of the support which you will give on the 8th of November, and I do thank you for it.', '[9.] YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO (5 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate your coming here this afternoon to extend to Mrs. Hoover and myself this greeting. It is heartening and encouraging. It is evidence of your support.', 'I need not tell you that our Nation has been passing through an unprecedented crisis, and I need not tell you it has had its reflex in your city and in every home. Your banks have been closed. Your mills have been partially shut down. You have much unemployment. You have much distress. You have great anxiety for the future. All this is the result of forces which have swept the United States from abroad, and against which this administration has carried on a continuous battle from the day that they first appeared. And in carrying forward that battle we have forged great weapons in defense of the American people and in defense of the industries and employment of your city and of your homes. You will recognize that one of the instruments of the Government, which was created, intervened and secured the reopening of the banks in your city. The employment which we have gradually stimulated over the country has begun to reflect itself in this very city. I fortunately have in my hands a telegram that reached me a few moments ago, which has given to me great encouragement, and I know it will be encouraging to you. It says:', '""The Associated Press carries following Youngstown dispatch: Improvement in steel production next week will raise mill operations in Youngstown district above 20 percent of capacity for first time in many months. Finishing mill activity also will increase. Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company\'s Bessemer plant, idle for 2 weeks, will resume during the week, giving Company\'s highest steel tonnage output since last May.""', 'That, my friends, is tangible and positive evidence that we are winning in this battle. It is an encouraging result of the effort that has been made by this administration and the effort being made by our people.', 'I wish before departing to mention one other subject. When you consider what you will do on next November 8 you should remember a primary Republican policy, on which the safety of your city and your State is builded, and that is the continuance of the protective tariff. Our opponents propose to reduce that tariff. It has been the sustaining factor; it has been the guardian of your industries in Ohio during this last 40 years. President McKinley, of your State, more than any one other man effectively established that policy as a fixed purpose of the Republican Party. He did so because of his recognition of its vital importance to the Nation and to this State. It is indeed a matter of deep concern to you that that policy as well as the measures and policies instituted and initiated by the Republican Party shall be continued in this Nation.', 'I deeply appreciate your coming to give me this greeting and this welcome. It is evidence of your support in the battle which we are carrying on.', '[10.] AKRON, OHIO (6:25 p.m.)', 'Mrs. Hoover and I deeply appreciate your cordial greeting. Ohio has a personal interest for us both because her parents and mine both sprung from the soil of this great State, which has contributed so notably to the material and spiritual growth of our country. Now, within a few hours I shall be talking to the people of Ohio on national issues. I will not take your time now to go into these questions on this occasion. Presumably, you may be able to listen in later on. There is, however, one issue I would like to emphasize to the people of Akron. Ohio is in the first rank of States in agriculture, mining, transportation, and manufacture. It is an outstanding example of the benefits of the American policy of protective tariff which is one of the cardinal principles of the Republican Party.', 'Your city, with its diversified industries, is a manifest and I hope an enduring monument to the protective tariff. Never was the protective tariff needed more than right at this moment. Over 30 commercial countries have been compelled to abandon the gold standard. With the consequent depreciation of their currencies, their standards of living and their wages have fallen to an extraordinary degree during the last 12 months. The differences between the cost of production of commodities in those countries and the cost of production in the United States with our higher standards of wages are now wider than ever before.', 'Already rubber goods, in the manufacture of which many of you are deeply interested, are beginning to flow into the United States in large quantities because of this depreciation. The Treasury Department, under my direction, has been holding an inquiry during the past week to determine whether these imports are in violation of our laws aimed at the dumping of foreign goods. The Tariff Commission has also undertaken an inquiry to determine whether the duties on rubber goods should be increased in order to give adequate protection to the American rubber industry.', 'Here I will point out to you one of the most important and progressive steps ever taken in American legislation. That was the effective authority given by the act of 1930 to the Tariff Commission, a bipartisan body, under which it may, after determining the relative costs of production at home and abroad, either increase or decrease tariff duties in order that if, on the one hand, the tariffs may be too high they may be lowered, but, of far more importance at the present time, if the tariffs should be too low in order to protect American labor, they may be increased.', 'The Democratic Party is not only opposed to the protective tariff in principle, but proposes to take from the Tariff Commission the authority to make tariff adjustments and return the whole question of the tariff once more to the madhouse of congressional logrolling.', 'The Democratic Party proposes to reduce the tariff. Never before was the retention of this policy more necessary in order to protect American workers.', 'My friends, we have been passing through a great crisis. The many measures we have taken to mitigate the devastation of the economic storm that swept upon us from abroad have helped many of your institutions and have held for you much employment that would otherwise have been lost. They have aided in the care of your unemployed. We are making recovery. We shall see a restoration of employment and business if we continue the battle on these lines.', 'I hope you will continue the Republican Party in power on the 8th day of November.']"
6,Herbert Hoover ,"October 15, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'It gives me a great deal of pleasure to appear on the platform with my friend Mr. Ingalls, my friends the Senators and the Senator to be elect, my other friends who are candidates for the House of Representatives from Ohio. These men have served you well and will serve you well in the future. I commend them to the people of Ohio.', 'I have come to Cleveland tonight because of the depth of my feeling that it is in the vital interest of this Nation that the war which we have been waging against terrific forces which have disrupted our economic life should be carried forward by a Republican administration. A change in the strategy of that war--of those policies--may convert what is now a victorious battle in progress into a defeat of the American people.', 'A few days ago, I spoke at Des Moines with relation to agriculture. My remarks this evening will be directed largely to employment, to the wage and salary earners. I propose to review what the administration has done, and the measures and policies that .it has in action together with the relation of those policies to those of our opponents. Now, as President of the United States, I have the duty to speak to the workers, but I have also a certain personal right to so speak.', ""When I talk to you tonight about labor I speak not out of academic imaginings but from sharp personal experience. I have looked at these human problems not only from the fireside of one who has returned from a day's work with his own hands, but I know the problem that haunts the employer through the night, desperate to find the money with which to meet the week's payroll. In public service during years past I have had to look at these problems from the point of view of the national welfare as a whole."", 'Now, the people of a free nation have a right to ask of their Government, ""Why has our employment been interrupted ? What measures have you taken in our protection ? What has been done to remove the obstacles from the return of our work to us ?"" They not only have a right to ask these questions, but they have a right to an answer. I am here tonight to give that answer.', 'During these past 3 years our economic system has received the most terrific shock and dislocation which, had not strong action been taken by your Government, would have imperiled the Republic and the whole hope of recovery. It has affected business and industry and employment and agriculture alike. It is appropriate to repeat that while many of our measures are directed to the protection and assistance of particular groups, yet all are in the same boat, and all must come to shore together. And how are they to get to shore ? By listening to those who manifestly display a lack of knowledge of the character of the storm and of the primary problems of navigation ? By boring holes in the bottom of the boat? By throwing overboard the measures designed to meet the storm and which are proving their effectiveness ?', 'Now, our opponents have been going up and down the land repeating the statement that the sole or the major origins of this disruption and this worldwide hurricane came from the United States through the wild flotation of securities and the stock market speculation in New York 3 years ago, together with the passage of the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill, which took place 9 months after the storm broke.', 'I propose to discuss this assertion.', 'First, because it can be proved absolutely untrue.', 'Second, because the United States did not bring this calamity on the world. The United States is not the oppressor of the world.', 'Third, because it can be demonstrated to be founded upon a complete misunderstanding of what has happened in the world.', 'Fourth, because any party which exhibits such a lack of economic understanding upon which to base national policies should not be trusted with the fate of 25 million American families. They should not be trusted to command the battle against the most gigantic economic emergency with which our people have ever been confronted, and to bring that battle to victorious issue in the reestablishment of the functioning of our economic machine.', 'This thesis of the opposition as to the origin of our troubles is a wonderful explanation for political purposes. I would be glad, indeed, if all the enormous problems in the world could be simplified in such a fashion. If that were all that were the matter with us, we could have recovered from this depression 2 years ago instead of fighting ever since that moment against the most destructive forces we have ever had to meet in the whole history of the United States-and I might say fighting victoriously.', 'Nowhere do I find the slightest reference in all the statements of the opposition party to the part played by the greatest war in history, the inheritances from it, the fears and panics and dreadful economic catastrophes that have developed from these causes in foreign countries, or the idea that they may have had the remotest thing to do with the calamity against which this administration is fighting night and day.', 'The leaders of the Democratic Party appear to be in ignorance of the effect of the killing or incapacitating of 40 million of the best youth of the Earth, or of the stupendous cost of war--a sum of $300 billion or nearly equal to the value of all the property in the United States, or the stupendous inheritance of debt, with its consequent burden of taxes in scores of nations and with the stifling effect of these taxes on recuperation of industry or commerce and the paralyzing effect upon world commerce in the continued instability of currencies and budgets.', 'Democratic leaders have apparently not yet learned of the political instability that arose all over Europe from the harsh treaties which ended the war and the constant continuing political agitation and the creation of fear which has from time to time paralyzed all confidence. They have apparently never heard of the continuing economic dislocation from the transfer on every frontier of great masses of people from their former economic setting.', 'They apparently have not heard of the continuing dislocation of the stream of economic life which was caused by the carving of 12 new nations out of 3 old empires. Those nations have a rightful aspiration to build their own separate economic systems; they naturally have surrounded themselves with tariffs and other national protections; they have thereby diverted the long-established currents of trade. I presume, however, that if our Democratic leaders should hear of these nine new tariff walls introduced into the world some 14 years ago they would lay them at the door of the Smoot-Hawley bill passed 12 years later.', 'The Democratic leaders have apparently not heard of the increase of standing armies of the world from 2 to 5 million men, with the consequent burdens upon the taxpayer and the constant threat to the peace of the world.', ""They apparently ignore the effect of revolution among 300 million people in China, or the agitations among 300 million people in India, or the Bolshevist revolution among 160 million people in Russia. They have ignored the effect of Russia's dumping into the world the commodities taken from its necessitous people in a desperate effort to secure money with which to carry on--shall I call it a new deal ?"", 'The Democratic leaders apparently have never heard that there has been gigantic overproduction of rubber in the Indies, or sugar in Cuba, or coffee in Brazil, or lead in Burma, or oil in Russia or Venezuela, or gigantic areas of new wheat lands in the Argentine and Canada. In each and every case these great over productions, far beyond consumption even in boom times, have crashed into the immutable law of supply and demand and brought inevitable collapse in prices and with it a train of bankruptcies and destruction of the buying power for American goods.', 'The Democratic leaders appear not to recognize that these forces finally generated economic strangulations and fears and panics, the streams of which precipitated another long series of worldwide disasters.', 'They apparently never heard that there followed revolutions in Spain, in Portugal, in Brazil, in the Argentine, in Chile, in Peru, in Ecuador, and Siam and attempts at revolution in a dozen other countries--all of them resulting in a partial or a practical repudiation of their debts and the constant decrease in buying power for our goods.', 'They seem not to know that the further accumulation of all these causes and dislocations finally put a strain upon the weakened economic systems of Europe until one by one they collapsed in failure of their gold standards and the partial or total repudiation of their debts. The Democratic leaders would hold the American people ignorant that every one of these nations in their financial crises imposed direct or indirect restrictions on the import of goods in order to reduce expenditures of their people. They call these ""reprisals"" against the Hawley-Smoot bill.', 'They apparently have never heard of the succeeding jeopardy-jeopardy into which our Nation was put through these destructions of world commerce, or the persistent dumping of securities into the American market from these panic-stricken countries, or the gigantic drains upon our gold and exchange, or the consequent fear that swept over our people, causing them to draw from our bank resources $1,500 million-all of which contracted our credit and resulted in demand for payment of debts right and left, and thwarted our every effort for industrial recovery.', 'Yet in face of all these tremendous facts, our Democratic friends leave the impression with the American people that the prime cause of this disaster was the boom in flotations and stock prices and a small increase in American tariffs.', 'Now, such an impression is unquestionably sought by the Democratic candidate when he states: ""That bubble burst first in the land of its origin--the United States. The major collapse followed abroad. It was not simultaneous with ours.""', 'Now, I do not underrate the distressing losses to millions of our people or the weakening of our strength from the mania of speculation and flotation of securities 3 years ago. But I may incidentally remark that the State governments have the primary responsibility to protect their citizens in these matters and that the vast majority of these transactions originated or took place in the State of New York.', 'But as to the accuracy of the statement which I have quoted I may call your attention to a recent bulletin of the highly respected National Bureau of Economic Research, in which it is shown that this depression in the world began in 11 countries, having a population of nearly 600 million people, before it even appeared in our country, instead of the bubble having ""burst first in the United States."" Their report shows the depression in eight other countries, with a population of another 600 million, started at the same time with ours. In fact, the shocks from the continued economic earthquakes in these other countries carried our prices far below the values that we would have otherwise sunk to, with all its train of greatly increased losses, perils, and unemployment.', 'Now, our opponents demand to know why the governmental leaders or businessmen over the world did not foresee the approach of these disintegrating forces. That answer is simple. The whole world was striving to overcome them, but finally they accumulated until certain countries could no longer stand the strain, and their people, suddenly being overtaken with fear and panic, through hoarding and the export of their capital for safety, brought down their own houses, and these disasters spread like a prairie fire through the world. No man can foresee the coming fear or panic, or the extent of its effect. I did not notice any Democratic Jeremiahs.', 'So much for the beginnings and forces moving in this calamity. And I have spent some moments upon them because it is necessary that the American people should understand them if it shall have a comprehension of the problems which it has to meet.', 'I now come to the amazing statements that the tariff bill of 1930 has borne a major influence in this debacle also.', 'I quote from the Democratic candidate; he says: ""The Hawley-Smoot bill is one of the most important factors in the present worldwide depression.', '""At another place: ""It has destroyed international commerce.""', 'At another place: ""The tariff has done so much to destroy foreign trade as to make foreign trade virtually impossible.""', 'Now, I shall analyze the accuracy of these statements not only because I should like to get before my countrymen a picture of the lack of understanding which the Democratic Party has of world trade, but also for the further reason that it is of vital importance to labor and .to our agriculture that, as our opponents have this obsession, it means that if they are intrusted with control of our Government, they intend to break down the protective tariff which is the very first line of defense of the American standard of living against these new and destructive forces.', 'Now, it requires a collection of dull facts to demonstrate the errors in these bald assertions.', 'At the beginning I may repeat that this tariff bill was not passed until 9 months after the economic depression began in the United States and also not until 20 other countries had already gone into the depression.', 'The Democratic Party seldom mentions that 66 percent of our imports are free of duty, but that happens to be the fact. From one-half to two-thirds of the trade of the world is conducted in nondurable goods-that is, mostly raw materials; some part are luxuries, upon which all nations collect tariffs for revenue; another part, probably less than one-third of the whole, is in competitive goods so far as the importing nation is concerned, and therefore, subject to protective tariffs.', 'Now, the trade of the world has distressingly diminished under the impact of these successive dislocations. But the decrease is almost exactly the same in the free goods everywhere as in the dutiable goods. That is the case in the United States. If the Smoot-Hawley bill reduced our imports of dutiable goods as our opponents claim and thereby destroyed international commerce, what was it that reduced the two-thirds of nondurable goods ?', 'Now, if we explore a little further, we will find from the Tariff Commission that the total duties collected in a comparable year represent 16 percent of the total imports--that is under the present tariff bill--that being an increase from 13.8 percent of the previous tariff bill. In other words, the effect of the new tariff was an increase of 2.2 percent when applied to the whole value of our imports. This is the margin which our opponents say have pulled down foreign governments, created tyrannies, financial shocks, and revolutions.', 'I may mention that, upon the same basis of calculation, the McKinley duties were 23 percent, the Dingley duties were 25 percent, the Payne-Aldrich duties were 19 percent of the whole of our imports-all compared with the 16 percent of the present tariff--and yet they produced no revolutions in foreign countries, no financial crises; they did not destroy the whole world nor destroy American trade.', ""And I may explore the facts a little further. The 5-year average of the import trade of the United States before the depression was about 12 Percent of the whole of the world's import trade. Now, the thesis of our opponents is that if you embarrass import trade, you destroy world trade. But they would say that 2.2 percent increase applied to one-eighth of the world's whole imports has produced this world catastrophe."", ""Now, I can explore this in still another direction. I would remind you that we levy tariffs upon only one-third of our imports. I also remind you that the actual increases made in the Smoot-Hawley bill covered only one-quarter of the dutiable imports. I may also remind you again that our import trade is only one-eighth of the total import trade of the world which we are supposed to have totally destroyed. So they would have us believe this world catastrophe and this destruction of foreign trade happened because the United States increased its tariffs on one-fourth of one-third of one-eighth of the world's imports, and that we pulled down the world, so they tell us, by increases on less than 1 percent of the goods being imported by the world as a whole."", 'And I may explore this thesis that the Republican tariff has destroyed the world a little further. He recently stated that this increase of tariffs ""started such a drain on the gold reserves of the principal countries as to practically force all of them off the gold standard."" At Des Moines I defended the American people from this piece of guilt. I pointed out that it happens there had been no drain of gold from Europe, which is the center of this disturbance, but on the contrary, that Europe\'s gold had increased every year since the Smoot-Hawley bill had been passed.', 'Now, my fellow citizens, I could continue for hours in an analysis of mistaken statements and misinformation from the opposition. But I assure you that this country is not to blame for the catastrophes that have come on the world. The American people did not originate the age-old controversies of Europe. We did not inaugurate the Great War or the panics that have taken place in the last 5 years.', ""No, my friends, the increase of duties collected by the United States of 2.2 percent calculated on all the goods we import didn't bring about the debacle in the world. If every country in the world were to increase the duty on their imports by 2.2 percent tomorrow, but if at the same time they would also adopt domestic policies which would bring about release of the energies and progress of their people, if they would maintain peace and good will with their neighbors, if they would support confidence in the world, then the world's, as well as our own, international commerce would thrive and boom beyond any dimensions that we ever dreamed of."", ""I've dwelt on this point not only because I believe it is important to correct current misstatements of our opponents, but because the policies of our opponents are rounded upon misconceptions of the utmost gravity for the future of the United States. If it were not a matter of such utter gravity for the future of our country, I should treat them not in a sense of seriousness but in a sense of humor. There is a vital determination before the American people as to whether there shall be placed in power over the destinies of 120 million of us a party which so lacks in penetration into the forces active in the world and the dangers which we confront and responsibilities that arise from them."", 'Now, I wish to examine the record and policies of the present administration in their relation to our wage and salary earners, for that record is made. They speak louder than promises. There are 12 major measures and policies which we have put into action and to which I would like to refer.', 'First, my concern in dealing with the problems of these times, while fighting to save our people from chaos and to restore order in our economic life, has been to avert hunger or cold amongst those upon whom these blows have fallen with heartbreaking severity--that is our unemployed workers.', ""In the fall of 1930 to meet this situation, I set up the President's Organization for Unemployment Relief 1 under able leadership. Through cooperation of every State, town, and village the forces were organized and mobilized which overcame victoriously the suffering of that winter. In the fall of 1931, we mobilized again, and again with the cooperation of Governors and local communities, all the associations and agencies in the United States, we carried a victorious battle over the winter of 1931-32. Still again, during the past few weeks, I have cooperated with the great national agencies in the remobilization of the voluntary forces of the country for an attack on the forthcoming winter."", ""1 In October 1930, the President's Emergency Committee for Employment was established under the chairmanship of Arthur Woods. In August 1931, the President's Organization on Unemployment Relief was established under the chairmanship of Walter S. Gifford."", 'But, fearing that the resources of individuals and of local communities and States were being exhausted, I settled with the Congress an authority to be given to the Reconstruction Corporation to loan a total of $300 million to those States whose needs might be found greater than the voluntary associations and local authorities could provide. I had great difficulties with Democratic leaders to prevent this being made a pork-barrel operation rather than one based upon need. Under that authority many millions have already been provided. We have provided, in addition, large quantities of wheat and cotton for the aid of those in distress. There should be no fear or apprehension at any deserving American fireside that starvation or cold will creep within their doors or menace their families and loved ones over the forthcoming winter.', ""With these 3 years of unceasing effort in relief, by the patriotic service of our citizens and our local communities and public officials, and the stimulus and mobilization that we have been able to give by the use of the Presidential office and direct support of the Federal Government, we present to the world a record unparalleled by any other nation in this period. That is a record expressed in technical terms yet interpretable into sheer human sympathy. That record is the information furnished to me constantly by the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service which shows, down to the latest moment, that the adult mortality, the infant mortality are at the lowest rate on record, and that the general health of the American people is at a higher level today than ever before in the history of our country- I know that there are exceptions and that there is suffering which always arises in communities where their organization is less efficient than it should be. Even so, no such record could be established if the Nation's unemployed were starving and without shelter. Yet some say that things could not be worse. Had these actions not been taken they would be a thousand times worse."", 'The second of our actions of interest to the workers was the conference which I called in Washington, in November 1929, of representatives of the leading employers, together with representatives of organized labor, and here we developed certain plans for dealing with this emergency. I believe this can be truly said to have been the first time in history that the Government has taken the leadership to secure an understanding between industry and labor of the complete mutuality of their interest in the face of a national danger.', 'We worked out on that occasion many purposes.', 'The first was to uphold the standard of real wages.', 'The second was to uphold the buying power of our working people until the cost of living had diminished.', 'The third was to prevent that thing which had happened in every previous depression in our history, and that was an immediate attack upon wages as a basis of maintaining profits. This proposal had the sympathetic support of the employers of the whole country, and for nearly 2 years they maintained the standard of wages in the United States; they maintained them in the face of disappearing profits. As the depression grew more severe there have been readjustments, but these readjustments have come about by agreement between employer and employee after profits were taxed and the cost of living was reduced. As a result of these efforts we have had the astonishing spectacle of a country in which there have been less strikes, less industrial conflict, with all of their bitterness, than even in normal times and where there has been less social conflict than in any other country disturbed by this depression.', 'The fourth of these undertakings made at that time had to do with the staggering of employment--instead of discharging a portion of workers into complete disaster.', 'The fifth of the undertakings made on that occasion was that the manufacturers, the railroads, and the utilities would expand their construction of new equipment beyond their immediate need. A vast sum of money was expended in these directions during the first year of the depression. Again some few months ago, I secured the interest of employers in organization of a new campaign to replace obsolete equipment and machinery. That is today resulting in an increase of employment.', 'As I have said, when history records this depression, it will record no brighter chapter in the whole history of the United States than the approach to this problem by both employers and leaders of labor in a sense of humanity and a sense of social responsibility. To them I pay high tribute. In the face of these results, let no man say that it could not be worse. If it had not been for these actions, this country would have been fired with the flames of bitterness and conflict between workers and employers; millions more would have been without jobs; wages would have been reduced far below their present level.', 'Now, day before yesterday my opponent announced a plan ""to set up in times of prosperity what might be called a nest egg to be used for public works in time of depression."" He said, ""That is a policy which we should initiate when we get back to good times.""', 'He advocates this apparently as a brand new idea. It will doubtless surprise him to learn that the eggs have not only been laid but they have hatched, long since.', 'He either ignores or is ignorant of the fact that as far back as 1922, in our unemployment conference of that year under my chairmanship, we developed then the idea of making use of public works to assist in the stabilization of employment in times of depression and laid the foundation for its operation. I do not claim to have invented the notion.', 'On the breaking out of this depression in November 3 years ago, I announced not only that the Federal Government would speed up its public works, but I requested the States and municipalities to do likewise. During the year 1930 we not only maintained these types of construction work, but we stimulated it to above normal--an amount of $500 to $800 million. The wide extent and pressure of the depression, however, rapidly cut into the construction abilities of many States and municipalities. We, however, have held Federal construction work up to three times its normal, straight through year by year. By the end of this fiscal year we will have expended nearly $2,400 million of Federal money on construction and maintenance work since the depression began. And I ask again, do you think things could not have been worse had these policies not been adopted ?', 'Now, there has proved to be a limitation, however, on this, and that limitation is that the Federal Government should not and must not undertake projects which are not of productive value to the Nation and must not extend its liabilities beyond its ability to maintain a balanced budget. To take money from the taxpayer and thus decrease his ability to employ people himself, and to put it into public works which will never make a real return to the public, is a waste of national wealth and an actual destruction of employment.', 'Notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Government was carrying a burden of $700 million of public works per annum--the very utmost that its resources permitted and the utmost that could be justified on merit--the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate introduced, in May of this year, and secured the passage of a bill in the Democratic House of Representatives calling for $1,200 million more of public works. The expenditure of these sums meant unbalancing the budget; it meant the destruction of Government credit.', 'But, far worse than this, the works upon which it was intended to expend this money were of typical pork-barrel character. In that bill were 3,500 different projects scattered in every community in the country. One list alone would have imposed a maintenance charge on the Government of $15 million a year as against a perfectly efficient service now costing $3 million a year. Lists of the projects in different congressional districts were distributed in the hope that they would appeal to the cupidity of those districts and that I should be forced into the embarrassment not only of appearing to oppose my own policy of speeding up public works, but of depriving thousands of towns and villages of the expenditure of Federal money and myself of votes in this election.', 'Now, it is a good thing to have a fire in the grate to warm the house, but it is a bad thing to set the house on fire in order to warm your hands.', 'The Democratic candidate for Vice-President still advocates that bill. He proposes to introduce it in the next session. He proposes it as a part of the policies of the Democratic Party. But, with the responsibility of the President of the United States, I propose to continue to oppose it.', 'Some 8 months ago I requested that certain engineering associations investigate the possibility of aid from the Government by way of the use of governmental credit to stimulate construction of public and private works of what are called of reproductive character--that is, works that would earn a repayment of capital and interest and that were only halted from the lack of credit. As a result of the ventilation of these ideas the Reconstruction Corporation was authorized to make such loans up to $1,500 million.', 'Already that Corporation has authorized the starting of works, the ultimate cost of which will exceed $400 million. That is no cost to the taxpayer; it is the use of Government credit. The installation of these works will be productive in living for literally thousands of families.', 'Now, it is obvious that, in addition to the great dislocations that we have received by the demoralization of governments and markets abroad, that there is another economic force moving for which there must be a remedy. That was the so-called technological unemployment. In plain terms, our inventions of labor-saving machinery have outrun our discovery of new commodities and new services on which to absorb the men discharged from the older industries. In order to bring the Government into line with these facts, and upon my recommendation to Congress, the shorter hours were applied effectually to Government service so that we should spread Government employment over the largest possible numbers and yet decrease governmental expenses.', 'Another matter in which we have been greatly concerned on behalf of labor is that of a protection that has been near to my own heart over many years. That was the establishment of a better opportunity for our people to purchase their own homes and to have a chance to keep them when they had undertaken that great step in life. In November of last year I propounded the plan for a national system of home loan banks. These banks were for the purpose, with only the temporary assistance of the Government, of mobilizing the resources of building loan associations and savings banks and other institutions that are devoted to homeownership in order to enable them to borrow collectively on more favorable terms from the investor, and to assure to the borrower long-term payments at more reasonable rates. Literally thousands of heartbreaking instances of inability of working people to obtain renewal of expiring mortgages on favorable terms, and the consequent loss of their homes, have been one of the tragedies of this depression. Had the Democratic House of Representatives acted upon this measure at the time of its recommendation, we would have saved hundreds of thousands of such tragedies.', 'I did finally secure the passage of that bill through the Congress. Those banks will be opened and operating at the end of this month. The system is not as perfect as I could wish, but it has already had one immensely beneficial effect, and there will be others. The anticipation of its aid has largely stopped the foreclosing on homes, and with its operation it should give every man who wants to make a fight to hold onto his home the opportunity to do so.', 'And there is another purpose of interest to labor in the setting up of that new institution. Despite the tendency of the people in some communities to huddle in depression and therefore to create many vacant dwellings, yet there are other communities where people today wish to build new homes but cannot do so because they cannot borrow a portion of the cost. These institutions, by furnishing this capital, will give a renewed employment to many thousands of people.', 'Now, there are other matters of vast interest to labor. One of most primary interest is that of wages. I have for many years advocated high wages as the economic basis for the country. That has long been a Republican doctrine. That is the road to economical production and high consumption of products of the farm and factory.', 'Those who say that things could not be worse, without knowledge of what has happened in other countries which have gone through this cataclysm, might be interested in the rates of wages being paid abroad compared to the United States. In order to illustrate it, I have this week secured through the Department of Commerce a calculation on a basis which I have used before, and that is to interpret wages into currencies of other countries by means of a common denominator.', 'If we were to say that 5 percent of butter and 95 percent of flour would form the basis of that useful mixture called ""bread and butter,"" then we might apply the weekly wages of different trades in different countries and determine how much each of them could buy at retail in those countries of that very useful compound. I will not read you the table 2 but I can point out to you that day labor in the United States can buy almost 400 pounds of that mixture with a week\'s wages, and that the highest skilled labor in our country can buy about 1,000 pounds a week; that the highest paid other wage in the world--and skilled wage at that--in the United Kingdom can buy 342 pounds. That is about one-third the amount that a similar trade can purchase in the United States. I could go on down through many countries represented in this table until I get to Japan, where I find that the purchasing power of Japanese wages will secure just about one-eighth the amount of bread and butter than can be secured by the American worker at today\'s wages.', '2 The table to which the President referred is printed in the note to Item 364.', 'Now, as it bears most importantly on labor, I wish to return a moment to the tariff. There is no measure in the whole economic gamut more vital to the American workman and the farmer today than the maintenance of the protective tariff. I stand on that principle. Our opponents are opposed to it. They propose ""a competitive tariff for revenue,"" and they propose to reduce the tariff. They propose to do this in the face of the fact that in the last year currencies of competing nations have depreciated by going off the gold standard. Consequently, the cost of living has lowered in 30 countries. So that this becomes a flat issue which every farmer and workman in the United States must consider from the point of view of his home and his living.', 'That it is the intention of the Democratic candidate to reduce the tariffs--on all commodities--must be clear from typical expressions used in the course of this campaign. It is styled a ""wicked and exorbitant tariff."" It is referred to as ""its outrageous rates, .... almost prohibitive tariffs, .... the notorious and indefensible Smoot-Hawley tariff, .... the excessive rates of that bill must come down, .... until the tariff is lowered,"" ""our policy calls for lower tariffs"" and so on and so forth.', 'Now, I would like to put the question to our own people both on the bench and on the farm: Do you want to compete with laborers whose wages in their own money is only sufficient to buy from one-eighth to one-third of the amount of bread and butter that you can buy at the present rates of wages and the present price of commodities bad as they are ? That is a plain question. It does not require a great deal of ingenious argument to support it or find its correct answer. It is true that we have the most gigantic market in the world today, and we are surrounded by nations clamoring to get in. But it is still my belief that we should protect this market for our own labor, and that we should not surrender to the labor of foreign countries as the Democratic Party proposes to do.', 'Now, on a matter of great importance to labor, that in order to hold the jobs which we have for our own people and to prevent further additions to our unemployed and thus prevent further burdens upon our communities, I have by administrative order practically prohibited all immigration from every quarter of the globe, except the relatives of our residents. It has reduced the numbers of people coming into the United States seeking employment to less than those who are departing. That order was issued 2 years ago. Had the net immigration taken place since the date of that order which took place in the 2 years previously, we would have had 400,000 jobs taken away from our people or had just that many more persons added to the unemployed. And even that might have been worse.', 'Now, there is nothing in which the American workman is more concerned than in preserving the integrity of the American dollar. The Democratic Party has at various times, and especially by the passage of the Patman bill through the Democratic House of Representatives on June 15 last, endeavored to undermine the integrity of the American currency through the issue of $2,300 million of greenbacks. They were barking back to the disastrous experiment of some 60 years ago. If any of you will study what happened in Germany, or France, or Austria, or our own country at that period, long since past, when we have resorted or they have resorted to these measures in order to meet the immediate difficulties you will find that the major hardship fell upon the working people. There was a time when the value of the German mark was five to the dollar. Then they tried this plan of relief to their economic difficulty. I have in my desk a 5 million mark note which I purchased, which before the entrance into the experiment would have been worth $1 million, and yet I actually bought for $1. The effect of that experiment and all other experiments of that kind is a subtle and steady reduction of real wages, right and left.', 'We have fought a great battle to maintain the stability of the American dollar, the stability of our exchange. We have fought in order that we might protect the working people of the United States.', 'Over and above and of infinitely more importance than all of the measures I have mentioned is the problem of restoring the great mass of normal jobs in our country. Emergency jobs have helped enormously, but the normal job is the permanent dependence of the worker. Emergency jobs will never heal the depression.', 'Obviously, the normal jobs lie in the production and distribution of goods and services; in other words, the factories, the mills, the mines, the railways, the public utilities, the stores, the offices.', 'And every part of this mechanism is lubricated by what we call credit. That is, the ability of the manager of a business to borrow money to buy his raw materials and pay his labor. Thus credit is the very lifeblood of this whole structure. It is the lifeblood of jobs. If credit fails the enterprise dries up; it withers and it dies. And jobs decrease or disappear.', 'Now then, what is the source of credit ? That is the savings of the people themselves. These savings are gathered in a myriad of tiny rivulets of their deposits in the banks, their premiums to life insurance companies, their dues to benevolent and fraternal organizations, their payments to building and loan associations, and a score of other ways. These rivulets in total volume are a mighty river. Their waters are stored in credit reservoirs. These are the banks and the mortgage companies and the insurance companies and the investments in the services of industry and of business. Now, all this may sound trivial, but it is fundamental to an understanding of the processes that we have gone through and the measures that we have adopted.', 'Thus credit is born of the people themselves. What the people give, the people can take away. The reservoirs of credit are built upon the confidence of the people in them, and fear is death to credit.', 'Now, when the great economic earthquakes abroad struck directly at the credit structures of those foreign countries, those shocks reverberated to us. I have already said that foreigners dumped their securities here at panic prices and demanded gold in payment. They claimed their deposits from American banks. They demanded cash for all the goods they had sold us. Our own people in fear drew out $1,500 million of their savings from our own banks. Thus credit dried up. The managers of business turned in vain for the accustomed loans to pay for raw materials and to pay their labor.', 'Beyond all this contraction of credit was the fear and panic through the world, spreading its destruction into the United States. It imperiled the institutions in which were the savings of all of the other people, the savings of every fireside--bank deposits or insurance policies or investments. In this contraction of credit lay the dangers to everyone who owed money, for upon demand for immediate payment he was compelled to sell his property in a limited and vastly depreciated market and so was threatened with ruin.', 'Faced with these unprecedented perils, we took unprecedented steps. We refused to allow these destructive forces to run their course to chaos and ruin and to total unemployment. We organized the cooperation of the community. We thrust the strength of the Government as a shield before the people as has never been done before in the history of the United States and that for the purpose of protecting labor.', 'I have referred to these gigantic measures on other occasions. I will not take your time to again describe the weapons and instrumentalities that we have brought to bear in this battle. We have created them, and we created them to preserve your savings deposits, your insurance policies, and to protect you from foreclosure on your homes and your farms. We did it to hold for you the jobs you have and, finally, to recover the ground lost in the battle and restore the jobs which have been lost. That has been the battle of credit. The restoration of credit is the restoration of the lifeblood of this system and the restoration of normal jobs in the United States. It has been a great battle with inevitable casualties, but that battle is being won. Credit is being expanded, and normal jobs are coming back.', 'Now, the agencies and the instrumentalities that we have created are working day and night. They are producing results. September, as announced by the Department of Labor this morning, shows an increase of 3.6 percent in employment for the whole country for that one month alone. If these policies shall be uninterrupted, if we shall hold the financial integrity of the United States by maintaining a balance in our budget, these measures and these instrumentalities together with the courage and industry of our people will bring back our economic system a long way toward its normal functioning and the restoration of our people to their normal jobs.', 'Let no man say that things could not have been worse. Without these many measures, things would have been so much worse today that this moment would look like prosperity in retrospect.', 'Now, there is another phase of this problem in its larger vision. It must be clear to you and ought to be clear to the country that a major part of the shocks and dislocations which have brought this destruction were of foreign origin--not alone in the shortening down of our markets but in the crushing of credit through fear and the destruction of confidence throughout the world. They are not of American making. The fact that we have suffered from them implies in itself that labor and agriculture have a fundamental interest in securing greater stability abroad. Our self-containment is such that we can build back a long way on our own resources. But if it is possible to improve the internal stability of other nations, it would at once allow them to relax their emergency restrictions against exchange and the import of commodities; it would allow them to return to stable currencies and enable the world to be free from political shocks--all of which would build for American markets and for the American farmer and for American labor and for stability in American confidence. It would protect the American worker and farmer and businessman from a rising flood of goods due to depreciated currencies and lowered standards of living. To this major end, which means work for our unemployed and increasing prices for our farmers, we have given steady devotion during this last year and a half.', 'I will not review for you the German moratorium which prevented the total collapse of the German people or the standstill agreement or a half dozen other measures in this direction. But I will point out to you that in an endeavor to strike at the root of such evils I have proposed that the armaments of the world should not only be cut by one-third but that the weapons and methods in use should be so altered as to increase the power of defensive weapons and decrease the power of offensive weapons. We not only thereby seek to remove fear and political shocks, but the substantial acceptance of this proposal would save the United States over $200 million annually and through savings of taxation in European countries would increase their buying power by perhaps a billion a year. It would release a thousand energies amongst their people.', 'Further, we have taken part in the development of a world economic conference to be held later in the year to consider a multitude of monetary and other economic questions which will reduce the obstacles to recovery.', ""In this connection, with all these problems, the European war debts to the United States constantly arise. I have consistently opposed the cancellation of these debts. The Democratic candidate, to use his own words, proposes to reduce our tariffs so that out of Europe's profits through the increase of trade they would obtain from the United States, they could pay us these debt annuities. That is vastly worse than cancellation. That would take money out of the pockets of the American farmer, laborer, and businessman to pay Europe's debts."", 'In the constructive handling of this question I have stated that I would favor the utilization of the war debts to advantage agriculture and labor. Such action has already received the support of many leaders of both agriculture and labor.', 'I am confident that if these policies which we are proposing in building up in these three directions--that is, disarmament, economic stability of the world, and the proposed use of these debts to secure the ends I have mentioned--I believe we can confidently hope to promote more rapid recovery and that we can greatly safeguard ourselves from future economic shocks.', ""Now, that briefly is the record of organization and the measures that we have taken in aid to labor. It is radical in its defense of our people's interests; it is progressive in constructive advancement of our people, but it is conservative in maintaining the fundamental principles of American life."", 'Now, I should like to digress for a moment to a purely personal matter which I have some hesitation in expressing. In my hand I have a copy of the instructions issued by the Democratic National Committee to their speakers. I find a paragraph referring to my ""dark labor record."" I am glad to say that is neither pink nor red. But what they do say is: ""First and indelible, his early record is clouded by his former partnerships which contracted cheap Chinese coolie labor in South African mines."" It goes further with references to statements of Democratic leaders grieving over this coolie labor and implies that I engaged in the slavery of human beings.', 'Now, that calumny has been disproved and denounced time and again. Some of my friends have even gone to the extent of digging up the public records of 28 years ago, which show that at the time Chinese labor was imported into South Africa mines, that I publicly protested on the grounds that high-paid skilled labor could do the work more efficiently. And furthermore, no South African concern with which I was ever connected and I was employed as an engineer, ever employed a single Chinese laborer. But more important in connection with this, I happen to have in the files in Washington, from the man who first penned and spread those lies, a statement under oath, humbly and abjectly withdrawing them.', 'Such contemptible statements in a political campaign would be ignored-should be ignored--were it not issued by the authority of the Democratic National Committee as a part of this campaign, and it would be of no interest to the American people except that it is proposed that a political party shall be placed in power over 120 millions of people on the basis of votes secured in that manner.', 'I should like a moment also to shortly indicate the Democratic record of action during this trying period that we have gone through in the past 12 months. The Democratic Party has laid before the country its program both in the last session of Congress and in the promises of its candidates.', 'At no time in the history of the country have we required more constructive statesmanship than in this last 2 years. The Democratic Party in the last congressional election promised a definite program for restoration of the country. That program was not disclosed until 18 months later in the House of Representatives which they controlled. Aside from the highly patriotic support which I always acknowledge of many of their members to our program, the organized program of their party was evidenced by passage of one act after another through the House of Representatives which had to be stopped either by veto or successful opposition in the Senate or through public support. Those bills consisted of an omnibus pension bill; of an order to the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury to fix prices in the United States, which they could not physically carry out; of a $1,200 million pork-barrel public works bill; of the payment of a cash bonus to veterans of $2,300 million; of the issuance of $2,300 million of old-fashioned greenbacks, which I have referred to; of the destruction of the effectiveness of the Tariff Commission; and the placing of the United States Government into direct and personal banking on a stupendous scale.', 'Instead of decreasing governmental expenditures, as they had assured the country that they will do if they were given full control of the Government and that they have promised that they will do, they failed to accept the recommendation of the administration for reduction of expenditures, and on top of it passed measures that would have increased them by $3,500 million.', 'We are willing to rest our case upon the comparison of these records of actual performance--not upon promises.', 'In closing, let me carry these issues to a plane above any personal considerations. I have discussed with you tonight the battles we have fought, the measures and policies we have in action which more particularly relate to those who work at the bench and at the desk. Parallel with these actions other battles have been fought on a score of fronts, on behalf of agriculture, and of industry and business, to which the welfare of every worker is indissolubly related.', 'We have been fighting not only as an administration but as a people, to relieve distress, to repel impending catastrophes and to restore the functioning of our economic life. This economic system has but one end to serve. That end is not the making of money. It is to create security in the millions of homes of our country. It is to produce increasing comfort, to open wider the windows of hope, to increase the moral and spiritual stature of our people, to give opportunity for that understanding upon which national ideals and national character may be more and more strengthened.', 'In securing these ends the first necessity is to preserve those precious heritages and principles which have come down to us forged in the fires of long generations of Americans. They are principles and institutions which, while they have the imperfections of humanity, yet they represent the highest expressions of human attainment in thousands of years.', 'And to me a great historical truth has been revealed during this period of trial and of stress. This is the striking fact, driven home above all others, that never during these trying weeks, months, and years has the soul of America yielded to the bitter sting of defeat. Bewilderment and dismay have seized upon some of our people, but never did the spirit of America itself surrender. Never for an instant did the American people lose faith in the principles of their Government, of their institutions, or their country, or their faith in their God. Had America not stood staunch in this world storm, had it surrendered, had our people lost faith, the tide of disintegration might now engulf us all.', 'It has been the intangible and mighty forces of this unconquerable spirit of the Nation that has overcome the dangers and perils which might have plunged the world into a long period of chaos. Incessant above the storms in business, above the din of political debate and legislative battle, there has been the firm, strong voice of the people bidding that we should carry on.', 'No one who has seen this battle as I have seen it, who has watched the bright fabric of recovery woven laboriously day by day, with the stout efforts of American faith and confidence in her people, could harbor a doubt for the future of the American people.', 'If there shall be no retreat, if the attack shall continue as it is now organized, then this battle in the history of our race is won.']"
7,Herbert Hoover ,"October 22, 1932","['[1.] CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA (Laidley Stadium, 8:50 a.m.)', 'My fellow citizens:', 'I wish I had the ability to express the appreciation which I feel for so great a welcome to West Virginia. I realize that at this hour in the morning this is a demonstration such as has been shown to no public man over many years. We have but a few moments, and I wish to touch on one or two themes which are of importance to the people of West Virginia.', 'The Democratic candidate for President and his party propose to reduce the tariff. He states that the protective tariff is a ghastly jest. That becomes a curious description of the great industrial development of this State.', 'Right here the Kanawha Valley, once a wilderness, has become the great chemical center of our country. That industry would never have been created except by the protective tariff, and it cannot survive today and the people obtaining their daily bread from it could not continue their jobs if that tariff be reduced.', 'The protective tariff made possible all the plants in this valley and the employment of the people in them. That great American policy, adopted and fathered and defended by the Republican Party, has also made possible the steel, glass, and pottery industries in this State. All these plants are today the backbone of your employment and business. They give the market to your agriculture. They will continue to do so for generations unless they are destroyed by this promised action of the Democratic Party.', 'Due to depreciated currencies in foreign countries, the present tariffs have been seriously impaired lately in a number of commodities. The depreciation in currency has the effect of lowering wages and lowering standards of living in our competitive countries.', ""Four years ago I directed a survey to be made of the cost of living amongst workers in the lands competing within foreign countries, using as a common denominator the amount of bread and butter that could be purchased at retail with a workman's wages in each country. I found that in the highest wage countries outside of the United States they could purchase about one-half as much bread and butter with current wages as could be purchased by the workman of this country. I found that in the countries of lowest wages they could purchase with their wages only about one-third of the amount of bread and butter that could be purchased by the American workman in comparable occupation."", 'Recently I had this situation resurveyed in view of depreciated currencies. I found that in the highest paid countries, instead of being able to purchase one-half as much bread and butter as an American workman, they could today only purchase one-third as much. And in the countries of lowest standards of living, instead of purchasing one-third as much, they could only purchase one-eighth as much of the amount of bread and butter at present wages in the United States as they could 4 years ago.', 'In the face of this the Democratic Party proposes to reduce your tariffs. In the face of this I have asked the Tariff Commission to reinvestigate the whole rates on many commodities to see whether the tariff is giving the actual protection which is the spirit of the present law.', 'And now the Democratic Party promises to destroy the effectiveness of the Tariff Commission. That is a bipartisan body directed upon application of any substantial person to investigate and determine what is the difference in cost of production at home and abroad, and to report their recommendations to the President for any change in the tariff. The President makes these changes effective by Executive order.', 'The Democratic Party proposes to take away this power of recommendation to the President, reduce the Commission to a statistical body reporting to Congress. This effective authority of the Tariff Commission was secured by me with the help of the Senator from your State in the last tariff bill. To take that authority away means to take away the ability to change the tariff with changing tides of economic life. It means that no remedy may be had except by action of Congress which again means the old scenes of logrolling, greed, and compromise, with stagnation of business for years before final action is arrived at. I have said many times that no tariff bill is perfect but under the Commission its inequities can be removed and the rates of duty can be adjusted in the shifting economic situation, schedule by schedule, without disturbance of business and based solely on fact. The reason they wish to destroy this independent authority is obvious. So long as the Tariff Commission holds this position they do not dare to criticize schedules in the tariff because at once any valid criticism could be promptly answered by investigation and remedy through the Commission.', 'But of more importance from this purely political point, the Democratic Party would not wish to reduce the tariffs and have the Tariff Commission promptly restore them. In order to attack the tariff they have set up an ingenious hypothesis that it prevents imports into the United States and thereby decreases the ability of foreigners to buy our goods, and they say to the American workman that he would produce and sell more goods for export if there was a lower tariff. I call your attention to the fact that 93 percent of the market for the American workman is within the borders of the United States and 7 percent outside the borders. They propose to place our 93 percent at the disposal of all countries in the world with the fantastic idea that the American farmer and worker can reduce his standard of living so as to increase his part of the 7 percent, by reducing his standards to those of labor which can only buy one-third as much bread and butter.', 'They say that the decrease in our exports during this crisis has been due to retaliatory measures against our tariff. This can be disposed of in the easiest fashion in the world. Two-thirds of the goods imported into the United States are on the free list and the decrease in our imports has been just exactly in the same percentage on free goods as it has been on dutiable goods. It must be obvious that some force is working in the world which affects free goods just the same as protected goods. I could give you still a further answer in the fact that American trade has fallen in the worldwide depression from the same causes that have affected other countries and in about the same amount or even less than other countries. I would also call attention to the fact that since our great measures for recovery have been in free action during the past 4 months, imports and exports of the United States have increased 23 percent.', 'If the stories you are told are true, that our trade has been destroyed, this increase must come as a great disappointment to the Democratic Party. The fact is that foreign trade comprises but a small portion of our national activities. It is a valuable portion but when we consider the well-being of American homes and families the preponderant safeguard to those families lies in maintaining for them the domestic market of the United States.', 'There is no part of this Union where these matters so definitely apply as to this very State of West Virginia where the dangers to you and your employment and living are so great by change in our policies.', 'There is another question of vast interest to the people of West Virginia and one of ranking importance with your agricultural activities and second only to that of all States in the Union--that is your bituminous coal industry. That industry has gone through a long period of difficulty. The competition of oil, electricity, improved efficiency in use of coal--all tend to prevent the expansion of your industry, or even its maintenance on a fair level. These competitors have in my view about exhausted themselves and the natural growth of the country will give to you a greater future. But in the meantime the industry has been reduced to a bitter, destructive competition, the main burden of which falls upon the backs of those who labor. I know the hardships that have been piled upon this industry and the men engaged in it. A large part of my life was concerned with the mining industry. I have worked with a pick and shovel at the face; I have managed coal mines on a large scale. I am interested in the restoration of that industry as every man is interested in the welfare of an industry in which his own profession is involved.', 'The coal we use in steel, chemicals, and manufactured articles, is itself dependent on the tariff, for without the tariff on those goods there would be no demand from those manufacturers for coal. Therefore, the welfare of the coal industry is tied up with the maintenance of an adequate protective tariff on industry, for which we stand. That tariff has contributed to prevent further unemployment in the mines.', 'In order to protect the industry and the labor engaged therein from the competition of foreign oil, I cooperated with the Senator from your State and others in securing an excise tax on the importation of foreign oils produced by cheap labor and transported here as a substitute fuel.', 'Some years ago, being impressed with the absolute destruction of our national resources and the impoverishment of labor through destructive competition in the coal industry, I suggested there should be some measure of cooperation in the marketing of coal. Ultimately, leaders of the industry took the matter up, and we have recently had a test case before the courts as to whether limited cooperation of this character would be a violation of the antitrust laws. The first decision of the courts has been adverse to the industry, but in order that this matter might be placed on a sound and permanent basis, I recommended to the Congress 2 years ago that we should institute an inquiry as to the economic working of these laws as applied to the natural resource industries. I pointed out that destructive competition was creating wasteful and destructive use of the natural resources, impoverishing the operator and the worker. I pointed out the situation in the bituminous coal industry as an illustration.', 'No action having been taken by Congress a year ago I again returned to the subject and stated that it was necessary that some change should be made in the laws in this relation. I recommended that Congress give it immediate consideration. Neither you nor I wish to destroy the fundamental basis of competition in our country. But a limited cooperation to prevent this destructive action should be undertaken. We have already extended this privilege to your agriculture and labor. The coal industry could have such safeguards as would make it possible to pay a fair wage, earn a reasonable profit, and save hundreds of communities from their steady degeneration and impoverishment.', 'And I do not wish to be misinterpreted as favoring the repeal of the antitrust laws. I am opposed to monopolies. I am for the maintenance of the fundamentals of competitive system as the only basis on which progress can be stimulated and maintained. There can be a degeneration of competition of such destructive order that it becomes of first importance in the maintenance of proper homelife amongst our people. We have the statesmanship in the Republican Party to solve this question also.', 'Now, my friends, tonight I shall have opportunity to speak at length upon the measures which we have inaugurated for overcoming the present national emergency. I am in hopes that many of you may have opportunity to listen to that address. I am glad to inform you that these measures have proved so powerful and so potent that the country is beginning to right itself and shows improvement in every direction day by day. Our people are beginning to return to work. The signs of economic life show in every quarter. That is proof of the soundness, the ability, the character, and the willingness of the Republican Party to bring the full strength and power of the Federal Government to the Protection of our people in times of need.', 'I wish to thank you for this magnificent reception you have given me on this occasion. It is heartening, and it is evident that the country has an understanding of the problems before it. And it is proof of what the action of the country will be in support of the Republican Party on the 8th day of November.', '[2.] HUNTINGTON, WEST VIRGINIA (Pavilion at the station, 10:40 a.m.)', 'I wish that every citizen in this country could have the privilege that I have had this morning of coming up the great Kanawha Valley, of seeing the huge industries that have been developed in this State, most of them within the last 10 years.', 'West Virginia has been transformed in a shorter space of time than any other State from the frontier of mining and lumbering to one of the greatest industrial centers of the Nation. Under the protection of a Republican tariff your conjunction here of lumber and coal, of oil and gas and waterpower has made for you the opportunity of enormous development. You are developing in West Virginia one of the greatest industrial areas in the United States. You can only go ahead with the development that has taken place under adequate tariff protection.', 'The tariff is easy to understand. It is the maintenance of duties on the imports. of goods from abroad which will prevent those countries from taking your markets at unfair prices. By unfair prices I mean prices based upon lower standards of living than we demand for the American family and the American home. We are first interested in building up the American people. We are interested in increasing the security and the comfort of their lives. We are not ungenerous. We know that with prosperity in the United States our people will purchase more goods of foreign nations than we could ever purchase if we are to impoverish our people to the extent of the impoverishment of foreign countries. We are endeavoring to build up a standard of living, a standard of comfort, and a basis of hope and opportunity such as the world has never seen before. And the first safeguard is that we shall maintain protection to our people both by the tariff and by the limitation of immigration which would by competing at your factory doors reduce your wages and standards of living.', 'Those are fundamental policies of the Republican Party. Our Democratic opponents state they will reduce these tariffs. They have made no declaration as to what they will do in the matter of immigration, alert surely they have the vocal capacity with which to express themselves upon this or any other subject of interest to the American people.', 'I regret that I am not able to speak to you at greater length. It is difficult in this time of great national crisis for me to leave Washington, where my first obligation lies in the duties of my office as President of the United States. I am devoting weekends to public addresses in order that the people may better understand the policies of this administration and of the Republican Party. But of necessity my time is preoccupied by the administration of those unprecedented and gigantic measures which have protected this country from the disaster which overhung it and to administer those measures in such a fashion today as to bring about recovery of employment and agriculture.', 'I am happy to tell you that during the last 3 or 4 months, since we were freed from the obstruction of the Democratic Party in the Congress, these measures have proved themselves so vital and so potent and so powerful that we have begun to see the evidence of recovery in every part of the country. That recovery will continue if there is no change in these policies and these measures.', 'I shall speak at greater length on these subjects tonight. For this occasion I wish to express to you my heartfelt appreciation of your coming here to welcome me and of this evidence of the support which you will give my policies and the policies of the Republican Party on November 8.', '[3.] KENOVA, WEST VIRGINIA (Rear platform, 11:02 a.m.)', 'Fellow citizens:', 'It is a great pleasure to be here this morning, not only because it is always a pleasure to travel across the State of West Virginia with all of its wonderful scenery and because this is a most extraordinary welcome of its people, but it is a great pleasure to be here with your senior Senator. Senator Hatfield has been one of the stalwarts, one of the reliances of the Republican Party since you sent him to the United States Senate. Although he is not up for election this time, I hope you will keep in mind that the American people need his continued service and that you will not forget when the time comes to send him back to Washington.', 'There are many things one could discuss that are of interest to West Virginia--the tariff, immigration, development of your industries, especially the emergency measures which we have in motion to promote the recovery of the country from the great crisis which we have gone through. I may tell you that it is my confident belief that we have overcome the danger of great disaster to our country and that we are now on the road to recovery.', 'I shall be speaking to you more at length this evening from Detroit. I am hoping that many of you may have the opportunity to listen in. But for this occasion I wish to express my deep appreciation for the welcome which you and the others of West Virginia have shown to Mrs. Hoover and me this morning. It is evidence of the support which you will give to me and to the Republican Party on the 8th day of November.', 'Thank you.', '[4.] IRONTON, OHIO (Rear platform, 11:33 a.m.)', 'Fellow citizens:', 'I am intensely sorry that we have stopped a hundred yards from the microphone because I fear you cannot hear me. But I should like to express my appreciation of your welcome to the State of Ohio. This is not the first time that I have visited Ironton because while I was Secretary of Commerce I had occasion to come down the Ohio River and to inspect those works and others of the great development on the river.', 'I should have liked to have had the opportunity of discussing with you some of the things in which you are interested. It seems impossible to reach so enormous a crowd in the open air without the assistance of the microphone. For that you will have to blame your local railroad officials on this occasion and forgive me.', 'But I do want to express to you our appreciation for your coming here this morning, for the welcome that you have given to Mrs. Hoover and to me. It is evidence of the support which you are giving to the policies of my administration and the support which you will give to the Republican Party on the 8th of November.', 'Thank you.', '[5.] PORTSMOUTH, OHIO (Rear platform, 12:15 p.m.)', 'My dear friends:', 'I am sorry that the train did not stop so that we might bring the microphone to the back platform. I am glad to have this opportunity to express my appreciation for the greeting which you have given this morning to Mrs. Hoover and to me, and to give to you that thanks which is due for your attendance here on this occasion.', 'I had hoped to have an opportunity to say a word to you about those measures of the Republican Party which are of importance to you.', 'I congratulate you that your splendid shoe industry has been able to maintain itself so well during the world depression. That you are able to maintain it today is due solely to the protective tariff placed upon shoes 2 years ago by the Republican Party. Otherwise the importation of shoes manufactured under the lower standards of labor in Europe, due to their depreciated currencies, would not have enabled you to sell them, and the factory in your city would have been idle at this moment.', 'Now, there are many measures of our party which I would like to have expounded to you at great length. Tonight I shall speak at Detroit on those questions in which you are vitally interested. I am in hopes I shall be able to indicate to you that these measures have proved very effective, and that they are today turning our country on the road to recovery, with the resultant employment and the improvement of agriculture.', 'Again, I thank you for this cordial greeting, and I accept it as an evidence of the support which you propose to give to the Republican Party on the 8th day of November.', '[6.] WAVERLY, OHIO (Rear platform, 12:53 p.m.)', 'Friends:', 'I deeply appreciate the welcome of Waverly. It is a fine greeting and gives encouragement and strength to the labors which rest upon the President of the United States.', 'Waverly is a farm town. You are interested in farm questions. Recently at Des Moines I had occasion to speak at great length on the problems that are involved in the agricultural industry in the United States and I made some suggestions as to the method of relief. It was based upon one primary fact, and that is that there are no panaceas or miracles in the world; that the whole of our country must pull out of this depression together. This depression came upon us from abroad. We have built measures and instrumentalities which have protected our people from disaster, and they are today moving our country forward toward recovery.', 'In Des Moines I stated some 12 points that I thought were of interest and of fundamental importance to the development of American agriculture. I do not propose to traverse those points at this moment, but to those amongst you who are farmers I express the wish that you will obtain a copy of that address, for it contains the most thoughtful consideration of the subject which I believe has been given to the agricultural problem. If you will obtain it, if you will read it, if you will consider it, if you will make up your minds upon it, I believe that you will vote the Republican ticket on the 8th day of November.', '[7.] CHILLICOTHE, OHIO (Rear platform, 1:27 p.m.)', 'Recently at Des Moines I outlined a definite and constructive program for agriculture. It is designed upon the primary fact, from which no panaceas or miracles can escape, that farmers and businessmen and workers are all in the same boat. We must all come ashore together or we shall all sink together. I refused to present to the farmers any economic patent medicine or any proposals which I cannot fulfill. I refuse to offer generalities which offer easy exits from the responsibility of execution later on.', 'This program, so far as it directly affected agriculture, consisted of 12 points. Of these measures many are today in action--they are not promises, they are performances. They are beginning to have their effect on recovery from the greatest peacetime disaster that ever came to a nation--a disaster not of American making, but a disaster spread to us from the wars and troubles of the Old World. I greatly hope that the farmers among my audience here will obtain copies of that statement at Des Moines and form their own judgment upon it.', '[8.] CIRCLEVILLE, OHIO (Rear platform, 2 p.m.) Friends in Circleville:', 'I wish to express the very great appreciation I have for this wonderful greeting from you. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of your attitude on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not an occasion on which to make a prolonged address on our national problems. I am speaking tonight in Detroit on them. 1 hope you will find an opportunity to listen in to that address. I shall endeavor there to set out the methods which we have adopted, by which we have saved the United States from a great disaster which threatened us from abroad, and by which we are bringing about now the recovery of the United States.', 'Many questions are of interest to you--many questions that go beyond the present emergency. I shall hope to have an opportunity to deal with them from time to time in the course of this campaign. The duties which are imposed upon the President of the United States and the loyalties to the American people are now such that I am not able to leave Washington except at the end of each week, and I am, therefore, not able to expound to you what we have tried to do and what we are now doing. I hope you will take it and accept it in earnest and serious loyalty to the interest of every fireside and home in our country.', 'I thank you again for your presence here and the greeting and encouragement that you have given to me.', 'Thank you.', '[9.] COLUMBUS, OHIO (Rear platform, 2:55 p.m.)', 'My friends of Columbus:', 'I do appreciate this wonderful greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging. It is stimulating. This is not an occasion for me to talk to you at length on national issues. I am speaking tonight from Detroit, and I am in hopes that through the radio, that most wonderful invention of our generation, you will be able to listen because I shall there discuss the problems of this depression and the measures which have saved the United States from imminent disaster and the measures by which we have turned the tide and have now directed this country towards recovery of unemployment and agriculture.', 'A day or two ago, I received a letter from a citizen of Columbus asking that I should further expound our policies in respect to immigration. I am glad to answer that inquiry here and now in Columbus. The Republican Party has not been inarticulate (?) 1 in its declaration on this subject. Our opponents have not as yet explained to the country where they stand.', '1 The question mark appears in the transcript.', 'The Republican Party has been, over these many years, the constant exponent and the constant guardian of the protective tariff for industry. Its major purpose has been to protect the American workman in his standard of living and in the increasing comfort of his home.', 'If we are to maintain within our borders our own industries, if we are to maintain our standard of living higher than the rest of the world, the handmaiden to that policy must be that there should not be a flow of immigration, fleeing from the lower standards of living abroad, flooding our country and offering to work for less wage than the American workman, at the gate of every factory in the United States. It is just as important to protect the American workman from the movement of people into the United States to take over his job as to protect him from a flow of goods from abroad which would take away his job.', 'The United States has received invaluable contributions in its upbuilding, in the growth of its culture from the migration of the various races of Europe. It has held its doors open to those who have fled from persecution, both religious and political. With the growth of democracy in foreign countries political persecution has largely ceased. There is no longer a necessity for the United States to provide an asylum for those persecuted because of conscience.', 'It is important that we should restrict immigration in order that those who are already resident in our country may not be driven into unemployment. We should be wise and humane in our restrictions. It must not separate families. It must not prevent the coming into our country of the relatives of residents already here. It must in ordinary times allow a flow of selective stream of peoples to refresh our population with the ideas and contributions of foreign countries to our civilization. It must recruit from them our share of their advancing skill and their advancing knowledge. It should be based upon our determination of who shall come. But in times of great crisis like the present where we have millions of unemployed, it is an injustice and inhumanity to our own residents that we should allow the entry of people fleeing from starvation abroad. The obligation remains upon those countries to take care of their own people.', 'Therefore, by Executive order 2 years ago I stopped the entry of all immigrants to the United States except the relatives of residents who are still he. re and a few other minor exceptions. Two years have now passed since that order was issued. If we had had the same immigration during these past 2 years that we had in the 2 years previous we should have nearly a half million more unemployed in our country than we have today. This would have added 500,000 new immigrants to be cared for by our public bodies and by our charitable associations. Or, alternatively, it would have taken 500,000 jobs from our residents and thrust them upon public charity.', 'I propose to continue this policy until the end of this depression, and after the end of the depression we propose to continue the policy of wise and selective immigration of a limited order. That is my answer to that question.', 'Now again I wish to express my appreciation for this greeting as it evidences encouragement that the State of Ohio will be carried under the Republican banner on the 8th day of November.', '[10.] DELAWARE, OHIO (Rear platform, 3:43 p.m.)', 'My friends in Delaware:', 'You are giving to us a magnificent reception. This is indeed a great greeting. It is encouraging. It is helpful. It is stimulating, and I deeply appreciate it not only for the warmth of feeling which it contains but for the forecast it is as to the action which you in this city and its surroundings will take on the 8th of November next.', 'You will realize that in so short a moment as this it is impossible to discuss national issues. I am making an address at Detroit tonight. Due to that miracle of our generation, the radio, many of you will be able to listen in. I shall discuss the measures which we have taken and which have saved this country from a great disaster which might have come to us or would have come to us from the collapse of countries abroad--those countries which were subjected to the aftermath of the Great War--a disaster which is not of the making of our people, a disaster which has now been prevented. I shall be able to discuss with you the progress which we are making in the recovery of the country by these same measures, and to say to you that we are on the road out.', 'I wish to thank you again for the cordiality of your greeting and the kindliness of your coming here. We appreciate it enormously.', 'Thank you.', '[11.] MARION, OHIO (Rear platform, 4:13 p.m.)', 'This is my fourth visit to Marion, Ohio. I visited it during the campaign of 1920 when your fellow citizen was the Republican candidate for President of the United States. I visited it again when we buried him, a man broken in the service of his country. I visited it again to dedicate the memorial which you erected to his memory.', 'There is no occasion for me to extol his great qualities of geniality of friendship and devotion to his country and to the citizens of Marion. There is no occasion for me to go into the sad disloyalties to him which crushed his spirit and brought humiliation to the American people. You and I know him as a man devoted to the people and devoted to his country, who gave his life in its service.', ""The greatest accomplishment of President Harding's administration was the limitation of armaments. I have followed in his footsteps in endeavor to secure further limitations on arms, in order that we may again reduce the dangers to peace and develop stability and goodwill in the world."", 'Your Congressman [Grant E. Mouser, Jr.] has just referred to one of the activities of our Government.

The incident which he has given to you is but one of its reflexes. They are penetrating into every town and every village in the United States in the restoration of employment and the gradual march backwards towards prosperity.', 'I deeply appreciate your welcome.

It is heartening. It is encouraging. It is stimulating.', 'These are not occasions on short stops where I could discuss problems of great national issues. But it gives me opportunity to see you and to see your enthusiasm for the Republican cause, and it gives you perhaps the opportunity to-look at me.', 'I shall speak tonight at Detroit. Through the radio, that great miracle of all times, many of you will be able to listen in. I shall then discuss with you the unprecedented measures and instrumentalities through which your Federal Government is endeavoring and is succeeding in placing this country again on the road to recovery. And it is on the road. I could not go along and discuss with you further of these problems without repeating what I will say tonight, but I do wish you to know how deeply I appreciate this evidence of your support, this backing that you are giving to the policies which we have inaugurated and the measures which we have in action on your behalf and to receive this evidence of your action on the 8th day of November next.', 'I thank you.', '[13.] TOLEDO, OHIO (Rear platform, 6:05 p.m.)', 'I need not tell you how much Mrs. Hoover and I appreciate your cordial greeting, particularly at this hour when you would normally be in your own homes partaking of your evening meal.', 'The last 18 months have brought sorrows to us all. Perhaps no community in the country has suffered more deeply than Toledo. When your banks were failing, and your businesses and manufacturing came to a standstill, my heart went out in sympathy to you, for I understood very well the hardships you were facing and must endure.', ""I have been trying to be of service to you in this situation. You will recollect the measures which we established to protect the depositors in banks, the insurance policyholders, and the owners of mortgaged homes. I asked the Democratic House of Representatives to give us the authority to give relief to depositors in closed banks. They refused. But at my suggestion the Reconstruction Corporation has undertaken to grant loans to closed banks so that depositors would not have to wait until such banks were liquidated in order to get a substantial part of their distributive share of the banks' assets. I am advised informally that some of your closed banks will shortly take advantage of this governmental assistance."", 'You know about the authority which I secured that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation should grant loans to needy communities for the relief of citizens from cold and want because this very week a loan of $144,000 was made to your city for this purpose. We shall continue to assist you during the coming winter if necessary.', 'The creation of the Home Loan Banking System of which, according to the morning papers, even Governor Roosevelt approves, will also bring to a stop the foreclosing of mortgages and will give men and women a fighting chance to hold their homes. It should thaw out the frozen assets of your building and loan companies and provide funds to carry mortgages held by your closed banks. It will, I trust, be the means of saving for many a family the home for which they have toiled and saved.', 'Your banks which have failed were all State banks, whose operations, of course, are not subject to Federal regulation. However, in a broad view the home loan bank will add greatly to the security of such institutions.', 'One thing more, at my request your distinguished fellow townsman, John N. Willys, whom I had appointed our Ambassador to the Republic of Poland, agreed to lay aside his honors and once more assume the active management of your largest and most important industry which a few years ago prospered so notably under his leadership. I commend his fine public spirit, and I am sure that by next spring the Overland 2 will again be filled with busy workmen.', '2 Willys-Overland Co. of Toledo, Ohio.', 'Tonight I bring you a message of good cheer.

Many of its industries are absolutely dependent for their existence upon the protective tariff. But Toledo is also the center of a great agricultural region, and no one is more dependent today upon the protective tariff than is the farmer in this section.', 'Our opponents propose to reduce these tariffs. They propose to reduce them in the face of depreciated currencies abroad. You, the farmers of this section of Ohio, have only to inquire the price of dairy products, the price of cattle, the price of hogs across the border in Canada to know that the only thing that preserves to you the market for your products and retains to you the prices which you have today, distressingly low as they are, is the tariff wall which runs along that border.', 'Recently at Des Moines I outlined a definite and positive and constructive program for agriculture. I showed that a large part of that program was in action today and that it is proving itself helpful. I refuse to present to you any panaceas or miracles. I refuse to present to the farmers any economic patent medicine, because no mortal can fulfill such promises. I offered a constructive program, and I believe the farmers of Ohio would be well advised, in considering any action they should take in their own interest, to obtain copies of the speech I made at Des Moines and give it the most careful consideration.', 'The Republican Party has always been the party in defense of agriculture. The Democratic Party has always been the party which lowered its tariffs and its protections.

You will forgive me for not taxing my voice at the present moment because I have to hold it in reserve for that event. Nevertheless, I can make one remark which I believe is of interest to the people of Michigan, and that is that your community is dependent to a very large degree upon the maintenance of the protective tariff, and our opponents propose to reduce that.', 'Thank you.']"
8,Herbert Hoover ,"October 22, 1932","['Governor Brucker, my fellow citizens:', 'The most important issue before the American people right now is to overcome this crisis. What our people need is the restoration of their normal jobs, the recovery of agricultural prices and of business. They need help in the meantime to tide them over until these things can be accomplished and that they may not go hungry nor lose their farms and their homes.', 'I wish to present to you the evidence that the measures and the policies of the Republican administration are winning this major battle for recovery. And we are taking care of distress in the meantime. It can be demonstrated that the tide has turned and the gigantic forces of depression are today in retreat. Our measures and policies have demonstrated their effectiveness. They have preserved the American people from certain chaos. They have preserved a final fortress of stability in the world. Recovery would have been faster but for 4 months of paralysis during the spring months while we were defeating proposals of the Democratic House of Representatives to increase governmental expenses by $3 1/2 billion, to issue fiat money, and other destructive legislation.', 'The battle must be continued. We have yet to go a long way and to capture many positions to restore agriculture and employment. But it can be made plain that if the strategy which we have established is maintained and the battle not halted by change in the midst of action, we shall win.', 'If we examine but a few indications, we find that since it was known that the destructive proposals of the Democratic House were stopped, over $300 million of gold has flowed into our country through the restored confidence throughout the world; over $250 million of currency has returned from hoarding of our own citizens because of the restoration of confidence at home; the values of bonds have increased nearly 20 percent, thus safeguarding every depositor in every savings bank and every policyholder in every insurance company. Manufacturing production for the Nation as a whole has increased by 10 percent. Some groups, such as textiles, have increased over 50 percent.', 'Contrary to the usual seasonal trend, building contracts are steadily increasing. The Department of Commerce shows that over 180,000 workers were returned to the manufacturing industry in August, 360,000 more in September, and there is evidence an even still larger number in October. Car loadings have increased from 490,000 a week to 650,000 a week, showing the increased volume of materials moving in the country. Our exports and imports have increased by nearly 23 percent. Agricultural prices, always the last to move from depression, have improved from their low points, although they are still hideously low. Bank failures have almost ceased; credit has begun to expand. And every week some improvement is recorded somewhere.', 'As I have said, improvement would have begun 4 months earlier but for the fear of the destructive Democratic program. Today we would be moving faster in the restoration of farm prices and employment but for the threat that these destructive measures will be revived by a change in this election. The Democratic candidate for President has refused to renounce or disavow these destructive measures, or to give the country the assurance it deserves that he will not be a party to them, including the prepayment of the bonus. Observing this, and examining the dominant elements of this party under the leadership of the Vice-Presidential candidate, we can only assume that this program is still in abeyance, to be produced by them if they shall come into power. They have no right to complain that fear runs in the country.', 'The Democratic candidate has devoted most of his speeches to the presentation of numerous faults and wrongdoings in our economic system in which there is no new discovery. We may have much to do-we do have much to do in the future to punish wrongdoing and correct weaknesses in our system, but these corrections have but little bearing on our immediate national issue, and that is to restore employment, agricultural prices, relieve distress, so that fear and apprehension may be lifted from the homes of our people that they may be bright with hopes for the future. That is the first issue before the American people.', 'Before I discuss further the successful battle of the Republican administration to meet a worldwide emergency and to restore economic life, I wish to deal with some of the statements made by the Democratic candidate upon economy and the fiscal policies of this administration.', ""I have on previous occasions repeatedly called attention to the vast increase in public expenditures--local, State, and national--and the absolute necessity for their reduction as a fundamental part of national recovery. The cost of all forms of government must be reduced. The burden of intolerable taxation must be lifted from the backs of men. While only 30 cents of the taxpayer's dollar goes to the Federal Government, yet I and my colleagues have worked hard to reduce even this amount. Much has been accomplished, despite the opposition of selfish groups and sections of our country and the unwillingness of a Democratic House of Representatives to cooperate. And much more must be done."", 'The Democratic candidate says that we have been extravagant and in his various statements implies that we should make a defense of our actions. There will be no defense because none is needed. The ordinary expenses of the Federal Government, except for relief purposes, have been reduced, while those of the government of New York have been increased. Moreover, there will be proof that the Governor of New York, no doubt through ignorance of our fiscal system or through misinformation supplied to him, and totally ignoring the actions of the Democratic House of Representatives, has broadcast a misstatement of facts. In consequence his conclusions are amazingly far from the truth.', 'I live with these expenditures morning, noon, and night. Not a day goes by that I do not have them before me for responsible action. There is not a year in the formulation of the budget when there is not a battle between selfish groups which would increase the expenditures of the Government right and left. Not a session of Congress has convened that I have not had to veto increases in public expenditures.', 'So few of the statements made by the Democratic candidate are in accordance with the record of the Government that it leaves me nonplused where to begin. It would take hours to dissect each line and Paragraph, and I must confine myself to a few representative misstatements.', 'The Democratic candidate adopts the current method, which I shall follow, of discussing expenditures and not appropriations, and of expressing expenditures in sums less the postal receipts. The Governor also says that he wants to ""compare only the routine Government outlay, .... the ordinary costs of conducting Government,"" and excludes all extraordinary items in his comparisons. On this basis, which I accept, he says, we have increased the ordinary, routine cost of the Government by $1 billion between 1927 and 1931. I shall deal with that in a moment, but he omits to state that when the Republicans took office in 1921, Federal expenditures were still, 3 years after the war, at the rate of $5,500 million, and that by 1927, which year he uses as a base, they were reduced to approximately $3,585 million, or a reduction of nearly $2 billion a year.', 'The Governor states that, in order to arrive at a true representation of the ordinary expenditures of the Government, he will deduct from each of the 2 comparative years--that is, 1927 and 1931--what he calls ""an exceptional item""--that is, the reduction of interest and sinking fund on the public debt--and that he will deal in the case of each year with the residue. There was a reduction of $268 million in the service of the debts from 1927 to 1931. The Governor implies that it is not fair to consider this as an economy. That is an error, for it is a true economy in Government. A large part of this reduction in the charge upon the national debt was the result of many years of steady, painstaking refinance to decrease interest and the application of other economies in expenditure to the reduction of the debt during Republican administrations. That accomplishment can scarcely be considered an extravagance.', 'The actual expenditures for the year 1927, and I give you the full figures, were $3,585 million.', 'For 1931 they were $4,220 million or an increase of $635 million. Bear in mind the Governor says he wants to ""compare the routine, ordinary costs of conducting the Government."" He also says, in the same statement, that he favors relief measures by the Government. He then neglects to inform the country that the increased expenditures for 1931 over those of 1927 were almost wholly for relief of this depression. This increase includes an emergency increase in public works and vessel construction to relieve unemployment of $335,900,000- They include $243,600,000 of emergency relief to the farmers. Beyond this they include $112 million of emergency relief to the Postal Department because of the falling off of receipts from the depression itself. They include a special payment to veterans on the bonus and other items for depression of $124 million as a depression emergency action.', ""Thus we have a sum of emergency expenditures in relief of the depression of $815 million, compared to the $635 million of increase. If we adopt the Governor's own definition of the ordinary, routine expenditures and deduct this sum, if we adopt his policy, justification for relief measures by the Federal Government, then the ordinary, routine costs of the Government for 1931 were actually less than 1927--and not $1 billion greater, as he has stated to the American people."", 'Let me explore the subject some further. The year 1927, chosen by the Governor, was an especially low year, an exceptionally low year, for reasons connected with the census and the national defense. If the Governor wanted to be completely fair he would have adopted the year 1929, the last year before my administration, in which you can be sure that there was no waste under President Coolidge. He not only practiced economy, not only preached economy, but he gave the most practical demonstration of it ever seen by the Government of the United States. Had the Governor adopted that year, with its total expenditures of $3,848 million, and deducted from 1931 the extraordinary expenditures due to relief, he would find that there was an actual decrease in expenditures of upwards of $300 million in the ordinary conduct of the Government during the present administration.', 'But of more importance than this, the Governor promises that he will reduce Federal expenditures by a billion a year.', 'It would help if the Governor would state what year, and upon what theory, he proposes to use as a base. It would appear inasmuch as he has adopted the promise of the Democratic platform that he proposes to reduce the expenditures below the gross amount of all kinds for the year ending June 1932. That is a good base to start from because the expenditures were a little over $5 billion, due to the extraordinary measures of setting up the Reconstruction Corporation, financing the land banks, and a number of other large Government operations of purely temporary character, but yet charged to expenditures. If that is the basis, if he will compare the total expenditures of 1932, that is the fiscal year 1932, with the estimated total expenditures of the current fiscal year ending 1933, he will find a thing that he possibly knows already, and that is that the promised saving of $1 billion has already been accomplished. He will find that, even though we are still struggling with expenditures forced upon us by the Democratic House. But more than this, if the economies proposed by this administration had been accepted by the Democratic House there would have been for the current year a further saving of at least half a billion more.', 'If we are supported by the American people, and if the Democratic House will cooperate, I will make for the next fiscal year a reduction from the totals of 1932, not a reduction of a billion but of $1,500 million.', 'Now, I must tell you in all fairness that a larger part of this discussion depends on what year you use as a base. If the Governor means to reduce the Government expenditures $1 billion below the ""ordinary, routine"" costs of the Government, taking the present fiscal year, as we call it, the fiscal year 1933, which we are now in, as a base, it might be implied by any reasonable mind, it is only fair that the American people should know where and how he is going to accomplish it. If he is warranted in making such an assertion, then he must know the Federal Government well enough to know the places where such reductions can be made.', 'In order to help him I may say that the ""ordinary, routine"" expenditures for the current fiscal year are estimated at $3,647 million. Of these, $1,980 million are for the public debt and certain trust and refund services to which the Government is obligated and cannot escape, together with the expenditures upon the Army and the Navy. In the present disturbed state of the world we must not further reduce our defenses without a general agreement for the reduction of arms. Thus, the Governor must find a cut of $1 billion out of the remaining amount which is $1,667 million of ordinary, routine Government expenditures. Now then, friends, of this sum, $946 million is expended for veterans and $216 million for ordinary public works, while all other costs of Government are about $505 million, making a total of $1,667 million from which we are now to deduct a billion.', 'This last item of $505 million includes the cost of the Congress, the judiciary, prisons, tax collection, accounting, foreign relations, health, maintenance of lighthouses and airways, merchant marine, education, agriculture, various scientific bureaus, and a host of other critically important services. Assuming the wildest estimate, that these services could be reduced by one-half, that half of the lighthouses could be extinguished, that half the Federal prisoners turned loose on the public, the Governor would still have to find $750 million of economy. And even if he stopped all of the public works, he would have to finally find $500 million, and he would have to take it out of the one remaining item, that is, $946 million which the veterans of the United States receive. That would be a gross injustice. But that is where rash promises inevitably lead.', 'The Governor points with satisfaction to the increase in expenditures of the Department of Commerce under my administration. He neglects to inform the American people that these increases were nearly all due to the transfer of bureaus to that Department from other departments with a corresponding decrease in expenditures in those other departments. Enough of that statement.', ""I would like to take your time for a moment to examine the record of the last session of Congress in its relation to economy and to compare it with the efforts of the Republican administration, for it is illuminating both on the Democratic platform and upon the Governor's promises and his ability to perform."", 'In October a year ago, we prepared the budget--it was formulated before the crisis had become completely acute--reducing expenditures by $369 million over the previous year.', 'The situation having grown steadily more tense, you will recollect that in a message to Congress on December 8, I pointed out that revenues were falling steadily and then forecast a drop of $1,600 million in revenue and that we must have even more definite and actual reduction in Government expenditures than was possible by executive action, and again repeated an oft-made recommendation for legislative authority to effect certain further economies by consolidation and the elimination of bureaus and so on.', 'As the situation became daily more and more tense, you will recollect that again, on January 4, I addressed the Congress and urged the growing seriousness of the situation and demanded that we must have ""further and more drastic economy in expenditure.""', 'On February 17, little over a month later, you will recollect, I urged upon Congress again ""the absolute necessity for the most drastic economy"" and proposed the methods by which such further economies could be brought about.', 'The reply to this urging for economy--the first reply--was not economy, but the passage by the Democratic House on the 4th of March of the Gasque omnibus pension bill, and I vetoed that bill.', 'On April 4, adequate action not having yet been taken by the Congress to reduce expenditures, you will recollect that I again addressed them, stating that the $369 million of cuts originally recommended in the executive budget were entirely inadequate to the growing situation and proposed further savings which must be made only by legislative authority. I pointed out the gravity of the situation and asked that a national committee on economy representing the Senate, the House, and the executive should be appointed to review the entire question. The Democratic leaders all arose and at once denounced this suggestion as dictatorship.', 'Now, the House did appoint such a committee, but not under that name. The administration, the Republican administration, at once recommended to that committee that legislative authority be given to effect certain possible economies amounting to $250 million and certain indirect economies amounting to $50 million. At the same time we asked for more cuts from the appropriation committees. By the time these recommendations had filtered through the Democratic committee and through the Democratic House the economy bill had dwindled from $250 million of savings to savings of under $40 million, although the Senate restored a part of them.', 'Again, as if in reply to my urging for economies, on April 13 a bill which was not economy was passed by the Democratic House setting up a train of large Indian claims which had been settled 75 years ago, which again I was compelled to veto.', 'Some of you will recollect that on May 31, I addressed the Senate in person, pointing out the disastrous effect of the failures of Congress in effecting economies and to balance the budget with the shocks to Federal credit, its responsibility for degeneration in the economic system, and I stated: ""The probable decrease in revenues now is about $1,700 million. It necessitates absolute reduction in governmental \'expenditures,"" and I demanded as a first consideration that we have more and more drastic economy. I asked for a total reduction of $400 million in addition to my original proposal of December of $369 million, making a sum of nearly $800 million of economies. And I pointed out how they could be obtained.', 'Despite the desperate situation of the country, the helpful reply of the Democratic House, 8 days later, was not economy but the passage of the Garner-Rainey pork-barrel bill, one portion of which called for the increase in expenditure by $1,200 million. I was compelled to appeal for public support in protest, and I am glad to say the public so rallied that that bill died.', ""Again showing their utter disregard of the Nation's plight, on June 15, the Democratic House passed the Patman bill for the cash prepayment of the bonus, requiring an expenditure of $2,300 million. Again I protested publicly and asked for public support in stopping that bill. And it died."", 'Now, among other things, various conferences were carried on in an endeavor to arrive at an adequate relief bill, expanding the activities of the Reconstruction Corporation, but the Democratic leaders insisted not upon economy but on the inclusion in that bill of a new item of $322 million of further expenditures from the Federal Treasury. Ultimately this bill passed the Congress. It contained not only that provision but other measures putting the Government into wholesale pawnbroking in the unlimited use of Federal Government credit. On July 11, I vetoed this bill and again protested about the item of $322 million and requested that at least such a reservation be made on it that would hold back the expenditure until it could be determined if the budget had been balanced. In order to secure the relief bill at all, with its vital provisions in relief of distress, employment, and agriculture, I was finally compelled to accept it with an inadequate safeguard of that $322 million. And that expenditure has been forced upon the Government by the Democratic leaders. And I may say here and now that it has many of the colors of pork legislation.', 'If there is a deficit this year, it will be due to the Democratic Members of Congress. We had a vast amount of oratory from the Democratic side on the subject of economy during the whole session. The oratory, instead of the facts, seems to have lodged in the mind of the Democratic candidate.', 'And now these gentlemen arise to say that the Republican administration is to blame if the budget be not precisely balanced. I am well aware that progress in a democracy requires cooperation and compromise on matters that do not involve great principle, but it is not for the Democratic leaders to rise now and talk of economy and reduction of governmental expenditures after their attempts to foist $3 1/2 billion of further expenditures upon the Government, which we stopped, and after their failure to reduce expenses by some $200 million to $300 million which they refused, and after their forcing $322 million of new expenditure on us after our most strenuous opposition. The expenditures of the Federal Government for this fiscal year would be $500 million less had the demands of this administration been heeded.', 'When our opponents rise and say that they are the party to be trusted with the reduction of governmental expenditures, I recommend that you compare these promises with the actual performance of the body which under the Constitution initiates the fiscal policies of the Government--not the Senate, but the House of Representatives.', 'Despite all of this obstruction, I propose to continue the fight for reduction of governmental expenditures, and if there be a fresh mandate from the people on November 8, there will be no denying my demands.', 'The Governor has involved himself in a labyrinth of inaccurate statements, due to misinformation supplied to him, in trying to prove that the Secretary of the Treasury made errors in the estimates of our future revenue. He may have done so. The Governor insists that we should have increased taxation 2 years before we began. He ignores the fact that the Federal budget estimates are made in October for a year beginning the following July. This, however, is a detail. He would, however, appear to expect that by crystal gazing or by astrology the Secretary of the Treasury would be able to prophesy the revenues a year ahead in the midst of the greatest crisis in history, and to have thus anticipated the effect of every crash in the world upon our Federal revenues. I wish it were possible for human beings to predict the action of a Democratic House of Representatives a year or two in advance. If we had been able to do this, we could have interpreted the effect on the revenues and upon the budget of the actions of the last Congress and their disturbances in the whole economic system and their raids upon the United States Treasury.', 'In this particular the Governor might be interested to know that certain Democratic leaders in Congress publicly protested that no taxes should be imposed at all or that they should be delayed still another year, and that we should continue to live off of our fat, which was then getting thin. The administration was the first to insist that the undermined revenues of the country should be increased as a fundamental necessity to the maintenance of the stability of the United States Government.', 'The Governor implies that as the result of the failure to read the crystal of the future we have jeopardized the credit of the Federal Government. The answer to that--the Governor apparently does not know--is that only 10 days ago the Treasury of the United States sold $500 million of its notes at 3 percent interest. That does not look like a discredited institution. There is no government in the world financing itself at this moment on such a basis and with such confidence in its stability.', ""The Governor's labored charge a day or two ago that for some sinister purpose the facts as to Government finance and expenditures were misrepresented or concealed from the people is too silly to merit serious consideration. You are probably aware of the fact that the actual Federal expenditures and receipts for the different branches of the Government are issued to the public every morning at 9:30 o'clock and are open to every citizen of the United States, and he can calculate the progress of the Government day by day, week by week, and month by month with his own lead pencils."", 'Now I want to address myself to the constructive policies of my administration and the Republican Party, and in addressing myself to this task I want to address myself to the man who has a job, to the man who has no job and is looking for one, to the farmer and the businessman who are in difficulty. After all, the thing which is of real importance is not the misinformation furnished to the Democratic candidate or the promises of that party, but they are the actual measures and forces which we have in motion to restore jobs, agriculture, and business.', ""It has been my fate to have been born and raised in contact with the problems that come from distress and striving to maintain a home for one's loved ones. And I can say without challenge that a large part of my life has been spent in contact with efforts to solve human difficulties."", 'I, therefore, wish to discuss with you the emergency program which we have put into action and which we propose for overcoming this crisis, and to compare it with the Democratic program as made evident by the last Congress and with some suggestions which have been made in addition by the Democratic candidate.', 'In previous addresses I have traced the origins of this depression. I have spoken of the forces which dragged down the prosperity of our people and brought suffering, distress, and fear into American homes. The first stage of depression in this country was a reaction from the mania of speculation and flotation in 1929. I have traced on other occasions the measures which we initiated at that time to increase employment, to hold wages, to assist agriculture, to prevent distress, and the gradual recovery of the country from this domestic phase which took place a year after. I have pictured the dreadful calamity which then interrupted our recovery through the tremendous earthquake whose origins were in the World War and its aftermath and the strains which it had placed upon the nations of Europe. As the result of these they collapsed one by one, finally culminating at the end of September last year, when Great Britain abandoned the gold standard and was followed by a score of other nations with financial panics, overthrown governments, and revolutions.', 'In other places I have discussed the method by which the tremendous world crisis was transmitted to the United States. At the moment I desire only to point out to you the effect. In the weeks following the abandonment of the gold standard in England, the bank failures measured in deposits rose to over $250 million a week in the United States, and hoarding rose to over $100 million a week. Foreigners, fearing that we might be engulfed, drew out $725 million in gold from us within less than 6 weeks.', 'We met that situation promptly. On October 3, a year ago, I secured from the bankers of this country the establishment of the National Credit Association, with half a billion dollars with which to support our financial situation. On October 6, I asked for a meeting of the political leaders of both political parties and secured a declaration of unity of national action in the face of national danger.', 'The ship began to right itself. But again at the end of November it became evident that the forces moving against us were more powerful than could be stopped by these measures. Bank failures and hoarding increased, with a thousand other effects in increased unemployment and decreasing farm prices.', 'We were faced with three great perils. The first was that through the losses and decrease of profits in business there was a drop in Federal tax revenues of $1,600 or $1,700 million, that is, nearly half the revenue of the Federal Government. We were faced with inability to pay our expenses of Government except by an increase of taxes or, alternatively, by enormous borrowings.', 'Second, the integrity of the monetary system was increasingly threatened by the terrible impact of foreign gold withdrawals and our own hoarding and the inflexibility of the Federal Reserve Act.', 'Third, the whole private credit machinery of the country was so paralyzed that credit was practically impossible to obtain. Business dried up, demands were made right and left upon debtors to force them to raise cash upon which their property must be realized in diminished and nonexistent markets. Unless these forces could be stopped the whole Nation was in the gravest of danger.', 'I should like for a moment to review the whole program we proposed and have largely established to meet that emergency. Some of its effectiveness was lost by delays in placing these weapons into our hands, for in battle much depends on being there on time. Some part of the losses, in failures, bankruptcies, falls in farm prices, increases in unemployment, were due to these delays. Some of the delays were the result of the slow moving of democracy; much of it, the refusal to enact some portion of the measures we asked for, were in consequence of destructive Democratic opposition. And again I wish to state that certain members of that party did cooperate with us, and to them I pay the highest tribute to their patriotism of which I am capable.', 'You will recollect the recommendations which I made to the Congress in a message at its convening on December 8 last:', 'First, drastic reduction in Government expenses.', 'Second, by this and an increase in revenues to balance the budget, thus to hold impregnable the credit of the Federal Government.', 'Third, the strengthening of the capital of the Federal land banks by $125 million in order to relieve the pressure upon farmers to repay their mortgages.', 'Fourth, the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with $2 billion of resources in order that, having maintained national credit, we should thrust the full resources of public credit behind the private credit system of the country in order to reestablish and maintain it in an unassailable position. That with the backing of the Federal credit it should protect the depositors in savings banks, insurance policyholders, the lenders and borrowers in building and loan associations; that it should through existing agencies expand the funds available for loans to merchants, manufacturers, farmers, agricultural marketing associations; that it should protect the railways from receiverships in order that in turn the railway securities in the insurance companies and savings banks might be protected, and the employees of the railways, likewise with a score of other services.', 'Fifth, an extension of the authority of the Federal Reserve Board to meet the danger of our gold standard and to expand credit in counteraction to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawals.', 'Sixth, the creation of the home loan discount banks with resources of several hundred millions to give homeowners a chance to hold their homes through foreclosure and to furnish credit to create new homes and to expand employment.', 'Seventh, an authority by which we could secure early liquidation of deposits in closed banks that we might relieve the distress to millions of depositors. We did not secure that authority out of the Congress.', 'Eighth, revision of the banking laws. This matter was postponed.', 'Ninth, continuation of the public works program of some $500 to $600 million per annum as an aid to employment.', 'Later in the session of Congress I expanded these emergency recommendations to include a tenth item, that is, an authority to the Reconstruction Corporation to loan up to $300 million to the States whose resources had been exhausted in relief of distress.', 'Eleventh, loans by the Reconstruction Corporation up to $1,500 million for the undertaking of great works which would add to employment and from their own earnings repay the outlay.', 'Twelfth, the erection of a new system of agricultural credit banks with indirect resources of some $300 million in order to save the farmer.', 'Thirteenth, the extension of credits through the Reconstruction Corporation for the movement of agricultural commodities in a normal fashion to market.', 'And I may add to these measures others which we have set in motion in this emergency.', 'The fourteenth would be to maintain the protective tariff as the first safeguard of every manufacturer and every workman and every farmer in the United States. Never has the protective tariff been so vital as in this emergency when 20 countries are suffering from depreciated currencies; their standards of living and wages are lower than even a year ago. The danger of flooding our markets with foreign goods was never greater than at this moment. A week ago in Cleveland I showed wages in foreign countries would buy only from one-eighth to one-third as much bread and butter as could be bought by the wages in the United States today. In the face of these standards of living and in the face of this depreciated currency, the Democratic Party and its candidate Proposes to lower the tariff. In this emergency as never before we require the Preservation of our nonpartisan Tariff Commission, by which this flood can be prevented and through which, if tariffs should become high, they can be lowered without disruption and the logrolling of congressional action. Our opponents propose to destroy that function.', 'Fifteenth, the prevention of immigration during this emergency is vital except for relatives of those residents in the United States. It is important that we hold for our people the jobs which we have.', 'I might mention that the administrative order which I issued 2 years ago practically closing immigration except for relatives of residents has resulted in the exclusion of somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 millions of immigrants in addition to our unemployed, if we assume that immigration would have been at the same rate subsequent to that order that it had been in the 2 years previous.', 'The sixteenth item on our program and by no means the least, the constant mobilization and support of all private relief agencies as we have done over the past 3 years in order that we may have the fullest care and support given to those who are ill and in distress, and that we may maintain a sense of responsibility of every man to his neighbor.', 'Seventeenth, the mobilization of our businessmen, our labor and agricultural leaders, to carry on the present cooperative activities, initiate new activities for the increase of employment and aids to agriculture. It is upon this line of voluntary mobilization of cooperative action that we are engaged in an attack all along the economic front at this moment.', 'Eighteenth in the program of reconstruction, the vigorous consummation of the results from the World Economic Conference with view of relieving the pressures from the outside and preventing reoccurrences of these distresses in the future. The continuation of our negotiations for the reduction of armament in order to reduce our expenses and to relieve the world of fear and of political instability.', 'Now, this is the constructive program proposed by the Republican administration. It has largely been adopted as a relief to this emergency. The reform of banking and relief to depositors of closed banks was not secured. We have other measures to propose to the next Congress, especially for the future relief of farm mortgages. But I would have you examine this program. You will find that it conforms with American practice, American experience, and American common sense. It is proving itself every day. It has prevented national chaos, and it is today producing national recovery.', 'The first series of these measures was proposed to the Congress on December 8 last, after the debacle developed in Europe. The Congress incidentally, the House of Representatives concluded, against my appeal to its leaders, to adjourn over the Christmas holidays, and only one of these measures was enacted until February.', 'And coincident with the passage of the principal of these measures, in the middle of last February the ship began to right itself; the country began to show the resilience of its resources, courage, increased employment, upward trend of prices in agricultural products, and to give signs of again resuming its activities.', 'Then there supervened a whole period of obstructive and destructive actions by the Democratic House of Representatives which I will elaborate a little later, as I have already done in this address, in order to show the real program of the Democratic Party to meet this emergency.', 'It is now taken for granted that this Republican program has come of its natural self because in retrospect there is such universal recognition of its necessity. On the contrary, it has been wrought out of the fiery ordeal of hard and honest thought, the facing of facts when loose thinking and frightened men offered every temptation for specious panaceas. Much of it was wrought against the heartbreaking obstruction and delays in the Democratic House of Representatives.', 'But in the main it has been established, and it is working every minute now.', 'Practically the only evidence of the attitude of the Democratic candidate upon this program is the sneer that it has been designed to help banks and corporations and that it has not helped the common man. He knows Full well that the only purpose of helping an insurance company is to protect the policyholder. He knows full well that the only Purpose of helping a bank is to protect the depositor and the borrower. He knows full well that the only purpose of helping a farm mortgage company is to enable the farmer to hold his farm. He knows full well that the only purpose of helping a building and loan association is to Protect the savings and homes of its participants. He knows full well that in sustaining the businessman it maintains the worker in his job. He knows full well that loans to the States protect families in distress.', 'Now I may tell you that millions of men and women are employed today because there has been restored to their employers the ability to borrow the money to buy the raw materials and pay the labor and thus keep them on the job. And I may say that if the common man be a farmer, it has restored his ability to secure credit upon which to produce his crops and his livestock. If he be a homeowner or a farm-owner in jeopardy of foreclosure of his mortgage, it now gives him a fighting chance. If he has borrowed for any purpose, he has not been forced to the wall by bankruptcy through inability to meet his debt. If he has savings in the bank, it has protected him and relieved his anxieties. If he has an insurance policy, it has preserved the validity of that policy. If he be a merchant, it has stopped the calling of his loans and today enables him to again borrow to purchase his stock and thus start employment. If he be unemployed, it is making hundreds of thousands of jobs. If he be in distress, it enables the State or the city to secure the money and assures him that he will not suffer from hunger and cold. Those who are in distress in this city are today receiving their bread and rent from the result of these Republican measures. And I may say that nothing works perfectly, there have been casualties and there have been disasters, but I am speaking of the Nation as a whole--the Nation upon which the vitality of our race depends. Beyond these items which I have given you, it is today creating new jobs and giving the whole system a new breadth of life. And nothing has ever been devised in our history which has done more for those whom Mr. Coolidge aptly called the common run of men and women than the program which the Republican Party has produced and put into action.', 'Now I wish again to turn to the specific Democratic action and program for this emergency as shown by their actions in the House of Representatives, which is the only responsible place where they have been able and compelled to show their attitude of mind. I have only to repeat and enumerate. I hope by this time you are familiar with them. I can remember them by the dates when they were passed by the House of Representatives.', 'On January 9, 1932, the Collier bill was passed by the Democratic House providing for the destruction of the effective powers of the Tariff Commission. It also provided for an international conference to be called for many purposes, one of which was to ask foreign nations to help us lower the American tariffs. It also proposed reciprocal tariffs, and in vetoing it I stated that ""no concessions other than those on agricultural tariffs would be of any interest to other nations,"" and that has proved true.', 'On March 4, the Gasque omnibus pension bill, which I mentioned a few moments ago, was passed by the House. As I have said, I vetoed that.', 'On March 7, 1932, the revenue bill, introduced by a nonpartisan Ways and Means Committee, was torn to pieces on the floor of the Democratic House. It had to be sent back to the committee, and an inadequate patchwork bill was submitted and passed. Long and harmful delays resulted. The injustices in that bill have yet to be remedied.', 'On April 13, 1932, as I have said, I vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic House that would have set in train the opening of a large series of Indian claims, dead and settled 75 years ago. That was in accordance, of course, with Democratic economy programs.', 'On May 2, 1932, the Democratic House passed a bill ordering the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury to fix prices at the average prevailing during the years 1921-1929 by the control of the volume of currency and of credit. As no mortal human man can accomplish this, both of those agencies promptly denied that they could produce this kind of a rubber dollar.', 'On May 3, 1932, the House committees and the Democratic House refused to pass the economy bill, as I have described to you.', 'On June 7, 1932, they passed the pork-barrel bill for $1,200 million, of which I have already commented. That bill is still advocated by the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, still goes on.', 'I have already mentioned that on June 15, 1932, the Patman bill was passed, providing for the cash prepayment of the adjusted-service certificates requiring an immediate expenditure of $2,300 million.', 'On June 15, 1932, the Democratic House, likewise as part of the same measure, passed a provision for the issuance of $2,300 million of fiat money--a form of currency inflation that has been best exemplified: recent years by the action of the German Government in issuing paper marks in 1922. Had this measure become law, every farmer and every workman would be paying a penalty for it at this moment.', 'On July 7, 1932, the Democratic House passed the Rainey bill including a provision for injecting the Federal Government into direct personal banking. I vetoed that measure, and I stated it would mean loans for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to anyone that wanted money. It would place the Government in private banking in such a fashion as to violate every principle of public relations on which we have have builded our Nation, and would render insecure its very foundations.', 'On July 13, 1932, the House passed the relief bill, insisting on injecting the $322 million which I have mentioned. Now, this is by no means all that the Democratic House accomplished, but they at least indicate the controlling elements of that party and they constitute a program of about the same number of parts of the administration program that I have described to you.', 'Now I wish to discuss a proposal of the Democratic candidate himself.', 'Early in September there appeared amongst the unemployed in some of our cities reproductions of a letter from Governor Roosevelt which read [At this point the President read the text of the letter as follows:]', 'Mr. Lowe Shearon,358 Front Street,New York, N.Y.', 'In accordance with your request I shall be glad to have you quote me as follows:', 'I believe in the inherent right of every citizen to employment at a living wage and pledge my support to whatever measures I may deem necessary for inaugurating self-liquidating public works, such as utilization of our water resources, flood control and land reclamation, to provide employment for all surplus labor at all times.Sincerely yours,FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT', 'I emphasize that last line--""to provide employment for all surplus labor at all times.""', 'This letter did not appear in the public press until October 13, when it was published in the leading New York journal. It was republished on the 14th; on the 15th it was again republished in that journal with the statement, quoting from the Governor, that it was substantially correct. In case there is any doubt as to its authenticity, I may say that its continued circulation for the purpose of securing votes is subject to the severest condemnation.', 'There can only be one conclusion from that statement. It is a hope held out to 10 million men and women now suffering and unemployed that they will be given jobs, directly or indirectly, by the Government. That is a promise that no government on Earth can fulfill. It is utterly wrong to delude suffering men and women with such assurances.', 'The most menacing condition in the world today is the lack of confidence and faith. It is a terrible thing to increase this undermining effect by holding out, for political purposes, promises to 10 million men which cannot be kept and which must end in leaving them disillusioned.', 'There are a score of reasons why this whole plan is fantastic. These 10 million men, nor any appreciable fraction of them, cannot be provided with jobs in this fashion. The only way to provide jobs for our unemployed is by healing the wounds of the economic system and restoring them to their normal occupations.', 'There are many reasons why all this is true. To give a living wage to 10 million men, either through employing them directly on such works, as are here indicated, or indirectly in the furnishing of supplies and services, would cost the Government from $9 to $12 billion a year. The borrowing of this amount of money would suck the resources from industry and commerce and cause unemployment to other millions of people. It would destroy the Government and private credit on which all present employment is built and upon which all hope of future employment rests.', 'There are not in the United States enough of so-called self-liquidating Projects to employ but a fraction of this total, and the Reconstruction Corporation is at this moment engaged in considering and authorizing all of such available projects. If there were any beyond their resources it would require at least a year or 2 years of technical preparation to get any of them into action before anyone could be employed. To increase land reclamation would hugely increase agricultural production at a time when our farmers are already paralyzed by enormous surpluses. It would create the most gigantic bureaucracy in all history.', 'And above all, I ask you whether or not such frivolous promises and dreams should be held out to suffering unemployed people. I may reiterate again that the only method by which we can stop suffering and unemployment is by returning people to their normal jobs in their normal homes, carrying on their normal functions of life. This can be done only by sound processes of protecting and stimulating the existing economic system which we have in action today. I hope that that is the case. In any event, it is time that it is answered because it is being circulated and held out for votes in this campaign.', 'I have tonight confined myself to the measures which we have taken to save the country from a gigantic disaster and which are in action to overcome the present emergency. I have not attempted to cover the long view program of the administration and the Republican Party. I will do that on some other occasion.', 'In dealing with the present emergency I have insisted that we shall as a nation rely upon the initiative and the responsibilities of our citizens, of our institutions, and of our fabric of local government; that the full powers of the Federal Government shall be used for the protection of our people in this emergency; that the great instrumentalities and the measures which we have erected shall be conducted without interruption and with constantly inspiring and vigorous action until restoration is completed; and above all, that they shall be used in such a manner as to sustain these fundamentals which are the real spirit of our national life.', 'Your purpose and my purpose is to protect the American home with all of its precious blessings, and to protect our children in their rightful heritage of joy and hope and opportunity, and thus hand on to them the ideals and the aspirations which we have received from our fathers.', 'To do this and as a nation we have many labors before us when this emergency is past: the strengthening and the better regulation of public service; the improvement of our credit and banking system; the development of a better scene of agriculture and industry; and the score of other pressing duties.', 'And there is one inspiration for this emergency and for the future of this Nation that transcends all others. That inspiration we shall continue to discover in the schools and the churches of this land and in communication with the Great Searcher of all souls. Our Nation has survived thus far because it was rounded in the favor of God by men and women who were more concerned with His will than they were with selfish aggrandizement and material acquisitions. The ultimate source of great constructive measures of government and of law are in the moral and spiritual impulses of our people.', 'These are the beliefs and the convictions which necessarily must come to me from the vivid association with these currents and with the forces and in the office which I have occupied, with its invisible presence of the many men who before me have fought and builded for these ideals.', ""No marl can be President without looking back upon the effort given to this country by the 30 men who in my case have preceded me. No man of imagination can be President without thinking of what shall be the course of his country under the 30 more Presidents who shall follow him. He must think of himself as a link in the long chain of his country's destiny, past and future. That future is in your hands. By your action on November 8, you will determine whether we shall go on in the orderly adaptation of our old American ways to new needs, whether we shall build on the foundations laid by our forefathers over the last century and a half, or whether you will let momentary despair lead you to give the country a new and untried direction."", 'I can well understand that my countrymen are weary and sore and tired. I can well understand that part of this weariness comes from the exhaustion of a long battle. But in the battle we have carried the first-line trenches. It is of transcendent importance that there shall be no interruption; that there shall be no change in the strategy and the tactics used in the midst of a victorious movement. The essentials of American life must not be broken down in chaos and in peril.', 'These are questions which the American people must weigh, and weigh heavily, in the next 2 weeks. What you will determine on November 8 will be much more than a change of individuals, or even more important than merely making a choice between ways of coming out of this emergency. More than all that, it will determine the permanent course of this country.', ""The future of an individual is of no great importance in the lifestream of a nation. No one of us has the right to stand in the light of the Nation's progress. Change in my personal position from command to the ranks is of trifling importance in the life of this Nation. What is of vast importance is the measures and policies, the thought, the philosophy, and the sentiment you adopt by your vote, and the men and the forces who in front and behind the scenes will dominate our national life."", ""I am anxious to see that these present sound policies and measures shall be continued, only because I am anxious to see that my country shall come safely into the harbor from dangers that but few men not occupying my responsibilities will ever appreciate. The following of will-o'-the-wisps is not being progressive. It is not being liberal. It is driving slowly into the tyranny which means extinction under bureaucracy of liberty and hope and opportunity."", 'In conclusion, I declare again that it is the high purpose of my administration, it is the historic determination of the Republican Party, to preserve this Nation for our citizens with its American system of liberty intact, its American free opportunity and its equal opportunity still open, moving ever forward in accord with these principles, its American Government forever in the hands of men who believe that our fathers builded well, when for 150 years they strove with brain and brawn to make this the greatest land that ever free men have loved.', 'Thank you.']"
9,Herbert Hoover ,"October 28, 1932","['[1.] PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA (8:25 a.m. )', 'I am deeply gratified at this greeting and this reception which you are giving to Mrs. Hoover and me on our arrival again in the Ohio Valley. A few days ago I was called upon by a delegation of your citizens, comprising both your businessmen and representatives of your labor, in which they laid before me the situation that has arisen in your pottery industry, and that is a typical situation now arising in our country.', 'The depreciation of currency in foreign countries, particularly in Japan where the currency has dropped about 50 percent of its value 12 months ago, has dropped the cost of living and the cost of wages in Japan by 50 percent. The result has been that today a Japanese laborer working in their potteries is able to buy only one-eighth the amount of bread that can be purchased by the scale of wages paid in our pottery industry. The consequence of all that is that Japanese pottery is flowing in over our borders and depriving all of you of employment. We have placed that situation before the Tariff Commission. I am in hopes we will secure an early remedy of it. But it is one of the finest examples in the whole United States of the importance of the protective tariff.', 'The Republican Party has been the father, the supporter, and will continue to be the advocate and the supporter of the protective tariff. Our opponents propose to reduce that tariff. The reductions that have taken place in the past few months as the result of the depreciation of foreign currency are depriving the citizens of this city at this moment of their employment, and our opponents propose to still further reduce that tariff.', 'I leave you to make your own calculations, and I leave you to come to your own conclusions as to the action which you should take on November 8.', 'Thank you.', '[2.] ATHENS, OHIO (9:19 a.m.)', 'Friends in Athens:', 'I greatly appreciate your greeting. It means that someone has been up early in the morning to have come in from outside the city at this hour, and it adds to the warmth of your welcome.', 'I notice that the large part of the crowd belong to the younger part of our generation, and indeed upon them does rest very great responsibilities in these times. More than half of the voters of our country are under 35 years of age today, and upon them will come the burden of the conduct of our country year by year.', 'Athens is a name which carries over the country the character of one of its institutions. I live in a college town which has not had the benefit of that indication of the character of the city, and I can appreciate the value of the institution and the type of life in this city that arises from the influence of your college.', 'There is one question which I am going to take a moment of your time this morning to mention because it is not only of importance to the neighborhood of Athens, but it is of great importance to all this section of the country--and that refers to the problem of the bituminous coal industry. That industry has gone through a long period of difficulty due to the competition of electricity, of gas, and of oil. It has in consequence suffered tremendously from the most destructive competition that we have known in any industry in the attempt of that industry to hold together in the face of a decreasing demand. There appears to be an end to that decrease, and the industry may look forward in the future to some expansion.', 'But nevertheless there is here in this industry a form of destructive competition such as we have seen in no industry in the course of two generations, and that destruction takes itself out on the backs of men. We have seen a constant decrease of competition in securing orders, and we have seen a degeneration in that industry such as we have in no other industry in our country.', 'A few years ago I recommended to the Congress that they should investigate the subject and make a determination of a method by which we might end some of the destructiveness of the competition going on. A year ago I returned to it and pointed out the enormous losses to our national resources, the tremendous suffering going on amongst the wage earners of the industry and the unprofitable character of it to the operator. It would seem to me, and I recommended at that time, that we must draft a new law for some measure of cooperation between the mines in order that labor should not be the fulcrum on which this constant destruction takes place, and I am in hopes that we can in the early part of next session of Congress find that remedy. None of us are proposing to withdraw or abandon the Sherman Act. That is essential for the Preservation of the small businessmen throughout the country, but on the other hand there is no reason in the world why the operation of a law should create the amount of misery and suffering which is now going on in the bituminous industry at the cost of the law itself.', 'I wish again to express the appreciation I have for your greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging. It gives to me the feeling that we will receive your support on the 8th day of November.', 'Thank you.', '[3.] HAMDEN, OHIO (10:03 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate the welcome which you have given to me this morning. It is encouraging. It is heartening, and it is evidence of your feeling upon the 8th day of November. You will appreciate that so short a stop as this offers but little opportunity to discuss national issues. I do wish, however, for you to feel that your coming to the station to give us this sort of a greeting is the most heartening thing that can be done in this campaign. It is a great battle to preserve the foundations of American institutions. It is a battle far more important than the destinies of any one man. It is a battle that is of the first value to you and to your future, and that battle is being fought by the Republican Party.', '[4. ] CHILLICOTHE, OHIO ( 10:37 a.m. )', 'It was very generous of you to come down and give this greeting so early in the morning. It has been only, I think, 4 days since I visited this city. I am glad to see that you are constant in your support to the campaign that we are carrying on.', 'BY STANDER. We are going to reelect you, Mr. Hoover.', 'THE PRESIDENT. That is the right spirit, but you are not reelecting me. You are reelecting the Republican Party.', '[5.] CINCINNATI, OHIO (12:52 p.m.) Friends:', 'I deeply appreciate the generosity and the courtesy of your greeting this morning. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of where you will stand on the 8th of November next.', 'Our country has gone through a great strain during these last 3 years. The strain reached such a point a year ago, through the collapse of a great number of foreign countries, as to seriously jeopardize the whole of our country. The administration at once took unprecedented measures in dealing with that situation, and we have succeeded in defeating those forces. We have protected our institutions and our people. We have now transformed those measures into an attack upon this depression all along the line. The need today is to maintain and continue the constructive measures of the Republican Party in order to finally overcome the depression and restore our country. There are many evidences in the country today that these policies are working successfully. Men are returning to work. Orders are being placed with our manufacturers. Car loadings are increasing, and there are a score of other evidences of the success of the program, and, if it be not interrupted, will aid the march of recovery all along the line.', 'An occasion like this is hardly a time to review the battalions and the regiments and the army corps that we have in action in this great battle. They are both private and governmental. The first of these is the protective tariff upon our manufactured goods. Our opponents propose to reduce the tariff. They propose to reduce it in the face of the fact that, due to the depreciation of foreign currencies, the standards of living and the wages in 30 countries which compete with you have now been further lowered and a portion of our tariff protection has been already destroyed.', 'I have lately asked the Tariff Commission to review that situation because your industries in Cincinnati are vitally interested in maintaining that protection. It is the margin through which we maintain our standard of living and wages and your jobs.', 'A few days ago I asked the Department of Commerce to make a survey of the buying power of wages in different countries in the world as a result of these changes made by depreciation of foreign currencies. That survey showed that when you translate wages in those foreign countries into their ability to buy bread and butter, there is today no country where the wages will buy one-third the amount of bread and butter than can be bought by the wages in the United States. You are compelled to compete, if this tariff be lowered, with that kind of wage. But worse than that, one competitor, that is Japan, whose currency depreciated 40 percent, is today shipping goods into your city in competition with your industries. In Japan the standard of living has lowered to the extent that the power of their workmen of purchasing bread and butter is just one-eighth that of your workmen in this city.', 'There are other measures which we have introduced to bring about the recovery from this depression. One of them was the Reconstruction Corporation. You have seen evidences of its work in your own city. By loans made to your terminal company you are able to continue the construction of this railway terminal and secure its completion 2 or 3 years in advance of what would otherwise have been the case. You were able to maintain employment in a time of great distress to a great number of families.', 'Another of the measures that we have undertaken was the expansion of public construction. You have an example of that in this city in the postal terminal building, the contract for which has been let, which will result in the distribution of more than a million dollars of wages in this community.', 'Another of our Federal measures will no doubt reach into your city before winter is over--the provision of funds to save your unemployed from distress.', 'Another indication of the policies of the Republican Party has been the establishment in this city of one of the new home loan banks. These banks are for the purpose of mobilizing the strength of your building and loan associations and your savings banks, of increasing their ability to borrow money, and thereby in turn to relend it to the citizens of your city on more favorable terms than ever hitherto, and by opening new supplies of credit to increase the construction of new homes and the employment of further labor. Its further and more immediate object is to prevent the foreclosure upon homes where men are not able to secure renewals. That in itself is a measure of major importance in the safety of your work people and of your city.', 'Now, I will not go into the program of our opponents on this occasion. If any of you will read the record in the last session of Congress and the promises given in this campaign--many of them recklessly-you will find that they represent mostly destruction rather than construction. The Republican Party has been for the whole of its 70 years of life the constructive party of the United States. So that the issue for the ordinary businessman and the workingman is this: Whose election-the election of which party to the Government? Personalities are immaterial, the Government is conducted by parties and by the traditions of those parties. Which of these parties will bring us to a prompt industrial recovery ?', 'Our Republican program is definite, and it is specific. We do not hesitate to proclaim it. We do not sidestep the issues in this campaign. And this program is now actually working, greatly improving the conditions of business every week and every month. The Democratic program offers no actual measure unless it be reduction of the tariff, payment of the bonus, issue of paper money and half a dozen other destructive measures.', 'The program of the Republican Party is known to the whole business of the Nation, is based on sound governmental economic ideas. If on the 8th day of November there be no change, it will carry this great battle, in which we have already captured the first-line trenches, on to victory.', '[6.] HAMILTON, OHIO (2:12 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I greatly appreciate the courtesy and generosity of your greeting. It is heartening, and it is encouraging. And it is a sure sign of what will happen on the 8th of November.', 'Our country has come in the last 3 years through a great crisis. At one time it appeared that that crisis might overwhelm everything that we hold dear. The unprecedented measures which were taken by your Government in Washington prevented that calamity. Those measures have today been turned into an attack upon this economic depression. All about you in all sections of the country people are returning to work. Loadings are increasing on the railroads. Merchants are giving new and additional orders. We are on the road out if we are able to continue these policies and if we shall not change the strategy of this attack in the midst of the greatest battle in which our Nation has been engaged.', 'I thank you again for this greeting. It is encouraging. I am speaking to you tonight over the radio at greater length, and I hope that many of you can listen in.', 'Thank you.', '[7.] OXFORD, OHIO (1:38 p.m.)', 'It is a courteous and a generous reception that you are giving to me, and I take it as an earnest of what you will do on the 8th of November next.', 'This is not a very easy occasion on which to make a discussion of national issues, but most of you will be listening to the radio tonight, I have no doubt, and I shall give to you a solid hour of such discussion if you can endure it.', 'I thank you for this reception and encouragement.', '[8.] CONNERSVILLE, INDIANA (2:19 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is difficult to formulate words to give adequate expression to the appreciation I feel for this reception in the State of Indiana. It is encouraging. It is heartening. It is an indication of your action on the 8th day of November next. This is an occasion for me to see some of you and to say a word to the people of Indiana.', 'Tonight I shall speak to you over the radio. I am in hopes that most of you may have an opportunity to listen. I shall then deal with the questions which I believe are necessary to be understood by our people in coming to the judgment which will be required by them within another 10 or 12 days. And it is an important occasion to which you are coming. It is an action which can take our Nation on in the present course over the next few years, or it is an action as to whether you are to maintain the guidance and leadership of the Republican Party which has maintained this Nation in its stable form since the days of Abraham Lincoln.', 'I thank you for this reception. I tell you again that it is encouraging, and I believe it indicates where your hearts lie.', 'Thank you.', '[9.] RUSHVILLE, INDIANA (2:51 p.m.)', 'Friends:', 'I am glad to have the opportunity of seeing the faces of men and women who sent Senator Watson to Washington to cooperate with our administration. I would like to spend a half an hour with you to tell you of the service that the Senator has been to his country and to the State of Indiana and the friendship that he has shown for me.', 'I want to express to you my appreciation for your greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is a sure sign of your action on the 8th day of November.', 'I shall speak to you tonight from Indianapolis. I hope you may be able to listen in on the radio. This is not a time to talk of national issues, but it is a time to express to you my appreciation for your greeting.']"
10,Herbert Hoover ,"October 28, 1932","['My fellow citizens, my friends in Indianapolis, and may I also include Senator Watson, for I wish to add that he must be your next Senator--we require his services in Washington:', 'Now, my fellow citizens, my major purpose tonight is to discuss those long-view policies by which we not only cement recovery but also by which we secure over the years the enlarged comfort and the steady progress of the American people. I propose to contrast them with the ideas which have been developed by the Democratic House of Representatives, the Democratic platform, and the Democratic candidate in the course of this campaign.', 'When I refer to the views of these groups I wish to say at once that I do not refer to all members of the Democratic Party. Many of them, as in 1896 and in 1928, have signified their intention to support us against these notions. I also wish on all occasions to pay tribute to those Democratic Members of the Congress who supported the unprecedented measures which we presented during the course of the last winter and through which we saved this country from destruction and chaos.', 'I would like also to reiterate the statement which I recently made at Detroit, that the most important issue before the American people right now is to overcome this crisis, that we may secure a restoration of normal jobs to our unemployed, recovery of our agricultural prices and of our business, and that we may extend generous help in the meantime to tide our people over until these fundamental restorations are established.', 'I pointed out on that occasion that the battle has now changed from a successful defense of our country from disaster and chaos to forward marching attack on a hundred fronts through a score of instrumentalities and weapons toward recovery. Since that time I have had further positive evidence showing that the measures and policies that we have set in motion are driving the forces of depression into further retreat with constantly increasing rapidity. If there shall be no change in the strategy of this battle, if there shall be no delay and hesitation, we shall have the restoration of men and women to their normal jobs and we shall have that lift to agriculture from its anxieties and its losses.', 'But before I begin the major discussion of the evening, I wish to take a moment of your time to revert to those methods and policies for protection and recovery from this depression in the light of certain recent misstatements of the Democratic candidate in respect to them.', 'I presume the Governor of New York will announce that I am acting upon the defensive if I shall expose the self-interested inexactitude which he has broadcasted to the American people. I am equally prepared to defend, attack, or expound. I shall not be deterred from my purpose to lay before the people of the United States the truth as to the issues which they confront, and I shall do it with a sense of responsibility of one who has carried out and must carry into effect these issues.', 'I wish to call your attention to the fact that the Governor of New York in a speech on October 25 stated:', '""This crash came in October 1929. The President had at his disposal all of the instrumentalities of the Government. From that day until December 31, 1931, he did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation. Not only did he do nothing, but he took the position that Congress could do nothing.""', 'That is the end of the quotation, and it is a charge which extends over the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression. It seems almost incredible that a man, a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, would broadcast such a violation of the truth. The front pages of every newspaper in the United States for the whole of those 2 years proclaimed the untruth of that statement. And I need remind you but of a few acts of the administration to demonstrate what I say.', 'The Governor dismisses the agreements brought about between the leaders of industry and labor under my assistance less than 1 month after the crash by which wages of literally millions of men and women were, for the first time in 15 depressions of a century, held without reduction until after profits had ceased and the cost of living had decreased.', 'He ignores the fact that today real wages in the United States are higher than at any other depression period, higher in purchasing power than in any other country in the world. And above all, he dismisses the healing effect of that great agreement by which this country has been kept free from industrial strife and class conflicts.', 'He would suppress from the American people the knowledge of the undertaking brought about within 2 months after the crash amongst the industries of the United States to divide the existing work in such fashion as to give millions of families some measure of income instead of discharging a large portion of them into destitution, as had always been the case in previous depressions and was the case abroad. He ignores the fact that these agreements have held until this day for the staggering oœ employment.', 'If the Governor will look up his own files of his official correspondence, he will find that within a month after the crash I appealed to him, amongst the other Governors, for cooperation in creating employment and stabilization of wages, in which I set out to him the gravity of the national situation and urged that he should present in turn the great need to the counties and cities of his State. If he says nothing was done, it was a violation of the promise which he wrote to me on that occasion.', 'Nevertheless, the other States and the municipalities, including the great State of Indiana, entered into the general definite organization between the States to increase construction work in relief of unemployment during the winters not only of 1930 but of 1931. Not only were Federal, State, and municipal agencies mobilized, but private agencies were mobilized to that end. And by this, the Governor seems to have forgotten, I succeeded in reversing the whole usual process of decreasing construction work of this character in time of depression.', 'This type of work was increased during the first year of the depression by over $800 million above normal, thus giving a living to thousands of families who otherwise would have been destitute.', ""The Governor says nothing had been done. The Governor would also suppress the fact of the mobilization of the American people under my direction during the winters of 1930 and '31 of private charity and of public support to relief of distress in every town, village, and hamlet in the United States through which we carried them over these winters without serious suffering or loss, as is proved by the public health statistics of today."", 'The Governor cannot be ignorant of the recommendations which I made to the Congress within a month after the crash, and again in the session a year later, for the great increase of Federal public works in aid of employment, and he cannot be ignorant of the appropriations made at my recommendation for the care of farmers stricken by drought or the public funds raised under my leadership for these purposes.', 'The Governor ignores the most patent fact in the history of this depression: that, under the wise policies pursued by this administration, recovery of the United States from the first phase of the depression-that is, the collapse from our own speculation and boom--began about a year after the crash and continued definitely and positively until April 1931, when the general world crash took place which was not of our doing.', 'The Governor is probably ignorant of the international measures taken to limit the extension of this prairie fire under American leadership. He ignores the German moratorium and the standstill agreements in June 1931, which not only saved Germany from complete collapse but prevented much of the extended distress from reaching the United States. He neglects the creation, after the collapse of England, of the National Credit Corporation with a capital of $500 million in cooperation amongst American banks, which saved over 700 institutions involving the deposits of upwards of 10 millions of our people, and that was doing something.', 'The Governor entirely misrepresents the fact that the plan to meet this crisis which swept upon us from Europe was proposed by me to the political leaders of the United States at a White House conference on October 6, 1931. He ignores the fact that that plan was laid before the Congress by a message on December 8, and that it was not the creation of the Democratic leaders at the end of December, as he would imply. Although the leaders of the Democratic Party had promised 14 months before they would produce a plan, they produced no plan until they began their destructive program some months later. And not one of those acts has been disavowed by the Governor. He ignores the fact that the unprecedented measures proposed and carried through by the administration with the help of some of the Democratic colleagues in the Congress would have put us on the road to recovery 8 months ago instead of having had to await the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives only 4 months ago.', 'And again the Governor, despite every proof, keeps reiterating the implication that the measures taken by this administration have had no fruitful result to the common man. He has been told, at least by some of the men who advise him in this campaign, that the gigantic crisis with which the United States was faced was escaped by the narrowest margins and that it was due to unprecedented measures adopted by this administration. If some of these men will tell him the whole truth, they will tell him that they personally sought to buy and withdraw large sums of gold because of their belief that we could not maintain the gold reserves of the United States.', 'Would it not be well that every American citizen should take pride in the fact that America carried this Nation through this crisis safely and soundly and did it as a matter of national and united action ?', 'Why cannot the Governor of New York be frank enough to recognize the successful care of the distressed in the United States; that a vast amount of employment has been provided by cooperative action amongst our citizens; that the savings of more than 95 percent of the depositors in our banks have been held secure; that the 20 million borrowers who otherwise would have been bankrupt by destructive pressures from forced selling of their assets in order to pay their debts have been protected; that the 70 million life insurance policies which represent the greatest act of self-denial of a people in provision for the future safety of their loved ones have been sustained in their vitality; and foreclosure of hundreds of thousands of mortgages upon homes and farms has been prevented ? Those are national accomplishments for which the whole American people are proud.', 'The Governor knows that the integrity of our currency has been sustained, that the credit of the Federal Government has been maintained, that credit and employment are being expanded day by day.', 'The living proof of these measures, which were conceived from the human heart as well as the human mind, can be found in the men and women in every city, every town, every township, and every block in this broad land, for they have been saved their jobs and their homes and secured from suffering and that by the action of the American people as a whole.', 'I have stated that my major purpose this evening is to speak upon some of the continuing policies of this administration and the Republican Party in contrast with the policies of our opponents.', 'Many of these continuing policies are dealt with in our platform. I dealt with some of them in my acceptance speech. Some have developed in the course of this campaign. Having had the responsibility of this office for 30 years, my views upon most public questions are already set out in many cases in the public record and by definite public action. I do not have to engage in promises in respect to them. I may point to performance.', 'The opposition has shown its true purposes by its legislation in the last session of the Democratic House of Representatives, through their platform, and through the statements or evasions of their candidate.', 'Of these subjects I may first refer to the tariff.', 'In a recent speech, in discussing the agricultural tariffs, I pointed out the specific disaster to our farms from the Democratic proposal to reduce the protective tariff. I pointed out that the Democratic Party had, in 1913, not been content with merely lowering the tariff, but had put a large part of the farm products on the free list. I pointed out that the Republican Party had passed an emergency farm tariff bill in 1921, as soon as they had a majority in the Congress, and that a Democratic President had vetoed it. I pointed out that the Democratic minority in Congress, in 1921, had voted against the revival of the emergency farm tariff, and that the Republican majority had passed it, and a Republican President had signed it. I pointed out that the Democratic minority had voted against an increase in agricultural tariffs in the Republican tariff act of 1922. I pointed out that most of the Democratic Members of Congress voted against the bill carrying the increases in tariffs on agricultural products in the special session of Congress which I called in 1929 for that purpose on which occasion we passed the Hawley-Smoot bill.', 'In the light of this historic attitude it is but natural that our opponents express their bitter opposition to the Republican tariff. They have habitually voted against these tariffs. And now they propose in their platform a ""competitive tariff for revenue,"" and they denounce the Smoot-Haw. ley bill which is mainly devoted to the increase of farm tariffs. The Democratic candidate from the day of his nomination iterated and reiterated that he proposed to reduce the tariff. He stated that it was an unwarranted increase in the tariff.', 'During the first 7 weeks of this campaign he not only adopted the historic position of his party, but he constantly repeats their platform, and has reinforced it by repeated statements, as for instance:', '""I support the competitive tariff for revenue.""', '""The tariff law of 1932 was a drastic revision of the tariff upward in spite of the fact that the existing tariff levels were already high enough to protect American industries.""', '""We sit on the high wall of the Hawley-Smoot tariff.""', '""I condemn the Hawley-Smoot tariff.""', '""A wicked and exorbitant tariff.""', '""Sealed by the highest tariff in the history of the world.""', '""Our policy declares for lowered tariffs.""', '""A ghastly jest of the tariff.""', 'Mr. Roosevelt and his party knew that the major increases in the Hawley-Smoot act were farm tariffs when that platform was drawn, and he knew it was in effect when he made the statements that I have quoted. The evidence is complete that he and they intend to reduce the farm tariffs.', 'During the past 3 weeks I have reiterated this plain and evident purpose of their party and their candidate. Unquestionably my exposition has given their candidate great anxiety, because on the 25th of this month some 6 or 7 days ago, just 21 days after my first statement on the subject he announced another new deal. I call this a new shuffle. He now announces within 2 weeks of the election that he does not propose to reduce tariffs on farm products.', ""This is the most startling shift in position by a Presidential candidate: in the midst of a political campaign in all recent political history. What do you think Grover Cleveland or Samuel Tilden or Woodrow Wilson would have said to such a shift as that ? Does the candidate realize that he has overnight thrown overboard the great historic position of his party ? That he has rewritten the Democratic platform ? Does he realize that he must withdraw large parts of the speeches in which he has denounced this Hawley-Smoot bill as the origin of all the world's calamity?"", 'I have the privilege of informing him that 66 percent of all the duties collected on all of the imports into the United States are directly on imports of agricultural origin and the reduction of which would affect American farmers.', 'Are we to take it that all the diatribes we have heard from the Democratic orators throughout this campaign are in respect to only one-third of the American tariffs ? For just 7 days ago the Democratic candidate said, ""The Hawley-Smoot tariff law carried the decline in world trade, and what amounted to a world calamity became a general international calamity."" Since that time he must have concluded that the farm tariffs have done the world no harm.', 'You will further remember that under the tariff act two-thirds of our imports are free of duty, and now he excludes two-thirds of the remaining one-third that are dutiable. Does the Democratic Party now pretend that this terrible world calamity which we have encountered was caused by the tariffs on one-ninth of the imports into the United States ? And further, do they know--and they do know--that of this one-ninth of the imports of nonagricultural commodities less than one-half of them were increased by the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill ?', ""Now to continue our mathematical explorations a little further, I'm wondering if they pretend that this calamity was caused by increase of tariffs on one-eighteenth of the imports of the United States ? And I may pursue this mathematical course still further. Do they recognize that the whole of our imports, that is, the imports of the United States, constitute less than 12 percent of the imports of the world all taken together, and thus, in this revised view, the increased duties on one-eighteenth of one-twelfth or less than one-half of 1 percent of the world's import trade brought about this gigantic calamity by which 30 nations failed or gone to revolution."", 'Should not the Democratic candidate now at last search in the aftermath of the World War for the origins of our difficulties and stop this nonsense ?', 'I wish to extend this discussion a little further. It is desirable that the Governor may explain himself some further on other tariff questions. Does he include the reduction of the tariff on cotton textiles, so largely manufactured in the South ? I have included but a part of the textile duties in the agricultural tariffs--the tariffs on agricultural products-inasmuch as only a part of the raw cotton is dutiable. And I wonder whether he proposes to close up the Southern cotton mills?', 'In view of this new light of maintaining tariffs, I wonder if he has considered the grievous position that the oil industry might be in in the States of California, Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas, if they are left out ? Has he considered the copper industry in the States of Arizona, Montana, Michigan, and Utah? Has he considered the tariffs on metal and other products which affect the welfare of the whole of the people of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, West Virginia, and other States ? Has he considered the tariff on pottery and chemicals and its effect upon New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, California, and a lot of other States? And will he consider the tariffs on lumber and their effect on Oregon, Washington, California, and Wisconsin? If we are going to retreat from a reduction of the tariff those people ought to have some word of comfort also.', 'Perhaps if he would give the same consideration as to the effect of reducing the tariff for these other people, he will come to the same conclusion as that which he has been forced to come by this debate in respect to agriculture. Now, if political exigencies have forced this temporary conversion on agricultural products, how far is the Governor authorized to change at will the traditional policies and the platform of the Democratic Party ? How far can he guarantee to bring with him the Democratic Members of the House and the Senate who voted against the bills carrying the increases in agricultural tariffs, and how about the men who wrote that plank in the Democratic platform ? Now do you who are farmers believe in eleventh-hour conversion? Do you consider that your livelihood is safe in the hands of the traditional and the present enemy of the protective tariff ?', 'Perhaps the Governor and the whole Democratic Party will now withdraw and apologize for the defamation to which I have been subjected for the past 2 years because I called a special session of the Congress and secured an increase in agricultural tariffs.', 'Now I am, myself, taking heart over this debate. If it could be continued long enough, I believe we could drive him from every solitary position he has taken in this campaign. They are equally untenable. But even on the tariff, he perhaps remembers the dreadful experience of the chameleon on the Scotch plaid. And I can illustrate this to you.', 'As to the balance of the protective tariffs, unless this late conversion extends further than agriculture, he proposes to reduce them in the face of the fact that during the last 12 months there has been a violent change in the economy of the entire world through the depreciation of currencies in some 30 European nations and thus a lowering of their standards of living and the creation of still greater differences between the costs of production in the United States and abroad.', 'Now, the Republican Party is squarely for the protective tariff. I refuse to put the American workers and farmers into further unemployment and misery by any such action as the unrepented principles of their Members of the Democratic Congress and their platform.', ""The Governor's new shuffle, however, requires that he give some further assurances to our farmers in order to make it consistent. The Democratic House of Representatives and their allies in the Senate passed a bill directing me to call an international conference for the purpose of reducing tariffs. The Governor has supported this in his program. That means that we should surrender to foreigners the determination of a policy which we have zealously held under American control for nearly 150 years, ever since the first protective tariff was enacted under George Washington's administration. This would, in that manner, place the fate of American workers and American farmers in the hands of foreign nations, and I vetoed the bill."", 'But the point that I wish to make now is that the Governor should give to the farmers that if he calls this conference which he has assured he will do, that he will exempt agricultural tariffs from the discussion therein.', 'Further than this the Democratic Party and their candidate propose to enter upon reciprocal tariffs. That idea is not entirely new in our history, although it is a violation of what has now become a firmly fixed principle of uniform and equal treatment of all nations without preferences, concessions, or discriminations. It is just such concessions and discriminations that are producing today a large part of the frictions over tariffs in Europe. I suppose our Democratic friends blame these European tariff wars on the Hawley-Smoot bill.', 'Though reciprocal tariffs are a violation of well-established American principles, this Nation has fallen from grace at times and attempted to do this very thing. At one time 22 such treaties were negotiated for this purpose. Congress refused to confirm 16 of them; 2 of the remaining failed of confirmation by other governments; and 4 others were so immaterial as to be forgotten. On another occasion Congress conferred on the Executive a limited authority to make treaties of this character. Twenty-two of them were agreed upon, all of which were repealed by tariff acts. Now this demonstrates just one thing: that in an intelligent democracy you cannot surrender the welfare of one industry or one locality in order to gain something for another.', ""But there is an overriding objection to a reciprocal tariff upon which the Governor's new shuffle requires that he give these further assurances to the farmers. The vast majority of the wishes of foreign countries about our tariffs is to get us to reduce our farm tariffs so that they may enter our agricultural market. The only concessions that we could grant through reciprocal tariffs of any great importance would be at the cost of our farmers. Since the Governor has assured the Nation of a policy of reciprocal tariffs, he should give an assurance to the farmers that the farm tariffs will not be included and that he will abandon the whole idea of reciprocal tariffs in relation to agriculture. This, of course, takes away the whole foundation of the trading value in reciprocal tariffs. And we may as well abandon the further discussion of that in this campaign."", 'In all this discussion about reducing tariffs it should be remembered that if any one of the rates or schedules in our tariff is too high, it has been open to our opponents during the whole of the last session of the House of Representatives to pass a simple resolution and thereby secure its review by the Tariff Commission. Did they do that ? They did not.', 'The establishment of the Tariff Commission with this authority destroyed one of the campaign methods of the Democratic Party, and that was to conduct their campaigns by exhibiting kettles and pans to the housewives of the Nation and explaining what unjust cost was imposed upon them by the tariff. Now that maneuver is no longer effective, with the bipartisan Tariff Commission open to give remedy to the housewives of the United States.', 'The Democrats propose, in fact, passed a bill in the last session in the lower House, to destroy the authority of the bipartisan Tariff Commission by which it may change the tariff so as to correct inequities or to alter the schedules to meet the changing tides of an economic world. Thus, they propose to return to the old logrolling, the old orgies of greed, viciousness, and stagnation of business during general congressional action in review of the tariff.', 'The increased authority to the bipartisan Tariff Commission to make changes in the tariff with the approval of the President was brought about at my insistence, and with the sterling courage of your Senator, 2 years ago. That was the greatest reform in tariff legislation in half a century. And it originated from Theodore Roosevelt.', 'No better example of the vital importance of the flexible tariff exists than today, when we are in the crisis of men and women being thrown out of employment due to depreciated currencies abroad and of low-priced farm products moving over our borders. The commission is today reexamining the new differences in the cost of production at home and abroad that action may be taken to restore men and women to their jobs.', 'Sound public policy maintains the necessity of this Commission and its authorities. The Democratic policy is to destroy it, but perhaps the Governor of New York will offer us a new deal in this matter, also.', 'Now, related to the tariff, the Democratic candidate proposes to place the payment of the war debts owed to us by foreign countries squarely on the shoulders of the American workman and the American farmer by lowering the tariffs for this special purpose. He would let down the bars to the American market for foreign commodities to the extent necessary that foreign nations may collect from the profits of their manufactures the money with which to pay these debts. Will he now exclude the 66 percent of dutiable imports, which are farm products, from this proposal ?', 'My own view in opposition to cancellation of the war debts is a matter of public record through many public statements and messages to Congress. I have proposed that if opportunity offers we should use the foreign debts, payment by payment, to expand foreign markets for our labor and our own farmers. That is not cancellation and that is the reverse of the announced policy of the Democratic candidate.', 'At no point in this campaign have our opponents stated clearly and definitely their position on immigration. I have looked for it. I may have overlooked it. If I have I apologize. I have stated that I favor rigidly restricted immigration. I endeavored to secure from the Congress the return of the quota bases from the national origins to the base previously given. I have recommended that a more humane provision should be made for bringing in the near relatives of our citizens. I shall persist in these matters.', 'I have limited immigration by administrative order during the depression in order to relieve us of unemployment or, alternatively, to save the jobs of our people who are now at work. Two years prior to that order going into effect slightly under half a million immigrants came into the United States. Since it went into effect, more have gone out of the United States than have come in. The distressed people with lowered standards of living that would have come in would have been a far greater addition to our unemployed than even this amount. The Democratic candidate, incidentally, overlooked that little item in stating that the Republican administration had done nothing in the first 2 years and 2 months of this depression.', 'I have repeatedly recommended to the Congress a revision of our railway transportation laws in order that we might create greater stability and greater assurance in this vital service of transportation. The regulation should be extended to other forms of carriers, both to prevent the cutthroat destruction going on in their own business amongst themselves and to prevent their destruction of the other great major arm of our transportation. I have set this matter out in numerous messages to the Congress. I have supported the recommendations of the Interstate Commerce Commission, which are specific and not generalities. Our opponents have adopted my program in this matter during this campaign except for certain glittering generalizations, as to which they do not inform us how they are to be accomplished and upon which I enter a reservation.', 'I have repeatedly recommended the Federal regulation of interstate power. I stated as early as 7 years ago that ""glass pockets are the safety of the industry as well as of the public."" I secured the creation of an independent Power Commission by Congress 2 years ago under the leadership of your Senator. I have opposed and I will continue to oppose, the Federal Government going into the power business and the further extension of Federal bureaucracy.', 'The intention of many of the men at least that are campaigning for the Democratic Party and under the auspices of and with money provided by the Democratic National Committee, are certainly to put the Government into the power business, and it would seem that they must have confidence that their notions will be put over by the Democratic candidate.', 'The Democratic candidate assures us that he will preserve the great water powers of the country for the people. That is already provided by the law passed 20 years ago-passed in 1920--and it, therefore, presents no difficulty to vigorous campaign promises.', 'In my acceptance speech I stated that this depression had exposed many weaknesses in our economic system. It has shown much wrongdoing. There has been exploitation and abuse of financial power. These weaknesses must be corrected, and that wrongdoing must be punished. We will continue to reform such abuses and correct such wrongdoing as falls within the powers of the Federal Government.', 'Furthermore, the American people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system. They must have relief from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country being made available without adequate check for wholesale speculation in securities, with its ruinous consequences to millions of our citizens and to our national economy. This the Federal Reserve System by its present constitution has proven incapable of bringing about. I recommended to the Congress the sane reform of our banking laws. The Democratic House of Representatives did not see fit to pass that legislation in the last session, but we shall persist until it has been accomplished.', 'About a year ago, I recommended to the Congress an emergency relief to our depositors in closed banks that through temporary use of the credit of the Federal Government a substantial portion of their assets should be forthwith distributed in order to relieve distress and to enable depositors to reestablish their business. The Democratic Congress refused to pass such legislation in the last session, except for a minor provision of authority to the Reconstruction Corporation which does not reach to the heart of the question.', 'The Democratic candidate and his corps of orators have not yet disclosed their position on this subject. It concerns the welfare of 4 or 5 million Americans.', 'We have listened to much prattle from the opposition about reducing Government expenses. Having a record of earnest performance, I naturally exposed those insincerities in the last address which I made at Detroit.', 'My only comment on this occasion is that if I receive a mandate from the American people in this election, I shall be able not only to force upon this Democratic House real economies, but I shall be able to stop further raids by the Democratic Party on the Treasury of the United States.', 'Now, through some misinformation presented to him, the Democratic candidate has annexed, as if it were a new discovery, the recommendations which I made in 1922 and have been continuously advocating ever since for the reorganization of the whole Federal administrative structure for purposes of economy by consolidation of bureaus and the elimination of useless boards and commissions. The candidate in a speech 3 days ago was thus led to misrepresent the present situation in suggesting that I, having these powers, had not executed them. He did not realize that the Congress having no longer been able to oppose this reform, did pass a measure during the last session granting such an authority to the Executive to bring it about. They, however, denied my request for immediate action, except on minor questions, and made that authority dependent upon the approval of the Congress, which cannot be given before next March under the terms of the law. If the Democratic candidate will read the law and inform himself fully on the subject I have no doubt he will withdraw that statement.', 'I recently gave an address at Des Moines devoted largely to specific measures now in action and to be put in action for agriculture.', 'I also, likewise at Cleveland, gave an extended exposition of the measures and policies which we have in action and propose for labor and employment. I am in hopes that these statements may be carefully considered, and our time is too short this evening to go into those items in detail although I hope to take them up again in this campaign.', 'One of the most important issues of the campaign arises from the fact that the Democratic candidate has not yet disavowed the bill passed by the Democratic House of Representatives under the leadership of the Democratic candidate for Vice President to issue $2,300 million of greenback currency--that is, unconvertible paper money. That is money purporting to come from the horn of plenty but with the death\'s head engraved upon it. Tampering with the currency has become a perennial policy of the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has had to repel that many times before now. In the absence of any declaration by the Democratic candidate on this subject during 7 weeks of this campaign, no delayed promise now can efface that policy. The taint of it is firmly embedded in the Democratic Party, and the dangers are embedded in this election. If you want to know what this ""new deal"" and this sort of money does to a people, ask any of your neighbors who have relatives in Europe, especially in Germany.', ""I have stated that I do not favor the prepayment of the soldiers' bonus of $2,300 million. It was passed by the last Democratic House of Representatives. It will no doubt be attempted again. The Democratic candidate has not yet stated to the American people fairly and squarely what his attitude will be upon that subject."", 'The reasons why I do not approve of it can be illustrated by the father who in a generous moment promised his young son a bonus of $100 when he was 21 years old. That boy was led to ask his father for the $100 13 years in advance. His father said: ""Times are bad. I am hard-pressed. I have to bring up and educate a great many children, and I haven\'t the money. I am placing $5 per annum in the savings bank and as it is compounded it will amount to the $100 when you are 21 years old."" Some of his friends added that he might pay the boy in stage money.', ""Now, the moral of that story is that you cannot eat your loaf of compound interest before the dough has had time to rise. And the further political moral of that story is that it was said by the father's political opponents that his son would never vote for his father for public office."", 'There is no one in high public office who knows better than I do from personal observation the service given by the youth of this country in the Great War. I have insisted upon their care when in distress. I have expanded the services given to the veterans at the cost of much personal criticism. But with all of my regard and my feeling I cannot endanger the stability of this country in this special demand of a part of the veterans or any other special group.', 'Someone just asked the difference between this payment and the loans given by the Reconstruction Corporation. There is just this difference: One of them is a large gift from the Government and the other is loans upon security for a period of 6 months only.', 'But of one thing I will assure the veterans, and that is, when they are paid, they will be paid in real American money.', 'During the past few weeks the Democratic candidate has had a great deal to say in endeavoring to establish the idea in the minds of the American people that I am personally responsible for the bad loans by American bankers and investors to numerous foreign countries. He says: ""This is an unsavory chapter in American finance."" I agree with part of that. ""These bonds are in large part the fruit of the distressing policies pursued by the present administration in Washington. None other, if you please, than the ability of lending to backward and crippled countries."" That is the end of the quotation from him.', 'The Governor does not inform the American people that there is no Federal law regulating the sale of securities and that there is doubtful constitutional authority for such a law. And he fails to state that most of these bonds are issued from the State of New York, which sovereignty has such an authority, and where the government has done nothing of a reform to that evil, if it be one. I recollect a Republican Governor of New York who, believing that wrong was being done to the citizens of his own and other States on life insurance, found a man named Charles Evans Hughes who cleaned that mess up once and for all.', 'The Governor has not stated to the American people my oft-repeated warnings that American loans made in foreign countries should be upon sound security and confined to reproductive purposes. I have defined these loans as being the loans made for creative enterprise on which their own earnings would repay interest and capital. In one of his addresses the Governor pretends at least not to understand what a reproductive loan is, and yet, as I will show you in a moment, he does know something about it. I will say at once that when we have surplus capital, properly secured loans for reproductive purposes abroad are an advantage to the American people. They furnish work to American labor in the manufacture of plants and equipments; they furnish continuing demand for American labor in supplies and replacements. The effect of such creative enterprise is to increase the standards of living amongst the people in those localities and enable them to buy more American Products and furnish additional work for American labor.', 'I have no apologies to make for that statement. It is sound; it makes for the upbuilding of the world; it makes for employment of American workmen and profits for American investors. If it be followed there would be no losses. In these statements made by the Governor he entirely omits the conditions and warnings with which I have repeatedly surrounded the statements upon this subject and the warnings which indeed I have given broadcast over the last 7 years in respect to this type of investment. Although no Federal official has any authority to control the security offered on these loans, none of them have defaulted where the safeguards proposed by me have been followed.', ""It is obvious from the Governor's many speeches that he now considers that all foreign loans are wrong. He seems to consider the selling of foreign bonds in our country to be wicked and the cause of our calamities. And an interesting part of all this tirade is that I have never yet been engaged in the selling of foreign bonds and foreign loans. I have not been accused of that. The Governor, however, has an advantage over me in experience in that particular. As late as 1928 the Governor was engaged in that business for profit and actively occupied in promotion of such loans. At that time he was the chairman of the organization committee of the Federal International Banking Company, a corporation organized for the selling of foreign securities and bonds to the American people. I have in my hand a prospectus of that corporation in which the foreword, written by Mr. Roosevelt before he resigned that position to take the Governorship, reads as follows:"", '""The organizers of the Federal International Banking Company feel that foreign investments are in the nature of alliances ....The Federal International Banking Company will provide a new source of supply from which American demand for foreign investments may be satisfied .... It is intended to promote the expansion of American foreign trade .... Investments in the Federal International Banking are intended to be self-liquidating .... It will be put to sound protective uses a part of the surplus capital of our Nation.""', '""... its operations can be widely distributed in foreign countries and various industries.""', '""... that we must aid foreign debtors to purchase our products, rehabilitate themselves, expand and develop, and earn money with which to liquidate their debts, that foreign loans should be facilitated to aid the export sale of American products.""', ""Now I'll ask you if any more vivid statement of the policies which I have just pronounced to you was ever made than that."", 'Throughout this prospectus constant reference is made to the fact that it is organized under the law, and the impression is given that in consequence it has some sort of official blessing from the Federal Government, including quotations from myself.', ""I have no reason to believe, I do not believe, that the Governor's enterprise on this occasion was not perfectly proper and was soundly rounded. I do not wish to convey any such an impression. But the Governor as a private promoter for profit during the boom of 1928 believed and practiced what the Governor, a Presidential candidate, now denounces immoral and a cause of our calamities."", 'Two weeks ago at Cleveland I felt it was necessary to denounce certain calumnies being circulated in this campaign by the Democratic National Committee in official instructions to their campaign speakers. That committee privately acknowledged that these have not a shred of foundation, and yet they refuse to take the manly course and withdraw those statements. They have sought to maintain their continuing poison by silence.', 'I now have before me other calumnies of the Democratic National Committee, circulated in the same fashion by instructions to their campaign speakers. These instructions bristle with titles such as these-and these questions will interest American women--they are entitled:', '""How President Hoover has failed children.""', '""His real interest in the Nation\'s children may be gained by his re-corded effort to emasculate and disrupt the Children\'s Bureau.""', '""The bunk of the Home Loan Bank.""', 'Governor Roosevelt implies his endorsement of these calumnies by repeating these implications in his speeches when he speaks of what he calls ""... attempts that have been made to cut appropriations for child welfare.""', 'And again when he states that: ""the United States Public Health Service has said that over 6 million of our public school children have not enough to eat; many of them are fainting at their desks; they are the prey of disease; and their future health is menaced.""', 'In another speech he uttered a slur on the Home Loan Banking System created by this administration largely through the leadership of your Senator.', 'These things have importance only as indicating the desperate attempts to mislead the American voter. No woman in the United States believes that I am called upon to defend my interest in children over the past score of years. But more to the point of this discussion, I have a letter from the Chief of the United States Public Health Service to the effect that no such statement as that quoted by Governor Roosevelt has ever been put out by him or by that Service. Furthermore, I have an address, only a week old, by the president of the American Public Health Association, who is not a Government official, saying that ""by and large, the health oœ the people as measured in sickness and in death has never been better in the history of the United States despite this depression."" That shows the devoted work of thousands of American women and men whom his statements in this campaign sought to slur.', ""As to the Children's Bureau, I may demonstrate the untruth of that statement by the fact that the first year of my administration, despite hard times, I increased the appropriations of that Bureau from $320,000 to $368,000, which was every cent the Bureau asked for, and in the second year I recommended appropriations of $399,000, which was every cent they said they could advantageously spend, and in the third year I recommended appropriations of $395,000, but the Democratic House of Representatives reduced this by $20,000. That scarcely looks like an attempt to ruin the Children's Bureau--especially on my part."", 'In the matter of the home loan banks, the Governor states that this idea was brought out in the middle of the campaign, and, like the instructions to speakers sent out by the Democratic National Committee he makes slurs upon it. That statement falls a little to the ground in the same slough of untruth as the others when it is recollected that I rounded the Better Homes movement in the United States more than 10 years ago, whose activities in over 9,000 different communities through the devoted service of thousands of American women finally blossomed into the White House Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership more than a year ago. On that occasion I proposed and secured the backing of the men and women of the United States for the plan which ultimately resulted in the home loan banks. And that bill was drafted and presented to Congress in December last. The refusal of the Democratic House of Representatives to act prevented its passage until the last hour of the session 8 months later and then only when the pressures from the women and the men devoted to the upbuilding of the American home had become so great that they dare not defeat it in the face of this political campaign.', 'Had that bill been passed when it was introduced, nearly a year ago, the suffering and losses of thousands of small homeowners in the United States would have been prevented. I consider that that act was the greatest act yet undertaken by any government at any time on behalf of thousands of owners of small homes. It provides the machinery, through the mobilization of building and loan associations and savings bank, by which we may assure to men and women the opportunity to bring up their children in the surroundings which make for true unity and true purpose in American life.', ""Now, in conclusion, in Governor Roosevelt's address delivered on October 25, he stated:"", '""After March 4, 1929, the Republican Party was in complete control of all branches of the Government--Executive, Senate, and House, and I may add, for good measure . . . the Supreme Court as well.""', ""I invite your attention to that statement about the Supreme Court. There are many things revealed in this campaign by our opponents which should give American citizens concern for the future. One of the gravest is the state of mind revealed by my opponent in that statement. He implies that it is the function of a party in power to control the Supreme Court. For generations the Republican and Democratic Presidents alike have made it their most sacred duty to respect and maintain the independence of America's greatest tribunal. President Taft appointed a Democratic Chief Justice; President Harding mated a Democratic Justice; my last appointment was a Democrat from the State of New York whose appointment was applauded by Republicans and Democrats alike the Nation over. All appointees of the Supreme Court have been chosen solely on the basis of their character and their mental power. Not since the Civil War have the members of that Court divided on political lines."", ""Aside from the fact that the charge that the Supreme Court has been controlled by any political party is an atrocious one, there is a deeper implication in that statement. Does it disclose the Democratic candidate's conception of the functions of the Supreme Court? Does he expect the Supreme Court to be subservient to him and his party ? Does that statement express his intention by his appointments or otherwise to attempt to reduce that tribunal to an instrument of party policy and political action for sustaining such doctrines as he may bring with him ?"", 'My countrymen, I repeat to you, the fundamental issue of this campaign, the decision that will fix the national direction for a hundred years to come, is whether we shall go on in fidelity to American traditions or whether we shall turn to innovations, the spirit of which is disclosed to us by many sinister revelations and veiled promises.', 'My friends, I wish to make my position clear. I propose to go on in the faith and loyalty to the traditions of our race. I propose to build upon the foundations which our fathers have laid over this last 150 years.']"

In order to manage my job I have to get up about 6 o'clock in the morning, but I believe from the great crowds that welcome me early each morning as I pass through this State that you rise even earlier than that. The greetings that I have received in passing to and fro through West Virginia are most encouraging. You have been courteous. You have been generous, and you have given a profound indication to the country as to where you will stand on the 8th day of November."", 'A short occasion like this renders it difficult to adequately speak on national issues. There are one or two points, however, of vital importance. in this campaign to you in this city. I have seen this morning an advertisement of a New York retail establishment, in which they state that they are able to offer hosiery at prices which are demonstrated by our officials as 30 to 40 percent less than you can manufacture them in this community, and that the reason they are able to offer them at these prices is due to the depreciated currencies abroad and their ability to take advantage of that lower exchange in securing commodities in competition with your workmen.', 'And in the face of this our Democratic opponents propose to reduce the tariff as it stands. The Republican Party not only proposes to hold the tariff where it stands but through the Tariff Commission, whose authorities were created by the Republican Party in the Smoot-Hawley bill about a year ago, we propose a review of the differences in cost of production at home and abroad and determine if we are justified in an adjustment that should protect your community.', 'That inquiry is now underway. If this advertisement is true I am confident that it will show such a change in the costs of production as will make it possible to give to you relief. And I ask you whether the fate of your city and your community and your State will be more safe in the hands of the party which has fathered and for 70 years supported and strengthened the protective tariff than in the hands of the party who have always opposed these policies and who now promise a reduction of these protective tariffs.', 'Our Nation for the past 3 years has been passing through a great crisis. The early stages of the depression were more or less the normal stages of retribution from overspeculation and exploitation of our people. We have experienced them many times before and recovery has speedily followed. But about 18 months ago came a blow to the United States through the collapse of the nations abroad as an aftermath of the World War, the repercussions of which endangered this entire Republic.', 'The unprecedented action taken by the Republican Party, supported, I am glad to say, by those patriotic members of the Democratic Party who placed patriotism higher than politics, enabled the Nation to escape those dangers, have saved the Nation from chaos and collapse, and brought us into the stage of recovery. Our measures and policies have been turned from defense into measures of attack upon the depression.', 'Since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives, we have seen every day evidences of constant recovery. You will notice if you look at the business statistics of the country the increasing employment month by month. You will notice the increased car loadings which show again the increasing movement of goods. You will find in every quarter of the country the signs of recovery. And if the strategy and if the policies which have directed this great battle for the preservation of the United States and for the institutions and are now operating for recovery shall be continued without change they will bring restored prosperity to the American people. We have carried the first-line of trenches by the reestablishment of confidence in the stability of the United States. And if we can proceed with the battle without change or halt we shall win a victory for the American people that will assure their safety.', 'I wish again to express the appreciation that I have for the support and encouragement from the people of West Virginia. I believe that you will rally to the support of the Republican Party on the 8th day of November as the party of constructive action and give to us a victory which the party deserves for the service it has given over these many years to the American people.', '[2.] GRAFTON (9:55 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of the action which you will take on the 8th of November.', 'In the short moment I have here I would like to refer just one moment to the railway problems which we have faced during the past 2 or 3 years. You are interested in the success of the railways. A year and a half ago we were faced with the fact that the earnings of the railways were less than the amount necessary to meet their fixed charges. Over the trough of this depression we were faced with the possibility of receivership of three-fourths of the railways of the United States. Such a failure would jeopardize the policyholders in our insurance companies and the savings in our banks which are invested in our railways. And those of you who have had experience with a railroad in receivership know what the result is to the men who work upon those railways. You know that once the railways go out of the hands of their responsible managers, the intimate contacts of the men with the management of the railways is gone, contracts and understandings suffer. And of further importance is the fact that by supporting the railways we have been able to support them in the maintenance of a reasonable wage to the men who have to operate the railways of the United States.', 'You will recollect that early in the depression I secured an agreement between the industrial leaders, including the railway leaders and the leaders of labor, that there would be no reduction in wages. That was the first time in the history of 15 depressions in the United States that the first act of depression was not the so-called liquidation of wages--placing the first burden of the readjustment of the depression on the back of the workers. As time went on and the depression deepened, the cost of living decreased, profits vanished, and there were readjustments in wages, but those readjustments represented the contribution of the men to the stability of their own industry. They were not by the violence of strikes and lockouts and social disturbances and destruction to the whole social stability of the United States. They were your voluntary contribution to your own order.', 'We have gone further. We have immediately provided advances to the railways to enable them to repair equipment, to replace their equipment in order that with the gradual resumption of traffics they shall be able to meet that demand, and thus increase and maintain employment.', 'You know and I know that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives these great measures that we have in action for rehabilitation of the country have begun to have their effect. We have witnessed increase of car loadings from about 490,000 cars a week to over 650,000 a week. This means the recovery of the United States, and it means the recovery of employment to the railway workers.', 'And this is but one segment of the great program and the great problems that are involved in the rehabilitation of our country. There are many others affecting different communities, but everywhere they have begun to have their effect and we have begun to see their results. This is no time, when we are in the midst of the most gigantic battle that our country has ever been plunged into in time of peace, to change that strategy or the policies of battle.', '[ 3. ] PIEDMONT ( 12: 10 p.m. )', 'My friends:', 'I wish to express my appreciation for this greeting. It gives me an opportunity to see some of the people of West Virginia. It gives you an opportunity to look at me. But it is very encouraging to have you come to the station and give me this welcome. It is an evidence of what you will do on the 8th of November, for it means the support and encouragement of this administration in its work for restoration of employment and agriculture in the United States. We have already made progress on that road. We are making more rapid progress every day.', 'But this is not a time to discuss national issues.

You know that we have now turned the forces and agencies in our control towards restoration of employment and the restoration of agriculture. You have seen during the past few months evidence of recovery from these difficulties. They are evidence that the Republican Party has conducted the country wisely; that it has met the Nation's difficulties with courage; that it has devised the means and methods by which our people have been protected and by which they shall continue to make progress to recovery."", 'I wish to express again my appreciation for your coming. It is a great encouragement. It gives me a great hope and a great faith in the battle which we are carrying on.', '[5.] MARTINSBURG (2:15 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I wish to express my gratitude this time for two things: first, for the basket of apples. They are always gratefully received from Martinsburg. And second, I want to express my appreciation for your coming to greet me. It is always an encouragement. It is always helpful, and besides that it is a sign as to what will happen in Martinsburg on the 8th day of November.', 'I have thought the people of Martinsburg might be interested if I was to read an advertisement. Sometimes we resent reading advertisements, but here happens to be one of peculiar interest to the people of Martinsburg. This advertisement in a New York paper, refers to wool hose. It states that 8,000 pairs of these snug fitting, ribbed, soft English hose have been purchased abroad at the low wool and sterling prices because of the depreciation on that currency. And they are offered for sale at 39 cents a pair. I am informed that even at the reduced wages--and I understand there have been two or three reductions in wages in your factory in Martinsburg--but even at this reduced wage you cannot manufacture those hose for less than 50 cents a pair.', 'This raises a great question--a question that is an issue in this campaign. The Republican Party stands for the protective tariff. Our Democratic opponents propose to reduce the tariff, and they propose to reduce it in the face of these depreciated foreign currencies, in the face of the fact that living and wages have been decreased abroad as the result of the depreciation of those currencies below the standards of the tariff when that act was passed. Today at reduced wages, the people in Martinsburg are losing employment and suffering reductions of wages.', 'I recently asked the Tariff Commission, a bipartisan body, to investigate the differences of cost of production between those of Martinsburg and those of the places in England where these hose are produced, and to determine whether or not under the flexible provisions of the tariff some relief could be given to the people of Martinsburg.', 'The Democratic Party proposes as one of the issues in this campaign that it will take from that Commission the authority under which such acts could be performed.', 'I want to leave these thoughts with you that here is a town where the well-being of your homes, where the satisfactions and comforts of your life, are today and will be further jeopardized by the transfer of the power of the Government of the United States to the Democratic Party on the 8th day of next November. Do you think things cannot be worse ?', 'You will all realize that we have gone through a time of great difficulty. For the last 3 years we have been fighting with forces such as we have never before met in peacetime history of the United States. They have accumulated in strength and in volume at one time to a point where it appeared that we could scarcely save our country from chaos and degeneration. We did, however, through the courage of the American people, through the cooperation of the united action of the whole of the country, and the leadership of the Republican Party, get by and save ourselves from collapse. And we have now turned those agencies and those policies to the problem of recovery in the United States, and those of you who are familiar with the events of the last 4 months will realize that we are moving on that road to recovery.', ""As a final word, I wish to say that we cannot recover if you are going to lose the work of your factories, as is indicated by this advertisement in yesterday's papers."", 'I thank you.']"
12,Herbert Hoover ,"October 31, 1932","['[1. ] BALTIMORE, MARYLAND (Mount Royal Railroad Station, 11:30 a.m.)', 'My friends in Baltimore:', 'It is always difficult for me to formulate the expression of appreciation that I feel for so heartening a greeting and so courteous and generous a reception as you have given me this morning. I do feel that it is an indication of the action which the State of Maryland will take on the 8th day of November.', 'It has been my opportunity and pleasure during the past years of public service to visit practically every part of the State of Maryland. I have visited it particularly in search of those landmarks in the history of our whole country from the days of the first landings on our coast, in which this State is so rich. I deem it an honor to have had a great-grandfather who lived for the span of a generation at Union Bridge in Frederick County of this State. Every imprint of the development of American national life is to be found in the State of Maryland.', 'Because the time is short on this occasion, I must limit myself to a statement of a few of the wide differences of policies which have developed between the Republican and the Democratic Parties during this campaign. With the important concern you of this city have in the issues in this campaign there is no better place to point out the effect which the course you may choose on the 8th of November will have upon the future of your own welfare.', 'A few days ago in this city the Democratic candidate made a statement in respect to the Supreme Court which must be the negation of the sentiment, the feeling, and the resolution of the people of the State that produced Chief Justice Taney 1 and other honored members who have helped to make the long history of the Supreme Court of the United States. While the Constitution was actually brought into being in a neighboring State, yet every schoolchild in Maryland knows that it was the preliminary meeting at Annapolis from which the Constitution was born. And every student of history knows, and every person in the modern world knows, that Maryland has maintained a peculiar fidelity to the Constitution, and that it surely would not be the will of the people of Maryland that the independence of this great tribunal shall be undermined or brought into question for political party purposes, whether they be Democratic or Republican. It is the genius of our form of government that the independence of the Supreme Court stands unique in all the governments of the world and is the strongest bulwark of the permanence of our democracy.', 'Of other matters for which Maryland has always stood constantly from her beginning, I might mention the protective tariff. Lately at Cumberland, I recalled that the first petition lodged with the Congress which had just convened under the Constitution was a petition signed by merchants and manufacturers and the workers, chiefly of the city of Baltimore, requesting a protective tariff in order that they might have industrial freedom as well as political freedom from Europe. That was the first petition acted upon by the Congress of the United States. Thus the first piece of legislation signed by George Washington as President under the newly formulated Constitution was a protective tariff measure passed in response to a petition from the State of Maryland. From that day to this your varied industries have grown and thrived under protective tariffs. They have wilted and shriveled whenever that tariff has been lowered or when those protections have been abandoned. The livelihood of your workmen are peculiarly dependent upon it. Your agriculture is in particular danger from lowering of these tariffs because you are situated close to the seaboard and close to the point of attack of foreign imports. At this precise moment there is scarcely an agricultural or industrial product in your State that could not, under the depreciated currencies of Europe and South America, be brought to your doors at from 25 to 40 percent below the prices you at present realize, depressed as they may be. The taking off of that tariff must mean a lowering of wages and a lowering of standards of living in the State of Maryland.', 'The Democratic Party proposed to reduce this tariff. It proposes not only to reduce it generally, but it proposes to negotiate reciprocal tariffs, which can mean but one thing and that is to negotiate away the tariffs in favor of the import of some variety of goods. That is the reason why Maryland, except on a few occasions during the last 40 years has been Republican in national elections and has realized that the fundamental interest of the State lay with the party which has stood staunchly for the protective tariff ever since that party was born. There has never been an hour when it was more necessary that Maryland maintain that vigilant attitude as to the tariff as the one which now threatens us.', 'Another of the policies upon which the State of Maryland has stood staunchly since the beginning is a sound and stable currency. This is an added reason why the State of Maryland has so often supported the Republican Party in national elections. It is because it has been the party of sound and stable money. We have had within the last 5 months the passage of an act of Congress by a Democratic House of Representatives to issue $2,300 million of greenback currency--one of the most glaring attempts to violate the stability and sacred character of currency of a people that we have seen in our country since the days of the Civil War when it was issued only in complete desperation and paid for by a price of a thousand sufferings in the years which followed. The Vice-Presidential candidate in this campaign fathered this measure, and the Democratic candidate or any other speaker in this campaign has not seen fit to disavow it.', 'In view of the attitude which the State of Maryland has always taken in the support of stable currency, I should like to repeat to you the most prophetic statement of an American statesman--Daniel Webster. One hundred years ago, he said:', '""He who tampers with the currency robs labor of its bread. He panders, indeed, to greedy capital, which is keen-sighted and may shift for itself, but he beggars labor, which is unsuspecting and too busy with the present to calculate for the future. The prosperity of the workpeople lives, moves and has its being in established credit and steady medium of payment.', 'This has been a State given to economy in public expenditure, and this last session of the Democratic House of Representatives passed measures calling for an expenditure of 3 1/2 billion, or an increase in Federal expenditures by over 80 percent in the face of the tremendous difficulties of our taxpayers and of the Federal Treasury. These efforts were stopped, but the House refused to accept recommendations of the administration for decreases in expenditure. It forced increased expenditure upon the Government. It is not now the party of economy in conduct of public affairs.', 'The Republican Party stands today as the safeguard against a series of measures which would drive this country from the foundations which 150 years of constructive building by our own fathers has wrought. In a peculiar way the State of Maryland has stood for the maintenance of these traditions, for the upholding of progress based upon these views; it has never departed from them. Both the interest and the sentiment of this State can find its satisfaction and its expression alone in a national Republican administration.', '[2.] NEWARK, DELAWARE (Rear platform, 1:10 p.m.)', 'I deeply appreciate such a greeting as you have given to me. It is most encouraging, and it is heartening. And it is an indication of how you are going to act on the 8th of November.', 'I have one thing in common with many of you in this audience, and that is that I have lived all my life and made my home in a college town. I have lived with a college and helped to nurture that college, and I have appreciation of the problems not only of colleges but of students.', 'I have been very much interested in the past few days to have been sent a poll of the students of a large number of the colleges in the United States, showing that they are overwhelmingly for the support of the Republican ticket. That is because our institutions are pledged to the upbuilding of the United States upon its historical foundations and not for tearing down those foundations in order to win elections.', 'Now, I appreciate your coming and the greeting you have given to me, and I can only add thanks to you.', '[3.] WILMINGTON, DELAWARE (Rear platform, 1:30 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is difficult to find words to express the appreciation that I feel and the gratitude that I feel for so courteous and so enthusiastic a reception. It is a fine augury of what Delaware will do on the 8th of November.', 'This is not an occasion on which one can discuss national issues at such length as you deserve. I am speaking in New York tonight. Through the magic of the radio many of you will be able to listen in, and I hope you will like what I shall say.', 'We have been passing through a great crisis during this last 3 years. The major part of our difficulties has come upon us from abroad. They were not the doing of the American people. We have set up for the American people, by a Republican administration, great protective measures which have saved this country from 20 years of chaos and destruction which otherwise would have ensued, and we have now turned those measures towards recovery. We have carried the first trenches in that great battle.', 'The indications of the gradual improvement of the country are coming in from all sides. This morning I am informed that our Government agencies state that over a million men have returned to work since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Congress. If that battle can go on without change of strategy and without change of policy and without halting, this country will recover its employment and will recover in its agriculture.', 'Now, there is one of our Republican policies which is of the most vital importance to the people of Delaware, and that is the maintenance of the protective tariff. Our Democratic opponents propose to reduce that tariff, and they propose to reduce it in the face of the fact that during the last 14 months the collapse of foreign nations abroad brought about an enormous depreciation in their currency and a tremendous reduction in their wages and standards of living, to a point where the difference between the purchasing power of American wages and those of our competitors have been enormously widened. The real problem before the American people today is not the reduction of the tariff but to reconsider whether our tariff is high enough at this moment to protect you in your employment and in your living. Our Democratic opponents have proposed some measures in respect to this emergency. One of them is a proposal to inflate the currency of the United States by issuing unconvertible greenback money. That idea is not new in the Democratic Party every time the Nation falls into distress. The Republican Party has had to meet it before, and it has had to meet it in this election and in the last session of Congress.', 'I would like to be able to take the time to explain to you what inflation-the issuance of paper money--means to the man who works at the bench and who works in the field. It is a subtle destruction of his living. It serves no one except the greedy. It is one of the most vital things before the American people at this moment. A sound currency and a stable currency is the very beginning and the very end of sustained wages and sustained prices.', 'Now, I could go on with a number of our other issues, but I will not take your time. I can assure you that the Republican Party stands for the maintenance of these great principles of a protective tariff. It stands for sane and rigid economy in government. It stands for sound currency. It stands for stability in the finance of the Federal Government. It stands for measures that will care for distress pending the working out of these gigantic instrumentalities which we have established for the restoration of the country. I cannot find that our Democratic opponents have been able to meet these issues fairly and frankly.', 'Thank you.', '[4.] CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA (Rear platform, 1:52 p.m.)', 'My friends:', ""I deeply appreciate your greeting this morning. Some of you, I am told, have come a long distance. You must rise early in this part of the United States because I get up at 6 o'clock, and some of you must have gotten up before that. Your greeting this morning is encouraging. It is sustaining in a great right. It is an indication of where the State of Pennsylvania is going to be on the 8th day of November."", 'This is not an occasion when one can discuss at any length or with any adequacy our greater national issues. I am speaking tonight in New York. Through the magic of the radio many of you will be able to listen in, and I hope you will be interested.', ""There is one matter which is of importance in every manufacturing city of the United States, and that is the maintenance of the protective tariff. Our opponents are proposing to reduce that tariff to a competitive basis. I recently had a survey made as to the purchasing power of wages in the countries with which you have to compete. We reduced it to a common denominator of bread and butter, and we found that there was no country at the present moment where the rate of wages in that country would buy more than one-third of the amount of bread and butter that could be bought in Pennsylvania from your wages. And that has been due to a large extent to the reductions, the discounts, and the depreciation in currencies that have taken place by the collapse of the financial systems of those governments during the past 18 months. The problem is not so much the reduction of the tariff today as it is not only the maintenance of it but an inquiry into whether or not the tariff in the face of these depreciated currencies is adequately protecting you. That is a matter which the Republican Party is confronting and a problem which the Democratic Party is concerned with as to how much they don't say about the reduction of the tariff and still obtain your votes."", 'I want to express my appreciation to you for coming to this station, for the tremendous greeting which you have given to me on entering the State of Pennsylvania. None of us have any doubt about the action of this State. It has been the staunch supporter of the Republican Party from the very day it was born, and I have no lack of confidence as to its continuance.', 'I thank you.', '[5.] PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA (City Hall, 2:30 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is hard for me to find words of appreciation for such a greeting and such a reception as you are giving me at this moment.', 'I have a great deal of pleasure in coming into the great Common. wealth founded by William Penn, and to the city laid out and established by him as the seat of its government. If public business had permitted, I should have been particularly pleased to have accepted the invitation to be here last week to participate in the celebration of the 250th anniversary of the memorable day on which he first set foot on this soil. His noble contribution to civil and religious liberty is without parallel in the histories of the world.', 'In the certainty and the amplitude of the international political philosophy of his ""Essay Toward the Present and Future Peace of Europe,"" he was two centuries ahead of his time. How appropriate to his theories of government, as he applied them in practice, are the words of the Liberty Bell, first put in place in the statehouse tower 179 years. ago, ""Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof."" I could have participated in that celebration with personal sentiment because it was his faith and the proclamation of his principles of liberty that led my first American ancestor to land in this city just 46 years after Penn first established this Commonwealth.', 'I also have pleasure in coming today because your kind invitation stated that I should not be expected to make a political speech. I expressed my genuine appreciation of that gracious and generous condition and interpreted it, as your committee states that it should be interpreted, that the great majority of the voters of this Commonwealth were determined that her electoral votes should be cast for the Republican ticket.', 'Your city shares with the Nation her great historic heritage, long the scene of the proprietary government of Pennsylvania; the meeting place of the early Continental Congress where the Declaration of Independence was signed and given to the world; where the Constitution was framed; the early seat of the National Government. Very properly have such events made Philadelphia a shrine of American freedom.', ""If there were time, I might at this point remind you at some length that it was in this city, on June 17, 1856, on the anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill, that the first Republican National Convention met. It is a privilege to have contact 'with the earliest springs of American traditions and strong spiritual fortresses of American institutions at a time when those traditions and institutions are boldly threatened. But I must pass on."", 'I know that the fame and the greatness of this city and of this Commonwealth depend not alone on their early history. The people of this State were pioneers in the construction and development of systems of transportation by canal and by rail; over these the products of her abundant natural resources reached the markets. A great industrial commonwealth inevitably resulted. It is to be noted, too, that this growth has been continuous and the progress steady. So long as the destinies of government, of society, and of industry in this Commonwealth remain in the control and management of high character, as in the past, her historic bell will indeed proclaim liberty throughout the world.', '[6.] TRENTON, NEW JEREY (Rear platform, 3:33 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate the courtesy and the generosity of your greeting. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of what New Jersey intends to do on November 8.', 'These short stops give too little opportunity to discuss our national issues. I am speaking in New York tonight. With the magic of the radio, I hope you will be able to listen on that occasion.', 'Now, there is one issue that I would like to impress on you. You are a great pottery city, and today the depreciation in foreign currencies is such that the protection given to your potteries by the Republican Party is in jeopardy, and yet our Democratic opponents propose to reduce that tariff in the face of that jeopardy. We are having an inquiry and an examination as to prices by the Tariff Commission to see whether or not relief can be given to you. But if on November 8 a party is to come in power which is to reduce your tariff, it is a reduction of your wages and your standard of living, and it may as well be stated in those plain terms.', 'During the last 3 years, our Nation has been involved in a great crisis. The larger part of that crisis has flowed over our borders from abroad. We have met it with courage. Our people have met it with fortitude. The Republican administration has initiated such measures as have saved our country from infinite chaos.', 'I am informed by the Government agencies this morning that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives there has been an increase of nearly a million of men taken into employment in the United States. It is important to you to consider whether or not you shall continue those measures and those policies or whether you will have this battle halted in its midst by a delay of at least 4 months while its command is reformulated, a delay of a year while a new session of Congress is called for the purpose of reconstructing the policies which are to guide this Nation towards recovery.', 'I thank you.']"
13,Herbert Hoover ,"October 31, 1932","['My dear friends in Newark:', 'I well remember the reception which you gave to me 4 years ago, and no man has the eloquence or could find words sufficient to express appreciation of this reception from my friends in this city. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is evidence of the support which Newark will give on the 8th day of November.', 'I could not wish to pass so near the home of my great friend, former Senator Dwight Morrow of this State, without paying a tribute to his memory. The loss to the Nation of his single-minded, farseeing statesmanship, at the very hour when new emergencies disturbed the country, was one of the severest losses that could have come to our Nation. He was my great friend. His death was a personal loss to me as a friend, and a greater loss to me in my public duties because of his rare talent and his unique ability to find that common ground for action through which we must find national solutions. His service as Ambassador to Mexico, his splendid development of friendly relations with our sister republic to the south, his part in the Naval Conference, and above all his distinguished service in the Senate, to which you honored him, gave assurance of a most important contribution to American life. Senator Morrow was an unusual man. With a mind of intensity and clarity quite unique, a restless energy for service, and a simple directness in his search for truth which he never feared to express, he gained the confidence of his fellow men throughout the world to a degree seldom equaled by any individual. He set an example of high character to all in private and public life. Perhaps nothing that he did was as important to his country as what he was.', 'I have but a few moments to be with you. I am making an extended address at New York in a few hours which through the magic of the radio will be available to many of you. This meeting presents an opportunity, however, in which to emphasize one or two of the most fundamental things that face our country and the State of New Jersey to a unique degree. Our opponents have stated that they will call a special session of the Congress. They have stated that they will, perhaps, reduce the tariffs. There is no State in the Union, the maintenance of the welfare of whose workers, farmers, and manufacturers is more dependent upon the continuance of the Republican protective tariff than is the State of New Jersey. The Democratic platform, candidates, and speakers assert that they wish to reduce it to a competitive basis for revenue.', 'It happens that in this city 4 years ago, I spoke on this very question. At that time I presented to you a table, using as common denominator the amount of bread and butter which could be purchased in each of the principal countries by the wages of different groups of workers. I have had those countries resurveyed, that I might have this table reprepared to present to you. I will hand these two tables to the press of your city. If you will study them, you will find that the differences between your standard of living today and those of foreign countries have been more greatly widened than they were 4 years ago. That additional widening has been due largely to the depreciation of currencies of foreign countries by the collapse of one nation after another during the past 18 months. It raises an entirely new problem in the maintenance of the protective tariff. You will find if you inspect these tables that whereas 4 years ago the weekly wages of the workers of different groups were equal to purchase an amount of that useful mixture of bread and butter--in the country which most nearly approached us--they were able to purchase rather more than one-half as much as could be purchased at your rate of wages. You will find that that has diminished to less than one-third of what you can purchase, and that in some countries they can purchase only one-eighth of the amount whichyou can purchase from your weekly wage.', 'Thus, we face a new problem in your protection brought upon us by the collapse of foreign countries with which we have had nothing to do. And yet the Democratic Party proposes, in the face of this, to reduce your tariff protection, and the Democratic candidate has pledged himself to a special session of Congress in which through him this pledge will be introduced, and through which, if the Government is entrusted to them, beginning with the 8th day of November the whole business fabric of your community must stagnate until that question is determined. They further propose to call an international convention in which tariffs are to be lowered by international action which must take the nature of trading. In other words, the determination of your future and that of our other States is to be participated in by nations whose only ambition is to secure our market. Again there must be a prolonged disturbance to business and to progress. Further than this, they propose reciprocal tariffs. Reciprocal tariff can mean only one thing, and that is that the tariffs on certain industrial products from certain localities must be lowered in exchange for some hypothetical value to some other community. In other words, the question of the fate of your community is to be held in the balance. That threatens continuous revision and a continuous disturbance.', 'On the other hand, we have builded up an authority in the bipartisan Tariff Commission, whose obligation is to examine the tariffs on different articles and different schedules from time to time to see whether there is maintained a proper margin between the cost of production at home and abroad. They propose to destroy this agency and transfer the determination of tariffs to logrolling and vicious greed which exhibits itself always in action in the Halls of Congress. Today, that Commission is reexamining the protective duties to determine whether we can offer relief to your pottery and other industries.', 'And I would call your attention to another matter of vast importance to all of you. We have passed, in the last 3 years, through a national crisis greater in its effect than many of the wars in which we have been involved. That crisis arose out of the inability of European nations to longer stand the ravages and the undermining of the aftermath of the Great War. The Republican administration has built up a series of unprecedented measures through which we have warded off disaster and chaos which would have spread to our country. We have turned these agencies to the problem of reconstruction and recovery.', 'During the past few months, since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives and their destructive action, we have begun to see positive and practical results through the return of men to work, through the increase of prices, through increased car loadings, and in many other fundamental indications of recovery in our national life. We are in the midst of a great economic battle. We have carried the first-line trenches. Any hesitation, any halting of the battle for changes of policies cannot do otherwise than to stagnate progress and bring disaster to the fireside of every home in this State, indeed in this country.', 'There are many other subjects which I could discuss with you if time permitted, that are of equal importance to you. I will mention only one more, and that is the proposal of the Democratic Party which has always been their proposal in time of economic disturbance, and that is to tinker with the currency. They passed a bill in the last session of the Congress to issue $2,300 million of unconvertible paper currency, which is the old greenback come again. They threatened to do this despite all the lessons of history in the earlier years in this country and abroad in recent years. Anyone who wishes to know what the effect of such action can be upon the welfare of every man and woman in this country have only to ask what the experience has been in the European countries that have tried this experiment since the Great War. More particularly, you are asked to inquire of your friends who are familiar with the results of it in Germany.', 'The Republican Party has had over all these years to fight staunchly for the protective tariff, the maintenance of the stability of our currency, the soundness of Federal credit, true economy in Government, to hold for the independence of our institutions, to insist that the future of the United States can be built up on the experience and foundations laid by our forefathers over 150 years.', 'The commercial and industrial history of this city has been built upon the attributes of the Republican Party--the protective tariff, sound money, maintenance of governmental credit, the conduct of government with sane economy. And above all to sustain the principles under which this country has grown to the greatest Nation in the world. We propose to maintain and advance that development, of which you are so justly proud. Whether it shall be maintained and advanced depends upon the votes you will cast a week from tomorrow.']"
14,Herbert Hoover ,"October 31, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'No man has ever had a more gracious introduction from a more noble woman than Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt.', 'This campaign is more than a contest between two men. It is more than a contest between two parties. It is a contest between two philosophies of government.', 'We are told by the opposition that we must have a change, that we must have a new deal. It is not the change that comes from normal development of national life to which I object or you object, but the proposal to alter the whole foundations of our national life which have been builded through generations of testing and struggle, and of the principles upon which we have made this Nation. The expressions of our opponents must refer to important changes in our economic and social system and our system of government; otherwise they would be nothing but vacuous words. And I realize that in this time of distress many of our people are asking whether our social and economic system is incapable of that great primary function of providing security and comfort of life to all of the firesides of 25 million homes in America, whether our social system provides for the fundamental development and progress of our people, and whether our form of government is capable of originating and sustaining that security and progress.', 'This question is the basis upon which our opponents are appealing to the people in their fear and their distress. They are proposing changes and so-called new deals which would destroy the very foundations of the American system of life.', 'Our people should consider the primary facts before they come to the judgment--not merely through political agitation, the glitter of promise, and the discouragement of temporary hardships--whether they will support changes which radically affect the whole system which has been builded during these six generations of the toil of our fathers. They should not approach the question in the despair with which our opponents would clothe it.', 'Our economic system has received abnormal shocks during the last 3 years which have temporarily dislocated its normal functioning. These shocks have in a large sense come from without our borders, and I say to you that our system of government has enabled us to take such strong action as to prevent the disaster which would otherwise have come to this Nation. It has enabled us further to develop measures and programs which are now demonstrating their ability to bring about restoration and progress.', 'We must go deeper than platitudes and emotional appeals of the public platform in the campaign if we will penetrate to the full significance of the changes which our opponents are attempting to float upon the wave of distress and discontent from the difficulties through which we have passed. We can find what our opponents would do after searching the record of their appeals to discontent, to group and sectional interest. To find that, we must search for them in the legislative acts which they sponsored and passed in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in the last session of Congress. We must look into both the measures for which they voted and in which they were defeated. We must inquire. whether or not the Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates have disavowed those acts. If they have not, we must conclude that they form a portion and are a substantial indication of the profound changes in the new deal which is proposed.', 'And we must look still further than this as to what revolutionary changes have been proposed by the candidates themselves.', 'We must look into the type of leaders who are campaigning for the Democratic ticket, whose philosophies have been well known all their lives and whose demands for a change in the American system are frank and forceful. I can respect the sincerity of these men in their desire to change our form of government and our social and our economic system, though I shall do my best tonight to prove they are wrong. I refer particularly to Senator Norris, Senator La Follette, Senator Cutting, Senator Huey Long, Senator Wheeler, William Randolph Hearst, and other exponents of a social philosophy different from the traditional philosophies of the American people. Unless these men have felt assurance of support to their ideas they certainly would not be supporting these candidates and the Democratic Party. The zeal of these men indicates that they must have some sure confidence that they will have a voice in the administration of this Government.', 'I may say at once that the changes proposed from all these Democratic principals and their allies are of the most profound and penetrating character. If they are brought about, this will not be the America which we have known in the past.', 'Now, I may pause for a moment and examine the American system of government and of social and economic life which it is now proposed that we should alter. Our system is the product of our race and of our experience in building a Nation to heights unparalleled in the whole history of the world. It is a system peculiar to the American people. It differs essentially from all others in the world. It is an American system. It is rounded on the conception that only through ordered liberty, through freedom to the individual, and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise be summoned to spur the march of national progress.', 'It is by the maintenance of an equality of opportunity and therefore of a society absolutely fluid in the movement of its human particles that our individualism departs from the individualism of Europe. We resent class distinction because there can be no rise for the individual through the frozen strata of classes, and no stratification of classes can take place in a mass that is livened by the free rise of its human particles. Thus in our ideals the able and ambitious are able to rise constantly from the bottom to leadership in the community. We denounce any attempt to stir class feeling or class antagonisms in the United States.', 'This freedom of the individual creates of itself the necessity and the cheerful willingness of men to act cooperatively in a thousand ways and for every purpose as the occasion requires, and it permits such voluntary cooperations to be dissolved as soon as it has served its purpose and to be replaced by new voluntary associations for new purposes.', 'There has thus grown within us, to gigantic importance, a new conception. That is the conception of voluntary cooperation within the community; cooperation to perfect the social organizations; cooperation for the care of those in distress; cooperation for the advancement of knowledge, of scientific research, of education; cooperative action in a thousand directions for the advancement of economic life. This is self-government by the people outside of the Government. It is the most powerful development of individual freedom and equality of opportunity that has taken place in the century and a half since our fundamental institutions were founded.', 'It is in the further development of this cooperation and in a sense of its responsibility that we should find solution for many of the complex problems, and not by the extension of the Government into our economic and social life. The greatest function a government can perform is to build up that cooperation, and its most resolute action should be to deny the extension of bureaucracy. We have developed great agencies of cooperation by the assistance of the Government which do promote and protect the interests of individuals and the smaller units of business: the Federal Reserve System, in its strengthening and support of the smaller banks; the Farm Board, in its strengthening and support of the farm cooperatives; the home loan banks, in the mobilizing of building and loan associations and savings banks; the Federal land banks, in giving independence and strength to land mortgage associations; the great mobilization of relief to distress, the mobilization of business and industry in measures of recovery from this depression, and a score of other activities that are not socialism, and they are not the Government in business. They are the essence of protection to the development of free men. I wish to explore this point a little further. The primary conception of this whole American system is not the ordering of men but the cooperation of free men. It is rounded upon the conception of responsibility of the individual to the community, of the responsibility of local government to the State, of the State to the National Government.', 'I am exploring these questions because I propose to take up definite proposals of the opposition and test them with these realities in a few moments.', 'Now, our American system is rounded on a peculiar conception of self-government designed to maintain an equality of opportunity to the individual, and through decentralization it brings about and maintains these responsibilities. The centralization of government will undermine these responsibilities and will destroy the system itself.', ""Our Government differs from all 'previous conceptions, not only in the decentralization but also in the independence of the judicial arm of the Government."", 'Our Government is rounded on a conception that in times of great emergency, when forces are running beyond the control of individuals or cooperative action, beyond the control of local communities or the States, then the great reserve powers of the Federal Government should be brought into action to protect the people. But when these forces have ceased there must be a return to State, local, and individual responsibility.', 'The implacable march of scientific discovery with its train of new inventions presents every year new problems to government and new problems to the social order. Questions often arise whether, in the face of the growth of these new and gigantic tools, democracy can remain master in its own house and can preserve the fundamentals of our American system. I contend that it can, and I contend that this American system of our has demonstrated its validity and superiority over any system yet invented by human mind. It has demonstrated it in the face of the greatest test of peacetime history--that is the emergency which we have passed in the last 3 years.', 'When the political and economic weakness of many nations of Europe, the result of the World War and its aftermath, finally culminated in the collapse of their institutions, the delicate adjustments of our economic and social and governmental life received a shock unparalleled in our history. No one knows that better than you of New York. No one knows its causes better than you. That the crisis was so great that many of the leading banks sought directly or indirectly to convert their assets into gold or its equivalent with the result that they practically ceased to function as credit institutions is known to you; that many of our citizens sought flight for their capital to other countries; that many of them attempted to hoard gold in large amounts you know. These were but superficial indications of the flight of confidence and the belief that our Government could not overcome these forces.', 'Yet these forces were overcome--perhaps by narrow margins--and this demonstrates that our form of government has the capacity. It demonstrates what the courage of a nation can accomplish under the resolute leadership of the Republican Party. And I say the Republican Party because our opponents, before and during the crisis, proposed no constructive program, though some of their members patriotically supported ours for which they deserve on every occasion the applause of patriotism. Later on in the critical period, the Democratic House of Representatives did develop the real thought and ideas of the Democratic Party. They were so destructive that they had to be defeated. They did delay the healing of our wounds for months.', 'Now, in spite of all these obstructions we did succeed. Our form of government did prove itself equal to the task. We saved this Nation from a generation of chaos and degeneration; we preserved the savings, the insurance policies, gave a fighting chance to men to hold their homes. We saved the integrity of our Government and the honesty of the American dollar. And we installed measures which today are bringing back recovery. Employment, agriculture, and business--all of these show the steady, if slow, healing of an enormous wound.', 'As I left Washington, our Government departments communicated to me the fact that the October statistics on employment show that since the 1st day of July, the men returned to work in the United States exceed 1 million.', 'I therefore contend that the problem of today is to continue these measures and policies to restore the American system to its normal functioning, to repair the wounds it has received, to correct the weaknesses and evils which would defeat that system. To enter upon a series of deep changes now, to embark upon this inchoate new deal which has been propounded in this campaign would not only undermine and destroy our American system but it will delay for months and years the possibility of recovery.', 'We have carried the first-line of trenches in a great national battle. It is of little difference who the commander in chief may be if the strategy and the policies and the subordinate captains and majors and colonels and generals are maintained and if the battle be continued. But that battle cannot be continued under our political system with a 4-month lapse between the election and the inauguration and a 12 month lapse thereafter while new strategies and new policies are being determined, no matter how admirable they may be.', 'Now, to go back to my major thesis--the thesis of the longer view. Before we enter into courses of deep-seated change and of the new deal, I would like you to consider what the results of this American system have been during the last 30 years--that is, a single generation. For if it can be demonstrated that by this means, our unequaled political, social, and economic system, we have secured a lift in the standards of living and the diffusion of comfort and hope to men and women, the growth of equality of opportunity, the widening of all opportunity such as had never been seen in the history of the world, then we should not tamper with it and destroy it, but on the contrary we should restore it and, by its gradual improvement and perfection, foster it into new performance for our country and for our children.', ""Now, if we look back over the last generation we find that the number of our families and, therefore, our homes, has increased from about 16 to about 25 million, or 62 percent. In that time we have builded for them 15 million new and better homes. We have equipped 20 million out of these 25 million homes with electricity; thereby we have lifted infinite drudgery from women and men. The barriers of time and space have been swept away in this single generation. Life has been made freer, the intellectual vision of every individual has been expanded by the installation of 20 million telephones, 12 million radios, and the service of 20 million automobiles. Our cities have been made magnificent with beautiful buildings, parks, and playgrounds. Our countryside has been knit together with splendid roads. We have increased by 12 times the use of electrical power and thereby taken sweat from the backs of men. In the broad sweep real wages and purchasing power of men and women have steadily increased. New comforts have steadily come to them. The hours of labor have decreased, the 12-hour day has disappeared, even the 9-hour day has almost gone. We are now advocating the 5-day week. During this generation the portals of opportunity to our children have ever widened. While our population grew by but 62 percent, yet we have increased the number of children in high schools by 700 percent, and those in institutions of higher learning by 300 percent. With all our spending, we multiplied by six times the savings in our banks and in our building and loan associations. We multiplied by 1,200 percent the amount of our life insurance. With the enlargement of our leisure we have come to a fuller life; we have gained new visions of hope; we are more nearly realizing our national aspirations and giving increased scope to the creative power of every individual and expansion of every man's mind."", 'Now, our people in these 30 years have grown in the sense of social responsibility. There is profound progress in the relation of the employer to the employed. We have more nearly met with a full hand the most sacred obligation of man, that is, the responsibility of a man to his neighbor. Support to our schools, hospitals, and institutions for the care of the afflicted surpassed in totals by billions the proportionate service in any period in any nation in the history of the world.', 'Now, 3 years ago there came a break in this progress. A break of the same type we have met 15 times in a century and yet have recovered from. But 18 months later came a further blow by the shocks transmitted to us from earthquakes of the collapse of nations throughout the world as the aftermath of the World War. The workings of this system of ours were dislocated. Businessmen and farmers suffered, and millions of men and women are out of jobs. Their distress is bitter. I do not seek to minimize it, but we may thank God that in view of the storm that we have met that 30 million still have jobs, and yet this does not distract our thoughts from the suffering of the 10 million.', 'But I ask you what has happened. This 30 years of incomparable improvement in the scale of living, of advance of comfort and intellectual life, of security, of inspiration, and ideals did not arise without right principles animating the American system which produced them. Shall that system be discarded because vote-seeking men appeal to distress and say that the machinery is all wrong and that it must be abandoned or tampered with ? Is it not more sensible to realize the simple fact that some extraordinary force has been thrown into the mechanism which has temporarily deranged its operation? Is it not wiser to believe that the difficulty is not with the principles upon which our American system is founded and designed through all these generations of inheritance ? Should not our purpose be to restore the normal working of that system which has brought to us such immeasurable gifts, and not to destroy it ?', 'Now, in order to indicate to you that the proposals of our opponents will endanger or destroy our system, I propose to analyze a few of them in their relation to these fundamentals which I have stated.', 'First: A proposal of our opponents that would break down the American system is the expansion of governmental expenditure by yielding to sectional and group raids on the Public Treasury. The extension of governmental expenditures beyond the minimum limit necessary to conduct the proper functions of the Government enslaves men to work for the Government. If we combine the whole governmental expenditures--national, State, and municipal--we will find that before the World War each citizen worked, theoretically, 25 days out of each year for the Government. In 1924, he worked 46 days out of the year for the Government. Today he works, theoretically, for the support of all forms of Government 61 days out of the year.', ""No nation can conscript its citizens for this proportion of men's and women's time without national impoverishment and without the destruction of their liberties. Our Nation cannot do it without destruction to our whole conception of the American system. The Federal Government has been forced in this emergency to unusual expenditure, but in partial alleviation of these extraordinary and unusual expenditures the Republican administration has made a successful effort to reduce the ordinary running expenses of the Government."", ""Our opponents have persistently interfered with such policies. I only need recall to you that the Democratic House of Representatives passed bills in the last session that would have increased our expenditures by $3 1/2 billion, or 87 percent. Expressed in day's labor, this would have meant the conscription of 16 days' additional work from every citizen for the Government. That was stopped. Furthermore, they refused to accept recommendations from the administration in respect to 150 or 200 million of reductions in ordinary expenditures, and finally they forced upon us an increased expenditure of $322 million. In spite of this, the ordinary expenses of the Government have been reduced upwards of $200 million during the present administration. They will be decidedly further reduced. But the major point that I wish to make-the disheartening part of these proposals of our opponents--is that they represent the successful pressures of minorities. They would appeal to sectional and group political support and thereby impose terrific burdens upon every home in the country. These things can and must be resisted. But they can only be resisted if there shall be live and virile public support to a Republican administration. That support must be in opposition to the political logrolling and the sectional and group raids on the Treasury for distribution of public money, which is cardinal in the congeries of elements which make up the Democratic Party."", 'These expenditures proposed by the Democratic House of Representatives for the benefit of special groups and special sections of our country directly undermine the American system which I have described to you. Those who pay are, in the last analysis, the man who works at the bench, the desk, and on the farm. They take away his comfort, stifle his leisure, and destroy his equality of opportunity.', 'Second: Another proposal of our opponents which would destroy the American system is that of inflation of the currency. The bill which passed the last session of the Democratic House called upon the Treasury of the United States to issue $2,300 million in paper currency that would be unconvertible into solid values. Call it what you will, greenbacks or fiat money. It was the same nightmare which overhung our own country for years after the Civil War.', 'In our special situation today the issuance of greenbacks means the immediate departure of this country from the gold standard, as there could be no provision for the redemption of such currency into gold. The new currency must obviously go to immediate and constantly fluctuating discount when associated with currency convertible in gold.', 'The oldest law of currency is that bad money drives out the good, for a population--that is, every individual--will hoard good currency and endeavor to get rid of the bad. The invariable effect is the withdrawal of a vast sum of good currency from circulation, and at once the Government is forced to print more and more bad paper currency. No candidate and no speaker in this campaign has disavowed this action of the Democratic House of Representatives. In spite of this visible experience within the recollection of this generation, with all its pitiable resuits, fiat money is proposed by the Democratic Party as a potent measure for relief from this depression.', 'The use of this expedient by nations in difficulty since the war in Europe has been one of the most tragic disasters to equality of opportunity and the independence of man.', 'I quote from a revealing speech by Mr. Owen D. Young upon the return of the Dawes Commission from Europe. He stated:', '""The currency of Germany was depreciating so rapidly that the industries paid their wages daily, and sometimes indeed twice a day. Standing with the lines of employees was another line of wives and mothers waiting for these marks. The wife grabbed the paper from her husband\'s hand and rushed to the nearest provision store to spend it quickly before the rapid depreciation had cut its purchasing power in two.', '""When the chairman of the syndicate of the German Trade Unions, Herr Grasseman, appeared before the Dawes Commission, I put to him this question: \'What can this committee do for German labor ?\'', '""I expected the answer to be some one of the slogans of labor: An 8-hour day, old age or disability pensions--something of that kind. Much to my surprise the answer came promptly.', '""\'What your committee must do for German labor is to give us a stable currency. Do you know,\' Herr Grasseman said, \'that for many months it has been impossible for a wage earner in Germany to perform even of his moral obligations ?', '""\'Knowing that a child was coming to the family at a certain time, there was no way by which the husband, through effort or sacrifice or savings, could guarantee his wife a doctor and a nurse when that event arrived. One, knowing that his mother was stricken with a fatal disease could not by any effort or sacrifice or saving be in a position to insure her a decent burial on her death.', '""\'Your committee must,\' Herr Grasseman added, \'just as a basic human thing, assure us a stable currency \'and thereby insure to the worker that his wages will have the same purchasing power when he wants to spend them as they had when he earned them.\'""', 'Now, I ask, is that a policy consonant with the American system ? It has been proposed by the Democratic Party within 4 months and passed a Democratic House of Representatives. Is that the preservation of equality of opportunity and the protection of men by their government?', 'Third: In the last session of the Congress, under the personal leadership of the Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, and their allies in the Senate, they enacted a law to extend the Government into personal banking business. I know it is always difficult to discuss banks. There seems to be much prejudice against some of them, but I was compelled to veto that bill out of fidelity to the whole American system of life and government. I may repeat a part of that veto message, and it remains unchallenged by any Democratic leader. I quote now from that veto message because that statement was not made in the heat of any political campaign. I said:', '""It would mean loans against security for any conceivable purpose on any conceivable security to anybody who wants money. It would place the Government in private business in such fashion as to violate the very principle of public relations upon which we have builded our Nation, and renders insecure its very foundations. Such action would make the Reconstruction Corporation the greatest banking and money-lending institution of all history. It would constitute a gigantic centralization of banking and finance to which the American people have been properly opposed over a hundred years. The purpose of the expansion is no longer in the spirit of solving a great major emergency but to establish a privilege whether it serves a great national end or not.""', 'I further said:', '""It would require the setting up of a huge bureaucracy, to establish branches in every county and town in the United States. Every political pressure would be assembled for particular persons. It would be within the power of these agencies to dictate the welfare of millions of people, to discriminate between competitive business at will, and to deal favor and disaster among them. The organization would be constantly subjected to conspiracies and raids of predatory interests, individuals, and private corporations. Huge losses and great scandals must inevitably result. It would mean the squandering of public credit to be ultimately borne by the taxpayer.""', 'I stated further that:', '""This proposal violates every sound principle of public finance and of our Government. Never before has so dangerous a suggestion been made to our country. Never before has so much power for evil been placed at the unlimited discretion of seven individuals.""', 'They failed to pass this bill over my veto. But you must not be deceived. This is still in their purposes as a part of the new deal, and no responsible candidate has yet disavowed it.', 'Fourth: Another proposal of our opponents which would wholly alter our American system of life is to reduce the protective tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue. The protective tariff and its results upon our economic structure has become gradually embedded into our economic life since the first protective tariff act was passed by the American Congress under the administration of George Washington. There have been gaps, at times of Democratic control, when this protection has been taken away or decreased. But whether you like it or not, it has been so embedded in our economic life and structure that its removal has never failed and never will fail to bring disaster. I can conceive a Nation builded without it, but we have been built with it. Whole towns, communities, and forms of agriculture with their homes, schools, and churches have been built up under this system of protection. The grass will grow in streets of a hundred cities, a thousand towns; the weeds will overrun the fields of millions of farms if that protection be taken away. Their churches, their hospitals, and their schoolhouses will decay.', 'Incidentally, another one of the proposals of our opponents which also would destroy equality of opportunity between both individuals and communities is their promise to repeal the independent authority of the bipartisan Tariff Commission and thereby return the determination of import duties to the old logrolling greed of group or sectional interest under congressional action in review of the tariff.', 'Fifth: Another proposal is that the Government go into the power business. Three years ago, in view of the extension of the use of transmission of power over State borders and the difficulties of State regulatory bodies in the face of this interstate action, I recommended to the Congress that such interstate power should be placed under regulation by the Federal Government in cooperation with the State authorities.', 'That recommendation was in accord with the principles of the Republican Party, over the past 50 years, to provide regulation where public interest had developed in tools of industry which was beyond control and regulation of the States.', 'I succeeded in creating an independent Power Commission to handle such matters, but the Democratic House declined to approve the further powers to this Commission necessary for such regulation, possibly in order that they might use it as a matter of agitation in this campaign.', 'I have stated unceasingly that I am opposed to the Federal Government going into the power business. I have insisted upon rigid regulation. The Democratic candidate has declared that under the same conditions which may make local action of this character desirable, he is prepared to put the Federal Government into the power business. He is being actively supported by a score of Senators in this campaign, many of whose expenses are being paid by the Democratic National Committee, who are pledged to Federal Government development and operation of electrical power.', 'I find in the instructions to the campaign speakers issued by the Democratic National Committee that they are instructed to criticize my action in the veto of the bill which would have put the Government permanently into the operation of power at Muscle Shoals with a capital from the Federal Treasury of over $100 million. In fact, 31 Democratic Senators, being all except 3, voted to override that veto. In that bill was the flat issue of the Federal Government permanently in competitive business. I vetoed it because of principle and not because it was especially applied to electrical power. In that veto I stated that I was firmly opposed to the Federal Government entering into any business, the major purpose of which is competition with our citizens except in major national emergencies. In that veto message, written long before the emergence of the exigencies of political campaigning, I stated:', '""There are national emergencies which require that the Government should temporarily enter the field of business but that they must be emergency actions and in matters where the cost of the project is secondary to much higher consideration. There are many localities where the Federal Government is justified in the construction of great dams and reservoirs, where navigation, flood control, reclamation, or stream regulation are of dominant importance, and where they are beyond the capacity or purpose of private or local government capital to construct. In these cases, power is often a byproduct and should be disposed of by contract or lease. But for the Federal Government to deliberately go out to build up and expand such an occasion to the major purpose of a power and manufacturing business is to break down the initiative and enterprise of the American people; it is destruction of equality of opportunity among our people; it is the negation of the ideals upon which our civilization has been based.', '""This bill raises one of the important issues confronting our people. That is squarely the issue of Federal Government ownership and operation of power and manufacturing business not as a minor byproduct but as a major purpose. Involved in this question is the agitation against the conduct of the power industry. The power problem is not to be solved by the Federal Government going into the power business, nor is it to be solved by the project in this bill. The remedy for abuses in the conduct of that industry lies in regulation and not by the Federal Government entering the business itself. I have recommended to the Congress on various occasions that action should be taken to establish Federal regulation of interstate power in cooperation with State authorities. This bill would launch the Federal Government on a policy of ownership of power utilities upon a basis of competition instead of by the proper Government function of regulation for the protection of all the people. I hesitate to contemplate the future of our institutions, of our Government, and of our country, if the preoccupation of its officials is to be no longer the promotion of justice and equality of opportunity but is to be devoted to barter in the markets. That is not liberalism; it is degeneration.""', 'From their utterances in this campaign and elsewhere, it appears to me that we are justified in the conclusion that our opponents propose to put Federal Government extensively into business.', 'Sixth: I may cite another instance of absolutely destructive proposals to our American system by our opponents, and I am talking about fundamentals and not superficialities.', 'Recently there was circulated through the unemployed in this city and other cities, a letter from the Democratic candidate in which he stated that he would support measures for the inauguration of self-liquidating public works such as the utilization of water resources, flood control, land reclamation, to provide employment for all surplus labor at all times.', 'I especially emphasize that promise to promote ""employment for all surplus labor at all times""--by the Government. I at first could not believe that anyone would be so cruel as to hold out a hope so absolutely impossible of realization to those 10 million who are unemployed and suffering. But the authenticity of that promise has been verified. And I protest against such frivolous promises being held out to a suffering people. It is easy to demonstrate that no such employment can be found. But the point that I wish to make here and now is the mental attitude and spirit of the Democratic Party that would lead them to attempt this or to make a promise to attempt it. That is another mark of the character of the new deal and the destructive changes which mean the total abandonment of every principle upon which this Government and this American system are rounded. If it were possible to give this employment to 10 million people by the Government--at the expense of the rest of the people--it would cost upwards of $9 billion a year.', 'The stages of this destruction would be first the destruction of Government credit, then the destruction of the value of Government securities, the destruction of every fiduciary trust in our country, insurance policies and all. It would pull down the employment of those who are still at work by the high taxes and the demoralization of credit upon which their employment is dependent. It would mean the pulling and hauling of politics for projects and measures, the favoring of localities and sections and groups. It would mean the growth of a fearful bureaucracy which, once established, could never be dislodged. If it were possible, it would mean one-third of the electorate would have Government jobs, earnest to maintain this bureaucracy and to control the political destinies of the country.', 'Incidentally, the Democratic candidate has said on several occasions that we must reduce surplus production of agricultural products, and yet he proposes to extend this production on a gigantic scale through expansion of reclamation and new agricultural areas under this plan to the obvious ruin of the farmer.', 'I have said before, and I want to repeat on this occasion, that the only method by which we can stop the suffering and unemployment is by returning our people to their normal jobs in their normal homes, carrying on their normal functions of living. This can be done only by sound processes of protecting and stimulating recovery of the existing system upon which we have builded our progress thus far--preventing distress and giving such sound employment as we can find in the meantime.', 'Seventh: Recently, at Indianapolis, I called attention to the statement made by Governor Roosevelt in his address on October 25 with respect to the Supreme Court of the United States. He said:', '""After March 4, 1929, the Republican Party was in complete control of all branches of the Government--Executive, Senate, and House, and I may add, for good measure, in order to make it complete, the Supreme Court as well.""', 'Now, I am not called upon to defend the Supreme Court of the United States from that slurring reflection. Fortunately for the American people that Court has jealously maintained over the years its high standard of integrity, impartiality, and freedom from influence of either the Executive or Congress, so that the confidence of the people in the Court is sound and unshaken.', 'But is the Democratic candidate really proposing his conception of the relation of the Executive with the Supreme Court? If that is his idea, he is proposing the most revolutionary new deal, the most stupendous breaking of precedent, the most destructive undermining of the very safeguard of our form of government yet proposed by any Presidential candidate.', 'Eighth: In order that we may get at the philosophical background of the mind which pronounces the necessity for profound change in our economic system and a new deal, I would call your attention to an address delivered by the Democratic candidate in San Francisco early in October.', 'He said:', '""Our industrial plant is built. The problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt. Our last frontier has long since been reached. There is practically no more free land. There is no safety valve in the Western prairies where we can go for a new start .... The mere building of more industrial plants, the organization of more corporations is as likely to be as much a danger as a help .... Our task now is not the discovery of natural resources or necessarily the production of more goods, it is the sober, less dramatic business of administering the resources and plants already in hand... establishing markets for surplus production, of meeting the problem of under-consumption, distributing the wealth and products more equitably and adopting the economic organization to the service of the people .... ""..', 'Now, there are many of these expressions with which no one would quarrel. But I do challenge the whole idea that we have ended the advance of America, that this country has reached the zenith of its power and the height of its development. That is the counsel of despair for the future of America. That is not the spirit by which we shall emerge from this depression. That is not the spirit which has made this country. If it is true, every American must abandon the road of countless progress and countless hopes and unlimited opportunity. I deny that the promise of American life has been fulfilled, for that means we have begun the decline and the fall. No nation can cease to move forward without degeneration of spirit.', 'I could quote from gentlemen who have emitted this same note of profound pessimism in each economic depression going back for 100 years. What the Governor has overlooked is the fact that we are yet but on the frontiers of development of science and of invention. I have only to remind you that discoveries in electricity, the internal-combustion engine, the radio--all of which have sprung into being since our land was settled--have in themselves represented the greatest advances made in America. This philosophy upon which the Governor of New York proposes to conduct the Presidency of the United States is the philosophy of stagnation and of despair. It is the end of hope. The destinies of this country cannot be dominated by that spirit in action. It would be the end of the American system.', 'I have recited to you some of the items in the progress of this last generation. Progress in that generation was not due to the opening up of new agricultural land; it was due to the scientific research, the opening of new invention, new flashes of light from the intelligence of our people. These brought the improvements in agriculture and in industry. There are a thousand inventions for comfort and the expansion of life yet in the lockers of science that have not yet come to light. We are only upon their frontiers. As for myself, I am confident that if we do not destroy our American system, if we continue to stimulate scientific research, if we continue to give it the impulse of initiative and enterprise, if we continue to build voluntary cooperation instead of financial concentration, if we continue to build into a system of free men, my children will enjoy the same opportunity that has come to me and to the whole 120 million of my countrymen. I wish to see American Government conducted in that faith and hope.', 'Now, if these sample measures and promises, which I have discussed, or these failures to disavow these projects, this attitude of mind, mean anything, they mean the enormous expansion of the Federal Government; they mean the growth of bureaucracy such as we have never seen in our history. No man who has not occupied my position in Washington can fully realize the constant battle which must be carried on against incompetence, corruption, tyranny of government expanded into business activities. If we first examine the effect on our form of government of such a program, we come at once to the effect of the most gigantic increase in expenditure ever known in history. That alone would break down the savings, the wages, the equality of opportunity among our people. These measures would transfer vast responsibilities to the Federal Government from the States, the local governments, and the individuals. But that is not all; they would break down our form of government. It will crack the timbers of our Constitution. Our legislative bodies cannot delegate their authority to any dictator, but without such delegation every member of these bodies is impelled in representation of the interest of his constituents constantly to seek privilege and demand service in the use of such agencies. Every time the Federal Government extends its arm, 531 Senators and Congressmen become actual boards of directors of that business.', 'Capable men cannot be chosen by politics for all the various talents that business requires. Even if they were supermen, if there were no politics in the selection of a Government official, if there were no constant pressure for this and for that, so large a number of men would be incapable as a board of directors of any institution. At once when these extensions take place by the Federal Government, the authority and responsibility of State governments and institutions are undermined. Every enterprise of private business is at once halted to know what Federal action is going to be. It destroys initiative and courage. We can do no better than quote that great statesman of labor, the late Samuel Gompers, in speaking of an exactly parallel situation. He said:', '""It is a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control. If I were a minority of one on this occasion, I would want to cast my vote so that the men of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government in their industrial effort.""', ""Now, we have heard a great deal in this campaign about reactionaries, conservatives, progressives, liberals, and radicals. I think I belong to every group. I have not yet heard an attempt by any one of the orators who mouth these phrases to define the principles upon which they base these classifications. There is one thing I can say without any question of doubt--that is, that the spirit of liberalism is to create free men; it is not the regimentation of men under government. It is not the extension of bureaucracy. I have said in this city before now that you cannot extend the mastery of government over the daily life of a people without somewhere making it master of people's souls and thoughts. Expansion of government in business and otherwise means that the government, in order to protect itself from the political consequences of its errors or even its successes, is driven irresistibly without peace to greater and greater control of the Nation's press and platform. Free speech does not live many hours after free industry and free commerce die. It is a false liberalism that interprets itself into Government operation of business. Every step in that direction poisons the very roots of liberalism. It poisons political equality, free speech, free press, and equality of opportunity. It is the road not to liberty but to less liberty. True liberalism is found not in striving to spread bureaucracy, but in striving to set bounds of it. It is found in an endeavor to extend cooperation between men. True liberalism seeks all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of other blessings is vain. Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved."", 'Even if the Government conduct of business could give us the maximum of efficiency instead of least efficiency, it would be purchased at the cost of freedom. It would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption, stifle initiative and invention, undermine development of leadership, cripple mental and spiritual energies of our people, extinguish equality of opportunity, and dry up the spirit of liberty and progress. Men who are going about this country announcing that they are liberals because of their promises to extend the Government are not liberals; they are the reactionaries of the United States.', 'Now, I do not wish to be misquoted or misunderstood. I do not mean that our Government is to part with one iota of its national resources without complete protection to the public interest. I have already stated that democracy must remain master in its own house. I have stated that it is, at times, vitally necessary for the Government to protect the people when forces run against them which they cannot control. I have stated that abuse and wrongdoing must be punished and controlled. Nor do I wish to be interpreted as stating that the United States is a free-for-all and devil-take-the-hinder most society.', 'The very essence of equality of opportunity in our American system is that there shall be no monopoly or domination by anybody--whether it be a group or section of the country, or whether it be business, or whether it be group interest. On the contrary, our American system demands economic justice as well as political and social justice; it is no system of laissez faire.', 'I am not setting up the contention that our American system is perfect. No human ideal has ever been perfectly attained, since humanity itself is not perfect. But the wisdom of our forefathers and the wisdom of the 30 men who have preceded me in this office hold to the conception that progress can be attained only as the sum of the accomplishments of free individuals, and they have held unalterably to these principles.', 'In the ebb and flow of economic life our people in times of prosperity and ease naturally tend to neglect the vigilance over their economic rights. Moreover, wrongdoing is obscured by an appearance of success in enterprise. Then insidious diseases and wrongdoings do grow apace. But we have in the past seen in times of distress and difficulty that wrongdoing and weakness come to the surface, and our people, in their endeavors to correct these wrongs, have been tempted to extremes which destroy rather than build.', 'It is men that do wrong, not our institutions. It is men who violate the laws and public rights. It is men, not institutions, that must be punished.', 'Now, in my acceptance speech 4 years ago at my own home town of Palo Alto I stated:', '""One of the oldest aspirations of the human race is the abolition of poverty. By poverty I mean the grinding by undernourishment and cold and ignorance and fear and of old age of those who have the will to work.""', 'I stated that:', '""In America today we are nearer a final triumph over poverty than in any other land at any other time. The poorhouse has vanished from among us; we have not reached that goal, but given a chance to go forward, we shall, with the help of God, be in sight of the day when poverty will be banished from this Nation.""', 'Our Democratic friends have quoted this passage many times in this campaign. I do not withdraw a word of it. When I look about the world even in these times of trouble and distress I find it more true in this land than anywhere else under the traveling sun. I am not ashamed of it, because I am not ashamed of holding ideals and purposes for the progress of the American people. Are our Democratic opponents prepared to state in their mouthing of this statement that they do not stand for this ideal or this hope ? For my part, I propose to continue to strive for it, and I hope to live to see it accomplished.', 'Now, one of the most encouraging and inspiring phases of this whole campaign has been the unprecedented interest of our younger men and women. It is in this group that we find our new homes being founded and our new families in which the children are being taught these basic principles of love and faith and patriotism. It is in this group that we find the starting of business and professional careers with courage, with hopeful faces turned to the future and its promise. It is this group who must undertake the guardianship of our American system and carry it forward to its greater achievements.', 'Inevitably, in the progress of time, our country and its institutions will be entirely in their hands. The burdens of the depression have fallen on the younger generation, probably greater than even its severity on their elders. It has affected not only their economic well-being but has tended also to shatter many illusions. But their faith in our country and its institutions has not been shaken. I am confident that they will resist any destruction to our American system of political, economic, and social life.', 'It is a tribute to America and its past and present leaders, and even more a tribute to this younger generation, that, contrary to the experience of other countries, we can say tonight that the youth of America are more staunch than many of their elders. I can ask no higher tribute to the Republican Party, no greater aid in the maintenance of the American system and the program of this administration than the support being given by the younger men and women of our country. It has just been communicated to me that in every county and almost every precinct of our country, 3 million members of the Young Republican League are meeting tonight to listen to this address and to rally their support for the party on November 8. That in itself is a victory for the American system.', 'My countrymen, the proposals of our opponents represent a profound change in American life--less in concrete proposal, bad as that may be, than by implication and by evasion. Dominantly in their spirit they represent a radical departure from the foundations of 150 years which have made this the greatest Nation in the world. This election is not a mere shift from the ins to the outs. It means the determining of the course of our Nation over a century to come.', 'Now, my conception of America is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty, where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth not concentrated in the hands of a few but diffused through the opportunity of all, where they build and safeguard their homes, give to their children the full opportunities of American life, where every man shall be respected in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct him to follow, and where people secure in their liberty shall have leisure and impulse to seek a fuller life. That leads to the release of the energies of men and women, to the wider vision and higher hope. It leads to opportunity for greater and greater service not alone of man to man in our country but from our country to the world. It leads to health in body and a spirit unfettered, youthful, eager with a vision stretching beyond the farthest horizons with a mind open and sympathetic and generous. But that must be builded upon our experience with the past, upon the foundations which have made this country great. It must be the product of the development of our truly American system.']"

16,Herbert Hoover ,"November 02, 1932","['I am speaking tonight to our California association in this city and to my fellow Californians and my friends in Oregon and Washington over the telephone and radio.', 'I find myself speaking with no feeling of being removed or apart from the people at home in my own State. There is no separation of time or distance which the longing of the heart and mind cannot span between those whose common experience in daily living, fundamental aspirations and ideals give common sympathy and common understanding.', 'The telephone and the radio which convey my voice to you across the continent are not quicker in their errand than is the spirit which prompts the message they bring to you.', 'It is almost 48 years since I came as a boy to Oregon where, under the tender care of my uncle, I spent 7 years amid the glories of the Willamette Valley, and it was there that I began to earn my own living. Still a boy I, 40 years ago, came to California in search of an engineering education, with little means beyond the savings I had made. That opportunity was made possible for me by a citizen of California in the endowment of Stanford University free of tuition.', ""After having worked in the mines of California with my own hands, through the same gentle kindliness of another great citizen of California, I was started on my professional career. A great chance came to me through the world leadership California had attained in the mining industry, and I participated in responding to the demand of foreign countries for the training and skill that California had developed in that profession. I have never gone so far away, nor remained so long, except during the Great War and the Presidency, that the homing instinct has not carried me back every year to sink more deeply and more firmly the roots of my being in the fertile soil of California's spiritual and cultural life."", 'During the 4 years of the Great War, I represented the United in great enterprises which brought credit and distinction to our country and to my State. But I was deprived during those years of return to my home. Fearful that my sons should grow up without that imprint of California; that they might fail in touch with their own people, they with their mother spent a large part of that period in our California home, to be educated there in the prime school of democracy-our public schools.', 'After the war we came home with the hope and long-treasured enterprise of every normal American family of building a new house. I am not one of those Californians whose heart needs the awakening influence of absence to quicken his appreciation of the State of his birth or adoption. When sooner or later the time arrives which permits me to do so, I propose to return to my home in Palo Alto to live with my fellow Californians.', ""Elevated to the Presidency of the United States as a son of California, it has been my task to contend with the greatest peacetime disaster which has ever come to the American people. That crisis has extended over every hour and every day for the whole of the last 2 years. It has not so far permitted me to be away from the nerve center of the Nation, the headquarters of a great battle, a distance of more than a night's journey."", 'Our family has each year made fond plans for return to spend a summer at our own home for normal change and relief from work, but new crises and new emergencies have compelled me to remain at the Capital of the Nation. The improved situation in the country affords me the deep satisfaction of coming home to vote, but not for the purpose of carrying on a political campaign amongst my neighbors, who are my friends, but to satisfy that proper instinct inherent in every American to cast his vote amongst his neighbors at his own home. I trust I may not be prevented from exercising this privilege.', 'My friends, in addressing you tonight as a Californian, I am asking you for support in this contest because, in the outcome of this fight for the Republican Party, the people of the State of California have a great stake. I am addressing the people of Oregon and Washington because they, too, might be faced with the sacrifices of their most vital interests.', 'No more serious moment has ever brought the people of California and myself together in counsel as friends and neighbors than that which challenges us now. California has been honored by the Nation with its leadership during a period even more dangerous than a great war. I do not take seriously the claims of our opponents, however loudly voiced, that California will contribute to the responsibility of interrupting that leadership to the Nation which California has itself provided.', 'I do not need to remind Californians of the stages by which this crisis developed. While our opponents lay it largely to the mania of speculation, which indeed did contribute, all Californians know the ease with which our own State has time and again recuperated from such reverses by a short wait for the solid forces of growth to catch up with the over advancement and overdevelopment of hope and enterprise.', 'Our opponents further claim that this great calamity was also due to increases in the tariff. Pacific Coast States can scarcely agree to this idea because they themselves were among the largest beneficiaries from these increases.', 'The Democratic candidate stated at Seattle: ""When this tariff was passed with its outrageous rates, these laws started us on the road where we now find ourselves and that is the road of ruin.""', 'He further states: ""Here on the Pacific coast it has had a destructive effect in our oriental trade.""', 'He repeated at Sacramento: ""I have called immediate attention to the tariff that has done so much to destroy foreign trade by making foreign trade virtually impossible. I called for consideration of means by which trade with the Orient, which has so largely been destroyed, may be restored.""', 'In the face of the facts no one has a right to broadcast such statements blaming the people of the Pacific coast. I may mention after that tariff bill was passed our exports to China increased from $80 million in the fiscal year 1931 to $93 million in the fiscal year 1932; exports to Japan increased from $146 million in the fiscal year 1931 to $240 million in the fiscal year 1932. And even this is not the whole story, for if we were to analyze the effect of the decrease in world prices we would find on a quantity basis that our oriental trade is even larger than is shown by dollar valuation. While our opponent is ignorant of the facts he reveals his hostility to the tariffs on Pacific coast products.', 'In fact, the true cause of the real calamity which interrupted our entry into the road of recovery some 18 months ago lies deep in the World War and its aftermath, the inability of Europe to longer stand the strain without enormous readjustments of debts, overexpansion of armaments, et cetera, which finally brought about economic collapse of 30 nations. In every quarter of the globe confidence, which is the foundation of the faith on which the economic structure is builded, crumbled; business came to a standstill; European institutions, with a hundred years of financial stability, collapsed; European social order received such reverses that the whole structure of civilization was at one time on the brink of chaos, collapse, and ruin, and we alone held the last fortress of stability in the world. The invasion of this army of fear destroyed confidence, sapping the defenses of our financial system and stifling our exports of goods to those nations, threatened to bring down our entire industrial and commercial structure.', 'This was the new world war, a war of fearful and invisible enemies. Its spectral hosts, recruited in Europe and gathering allies from every land, turned their final march of assault upon our shores and even upon our Pacific Coast States.', 'As the responsible head of the Nation, I, following the historic policy of our past, abjured partisanship. I called for national unity in the face of national danger; I set before the leaders of both parties a complete program of measures for national defense and recovery. To the credit of my countrymen, they answered this call with almost complete unanimity; many patriotic Democrats in the Congress aligned themselves with patriotic Republicans under the banner of a united nation.', 'I need not recite the long series of over 30 measures initiated by my administration to sustain wages and employment; to prevent hunger and cold among millions of men, women, and children; to hold impregnable our Government credit as the basis of all stability to maintain the structure of private credit system through the Federal Reserve System, the Reconstruction Corporation, the land banks, the agricultural banks, home loan banks, the Farm Board; the expansion in public works; the mobilization of cooperation in all parts of our country; and a score of other activities. Their whole purpose was to hold the Nation steady in this crisis and to maintain the validity of the deposits of our people in the banks, the savings, the insurance policies of our people, and to hold the jobs for those who had work, to care for the distressed, and keep the economic machine functioning until the hurricane was passed. These actions saved this Nation from a score of years of destructive degeneration.', 'Nor were these dangers just general to the Nation. These invasions swept from State to State and from city to city throughout the country. It was a battle not alone against a nationwide startling growth of fear but against local and separate dangers in which at times each one of our Pacific Coast States has been the object of acute anxiety and direct action on the part of the Federal Government in their defense.', 'One great difficulty which arose to halt our progress was the development by the Democratic House of Representatives and the allies which they had secured to themselves of a series of disastrous measures for vast raids on the Public Treasury, the issuance of greenback money, and other interferences with the currency. The flank attacks had to be fought, coincident with fighting a hundred battles on the whole economic front, and they delayed the effectiveness of our potent measures for recovery until the Democratic House of Representatives and their allies adjourned. Our opponents at no time have proposed a single constructive measure to meet this emergency.', 'Finally, confidence being restored, we have been able to mobilize these measures into counterattack on the depression. Since the adjournment of Congress a million men have returned to work, new courage and enterprise have come into the lives and souls of men, and again America has begun the march forward which she has moved over these 150 years. The poignant question which citizens are asking today is whether we are going to check this progress and subject harried business, employment, and agriculture to a new term of waiting and uncertainty by the threat of new policies which are destructive in character both in the short and long view of our Nation.', 'I cannot better illustrate the measures of defense and attack than to point to a few of their applications to our Pacific Coast States.', 'Bear in mind that the head of a nation has the obligation to exert equal concern for the necessities of every State. I use this illustration merely to bring home to my neighbors and friends in the West the practical application to them of the vast program we have put in motion.', 'No man can say I was unmindful of the Pacific Coast States when immediately upon taking office and in the face of every prophecy and every precedent of political disaster to Presidents who demand tariff revisions, I called Congress into special session for upward revision of all farm tariffs, including the products of every farm, orchard, ranch, and garden in California and the other Pacific Coast States. And, further, that I secured the support of Republican States not interested in the setting up of the oil and lumber tariffs, so that we gained for these industries and their workers a much-needed relief to their unemployment.', 'There are no States in the Union where prosperity is so dependent upon the maintenance of the protective tariff as in those of the Pacific coast. There is scarcely a commodity now produced within your borders that could be produced on a commercial basis tomorrow if we were to take down the barriers which prevent a flood of goods outside our boundaries from the North, the South, across the Atlantic and the Pacific.', 'You are familiar with the proofs. I need recite but a few. For instance, southern California should be interested that lemons can be laid down in New York from Europe at $3.50 a box, while through tariff protection California is able to sell her product for $6.50. Petaluma is interested that the import of over 3-million dozens of eggs has dropped to 300,000 this year under Republican tariff, and through the recent order I signed in connection with dried eggs upon the determination of facts by the Tariff Commission we saved that industry. New Zealand butter could be sold at this moment over the whole Pacific coast at less than 14 cents per pound; similar grades of butter bring 22 cents per pound because of the tariff. Against Asiatic beans the tariff has afforded, during the last 2 years, a nearly 100 percent protection for the Pacific coast farmer. Raisins and figs of Fresno and prunes of the Willamette and Santa Clara Valleys would sell in the common markets of the East at rates that would, despite the low level of present prices, reduce returns to those producers by nearly 50 percent. The price of California wool in the Boston market is 38 cents today, whereas your Australian competitors could sell the same kind of wool there for less than 22 cents, and the difference is due solely to the tariff.', 'It is not difficult to gauge the shallow hypocrisy of Democratic pretentions of tariff consideration in behalf of the Pacific coast farmer. The same story could be told of every farm product--nuts, grapes, melons, tomatoes, celery, and a score of commodities.', 'Turning to another of our great coast products, 60 cents out of each dollar produced in the Pacific Coast Northwest comes from the forests, where higher wages are paid to lumber workers than in any other district in the world. Since the passage of the tariff act, British Columbian lumber exports into the United States have almost disappeared, and those from Russia, which had rapidly developed into a large trade, have almost ceased.', 'I would like to repeat here a statement made on Friday, October 28, by Mr. W. D. Euler, former National Minister of Canada and now a Member of the Canadian House of Commons. He said:', '""I have no particular love for our American friends so far as business is concerned, but I would not cut off my nose to spite my face. It may be that after the next election--and it looks that way--the United States Government may change its attitude, and you may find President Roosevelt, if he is elected, making certain proposals possibly as to allowing our lumber to come into that country, or our fish, or something else.""', 'And this protection afforded to Pacific coast industries by the tariff of 1930 and since has become doubly imperative within the last few months, due to depreciation of currencies as a part of the world collapse. As many of you know, due to a more than 50 percent depreciation in Japanese currency since last spring, the competitors of our Pacific coast fish industries, which employ nearly 90,000 workers and have an invested capital of more than $103 million, have been confronted with the gravest peril. As a result of this depreciation of currency, foreign salmon is now quoted at about half the price of our Pacific coast product. Our imports of canned sardines, which come largely from depreciated currency countries, were almost 90 percent larger in September of this year than in September 1931. And other branches of our important Pacific coast industries, such as canned vegetables, dried fruits, beans and pulp, iron and steel may also be threatened with a similar peril.', 'In the light of this grave emergency, I have asked the Tariff Commission to investigate the situation immediately and, if the findings warrant, I shall at once increase the protection to these industries. The fact is, we on the Pacific coast are faced with the necessity to consider increases in the tariff instead of the proposals of the Democratic Party to reduce them. Our citizens should not be fooled by promises of local Democratic candidates not to reduce these tariffs.', 'Every man who knows the constitution, the character platform, and the traditional policy of the Democratic Party knows perfectly well that these products will rot on the farms and in our forests of the Pacific coast under such a regime. Furthermore, it must be obvious that the progress the Pacific coast has made from the crisis in certain industries toward upward movement of the last 4 months would wither under any such proposal. We would go back to conditions of depression worse than that through which we have passed.', 'I would call your attention to another phase of the tariff question, that is, the proposal of negotiated reciprocal tariff by the Democratic Party. I have just examined again the protests which were lodged with the State Department at the time of the increases in our tariff 2 years ago. I find that protests were made by 40 different countries. They are nothing new. They occur with every tariff bill, and the Democrats always ventilate them as being threats to our national welfare just as the Democratic candidate did while in our State. I found, however, that these protests in large part relate to items of interest to the Pacific Coast States: wool, hides, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, onions, potatoes, carrots, cattle, hogs, butter, cheese, eggs, canned goods, canned fish, sugar, preserved cherries, oranges, lemons, raisins and dried fruits, apples, olive oil, beans, peas, cement, pottery manufactures, iron and steel manufactures, lumber, and oil.', 'No reciprocal agreement would be made with these countries at all except at the expense of the Pacific Coast States. Because we have determined to protect the civilization upon which the Coast States rest, and their distance from States of predominant interest to that party, the Democratic candidate tells us that we have been unjust to foreign nations and that we have brought calamities on all other States and the world by our insistence upon your protection.', 'To indicate the practical application of our measures to protect the Pacific coast from destruction in this crisis and to advance that recovery, I may cite a few of the direct applications to California, Oregon, and Washington.', 'The National Credit Association and the Reconstruction Corporation at one time advanced over $150 million to some 409 banks, including branches, in the State of California; to 62 in Oregon; and to 99 in Washington. This sum has been largely repaid. Those banks have more than 3 million depositors, every one of whom was helped by these loans which were made solely for the purpose of protecting their deposits and savings, and of preventing undue pressure on borrowers from those banks during the period of panic. Had these advances not been made your entire banking system would have collapsed beyond any doubt. But this action has tided over the panic, has reestablished the banking system of the Pacific coast again on a sound basis, and has kept practically every family from despair at loss of their deposits.', 'I may call attention to the fact that during this period loans were made to 24 different building and loan associations on the Pacific coast and to 5 mortgage concerns, with a view to preventing foreclosure of mortgages on the homes and farms of hundreds of thousands of people.', 'The Federal Farm Board, created by my activities, has advanced to California farm cooperatives a total of $31,298,000 to prevent their collapse in this time of distress and thus aided hundreds of thousands of families. On top of this, in order to aid in employment, the Federal Government has expended, during my administration, on and let contracts for public works, buildings, roads, and other items $100 million in California, $45 million in Oregon, and $50 million in Washington. This has provided work for hundreds of thousands.', 'Beyond this again the Reconstruction Corporation, under provisions for advancing employment through reproductive works, has authorized advances to great projects in the Pacific Coast States which were held in abeyance because of the credit paralysis, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bridge, the bringing of Colorado River water into southern California--which enterprises will finally expend upwards of $400 million for the invigoration of the industries of California and the whole of the Nation. Beyond this the Reconstruction Corporation has authorized loans to States on the Pacific coast for the care of distress among unemployed.', 'Under these measures which I have inaugurated, we have set up new agricultural credit banks on the Pacific coast in order that there shall be no question as to the ability of our farmers to borrow money for productive purposes. We have set up new home loan banks in those States in order that we may protect and expand the activities of the building and loan associations and savings banks, not alone to protect homeowners from foreclosure but to free capital with which new homes can be built and new labor employed.', 'These great actions by the use of Federal credit to tide Pacific Coast States across the trough of this depression reflect directly and indirectly into every home and fireside in those States.', 'These measures which I have cited are but a partial picture of the reasons why I have not been able, during the whole of these 4 years, to renew the friendships and those associations in my home State, or even to have the pleasure of attending the Olympic games.', 'In all the stress of these past years, especially in these past few weeks when we have been battling that the rehabilitation of this Nation may be carried forward without interruption, nothing has been more heartening than the messages of confidence and hope that I have received from the mobilized women of California. I realize that when difficulties come of the character we have been meeting it is the women who first feel the effects of economic pressures on their shoulders, the burden of thousands of small economies that must be made for the preservation of the home and the safety of the children. They are proving the great steadying influence in the Nation, the great preservers. They will refuse to risk the fate of their families through the abandonment of those safeguards which we have builded during the past 150 years or to risk the programs of reconstruction we have inaugurated, by the adoption of the proposals of the Democratic Party which will inherently destroy it. I should like to pay a tribute to the organization of your young voters who are fighting this battle with us to such telling effect.', 'I have been requested by the Republican State Committee to comment on two calumnies being circulated by the Democratic agents in my home State. I had not supposed it necessary, but I can do so categorically. As to the first calumny, I have not, since I entered public service 15 years ago, owned any interest directly or indirectly in any kind of business outside of the boundaries of the United States, including any concern producing, transporting, or distributing oil. Twenty years ago I invested $5,000 in the California Oil Company, and I still have it. The second defamation that I am asked to denounce which has been industrially circulated is to the effect that the ranch at Wasco, my interest in which I disposed of 2 or 3 years ago, refused to employ white workers. To support this cheap political trick, a notice was prepared and hung on the gates and photographed for circulation despite repeated public statements of its fraudulent character by various substantial men.', 'I might add one further note of interest to the Pacific Coast States. Repeatedly in these last 4 years in illustrating what may be accomplished under the American System of government, and by a virile people, I have pointed out publicly and privately, time and again, the great example of the Pacific Coast States, an empire to itself--where 8 million people have settled in a period of less than 85 years, have builded a state of society in which there has been a degree of comfort, an addition to the sum total of human possessions, a diffusion of wealth, and a security that is not exceeded by any similar area on the face of the globe, no matter how old. And where, with it all, they have advanced in education and intellectual pursuits to the degree that the total number of students in institutions of higher learning amongst only 8 million people, is greater than the attendance in similar institutions in the whole of Great Britain with its population of 45 million.', 'I am asking you should vote to maintain our American institutions which have given you this well-being, not halt them because of temporary dissatisfactions with forces outside the control of our Government. And it is my purpose tonight to bring to your minds that this march and progress should not be halted nor destroyed.', 'I do not hesitate to ask you to so express your citizenship next Tuesday as to insure the continuance of this progress, which over the years has made California what it is. It must not deter me from the solemn duty of appealing to you to vote on the basis of the constructive measures and policies of the Republican Party which have protected you from great disasters in the past and have turned the country toward recovery and not allow your votes to be inspired by misrepresentations and general and special appeals to discontent with temporary forces forced upon us from abroad rather than your own well-being.']"

The administration in Washington has taken unprecedented measures calling into action the full powers of the Federal Government in the protection of our people from this invasion. We have succeeded in the defense of our people from the invasion of fear and interference from abroad, and we have preserved the institutions of the United States. We first fought a great battle of defense. We have turned our great instrumentalities and measures into an offensive all along the economic front and are restoring employment and agriculture to the United States. We are able at this moment to say to you that men are returning to their jobs at the rate of 500,000 per month, that, since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives and the cessation of their interferences with our program of recovery, we have returned over 1 million men to their jobs.', 'There is one fundamental difference between our program and that of our opponents that is absolutely fundamental to all of you, that is, the continued protection of our industries from foreign goods. If it were not for the protective tariff today there would be millions more unemployed in our country. If we were to let down the tariff barriers which surround you and which protect you, we should have a new and worse depression.', 'It is the most potent of all the emergency measures in protection of our people, and yet our opponents propose to reduce that protection. They propose to reduce it at a time when, in the economic debacle among other nations of the world, currencies have depreciated and brought lowered standards of living and lower wages to them, your competitors. They are able to penetrate our tariff wall in many places. The Tariff Commission is at present engaged in investigating these questions. Through it we may be able to repair these breaks which today are depriving the American workman of his employment and decreasing the prices to the American farmer. Our opponents have proposed in this campaign that they will abolish the authority which was established to the Tariff Commission to act in these emergencies. And not only do they propose to reduce the tariff but they propose to destroy the means of readjustment when it becomes necessary to preserve your jobs.', 'If the protective tariff is to be maintained and if the policies of the Republican Party of restricting immigration so that our own people may be employed are to be maintained, it rests with you, the workingmen and workingwomen of the United States. It can be done solely and only by the return of the Republican Party to power on the 8th day of November. If you desire a change by which the tariff on which your jobs are built shall be reduced, if you desire a change by which immigration shall be allowed to reenter the United States to compete for jobs at the gates of your factories, you have only to vote for our opponents. We are fighting against. these changes. We are fighting for the protection of the American people in their homes and firesides. We have no other interest than to maintain the stability of our own country and restore its employment from the shocks which it has received from outside our borders. We have builded up protection to you in a score of directions, and those protections and those measures are at this moment working steadily for the restoration of our country.', 'Now, I want again to express my appreciation for the support which you have shown by your gigantic welcome this morning. I have never seen so great a crowd gathered at such a time, and it is a demonstration that the Republican Party will be returned on the 8th day of November to complete its task.', '[5.] GRESHAM JUNCTION, ILLINOIS (9:42 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I deeply appreciate this greeting. It is encouraging. It is heartening, and it is evidence as to where you will stand in this State on the 8th day of November next.', 'You will realize that this is hardly an occasion for a long discussion of national issues. I have to speak twice during the day today, once at Springfield at about 3:30 and again in St. Louis at 7:30, and I am in hopes you may be able to listen on the radio. I do have something to say on those two occasions, and I know you would like for me to preserve my voice so as to be able to get it across.', 'Thank you.', '[6.] JOLIET, ILLINOIS (10:35 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I have had receptions of a dimension, since coming into this State, that have been almost unparalleled in the history of Presidential campaigns, and I deeply appreciate your greeting. It is heartening. It is encouraging, and it is stimulating to continue this fight. And it is a profound indication of where the Republican State of Illinois will be on the 8th day of November.', 'I am confident that the State of our Union that gave us the first Republican President is going to maintain the Republican Party in the guidance of the policies of this Government.', 'You will realize that this is not an opportunity for a long discussion of our national issues. I am speaking at Springfield at 3:30 this afternoon, and I am speaking again at St. Louis at 7:30 tonight. I know that most of you have access to the radio. I hope you will listen in because I am going to have something to say with regard to our opponents and the policies they propose for the American people.', 'This town among all towns has had much from the Republican Party. It has protection to its industries, and it has protection in a double sense today, through not only the present tariff but its protection through a Republican agency created in the last tariff bill, by which breaches which are being made today in the tariff wall can be repaired. They will not be repaired by the Democratic Party, who propose to reduce those tariffs and to increase unemployment in the United States thereby. And those breaches must be repaired to protect the American people in our factories. Therefore, our problem today is not the reduction proposed by our opponents, but it is the very large question as to whether it is necessary to increase the tariff in order to make more jobs for our factories and our farms.', 'My friends, we have gone through 3 years of difficult times. These times have brought great hardships. They have come upon us as the aftermath of the World War and the collapse of 30 nations abroad from that war. We have established instrumentalities and measures by which we have protected the United States from infinitely worse conditions than those with which we have been confronted, and we have turned those measures to an attack upon the economic situation. The result has begun to show since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives. We have now had 4 months in which to see the results of those measures established by the Republican administration for meeting this battle.', 'I am glad to give to you this today, to carry some conviction to you, and that one figure is that in the last 4 months 1 million men have been returned to their jobs.', 'I thank you again for your greeting. It is the most impressive evidence of where your heart lies, and that is in the Republican Party.', '[7.] MORRIS, ILLINOIS (11:04 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I am afraid I cannot undertake to make myself heard over all parts of this tremendous crowd. I have to save my voice for this afternoon at Springfield and tonight at St. Louis, but I do want to express my appreciation for this greeting. It is a sign of what you will do on November 8th.', '[8.] Ottawa, ILLINOIS (11:35 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I find it difficult to assemble the words to express the appreciation I have for such greetings as have been given to me since I came into the State of Illinois this morning. It is heartening and encouraging and a sure sign of what will happen on November 8th--that the State of Illinois, which furnished the first Republican President of the United States, will continue to be under Republican leadership.', 'I will speak to you this afternoon from Springfield. I trust many of you have radios, so that you can listen in. I am going to speak to you tonight from St. Louis, and I have to conserve my voice in the open air, so that I can give the impressions which I have of our opponents with the vigor which they deserve.', 'I thank you for your greeting.', '[9.] LASALLE, ILLINOIS (12 noon)', 'My friends:', 'I do want to express my appreciation for this tremendous greeting. It is heartening, and it is encouraging. It is a sign of what you will do on the 8th day of November.', 'I thank you.', '[10.] HENRY, ILLINOIS ( 12:45 p.m.)', 'I want to express my appreciation for this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is a great stimulation to continue the fight. And it is a sound indication as to what Illinois will do on the 8th day of November.', 'Thank you.', '[11.] PEORIA, ILLINOIS ( 1:30 p.m.)', 'This is unquestionably the greatest assembly of citizens at a railway station yet in history. I find it difficult to formulate the words which express my gratitude for your greeting. It is encouraging. It is heartening in this battle, and it is evidence of where the State of Illinois will be on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not a time to discuss at length our national issues. Within 2 or 3 hours I shall be able to talk to you by radio from Springfield and again this evening from St. Louis. I have one point of which I always wish to remind both the citizens of the town and the citizens of the country, and that is that in these terrible times--and I use the word advisedly--the Republican Party has given a protection to this country from collapses that would have endangered this Nation to a degree of which you have no comprehension. We have turned our great instrumentalities and those unprecedented measures now into complete attack upon the depression. We are moving forward. We are succeeding. Over a million of men have returned to work during the past 4 months, and they are returning to work at the rate of half a million a month. That is the evidence of the success of the great program which the Republican Party offers to this country.', 'Our opponents are offering you no emergency program. They are giving you some vague promises with regard to the future. The real problem of the American people is to get out of this depression, to restore men to their jobs, and to restore to agriculture their prices. That is the problem upon which our party has concentrated itself. That is the battle in which we are engaged. We have carried the first-line trenches, and we say to you that this is no time to change policies and strategies until we have won this battle complete.', 'Now, I wish I could more adequately express the appreciation which I have for this greeting. It is the most impressive group that has yet greeted me at any point in the United States, and some of the groups have been most encouraging indeed. I see in your faces and by your looks that we will carry the State of Illinois and by so doing you carry the Nation.']"
19,Herbert Hoover ,"November 04, 1932","['My friends:', ""No man can come to Springfield without a long look backward in our history. No man can visit this national shrine without reflecting once more on its significance in the life of our Republic. No man can live in Washington without constant reminder of the great struggle that determined our country's destiny. And no man in my position can fail to gain inspiration and courage from the courage, the high intelligence, the unswerving fidelity with which Abraham Lincoln met the overwhelming difficulties that threatened the very existence of our Union. I thank you for the privilege of renewing contact with that shrine."", 'At Des Moines a month ago I made an address largely directed to agriculture. I elaborated some 12 points which I can summarize again, with the progress made in respect to them since that time, and I can now add the apparent reactions upon the Democratic candidate in respect to that statement.', 'The first of the subjects I discussed at that time was the tariff in its relation to American agriculture. Since that speech, the Democratic candidate has made further statements as to which he can only confuse the public mind and from which I do not believe American agriculture will secure much conviction. It is, of course, difficult for the Democratic Party to maintain one theory on the tariff in the East and another in the West. But of one thing you can be sure, and that is that the party which placed the majority of farm products on the free list in the tariff bill which they imposed on the country in 1913; the party which voted against the emergency farm tariff in 1921; the party of the Democratic President who vetoed it; the party of the Democratic minority in the succeeding House which voted against the revival of the emergency tariff, although it was forced through by a Republican majority and a Republican President; the party which voted against the increase in the agricultural tariffs in the Republican tariff bill of 1922, and the party which voted against the increase in the farm tariffs in the Hawley Smoot tariff bill of 1930; the party whose platform enunciated the principle of competitive tariff for revenue, and the candidate who unceasingly has reaffirmed that platform and who denounces the Hawley Smoot tariff in unmeasured terms, notwithstanding that 66 percent of the dutiable goods under that act are farm products, and who has termed it frequently a ghastly jest, are scarcely the party and the candidate upon whom the Republican farmers of Illinois should depend for their protection. Certainly whatever they may now say in words in the West, they depend upon their historical low tariff policy to carry conviction in the East.', 'Moreover, I have not yet noticed that the Democratic candidate has abandoned his notion of what he calls ""negotiated tariffs"" with other governments. I have reexamined the protests which are always lodged by other nations every time we pass a protective tariff bill, and in fact all nations lodge similar protests when one of them passes a tariff bill. I find that all but a few of those protests lay their major emphasis on the increase in our farm tariff. In other words, there is no negotiation that can be carried through that will not be done at the sacrifice of the American farmer.', 'In speaking at Des Moines I gave some figures at which farm commodities could be sold in the United States from foreign countries, even in these days of distressing and even heartbreaking prices, if the tariff were reduced to a competitive basis for revenue. I can add some items that are especially applicable to the State of Illinois. Your soybean oil is an important new product with you. This oil now sells in the Atlantic coast markets for about $3.50 per 100 pounds. It could be imported for far less except for the tariff. It was formerly on the Democratic free list, and your entire industry would be destroyed by lowering the tariff to a competitive basis with the labor of China which is your chief competitive country. Your butter, which sells in New York at 22 cents, could be sold from New Zealand at this moment for 16 were it not for the tariff. And, as a matter of fact, your wheat, distressing as the price is, is selling in Minneapolis today at 12 cents above the Canadian price for similar grades.', 'In discussing the tariff at Des Moines I pointed out that at that moment there were about 2 million cattle in the northern States of Mexico seeking a market, and stated that: ""The price is about $2ð per 100 pounds on the south bank of the Rio Grande and $40 on the north bank, and only the tariff wall between them.""', 'This fact has greatly worried our Democratic orators, and they have concluded that these cattle must be bony, skinny, and seventh-class cattle. Although that is not true, I am quite prepared to transfer this comparison to the highest grade cattle in the world on the northern border where the difference is even more than the $2 margin between the north side and the south side of the Mexican border. I am further prepared to transfer this comparison to the Argentine, where the highest grade cattle that could come into New York in the form of meat for $7 per 100 pounds as against the present price of your meat at $12 per 100 pounds if it were not for the tariff. And I may say to the workmen of Illinois that it is because of the prices that you receive that men are employed in New York making goods for your consumption.', 'And I wish to call your attention to a further factor that has come to a head during the last few weeks, more particularly since I spoke at Des Moines, and that is the effect of the depreciation of foreign currencies on the ability of our competitors in agricultural products to ship into our markets. When their currencies depreciated, their prices and wages automatically decreased in comparison with ours, and this enables them to penetrate our tariff wall. At this moment foreign farm products, such as butter, pork products, grass for rugs, cattle, and competitive oils, have begun to flow over our borders in competition with our American farmers, and have contributed to the depreciation of the present prices. Particularly is this so from Canada, New Zealand, and the Orient, and from certain European countries. Fortunately, the Republican Party had secured, 2 years ago, the establishment of authority in the Tariff Commission by which the tariffs could we reexamined and readjusted in just such events. I have lately given instructions to the Commission to reexamine certain of the agricultural tariffs with view of presenting to me the actual facts of the difference in cost of production at home and abroad, and certainly if the facts are developed as they appear, I shall promptly act in relief of the American farmer. One of the planks of the Democratic platform, one of the things that has been consistently backed by the Democratic candidate, and one of the things passed by the Democratic Congress was to destroy this authority. And I ask you what emergency relief you could therefore expect from them.', 'The second point which I took up at Des Moines was the activities of the Farm Board. I stated that the original fundamental purpose of the Board was to encourage cooperative marketing. That they have done to a remarkable degree. Hundreds of cooperative associations would have gone bankrupt in this depression except for the ability of the Farm Board to lend to them the necessary money to carry them during the time of the depression. Today over 2 million of farm families throughout the United States, members of cooperatives, are receiving benefits solely because of the consummation of this undertaking by the Republican Party. Nowhere can I find that the Democratic candidate has agreed to continue this support of cooperative marketing through the Farm Board.', 'The Democratic candidate does denounce the emergency purchases of farm products during the panic. The files of the Farm Board will show the insistent demand of farm organizations, both Democratic and Republican Senators and Congressmen, Governors, bankers, and grain merchants for that emergency action to be taken. Some of the gentlemen who made these demands are the loudest critics of the Farm Board in this campaign. I have stated that as valuable as the operation was, I am convinced, and I believe the farmers are convinced, that its aftermath warrants the revision of the act to eliminate this section.', 'The third subject on which I spoke at Des Moines was the problem of better land use. The Republican platform contains a plank which constitutes the first declaration upon this subject. The Democratic candidate is now for it, but in a recent letter from him to Mr. Shearon, in New York, 1 freely circulated as a campaign document amongst the unemployed in the United States, he promises to put every one of the 10 million unemployed in the United States to work for the Government--a thing impossible to do without ruining every farmer in the United States with taxes and other disabilities. But he also enumerates the further reclamation of land amongst the projects of which he proposes to avail himself. The inevitable consequence would be to further expand agricultural production in the United States, and thereby further embarrass the American farmers with increasing surpluses and decreasing prices.', '1 See Item 347, page 588.', 'The fourth subject I discussed at Des Moines was waterways, on which the Democratic candidate has carefully refrained from any but vague references.', 'The fifth point which I discussed in that address was the loans made to help farmers during the drought and to rehabilitate their production where there were no credit facilities. I stated that I had seen to it that they would not be unduly pressed in the present situation for the repayment of these amounts, and I can report now that measures have been set up which have received the approval of these distressed people. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself on the continuation of that policy.', 'The sixth matter which I discussed was the question of taxes upon land property and the injustice of the proportionate burden which the farmer is now bearing. The Democratic candidate has referred to this subject on a number of occasions. He offered to use his influence in solution of it. I stated at Des Moines that I proposed to call a conference of the tax officials immediately after the election and to review the whole relation of our taxes between the Federal, State, and local governments, and to find a basis for each that would give an opportunity to the States to give relief to the farmer.', 'The seventh point which I discussed at Des Moines was the necessity of maintaining a flow of short-term credit to the farmer to enable him to make short-term loans for planting, harvesting, and feeding of livestock and other productive necessities. I pointed out that much was being accomplished indirectly through credit expansion in various directions by the Government agencies, and I am now able to report that the 10 new agricultural credit institutions which can command over $300 million of credit are actually in operation in all parts of the country, and the sound demand of no farmer need go unsatisfied. There has been no expression from my opponent as to his views upon that question.', 'The eighth subject which I discussed was the authorization to the Reconstruction Corporation to make credit available for the movement of farm commodities to the market in normal fashion, and to make credits available for the sale of farm products to countries abroad not otherwise able to produce such commodities. Since that date the farmers of the Northwest States have asked for a loan with which to sell 15 million bushels of wheat to China, and I believe that, despite technical difficulties which have been raised before the Reconstruction Corporation, we shall find solution and secure relief to those farmers with consequent aid to the whole wheat situation. That is a practical application of what I stated at Des Moines as among the powers we had established for the Reconstruction Corporation. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself upon this policy.', 'The ninth subject I discussed at Des Moines was the mortgage situation and the actions which we have already taken in provision of additional capital to the Federal land banks and the steps we have taken to secure coordination of private agencies to relax pressure upon mortgages. I further stated that I would propose to Congress at the next session a further reorganization of the Federal land banks to give them the resources and liberty of action to expand in the positive refinancing of the farm mortgages where it is necessary in order to give men who want a chance to fight for their homes the opportunity to do it. Since then we have further coordinated private loaning agencies and have thereby greatly relaxed the pressures from these agencies upon the farmers. The Democratic candidate in an indefinite way, has expressed his agreement to my proposal to further expand the land banks, but he has made proposals affecting private mortgages which, if he is to carry them beyond voluntary action already in course, he will require an amendment to the Constitution and will be required to adopt my proposal of reorganized land banks in full in order to do the job.', 'The tenth subject which I discussed at Des Moines was the important element of world stability in the recovery and expansion of our agricultural markets. I stated the necessity of the rebuilding of the credit structure of foreign countries, broken down by the present situation which had forced them off the gold standard and compelled them to restrict their imports of commodities; that we were participating in building up the World Economic Conference for the accomplishment of this purpose. I stated that I would send a representative of agriculture as a member of the American delegation to that Conference. We have made steady progress in the preparatory work for that Conference, and it will be held later in the year. The Democratic candidate has not expressed himself in support of that proposal.', 'The eleventh subject I discussed at Des Moines was the use of the war debts to assist in the expansion of agricultural markets; I commented on the proposal of the Democratic candidate to lower our tariffs in order that by profits gained from the flood of goods into the United States, these debts would be more easily paid by the foreigner, but the result would be to place the burden of these debts upon our workers by putting them out of employment and on our farmers by forcing their products to rot on their farms. There has been no withdrawal of this proposal by the Democratic candidate.', ""I stated that I was prepared to recommend that any annual payment of foreign debts be used for the specific purpose of securing expansion of American farm markets, which is the reversal of our opponent's proposal. The restoration of our proportion of European markets before Russia and other countries began their displacements would alone increase the market for our wheat by 50 million bushels and vastly increase our pork product exports. This will be made a real action."", 'The twelfth subject I discussed at Des Moines was the advancement of agricultural prices. I stated that the first measure of relief was to hold to our protective tariffs on farm products; that we will maintain. The next move in the battle for improved prices was to stop general deflation. There are evidences in nearly every direction that that has been stopped and that values are recovering. The third step is to expand the foreign market. The project I have proposed will work in that direction. The next step is to expand our domestic markets by restoration of employment, for 92 percent of American farm products are sold in America to American consumers. Every man taken from the ranks of the unemployed and put back to his job is, with his family, an increased consumer. This increase takes place by his ability to buy the more refined products of agriculture, such as animal products, which in turn require a larger consumption of grain. And I can report to you on authority of two different Government agencies that, since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives, the measures which we have instituted for recovery of the country have resulted in a million men being restored to their jobs. They have begun to return at the rate of 500,000 a month, and it will soon begin to reflect in your markets.', 'I have the most earnest desire to rebuild agriculture. The country fully realizes that the purchasing power of the farmer must be restored to gain national prosperity. I frankly stated at Des Moines that I had come to the farmers with no economic patent medicine especially compounded for them, and that I refused to offer counterfeit currency or false ideas. I shall continue to search for further practical measures.', 'The Democratic candidate has developed one of the greatest mysteries of this whole campaign in his proposal for relief to agriculture. He has not been willing to state the method by which he proposes to secure the advance of agricultural prices. He has stated with great care six methods by which he can escape from any demand that he make good on his mysterious proposal.', 'And he could add two other doors of escape not mentioned--first, that any plan should be constitutional; and, second, that it should not violate the laws of practically every country in the world against the import of commodities produced as the result of subsidies. I closed the door to the New Zealand butter under our own law in order to protect the farmers of the United States on one occasion during this present depression because they were subsidizing production.', 'It seems to me cruel to hold out hope to a suffering people by vague plans, the most specific parts of which are the ways of escape from putting it into action. The only thing we really know of the plan is that he is unwilling during all these many weeks to submit it to debate. Now, I leave these questions of definite problems before you.', 'I would like to give to you an important analogy with the whole situation we are in.', 'It was from Springfield, in the heart of the western prairies, that Lincoln was called to the leadership of the Nation at the beginning of a crisis that threatened our destruction. It was an unprecedented situation of unprecedented problems. A multitude of conflicting counsels beat in on Washington. An influential body of public opinion advocated a do-nothing policy. Even the commander in chief of the national armies, on the day before Lincoln\'s inauguration, wrote in this spirit: ""Say to the seceded States,"" he wrote, ""wayward sisters, depart in peace."" The most distinguished statesman of the time, William H. Seward, Lincoln\'s Secretary of State, advised the President to take the country into a foreign war, in the hope that this might rally the separating States to the defense of the Union. As the long conflict wore on, discouraged patriots urged and urged again a negotiated settlement.', 'Through all this tumult of discordant opinions, under the terrible strain of discouragement and apparent failure, Lincoln kept his head. He thought straight: ""The Union must be preserved."" He never was diverted from his goal. He never faltered. And in the end the policies he had adopted, the forces he had set in motion, carried the country through. The Union was saved. His record, his example, are a priceless heritage to the Nation. They are a constant incentive to every man who occupies a position of leadership in difficult times. They are a living guide to every man who in the Presidential office lives hourly in his invisible presence.', 'We are assembled here today in the midst of a gigantic economic conflict. For the last 3 years we have been beset with forces that threatened our economic structure as truly as the forces unleashed in the War Between the States threatened the structure of the Republic. On other occasions I have compared our present situation to a war on a hundred fronts. I have given some account of these various engagements, and of the general strategy of our campaign.', 'Here at Springfield, with its historic associations, it is appropriate to review briefly the events of that earlier struggle and to consider some of the similarities to the situation that we have met in the last 3 years. We must not press analogies too far. But I believe you will agree with me as we examine the record that certain phases of the conflict between the States will help to better understand our recent events.', 'And first I would call your attention to the suddenness and unexpectedness with which the blow fell that transformed a peaceful people into a people engaged in a desperate war. As we look back now, it seems perfectly clear that the struggle had been in the making for many years. In the light of history, it seems to have been an inevitable conflict between two irreconcilable theories of government. But even as the day of armed conflict approached, the people were busy with the matters of everyday life. If you search the newspaper and magazine files of the time, you will be amazed at the tranquillity shown, in view of what we now know was then impending.', 'As you all remember, the storm broke in the weeks immediately before Lincoln\'s inauguration. The events that followed I need sketch only in the broadest outlines. The first 2 years were a period of almost unrelieved gloom for the Union forces. One disaster followed another and the year 1862 ended with Burnside\'s defeat at Fredericksburg. The year 1863 opened as gloomily with the disaster to Hooker at Chancellorsville. But in July of 1863 the Union retreat was definitely stopped by Meade at Gettysburg and Grant at Vicksburg- Still, the victory was far from won. The draft riots in New York that summer showed how even the North was feeling the strain. The gigantic struggle continued into the 4th year with no decisive outcome in sight. Grant, intrusted with the chief command of the Union forces in March 1864, entered upon the frightful ""wilderness campaign,"" which culminated in the appalling losses at Cold Harbor, June 1 to 3.', 'The Presidential campaign was coming on. A convention of the disaffected met at Cleveland on May 31 and nominated General John C. Fremont for President. The Republican convention met at Baltimore June 7--only 4 days after Cold Harbor.', 'We know now, what could not be known at the time, that the real victory had been won at Gettysburg; that the forces against the Union, gallant as they were, and actuated by the deepest of convictions, had been overcome in the long struggle of the preceding years. Yet this fundamental fact was still obscured by the smoke of battle. The North was still dismayed, almost stunned by the violence of the blows it had received. The casualties of the ""wilderness"" hung like a pall over the land. Would it be possible, men asked, for the Nation to survive ? Was it worthwhile fighting on ?', 'Lincoln was renominated by the Republican Party, but the country was profoundly disheartened. It felt it had made enormous sacrifices and had made them vainly. True, Grant had now advanced on Richmond and had invested the capital of the Confederacy. But early in July, the dashing Jubal Early had appeared in front of Washington, and it looked for a tense moment as if the National Capital itself might fall. A few days later a Federal attempt to break through the defense of Richmond failed disastrously.', 'Bear in mind what I said a moment ago, that the retreat of the Union had been for months definitely stopped and that the advance was already in progress. But the strain had been so long and so heavy that the Nation could not realize what had happened. The wave of discouragement that swept over the country in the summer of 1864 was so extreme that on August 23, Lincoln prepared his famous secret memorandum: ""This morning,"" he wrote, ""as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected. Then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the President. elect as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration, as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards.""', 'Six days later the Democratic National Convention met at Chicago and declared in its platform ""as the sense of the American people, that after 4 years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war . . . justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities."" On that platform, with its appeal to discouragement, discontent, and suffering, the Democratic Convention nominated General George B. McClellan of New York for President.', 'But events marched rapidly. The grand strategy of the general advance, for which the foundation had been laid in the previous 12 months, began to bear fruit. After the gloomy summer of 1864 success attended the Union arms on every front. Sherman captured Atlanta on September 2 and began his march to the sea. Sheridan routed Early at Cedar Creek in October. The President was reelected in November. Thomas destroyed Hood at Nashville in December, and the following April came Appomattox Court House and the end of the war.', 'The transformation from apparent stalemate to overwhelming victory may have seemed amazing to many people at that time. But if it seemed amazing, it was only because people did not understand how well the foundation had been laid in the dark days that preceded and how effectively the strategy had been planned.', 'I believe this brief outline of the progress of events in a crisis that confronted a previous generation may help us to a juster appreciation of what has happened in the years just past and what is happening today.', 'In 1860, as in 1929, the country was unexpectedly faced with a great calamity. Then, as now, the disruptive forces gathered strength and for a time their progress seemed irresistible. Then, as now, the resources of the Nation were mobilized and organized in a campaign that finally ended the initial retreat. Then, as now, advances began here and there, so coordinated as to lead to the final triumph. But then, as now, the Nation had undergone such a strain, it was reeling under so many blows that even after the advance had begun many failed to realize what had happened.', 'Today our opponents are declaring in their platform, in words strangely reminiscent of those used by their predecessors in Chicago 68 years ago, that the struggle of this administration against the depression has been a failure and that ""the only hope of improving present conditions""--I quote from the present Democratic platform-""lies in a drastic change in economic governmental policies."" So in 1864 the Democrats declared that ""after 4 years of failure to restore the Union by the experiment of war""--again I am quoting from their platform--""that immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities."" So again today, as in 1864, in the midst of a great war, they call for a change of leadership and of policies at Washington.', 'In spite of the hardships, privations, and other difficulties of the time, the Nation in 1864 refused to be swerved from a course that had turned the retreat into an advance. It supported the policies whose value had been tested under the fiery strain of the struggle. By its election mandate it directed those to whom it had intrusted leadership to go forward with the campaign strategy whose results already were in evidence. It declined emphatically to turn aside to untried policies and experimental leadership.', 'The same alternatives are before the country today that lay before it in that momentous campaign of nearly three-quarters of a century ago. The choice that the American people made in 1864 was made on November 8. The choice they are called to make in 1932 will be made on November 8 likewise. My fellow citizens, can we doubt what that choice will be ?', 'Men and women--and I include women because they bore then as they do now a large part of the burdens of that struggle--the support of that strategy and that leadership which preserved the Union came from the constancy of the Republican Party in its refusal to be diverted from the leadership which it had given at that time and the leadership which it has given in the last 4 years to the solution of a great national crisis.', 'The turn in the tide of the Civil War was made at Gettysburg. The turn in the tide in this crisis was made in the last winter, and just as after Gettysburg long months of continual battle were required to bring about the saving of the Union, in the same manner we must continue to fight today to recover our prosperity and to preserve the social and political principles for which Abraham Lincoln stood.']"
20,Herbert Hoover ,"November 04, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'From the congressional elections in 1930 down to the present moment the strategy of the Democratic Party has been an effort to implant in the unthinking mind through deliberate misrepresentation the colossal falsehood that the Republican Party is responsible for this worldwide catastrophe. They appealed then to distress, hardship, and radicalism by nebular and inconsistent promises. These are the reasons they give why the Republicans of the country should desert their party, and why the Nation should abandon a constructive program with its accomplishment already demonstrated in overcoming this crisis. Theirs is not a campaign of issues; it is a campaign of avoidances. I propose tonight to discuss the nature of their campaign, its false premises, its vague promises, its shifts of position, and I shall also touch upon their destructive actions which have delayed recovery of this country for months.', 'Despite the fact that Democratic leaders announced after the congressional elections 2 years ago that they would have a real program to end this depression, they produced no program, then as now, although the crisis at one time rose to a degree which endangered the whole Republic. Instead of a constructive program, the Democratic leaders passed a number of bills through the Democratic House of Representatives designed to appeal to discontent and sectional cupidity and indeed of the type that would have destroyed the very foundations of our American system. Its threats to confidence set recovery backward. Their candidates have sought constantly to distort the facts as to the depression; they have sought to minimize the measures by which the administration saved the United States from a generation of chaos. They fail ever to mention the effect that these measures are having day by day in the steady recuperation of our economic life. Their leaders have taken no patriotic satisfaction in the fact that a million men have returned to work since the malign influence of the Democratic House and their allies was removed by adjournment of Congress, and the Republican measures and policies had an opportunity to act. No one of them has mentioned that men are returning to work at the rate of half a million a month.', 'The whole campaign has many aspects parallel with a campaign which took place in a former depression, of which I will read you a short description from a journal published in Washington during that time. That journal said more than half a century ago, and I quote:', '""The circumstances on which the Democratic Party base their hope of success in the present campaign is unquestionably the hardness of the times. Their expectation is that Republican voters will quit their party or at least remain at home on election day because they find themselves in straitened circumstances. Even the ravages of the grasshoppers, damages to the crops by drought in some sections and excessive moisture in others are to be traced by some mysterious process to the maladministration of the Republican Party.""', 'Later on that journal reviews the discussion of expenditures of the Republican administration during the period of depression and pointed out that the House of Representatives was Democratic at that time as it has been during the last year. It stated:', '""There had rarely been such ignorance joined with a stubbornness more mulish than that which characterized the action of some of the leaders of that body.""', 'And it continues:', '""Their economy was of the brilliant description which consists in saving at the spigot and losing at the bung.""', 'They likewise today repeat their promises of economy in the face of the attempts of the Democratic House last winter to fasten $3,400 million of added expenditures upon the Federal Government. The country wisely supported the Republican Party in that election of over a half a century ago, and it promptly made progress.', 'A circular placed in my hands since coming to this State, issued by the Democratic National Committee, says this depression was manmade. I agree with that, but they say the man who made it was myself personally. They express no gratitude that in my manufacture of this world crisis I have let this country off easier than Russia or Western Europe or South America.', 'In this campaign of 1932, also despite overwhelming proof to the contrary, but in order to make unceasing appeal to discontent, the present Democratic candidate and his corps of orators repeat down to the last 24 hours their unceasing statement that the Republicans made this depression and all that has happened in it.', 'Now, in the earlier part of this campaign the Democratic candidate held up the horrors of the Hawley-Smoot tariff act and of the stock market boom as being the sole causes of this world catastrophe. At Des Moines and at Detroit and Indianapolis I frequently established the complete absurdity of his tariff bill argument, and the Governor has since, at Wheeling, Baltimore, and Boston, uttered such confused thoughts in his tariff views that he can no longer consistently or conscientiously state that the tariff had anything to do with the worldwide catastrophe. If he would make his contradictory statements on the tariff consistent, it will have the disastrous political effect of requiring the deletion, so my statisticians tell me, of over 10,000 eloquent words from what has been said during this campaign. In order to continue the false premise on which the Democratic campaign continues to be based-that is, that the Republican Party brought on the depression--he is now thrust back, as his sole remaining explanation, to the boom of 1928. He argues now that if there had never been a boom there never would have been a slump, and if there never had been a slump in the United States, there would never have been a depression in the world.', 'Now, if by maintaining the prosperity of this country over a long period of years the people did become so overconfident of the future and thus overoptimistic, the Republican Party might be praised at least for that long period of prosperity. It was a bad outbreak of overoptimism and overconfidence. The collapse of the boom brought about great losses and great suffering, but I submit that some of the greatest leaders amongst the boom promoters of that period belonged to the Democratic Party, and the Democratic candidate himself assisted actually in promotions during that period which he now so warmly denounces. I do not criticize his acts. They were honest formations of concern. He was merely participating in the prevailing mood, like the former Democratic candidate who undertook the construction of the tallest building in the world in the same boomtown.', 'Of more importance, the Governor in his speeches conveys the impression that as President I should have stopped the boom. He does not describe the method by which I should have stopped it. Of course there is no constitutional nor statutory authority to Presidents to stop booms. If the President had attempted to stop that boom, one of the persons that he would have needed to warn is the present Democratic candidate.', 'Now, the only way I can see that a President could even tilt with a boom would be to turn himself personally into a blue sky law and go on the stump analyzing balance sheets and stock market prices and proving to the people that their investments were wrong. Now, I have little taste for this proposal that the White House should be turned into a stock tipster\'s office. I earnestly object to the idea that such a form of dictatorship should ever be set up over the American people, even if they do get overoptimistic. It may lead in directions for which this Republic would be mighty sorry. Even the Democratic platform does not seem to accord with the Governor, for it says: ""We condemn the actions of high public officials designed to influence stock market prices.""', 'Now, this same sort of reasoning led the Governor to propose in this city that the Presidential influence should be used in municipal finance. He said: ""If necessary they must be compelled to walk in the way of municipal honesty and efficiency,"" and he added: ""This is what I propose to do toward the credit represented by the 17 billions of municipal bonds."" It occurs to me that we should need to revise our whole form of government and the Constitution of the United States in a dozen places if the President of the United States is to supervise municipalities and mayors.', 'The Governor seems law to prevent booms to have some idea of creating a Federal blue sky and control the issue of all sorts of securities. I am not disputing that many securities are issued which are dishonest and over which there should be a control. But, the full constitutional authority for that sort of action rests, of course, in the States, and I am advised that this is not within the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. In any event, even if it were, I doubt whether the people in any State in the Union would like to have another board in Washington, distant from their own close inspection and understanding, dealing out certificates as to issue of securities and thus controlling the industries of their States. In any event, his plan would be centralization of government beyond anything we have hitherto witnessed and does not seem to accord with the forgotten Democratic theory of State rights. All this has been within the power of the State of New York not only to protect its own citizens but the citizens of other States, and the Governor seems to have forgotten it until this campaign.', 'Many years ago the Democratic Party undertook to remedy this whole question of booms and slumps by the creation of the Federal Reserve System. We have been afflicted with 15 of them in a century. They do bring disaster and hardship, and they ought to be remedied. But their new discovery was that, far from wanting the President to do this job, they should set up an agency and in it stipulate that the board alone should have powers entirely independent of the President, and they further made the board entirely bipartisan.', 'Now, it was indeed promised by Democratic leaders at the time the Federal Reserve System was created that they had found the solution to prevent booms, slumps, and panics. I could quote from a multitude of speeches of the day of the passage of the act, and further from: the assurance given in political campaigns as to this enormous accomplishment of their party.', 'I find in speeches of President Wilson, Secretary McAdoo, Senator Carter Glass, and other leaders, the recurrent idea that through the control of interest rates and other authorities the Federal Reserve System could prevent booms and consequently slumps and panics.', 'A few of their expressions ought to be of interest. Among them they said:', '""We shall have no more financial panics.""', '""Panics are impossible.""', '""Businessmen can now proceed in perfect confidence that they will no longer put their property in peril .""', '""Now the businessman may work out his destiny without living in terror of panic and hard times.""', '""Panics in the future are unthinkable.""', '""Never again can panic come to the American people.""', 'And I will not weary you with more quotations.', 'The whole country went along for years with much confidence in these statements and, although no one can say with certainty, it is likely that this confidence contributed to the building up of the boom which led to the crash.', 'The Governor will discover his errors in connection with the responsibilities for this boom if he will examine its relation to the Federal Reserve System. That System did loyally endeavor to restrain speculation. Many months before the collapse, it issued warnings to the banks about loaning money for speculative purposes, and it gave these warnings to the public. It placed restrictions on rediscounts, and they did force up the interest rate for speculative money to 15 and even to 20 percent. But that did not stop the mania for speculation. I do not criticize the Federal Reserve System. I believe in it. All the point I make is that using its utmost powers it failed in the face of a great mass movement-public psychology. Now the blame is to be transferred to the Republican Party for having failed to do the job which they promised would be done by the panacea of their own institution.', 'I could go further with this argument of futility by pointing out that the leading Democrats did not discover the Republican responsibility for this depression until it reached the vote-getting stage. Governor Smith, 2 years ago, implied that neither he nor any man takes the position of placing the responsibility for the business depression on either the President or the Republican Party. And Governor Roosevelt, before he was nominated, made a characteristically vague statement of much the same character.', 'The Democratic candidate, in a recent speech defending his boom argument, said that when our boom collapsed all but 20 percent of the people of the world were in a state of high prosperity. If he will examine carefully a statement of the National Bureau of Economic Research, whose authority no one denies, he will find that the booms of the following nations had already collapsed: Germany, Australia, Japan, Mexico, Turkey, Rumania, Bolivia, Brazil, India, Poland, and Bulgaria, embracing 600 million people, and that coincidently 11 other nations had been affected by the collapses I have mentioned--that is, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Hungary, Italy, Argentina, South Africa, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Peru, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain, had all declined. If he will check up the portion of the world included in these nations, he will find he has been misinformed about 300 percent.', 'As a matter of fact, if the Democratic candidate actually wants to make a point of the boom question and if he wants to put the true causes of this situation before the American people, he should with draw all this multitude of conflicting, confusing, and misleading statements and disclose to the American people that the most tremendous fact in modern history was the Great War and its aftermath. It would be only fair to point out that the difficulties we are now struggling with even within the United States consist to a large degree in the tremendous increase of our public debt, our foreign war debts, the liquidation of war inflation, the necessity to maintain a larger army and navy to protect ourselves in a greatly disturbed world. This war having come on during a Democratic administration, and they having spent the money, they should not have forgotten that the undertakings of that period are what create a multitude of the difficulties of this country today. If they would find the foundations of statesmanship, they ought to frankly recognize the problem with which the American people are faced. They should not be appealing to discontent on a basis of ignorance and of their full participation in the real causes. If they wish to find solutions for the guidance of the American people through these times, they should not continue to ignore these great burdens imposed upon the United States nor the effect on the world, ourselves included, by the enormous blotting out of lives in foreign nations by the World War, the fabulous waste of their property, the fabulous increase of their debts, the fabulous increase of armaments, the continued friction and hate that have arisen among them out of harsh treaties.', 'The Democratic candidate should not continue to ignore the panics which overtook these nations when their citizens recognized the fact that all property and material wealth must be readjusted in values from the consequences of the war. He should not overlook the frantic attempts of their governments to reduce the expenditures of their people by reducing the import of goods; the scramble of their citizens to turn what property they could into gold; the ultimate results in dictatorships and upsets in governments. He should not continue to ignore the effect of these things upon the United States and the dangers which so accumulated that we became the last fortress of world economic stability, and at one moment we held even that by the narrowest of margins. He should recognize the effect of the stoppage of the import of goods by these governments, not out of tariff reprisals to the Hawley Smoot bill, but out of their public necessity.', 'He should recognize the effect upon our credit system of the foreign withdrawal of $2,400 million in credit and gold from the United States in less than 14 months. He should recognize the fears which these events produced in our own citizens, causing them to draw out $1,600 million and put it into hoarding. And he should cease to ignore the fact that we were faced with a crisis of such dimensions that unless strong action had been taken in the passage of a bill for which Democratic Members of Congress voted, with the full knowledge of the facts, we could not have held the gold standard in the United States. And he should recognize that unless we had taken other strong and unprecedented measures we could not have prevented the collapse of our insurance companies, our banks, the foreclosures on millions of homes and farms, the strangulation of credit which would have brought about almost total unemployment.', 'It is true the Democratic Members voted for these measures of giving increased authority to the Federal Reserve System, of creating the Reconstruction Corporation, of support of mortgage banks. I admire their patriotism, and I have expressed it always. But if they did it without a knowledge of the facts of which they now appear to be so innocent, they are an easier group to persuade into legislation than I have hitherto met. They now fail to admit that these measures which we have put into motion have begun to bring about stability and prosperity in the United States, of which there is need of but one word more of proof. That is that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives and their allies last July down to this moment, over 1 million men have gone back to their normal jobs. They are going back at the rate of 500,000 a month unless they are interrupted by a change in these policies.', 'Now all of this statement that I have given to you has importance in four respects: first, because it proves the falsity of the foundation of their campaign; second, because it shows their utter confusion of mind, and either their insincerity or their utter lack of grasp of the forces loose in the world, and consequently the danger of placing men who have such a lack of penetration into the control of the Government of 120 million American people; third, because the continuous broadcasting of misinformation, although it is daily of conflicting character, as to where this calamity came from, indicates an irresponsibility which does not promise well for the Government of these same 120 million people; fourth, because they, as a responsible political party, should cease to appeal to unthinking people for votes based upon their suffering by misleading them as to its causes.', 'Having again disposed of the futile misrepresentations and evasions of the origins of this depression and the false basis of their appeal, I shall now consider some of their other evasions which have developed in the campaign. The Democratic candidate in his speech of acceptance says he will leave no doubt or ambiguity as to where he stands on any question of moment now before the country.', 'Notwithstanding this disarming promise, the people are still unable to find the method by which he will execute his six-point program for farm relief. It is one of the great mysteries of this campaign. It is a certainty that there will be six doors of exit from this attractive house, although he refuses to disclose the other specifications, and the walls have not yet been built.', ""The people have yet to learn what he proposes to do in respect to the soldiers' bonus. He seems to think that a cash sum of $2,300 million to be paid 13 years hence is no different from cash today, but he says that he intends it should be paid when there is a surplus in the Treasury with which to pay it. That means a surplus of $2,300 million. I assure the veterans of the World War that so long as there is a Democratic Congress there never will be a surplus of $2,300 million."", 'The people deserve to know more of his promise to take $1 billion off the expenditures of Federal Government, and before they can even start figuring on this question they must know whether he repudiates the Democratic proposals for $3 1/2 million additional expenditures which were passed by the House of Representatives in the last session of Congress. Does he repudiate the pork barrel and other expenditure bills ?', 'Now, the people deserve to know why, even at this late date, the Democratic candidate has not disavowed the bill passed by the Democratic House of Representatives to issue more than $2 billion of greenback currency, which bill, so far as Mr. Garner is concerned, remains upon the calendar as unfinished business of the Democratic House.', ""The people deserve to know why he has not yet stated his position on the proposal to put the Government into personal banking, as Provided in the bill passed by the last House of Representatives and in fact by the entire Congress under Mr. Garner's leadership, which I vetoed."", 'The people deserve to know his views on the rubber dollar provided for in the last session and passed by the last House of Representatives.', 'The people deserve to know what all his phrases and reservations about the Hawley-Smoot protective tariff really mean. He condemns it on every occasion. He gives 100 percent support to the competitive tariff for revenue. He gives nebular implications in such speeches as those at Wheeling, Baltimore, and Boston, that he will protect certain groups. Now the tariff is composed of different schedules. If he is sufficiently informed on the tariff law to debate its merits, he must be sufficiently informed to say at once which schedules are too high and which are too low. If he will do so, we will at once have them examined by the Tariff Commission as to the truth of his assertions, and we can afford quick remedy if his facts are correct. His only answer seems to be that he would do away with the Tariff Commission.', 'Now, the people deserve to know whether, as he has proposed to negotiate reciprocal tariffs, he will omit the agricultural commodities from these agreements.', 'The people deserve to know whether the Democratic State Committee of Oklahoma has the authority of the Democratic leaders for their promise to the people of that State to secure Federal legislation which will pour into that State $150 million for liquidation of long since repudiated Indian claims at the expense of the Federal taxpayer.', 'The American farmer deserves to know whether he is going to withdraw the Shearon letter 1--that is the proposal circulated amongst our unemployed to vastly expand reclamation land and thereby increase their surpluses despite the assurances given in another public statement that these surpluses must be reduced.', '1 See Item 347, page 588.', 'The people deserve to know whether he will support or repudiate Messrs. Wheeler, Norris, Huey Long, W. R. Hearst, and others, in their long-continued efforts to put the Government into large business undertakings.', 'The people deserve to know more details on the promise set out in the Shearon letter that the whole of the unemployed in the United States will be at once given jobs by the Government.', 'Are the people to assume that he does or does not endorse the system of national doles advocated in Congress by his present supporter, Senator La Follette of Wisconsin ?', 'The people deserve to know whether he has accepted the proposal of his supporter, William R. Hearst, for a $5 billion bond issue for nonproductive public works to be paid for out of the Public Treasury by the taxpayer.', 'They deserve to know if he joins with the same William Randolph Hearst in his opposition to the Disarmament Conference now in progress. Does he join with Mr. Hearst in his opposition to the promotion of peace by the Kellogg Pact?', 'The people ought to know if he still holds to his promise to solve the foreign debt problem by permitting foreign nations to sell goods in this country with which to pay sums owed our Government. In other words, are we, by giving up part of our market at the expense of our own workmen and our farmers, to furnish our debtors with profits necessary to make payments to us ?', 'He has been very emphatic on the provision of distress relief. That is also perfectly safe because the Government has provided for loans to the States in need of help to provide them with such relief.', 'Now, the evasions and misleading character of the campaign of the Democratic Party are not less evident in their program for dealing with the 18th amendment than in the other questions they have discussed. They know that their own Democratic strongholds in the South, if no other, will not accept the proposal for outright repeal of the 18th amendment, with the consequent return of the saloon, and its resultant lack of protection of the dry States.', 'I have stated in my acceptance speech what I believe is the only practical common ground with adequate protection on which this whole question can reach solution. That statement was the result of 3 years of intensive study and the responsibility of experience with the problem. It was delivered to probably the largest audience of the radio and press ever gathered together in the United States. It is known to you. It is a matter of public record.', 'Our Democratic opponents are trying to make another false issue over supposed coercion of voters by employers. In the first place, the ballot in the United States is secret, and no one can coerce a voter-except a political machine. In the second place, the interest of employer and employee is identical in securing business on which they mutually live. The Republican employer has the same right to publicly express his opinion on this election as has the Democratic employer and the Democratic orator.', 'Now, it is with sadness that I see attempts to mislead the people and avoid the real issues of the hour which demands a campaign of the most serious order.', 'I do not have the time tonight to present the whole great constructive measures of the administration by which we defended the American people from acute danger of a generation of chaos out of this world disaster. These measures are now placing us upon the road to recovery. They are vast and complicated. I think perhaps I can best illustrate the working of two of them--two out of scores--by short examples.', ""I would like to have you picture a group of gentlemen sitting in the board room of the Federal Reserve bank in one of our important cities 1,000 miles from Washington. Another similar group is seated in the board room of another Federal Reserve bank in a city some 200 miles from Washington. A group of advisers is seated with the President of the United States. Both of the city groups included Governors of the Federal Reserve banks, Directors of the Reconstruction Corporation, together with the leading bankers and merchants of those two cities, embracing men of both political parties. It was Sunday afternoon, and all had been summoned on a few moments' notice to meet a grave emergency. These three groups were continuously in communication by long distance telephone."", 'During the preceding week there had been a general run upon the banks in one of these important cities. Through Saturday evening and Sunday, panic increased and began to spread like a contagion to the whole district.', 'The banks were under heavy pressure because of the frightened depositors and the inability of the banks in the midst of the crisis to make a quick sale of their long-term securities without such tremendous sacrifice as to imperil all of their depositors or in turn to force the payment of notes of an army of borrowers without in turn forcing them to sell their homes and business at half price. It was found that one of the banks in one of these great cities had been weakened more than the others by these panic-stricken depositors. Without assistance, that bank would be unable to open on the following Monday morning. The failure of that bank to continue business would have added to the panic which threatened to bring down other banks in that city and spread in turn to other cities and involve many trust and insurance companies. The immediate problem was to provide before Monday morning a sufficient sum of money to quiet unreasoning fear and give absolute assurance that funds were available to pay every depositor in full without question.', 'In the course of inquiry upon the condition of the bank, it was found that they had ample securities which in normal times could have paid out their depositors with wide margins. But the securities could not be instantly sold at any price or at least at a price which would produce sufficient to pay all depositors, and they could not collect instantly from the note holders. In the inquiry into the condition of that bank, it developed they had 122,000 depositors, of whom 105,000 were savings depositors; that the average of the savings deposits was only $140 each; that many of them were workingmen and even children; that the safety of these depositors could not be separated from the other depositors of the bank.', 'It was found that there were 17,000 commercial depositors, most of whom were men and women engaged in small businesses, whose deposits represented the money necessary to meet their payrolls, the purchasing of their materials, and the discharge of obligations to others incurred in the course of their business. Jeopardy to them meant that many thousands of men and women in factories and stores would be discharged into untold hardship.', 'But these were not all of those that were dependent upon the maintenance of this bank. It was found that among the 17,000 commercial deposits 755 were country banks, the great majority of them in towns of less than 5,000 people. If this bank should fail, many of these country banks must also fall.', 'In the complex system of our economic life, things that on the surface seem unrelated are in fact under the surface inextricably tied together. A farmer in a small town in an agricultural State might feel no concern for the safety of this important bank in a great city. The widow with a small deposit in a small bank of a town of another State might know of no relationship between her bank and that city bank. But the farmer in one State and the widow in another, even though they did not know it, had a direct financial stake in the fate of that city bank. For the country banks must conduct business with the city banks in the ordinary course of trade, and they must carry their reserves with the city banks in order that they may draw interest upon them which they in turn pay to their depositors.', 'Now, it was found on examination that these 755 depositing banks had 60 million depositors scattered over 15 States, and that was not all. There were 21,000 other banks scattered through the country, which had deposits in the 755 banks depositing with this particular city bank, and in these 21,000 banks were over 20 million depositors, and they involved widows, orphans, workers, insurance companies, and merchants and manufacturers.', 'And in addition to all this, there was the position of the borrowers from all this mass of banks. If this city bank should fail, there must be immediate demand for the payment of the money due from its borrowers. If any of the banks dependent upon it should fail, their borrowers must in turn be compelled to make immediate payment of money due as it was due and to realize upon their property at a time when property could not be turned into cash at anything like its real value. Now, I will not tire you with these statistics, but they are important that our country should understand.', 'In this city bank and in the 755 banks which carried their reserve deposits in this city bank, there were 695,000 men and women and institutions owing money on their notes. They were scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land. They were on the farms, in the cities, the villages and hamlets. Most of all these groups of people were unaware of their danger. They were in their homes and in their churches, concerned with their own affairs, but they were not being forgotten.', 'The men who had conducted this bank over great numbers of years were men of high esteem in the whole community. To their credit be it said that their chief concern was the preservation of these hundreds of thousands or millions of people from disaster. They were asking nothing for themselves.', 'The investigations and the conversations occupied many hours of continuous communication from these two cities to Washington and back again. Remember this was a Sunday, when the normal processes of business were difficult to conduct. Countless difficulties were encountered and solutions worked out. They were working against time.', 'Finally, at 3 hours after Sunday midnight, that task was completed. The assets had been valued by the examiners of the Reconstruction Corporation. The banks of the two cities joined in lending assistance, and the Reconstruction Corporation agreed to furnish a sufficient sum to assure that this bank could open without fear and meet every demand of its depositors.', ""At 10 o'clock on Monday all these banks opened for business as usual. Public announcement was made that ample funds were on hand to pay every depositor. As had been anticipated, immediately excitement and panic subsided and confidence was restored. The crowds melted away, and the deposits began to return. The situation was saved, not only in this bank, but in all of the other banks which had been subject to heavy withdrawals."", 'The loans offered by the cooperating banks and the Reconstruction Corporation were never fully called for and have since been largely repaid, and they will all be repaid. Every danger in connection with that episode is now over.', 'The central human figure of that bank was a man, known to you in St. Louis, who had served his country for 40 years in many high capacities--both in peace and in war--who in recent years had been absent from the country in a position of first importance to the American people.', 'That is the story of the Dawes bank in Chicago.', 'You know the use our political opponents have made of this dent all through the Midwest. They ignore the fact that General Dawes resigned from the Reconstruction Corporation 3 weeks before, on his first news that attacks were being made on the bank with which his name had long been associated. He resigned to try to save that bank without a call on the Reconstruction Corporation of which he had been a Director. He knew and appreciated the use that would be made in this campaign of such a calumny. He sought to avoid it. And you should know that when that Sunday morning meeting started, General Dawes stated that he could not bring himself to ask for assistance from the Corporation in which he had so lately been a Director and thus involve the President of the United States in criticism. But it was upon the insistence of the Democratic members of the Reconstruction Board, sitting in the Federal Reserve bank meeting at Chicago, and upon the insistence of the leading Democratic banker of Chicago, who was then mentioned as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, and upon the insistence in New York City of the leading Democratic banker and a leading Democratic manufacturer, also mentioned for the Presidency; upon insistence of the other Democratic members of the Reconstruction Corporation as well as the Republicans that this was no case of personal feelings for General Dawes or the effect upon the campaign or this administration; that this was solely a case of national necessity, and those men then and there joined and offered to take the full responsibility for that action.', 'These men acted not because they were Democrats or Republicans but because they were loyal citizens of the United States. That situation required broad vision and comprehensive understanding of the problem, instant decision, bold and courageous action, and a human heart. Only by this was a major disaster averted. And I may tell you that not only were these loans adequately secured, but in the ordinary course of business they are being largely paid off.', 'The constant misrepresentation of this episode for political purposes by Democratic politicians is a slander upon men of their own party as well as a cruel injustice to General Dawes. It is a characteristic example of the character of this campaign. It is an insult to the American people to substitute this sort of political agitation for competent discussion of the grave issues which lay today before our country.', 'And I may tell you that this is but one of six similar episodes in great financial centers in the United States, the direct result of the shocks and fears which we received from the collapse of Europe. But such action by our Government agencies has not been limited to great financial centers. In over 5,000 towns of populations under 25,000 the Reconstruction Corporation has had to intervene to save their banks under similar circumstances and thank God that day has gone by. At the height of this crisis they had to make loans to insurance companies with 15 million policyholders. They made loans to 736 building and loan associations with over 10 million members. They made loans to several hundred farm and home mortgage companies, agricultural credit associations, livestock credit corporations--all of them for the purpose of preventing the loss of hundreds of thousands of homes and farms and the destruction of family life. The totals today aggregate millions of men and women who were not forgotten.', 'I have gone into this matter at such length to illustrate to you by actual example what the operation of the Reconstruction Corporation has meant. This is an example of the meaning of my oft-repeated phrase about the use by the Federal Government of the full power of its credit in time of great national emergency for the protection of millions of families and firesides.', 'The Democratic candidate for President has since the beginning of the campaign been going up and down the country characterizing the Reconstruction Corporation and maintaining that its actions have been for the benefit of large corporations and not for the benefit of the ordinary citizen. Can he honestly believe that in the incident I have described to you and in the countless similar cases, the action was taken for the benefit of the bank and not for the depositors and borrowers? When these loans have been repaid, there has been no benefit to the banks. There has been the preservation of the lives of millions of people.', ""[At this point, the transcript taken from a sound recording of the President's address ends. The following text is taken from the President's reading copy.]"", 'If he does not so believe, then I say in all solemnity that his action in fostering a spirit of discontent in a political campaign by the use of erroneous information merits just condemnation.', 'One of his first utterances to this effect was immediately challenged by a prominent citizen of his own State, a former superintendent of banks, who addressed a letter to him setting forth the real facts and requesting a retraction. Weeks have now elapsed, and that request has been met only by silence upon the part of the candidate.', 'Now I wish to picture to you another episode in this supreme battle to protect the American people, the last fortress of stability in the world, but at the same time to extend a helping arm of assistance to another great nation.', 'In the latter part of May a year ago Ambassador Sackett made an emergency journey from Berlin to see me to present to me the desperate situation of the German people. His evidence showed that under the burden of unbearable debts and the cost of war, that great nation was rapidly disintegrating and the people desperately discouraged. They had made a courageous effort to meet these obligations, but their discharge was inexorably undermining their whole economic and social structure. In desperation, those who had fought manfully to comply with the obligations imposed upon them had lost all heart for the future and were steadily coming to the conclusion that nothing short of a revolution such as that which had taken place in Russia offered them any hope of deliverance.', ""Moved by the Ambassador's picture of what was happening to the common run of men and women in that country, I took up that problem, not alone from the interest of this great mass of humanity, but knowing that, if that nation should fall, the reactions upon the rest of the world and the United States would be irreparable. President von Hindenburg, knowing of Mr. Sackett's visit, sent me an appeal of a character between heads of nations without precedent in diplomatic history. That appeal was for preservation of a great people that I should use the good offices and prestige of the United States for their rescue."", 'In order to give a year in which the world, particularly European nations, could come to a comprehension of what this disintegration was doing to civilization itself, I proposed the postponement of all international debts for 1 year.', 'This was not easy to accomplish. The bitterness of war hates and nationalism, still rampant in Europe, made its acceptance doubtful. In order to make sure that it would be accepted in our country I interviewed the leaders of both Republican and Democratic parties, and upon display to them of what was transpiring, secured their approval in sufficient number to assure that we could complete the measure on our side. I then resolved upon a bold course. I published the proposal within 24 hours after communications to the other countries in order that politicians of the world might not thwart it through processes of diplomacy.', 'Immediately after this act, for the first time in the history of the world, I made personal, hourly use of the newly installed transatlantic telephone and talked with our ambassadors in the presence of the leaders of the nations. I received wholehearted and immediate response from Signor Mussolini of Italy; the same sympathetic response from the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Furthermore, the Governments of Belgium and Poland, which you might think would have retained more bitterness from the war than any other nations, responded instantly.', 'The arrangements were not easy, as existing contracts were complicated in their relationships between many nations, and they involved unequal sacrifices. Day after day, night after night, I was in communication with first one ambassador and then another, proposing methods to meet difficulties which arose, building up adjustments among different nations, until finally that year of postponement w-as secured.', 'And it was not merely a postponement of a year in the payments on debts for which I was seeking. I was seeking for a year in which Europe could solemnly consider the situation into which she was drifting. I was seeking to remove from the mind of the world the fears of debacle in civilization which were breaking down all security of credit, and to bring to their attention the healing powers of international cooperation.', 'You yourselves are familiar with the history of the year which followed. I know that the proposal of the moratorium diverted the entire current of thought and changed the history of what otherwise would have been a tragedy to the whole of civilization. It brought to new understanding the realization of the burdens under which Germany has been laboring.', 'Under the impulses of these agreements and the recognition at least of the peril in which they stood, there came out of this agreement a great measure of redemption to the German people, a sense of greater security to the world from the agreements at Lausanne.', 'That agreement and the human sympathies which were evoked by that new understanding of the postwar difficulties in the world have served greatly in the healing of the wounds of the Great War.', ""There lie in many events of the last 3 years great dramas, great tragedies. I have told of but two of them. But, overriding all these incidents, the world has witnessed the courage of men and the willingness to place their fate and their political future at stake for the world's progress. No man can go through these episodes without belief that there is a great regeneration in the courage, confidence, and intelligence of men for the guidance of this world back toward stability and common interest in the development of human welfare.""]"

I used my voice pretty much last night, and I am going to have to use it again tonight. But I do want to express my appreciation to you for this greeting. It is generous. It indicates that you get up powerful early in the morning, but what is more, it indicates what you are likely to do on the 8th day of November, which is more important.', '[2.] ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS (Rear platform, 8:30a.m.)', ""You will realize that an occasion of this sort is not one on which one can go far into national issues. You will also realize that it is rather difficult on one's voice to be making public addresses at night and still talk outdoors in the daytime. Nevertheless, I would like to remind you of one national issue that is of vital importance to you, and that is that a long series of unprecedented steps and measures have been taken by this administration to protect this country from the catastrophe that swept over this country from Europe; that these measures have begun to show their vitality and their results; that since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives they have had a fair chance and during these last 4 months clearly show the reemployment of nearly 1 million men, and they are going back at the rate of 500,000 a month. The reemployment of these men adds to the market for the farmer, and thereby we shall see the restoration of this economic machine of ours, provided that it is not interrupted on the 8th day of November."", 'There is one other issue that is of vital importance to Rockford, and that is the continued maintenance of the protective tariff. The tariff is being greatly undermined through the falling currencies of Europe. These currencies have fallen through the catastrophies which have come to those countries, with which the United States has had no relation. It has decreased their cost of living and their wages, which makes it more difficult for American manufacturers and workmen to maintain their standards of living and wages.', 'And our Democratic opponents, in the face of the actual decrease in currency that is going on today through these causes, now propose to further reduce the tariff. Already two or three plants in different parts of the country have closed down because of this competition. We have set up through the Tariff Commission a method of remedy. We are proceeding as rapidly as possible toward that remedy. Our opponents propose to destroy the Tariff Commission. In other words, they cannot use information in the West with regard to the tariff which differs from the information which they use in the East.', 'I thank you for your reception. It is encouraging, and I am deeply touched by it.', '[3.] BELVIDERE, ILLINOIS (Rear platform, 9:35 a.m.)', 'I always find it difficult to formulate the phrases that express the gratitude which I feel for these receptions. They are encouraging to continue this fight, and they are an evidence oœ the support which you are going to give to us on the 8th day of November.', 'Every one of you has an interest in this election that is an interest to you personally. You have in this city an interest in the maintenance of the protective tariff. Your manufactures here are all of them protected, and the jobs of the men in the factories here are protected through the tariff. We have not only to meet today the normal competition of the world with our manufactures, but we have to meet, as the result of the cataclysm which has come over Europe, the effect of their depreciated currencies. Those currencies have lowered wages, lowered standards of living, and have made competition with you more severe than ever before in your history.', 'Our Democratic friends, in the face of these added difficulties, say they will lower the tariff and destroy the protection which you now have. They wish a competitive tariff for revenue only, and they are asking you to undertake competition with the lower-paid labor of the world.', ""Not long ago I had a survey made as to the standards of living in different countries. We used as a common denominator the amount of bread and butter that could be purchased with a week's wages. We found that in Japan, which is now exporting to the United States large quantities of goods, that the Japanese workman could buy only one-eighth of the amount of bread and butter which you can buy with your present wage scale. That is the sort of competition which you are expected to meet in a competitive tariff for revenue only. Our party is not alone to maintain the protective tariff but to increase it wherever it may be necessary in order to maintain American workmen in their jobs."", 'You have many other things which interest you personally. Above all, the primary issue of this campaign is the measures which are to be continued for the recovery of the country from its unemployment and the distressing plight of its agriculture. The Republican administration has set up a long list of instrumentalities that are engaged in that purpose today, and they are succeeding since the adjournment of the Democratic House of Representatives. We have approximately 4 months to test out the efficacy of those measures, and during that time over 1 million men have been returned to their jobs. They are returning now at the rate of 500,000 a month. And it is in the restoration of employment that we shall secure the added markets and the added prices to our agriculture.', 'Now, I could go on and discuss national issues, but length of time does not permit.

I thank you for it. It is a sign of what Wisconsin will do on the 8th day of November.', 'Now, this is not an occasion on which one can discuss national issues at great length. I speak again in St. Paul tonight, and I hope that you may through the radio participate in that discussion.', 'I have long known of Beloit more through her college than through her larger activities. I live myself in a college town. For 40 years I have had association with their ideals and dreams, and I value them greatly, and I envy any citizen privileged to live in a community that has so much of a fermenting ( ? ) 1 influence as a great college.', '1 The question mark appears in the original transcript.', 'There are other matters of great interest to you in this campaign and in this forthcoming election. One of them is the protective tariff.', '[At this point the train pulled out oœ the station without allowing the President to finish his remarks.]', '[5.] MADISON, WISCONSIN ( University of Wisconsin Fieldhouse, 12 noon )', 'It is a great pleasure to come to a city which has made itself famous by the contribution of a great university to the thought and leadership in modern life. My own home for 40 years has been on the campus of another great university, and I have valued to the highest degree the constant refreshment that has come to me from the idealism and dreams of youth who come to these institutions to fit themselves for this leadership in national life. I know your minds are alive to the great problems of our times, and that you are conscious of the new forces that have entered into the world and into our national life.', 'It is not my purpose to discuss at length with you economic issues. I would rather discuss with you those fundamentals for which America stands. These fundamentals are being tested daily in this the greatest peacetime crisis that has come to our country. We have builded a nation on certain conceptions of equality and personal freedom that are unique in the whole world. As a people we have sought a system that would give opportunity and stimulate each individual to his intellectual uttermost, and by the accretion of the contributions to thus enrich national life and to produce progress and through the sum of them to produce a new intellectual standard for the world and the guarantee of a national progress that will be worth all we have poured into it. We have created political equalities. We have created equality for men at birth, equality of men before the law, and we have set the ideal of an equal opportunity for all men and women. However much it may have fallen short of the ideal, it is yet infinitely more advanced than that held up before men in any other nation in the world. By these social conceptions, by the form of government, there have been created and given to our people the opportunity of expression that has set new standards, created a unique society in the world.', 'A fundamental part of this equality of opportunity and the part in which the United States is unique and envied of all people is our system of universal free education, by which the child of the humblest farm may learn from the alphabet to the Einstein theory--all that the mind of man has accumulated down the ages for his instruction and equipment to meet the battle of life. So zealous have we been to maintain this fundamental of an equal opportunity of men, and the sum of these accomplishments which produce the progress of the Nation, that it is not remarkable that, in the fullness of the freedom which we have protected, there has periodically appeared in our history its transformation into license, especially in the economic field and field of crime, which must be vigilantly restrained. Our fundamental purpose is the development of moral and spiritual growth and the strengthening of national ideals and national character. But in the restraints we have had to be constantly on guard that we do not stifle the intellectual opportunities and the initiative of men, for out of these flows the new strength upon which the Nation constantly feeds. We are, therefore, constantly confronted with the degree to which these restraints can be set up and still preserve that vital initiative and intellectual freedom which have elements of self-control which belong alone to self-government. On the other side we have to constantly guard lest in our restraints we regiment men instead of creating free men.', 'One of the very pertinent questions which arise out of this liberal license to men is the violation of law. Lawlessness and crime have unquestionably grown in our country. Some ascribe it to the too great license of individual liberty; some to the breaking down of moral restraints due to the Great War; and some to prohibition and a hundred other causes. Some have urged that we must change the whole basis of our Federal system, and that we should place the burden of this restraint upon the Federal Government because of the failure of some States and some municipalities to give proper function to their own responsibilities. Yet this would be a destruction of State sovereignty and local responsibility, the destruction of individual responsibility, and make a nation of vassals through bureaucracy concentrated at a far distant point.', 'The responsibility for the control of crime rests emphatically upon the States and the local communities. Our civilization will rise no higher than the concepts of order that reside in the self-control of an educated people. I think you are all conscious of the humiliation that comes to our countrymen when the Federal Government must deliberately use the violation of income ,tax laws to collect gains on crime in order to curb these criminals who are uncontrolled, unprosecuted, and unconvicted by the States and municipalities.', 'I can discuss this subject with more heart in the State of Wisconsin than any other State in the Union, because you have recognized your responsibilities, and you have sought to preserve your people from the forms of crime which in other places dictate the very conduct of communities, and indicate a clear sense of responsibility and vigilance in your people.', 'The gangster life which has developed in some of our cities and some of our States is one of the most dangerous elements to the whole of our civilization. It would seem that with the opportunities that were given the Governor of New York, who is a candidate for the Presidency of the United States, he might have made a larger contribution in these last 3 years to the solution of the gang life in that State, under the great powers conferred and the obligations bestowed by the constitution and laws of his own State.', 'Now, for a moment on economic issues.', 'The workers in the great industries of Wisconsin, both agricultural and industrial, are peculiarly dependent for their standards of living as never before upon the maintenance of the protective tariff. Dependent also is the fate of the small businessman upon the prosperity which must be thus protected. In the agricultural field I need only to refer to your great dairy industry where you lead the entire Union. Today its products, distressingly low as their prices are, would be 20 to 30 percent lower if it were not for the tariff wall which surrounds them. The consequence of the collapse of 30 foreign governments and the consequent depreciation of their currency, which means also the lowering of their wages and standards of living, are constantly endeavoring to make breaches in our tariff walls which [have] retard[ed] the recuperation in agriculture during the whole of these last 6 or 8 months. This has indeed grown to such a point of seriousness that you have need to consider, not the reduction of these tariffs which our Democratic opponents propose, but the strengthening of this wall of protection. Fortunately we have been able to thwart our opponents in their endeavor to destroy the independent authority of the Tariff Commission with its flexible potencies. We now have before that Commission a reconsideration of the necessities of this primary industry in your State.', 'Nor are your manufacturing industries less dependent upon it than your agricultural industries. Without the protective tariff, with the lowering of the tariffs which our opponents propose, you must be faced with an increasing unemployment instead of the steady march of recovery and of employment which are evident on every hand. We have passed, in the last 3 years, through the greatest crisis in our peacetime history. We have witnessed the economic crash of two-thirds of the world, and its repercussions have moved in upon our people in a manner which has at times endangered even our national stability. We have been the last fortress of strength in a crashing world. By the unprecedented measures, which we have taken we have prevented a chaos which might have extended over generations.', 'This battle of defense has now through these measures been turned into a great offensive for recovery. There was little opportunity for it to make itself felt in recovery until after the adjournment of Congress, with their constant destruction of confidence and spreading of fears from measures which were being presented to the American people and passed by a Democratic House of Representatives. But in these 4 months since that time we have seen the return of 1 million men to work, and the records show that they are returning today at a rate of nearly half a million a month. Materially it is of the greatest importance to you and every American citizen that this great battle which is in progress on the whole economic front shall not be interrupted by the long delays which are proposed to you in order that there shall be a change in policies and strategies.', 'I have endeavored in the last month in the presentation of these and many other issues to appeal to the thoughtful people of the United States, and I accept your demonstration as evidence of the support which you are giving to me out of your conviction in this battle. I have made no endeavor to appeal to emotion, but I have made an endeavor to appeal to reason. I have fixed my faith upon the logical conclusions of a thoughtful people.', '[6.] BARABOO, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 1:45 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'My chief recollection of this town comes from the fact that for many years it was the hometown of the Ringling Circus which I attended with great industry during my early life.', 'I wish to thank you for your greeting.

And it is an evidence of your desire to see that the Republican Party is returned on the 8th day of November.', 'Many of you have radio sets.

It is a great encouragement in making a fight to find the people ready to come down and give you such a generous welcome as this, and it is also to me an indication of where your heart is going to lie on the 8th day of November.', 'Now, a stop like this is too short a time to discuss national issues. I am going to speak from St. Paul tonight, provided I can get the speech written in time. You will then have an opportunity to hear not only what this administration has been doing but something about what I think of our opponents.', 'I wish to thank you for this reception because it is a great encouragement.', '[9.] EAU CLAIRE, WISCONSIN (Rear platform, 5:40 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is very difficult for one to formulate phrases of the eloquent order that so generous and so cordial a reception as this would warrant in response. It is encouraging. It is inspiring, and it is stimulating in a great battle to know that there are so many devoted supporters to that cause. And it is a promise of what the action of Wisconsin will be on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not an occasion on which to discuss national issues. It is an occasion on which you may take a look at me, and it is an occasion in which I may have the great pleasure of meeting with you. Within a few hours I shall be speaking from St. Paul and from there try to traverse some more of our national problems and to express my opinions to you on some questions raised by the opposition party.', 'I cannot hope on this occasion to make a long address or a prolonged address. It is necessary, and I think you will be helpful to me, that I save my voice for the strains which it must encounter during the next 2 or 3 hours.

It is heartening. It is a fine expression of your confidence. It is stimulating to continue this fight to the end. And it is an evidence of the action which you will take on the 8th day of November.', 'This is not a time to enter upon a discussion of national issues. Within a couple of hours, I shall be speaking over the radio from St. Paul, and there I will undertake to expound some of the views of the administration, some of our problems of the past, and hopes for the future.

22,Herbert Hoover ,"November 05, 1932","[""In these closing hours of the campaign I am conscious that the American people are summing up in their minds the candidates' statements, the issues, weighing the expositions of party policy, making their appraisals of party measures and of men, and thus preparing themselves individually for their final personal decision to be expressed by their ballots at the polls next Tuesday."", 'I stated a few days ago that the most important issue before the American people at this moment is to overcome this crisis. What our people need is the restoration of their normal jobs and the recovery of agricultural prices and of business. They need help in the meantime to tide them over their difficulties in order that they may not suffer privation or lose their farms and homes.', 'There are other measures which concern the more distant future. We must not lose sight of them. But the great balance in which to weigh the two great political parties today is in their attitude toward this immediate problem, because in this attitude lies their philosophy of government, their ability to penetrate into causes, their capacity to meet emergency and to translate measures into action. And in these balances should also be weighed the question of honesty in presentation to the people of the facts so that they may formulate a proper judgment.', 'There is beyond this the common, everyday fact as to whether the present administration measures and policies now in action are accomplishing the purposes for which they were set out and therefore deserve ratification and retention by the people. There is also revealed in this accomplishment what we may hope for in the way of performance for the future.', 'Many of our hopes for the long-view development of our Nation have been interrupted by the necessity to devote our concentrated attention to the protection of the American people from the cataclysm which has swept over the world as the result of the aftermath of the World War.', 'Our opponents have endeavored to build a fantastic fiction as to the causes of these events in the last 3 years in order that they might blame the Republican Party for all the distress and disasters which have happened, not only in our country but in the rest of the world, and thus resort to the oldest trick of politics by stimulating a protest vote. That is playing politics with human misery, but in the pursuit of this misrepresentation they have demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the real situation with which the Government must deal if we are ever to find our way out of this depression. This narrowness of vision, this incapacity to reach to the heart of things, is a complete demonstration of their unfitness for the still gigantic task of leading the Nation back to normal life and the resumption of its forward march of progress. They have deliberately avoided and decried the accumulation of strains which grew out of the Great War; they even ignore that such a war took place. They ignore the piling up of our national debt and the debts among combatant nations greater than the whole wealth of the United States.', 'They ignore the loss of the productive skill and intelligence of millions in Europe, blotted out by battle, disease, and starvation. They ignore the poison springs of political instability which lay in the treaties that closed the war, the fears and hates that have held armaments to double those before that time. They ignore the new nationalism of a score of small nations sprung from the war with all their own tariff walls and disturbances to old channels of trade. They ignore the ruinous government policies which fallaciously sought to build back to prosperity the impoverished countries of Europe by enlarged borrowing, by subsidizing industry and employment with taxes that sapped the savings upon which industry must be rejuvenated and commerce solidly built. Under these strains the financial systems of many foreign countries crashed one after another.', 'These blows struck at us through decreased world consumption of goods.', 'If we look back over the distress of these years we find that three-quarters of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution; many nations were subject to constant change and vacillation; others resorted to dictatorships and tyranny in desperate attempts to maintain some sort of social order. I ask you to compare that with the condition of the United States.', 'We are part of a world, the disturbance of whose remotest population affects our own financial system, our markets, our employment, and the prices of our farm products. And we have many problems of our own growing out of the Great War--the inflation of values during the war and the stupendous increase of our debt, the failure of foreign countries to respond to their debt obligations to us. Finally, with the desperate crisis abroad, the whole world scrambled to convert their property into gold and thus withdrew from us suddenly over $2,400 million of exchange and gold. These fears spreading to our own citizens caused them to withdraw $1,600 million in currency from circulation. The effect of this was to withdraw vast sums of gold from our own use, as we must protect the gold convertibility of our currency, with further repercussions of credit stringency, unemployment, and dropping prices. Yet we have protected our dollar and made it ring true on every counter in the world.', 'Our own economists overlooked one great fundamental factor--that while our own people consume 90 percent of their production, yet no one calculated the effect of worldwide fear upon our credit system and on the confidence of the Nation which thereby suddenly undermined our industry and commerce.', ""In the face of these gigantic, appalling worldwide forces our opponents set up the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill--changing as it did the tariffs on less than one-sixth of our own imports, one one-hundredth of the world's imports, and introduced long after the collapse started-as the cause of all this world catastrophe. What an unspeakable travesty upon reason this explanation is!"", 'Suppose that we had never had the Hawley-Smoot tariff bill. Do you think for one moment that this crushing collapse in the structure of the world, these revolutions, these perils to civilization would not have happened and would not have reached into the United States ?', 'And yet, in order to make a political campaign by which they can play upon discontent so that they could hope to create a protest vote, they are compelled to set up this travesty of argument. By this class appeal to the negative impulses of men they endeavor to lead them away from discussion of the actual measures which have been taken to meet the actual facts of the world situation, and to follow a mirage of miscellaneous vague hopes. They seek to lead them away from their realization that the restoration now begun should not be interrupted.', 'I would recall to you the unprecedented measures which we have introduced by which we have brought the full reserve powers of the Federal Government into action to save community values and protect every family and fireside so far as it was humanly possible from deterioration.', 'We have proved time and again in our history in actual war the altruism and patriotism of our people, the solidarity of their action toward a common objective. But in this war against the invisible forces, we have seen groups of men attempting to profiteer from the miseries of our people, both to increase their own fortunes and to increase their political strength. We have seen the very measures we have taken for defense of our people and reconstruction of recovery subjected to the cheapest of political misrepresentation. We have seen attempts of these same groups even in this national emergency to bring forth a philosophy of government which would destroy the whole American system on which we have builded the greatest Nation of a century and a half.', ""Indeed, this is the same philosophy of government which has poisoned all Europe. They have been the fumes of the witch's caldron which boiled in Russia and in its attenuated flavor spread over half of Europe, and would by many be introduced into the United States in an attempt to secure votes through protest of discontent against emergency conditions. We have had to meet such handicaps from our opponents both while meeting the first emergency which endangered the Nation and in the building of employment and agriculture."", 'I have enumerated at various times in this campaign the measures adopted by the Republican administration to meet this emergency. I have enumerated on several occasions our long-view policies to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in our country for the future. I will take your time for just a moment to refresh your minds on the unprecedented measures adopted from the beginning of this depression. I will also refresh your minds on the measures, lack of measures, or destructive measures proposed by our opponents.', '1. The first of our measures, which subsequently proved of great emergency service, was the revision of the tariff. By this act we gave protection to our agriculture from a world demoralization which would have been infinitely worse than anything we have suffered, and we prevented unemployment of millions of workmen.', '2. We have secured extension of authority to the Tariff Commission by which the adjustments can be made to correct inequities in the tariff, and to make changes to meet economic tides and emergencies, thereby avoiding the national disturbance of general revision of the tariff with all its greed and logrolling. That authority becomes of vital importance today in the face of depreciated currencies abroad.', '3. At the outset of the depression we brought about an understanding between employers and employees that wages should be maintained. They were maintained until the cost of living had decreased and the profits had practically vanished. They are now the highest real wages in the world.', 'With the concurrent agreement of labor leaders at that time to minimize strikes, we have had a degree of social stability hitherto unknown in the history of any depression in our country. We have not once in this depression had Federal troops under arms to quell conflicts which is the first time in 15 depressions over a century. I cannot pay too high a tribute to the leaders of labor, leaders of industry, and our people in general, for their intelligent self-control and their devotion to the cause of order in time of stress.', 'Last night one of the eminent orators of the Democratic Party began his speech in New York by accusing the Republican Party of waging a campaign of fear, declaring that the success of the Republican Party at the polls next Tuesday might be followed by mob disturbances to public order. How does the gentleman explain the last 3 years of unparalleled social calm ? Does he mean to charge that this magnificent body of self-disciplined citizens is suddenly overnight to become a mob ? Or does he mean to imply that his party is the party of the mob ? In either event does he mean that we must accept the threat of mob rule in the United States as a guide to our conduct on election day ? Thank God, we still have some officials in Washington that can hold out against a mob.', '4. An agreement to a spread of work where employers were compelled to reduce production was brought about in order that none might be deprived of all their living and all might participate in the existing jobs and thus give real aid to millions of families. There can be no greater service given by an industry to employees in these times.', '5. We have mobilized throughout the country private charity and local and State support for the care of distress under which our women and men have given such devoted service that the health of our country has actually improved.', '6. By the expansion of State, municipal, and private construction work as an aid to employment, and by the development of an enlarged program of Federal construction which has been maintained at the rate of $600 million a year throughout the depression, we have given support to hundreds of thousands of families.', '7. By the negotiation of the German moratorium and the standstill agreements upon external debts of that country, we saved their people from a collapse that would have set a prairie fire and possibly have involved the whole of our civilization.', '8. We created the National Credit Association by cooperation of the bankers of the country, with a capital of $500 million which prevented the failure of a thousand banks with all the tragedies to their depositors and their borrowers.', '9. By drastic reduction in the ordinary operating expenses of the Federal Government, together with the increasing of the revenues in the year 1932, we contributed to balancing the Federal budget and thus held impregnable the credit of the United States.', '10. We created the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, originally with $2 billion of resources, in order that, having maintained national credit, we should thrust the full resources of public credit behind private credit of the country and thus reestablish and maintain private enterprise in an unassailable position; that with this backing of the Federal credit, acting through existing institutions, we might protect depositors in savings banks, insurance policyholders, both lenders and borrowers in building and loan associations; through banking institutions expand the funds available for loans to merchants, manufacturers, farmers, and marketing associations; that we should protect the railways from receiverships in order that in turn railway securities in the great fiduciary institutions such as our insurance companies and savings banks might be protected and a score of millions saved from distress.', '11. In addition to strengthening the capital of the Federal land banks by $125 million we have, through the Reconstruction Corporation, made large loans to mortgage associations for the same purpose, and lately we have organized all lending agencies into cooperative action to give the farmer who wants to make a fight for his home a chance to hold it from foreclosure.', '12. We extended authorities under the Federal Reserve Act to protect beyond all question the gold standard of the United States and at the same time expand the credit in counteraction to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawals of gold.', '13. We created the home loan discount banks with direct and indirect resources of several hundred millions, also acting through existing institutions in such fashion as to mobilize the resources of building and loan associations and savings banks and other institutions, furnishing to them cheaper and longer-term capital, to give to them the ability to save homes from foreclosure, to furnish credit to create new homes, and expand employment.', '14. We secured further authorities to the Reconstruction Corporation to assist in the earlier liquidation of deposits in closed banks in order that we might relieve distress to millions of depositors. Through Democratic opposition we failed to secure authority from Congress to carry this on a scale the country so sorely needs today.', '15. We secured increased authorities to the Reconstruction Corporation to loan up to $300 million to the States whose resources had been exhausted, to enable them to extend full relief to distress, and to prevent any hunger and cold in the United States over this winter.', '16. We increased the resources to the Reconstruction Corporation by a further $1,500 million for the undertaking of great public works which otherwise would have been delayed awaiting finance, due to the stringency of credit. These works are of a character which by their own earnings will enable disposal of the repayment of these loans without charge upon the taxpayer.', '17. We have erected a new system of agricultural credit banks with indirect resources of $300 million to reinforce the work of the intermediate credit banks and our other financing institutions in the financing of production and livestock loans to farmers. Any farmer now with sound security may go to them for aid.', '18. We have extended the authority to the Reconstruction Corporation to make loans for financing the normal movement of agricultural commodities to markets both at home and abroad.', '19. We have systematically mobilized banking and industry and business of the country with the cooperation of labor and agricultural leaders to attack the depression on every front. They have sought out and given assurance of credits to business and industry where employment would be increased, and have cooperated in relief of agricultural mortgage pressures.', '20. We have developed, together with European nations, a worldwide economic conference with view to relieving pressure upon us from foreign countries, to increase their stability, to deal with the problems of silver, and to prevent recurrence of these calamities if it can be humanly done.', '21. We have given American leadership in development of drastic reductions of armament in order to reduce our own expenditures by $200 million a year and to increase the financial stability of foreign nations and, above all, to relieve the world of fear and political friction.', 'These are a part--not all--of the great and effective weapons with which we have fought the battle that has saved the American people from disaster and chaos. These weapons are still in action and advancing along the whole front to the restoration of recovery.', 'I would call your attention to certain economic and social backgrounds of all these instrumentalities, that they are so constructed as to act through existing agencies, to avoid competition of the Government with private enterprise and responsibilities. Their essence has been that of cooperation, so created that with the passage of this emergency they can be withdrawn, leaving our economic structure in its full strength and vitality. They represent the full use of the Federal power in time of emergency to protect the people. That is the reason for the social calm in the United States as contrasted with the riots in nearly every foreign country.', 'I recently enumerated at Detroit some of the evidences of recuperation of the country under these measures in so short a period as 4 months since the destruction of public confidence by the Democratic House of Representatives ceased.', 'I do not wish to weary you with statistics, but to show the validity of that progress I may mention that in employment over a million men have now returned to work during these 4 months. This is the estimate of our Government departments. The estimate of our employers places the number at a million and a half. Certainly we are now gaining a half million a month.', 'Last night I heard an evidence--an evidence of recuperation that is going on. The city of St. Louis had made application for a large sum from the Reconstruction Corporation with which to carry their destitute over the winter. I was informed yesterday that they asked that the application for that loan be cancelled as it was no longer required.', 'Production of boots and shoes amounted to 34 million pairs in October, the highest output for any month in the year and higher than the same month of the previous year.', 'Hoarded currency continues to return; imports of gold withdrawn by frightened European holders have continued to increase; deposits of banks continue to show steady expansion. In 4 months they have increased by nearly a billion dollars. This is money being put to work and an evidence of renewed confidence.', 'A further indication of the upward movement of industry lies in the increased demand for electrical power, which has increased by over 8 percent in the last 4 months. Every business index shows some progress somewhere in the Nation.', 'I do not want to say it in criticism, for there is no one more devoted to our form of government than myself, but there is one unfortunate incident in our system, and that is that a change of parties in power at the national election may come at a difficult moment. A change at this election must mean 4 whole months in which there can be no definition of national policy, during which time not only the commander of the forces in battle for economic recovery must be changed but the subordinate commanders as well. Following the period of delay and uncertainty, the opposition party will, as it has announced, call a special session of Congress in order to validate their promises and their new deal. And whether these new policies be for better or worse, at least a year must elapse before they can emerge into action. The battle must stagnate at a time of its height, and recovery must inevitably be delayed.', 'And now in contrast with this constructive program of the Republican Party and this administration, I wish to develop for you the Democratic program to meet this depression as far as we have been able to find any definition to it. I would again call your attention to the fact that with the Democratic victory in congressional elections of 1930, their leaders promised to produce a program which would redeem this country from the depression. No such program was produced until we were well into the winter of 1932. Their program as developed under the leadership of Mr. Garner by the Democratic House of Representatives was:', '1. They passed the Collier bill, providing for destruction of the Tariff Commission by reducing it again to a mere statistical body controlled by the Congress. Had they succeeded, the relief which you so sorely require from competition with countries of depreciated currencies would today be impossible.', '2. They attempted to instruct me by legislation to call an international conference through which the aid of foreign nations would be requested to lower American tariffs, by which the independence of the United States in control of its domestic policies was to placed in the hands of an international body.', '3. They passed an act instructing me to negotiate reciprocal the result of which could only be to deprive some locality of its protection for the benefit of another, and by which the only sible agreements would involve the reduction of farm tariffs in to build up markets for other goods. I might further suggest that two largest export commodities in the country are in the hands of a gentleman who will control the next Congress.', '4. They passed an omnibus pension bill with unworthy payments as an indication of their economical temper.', '5. They passed an inadequate patchwork revenue bill, the injustices of which to different industries and groups must yet be remedied.', '6. They passed Indian claims bills to reopen settlements 75 years old in order to favor certain localities at the expense of the Public Treasury-', '7. They passed a bill instructing the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury to fix prices at averages prevailing during the years 1921 to 1929 by constantly shifting the volume of currency and credit and thus creation of every uncertainty to business and industry by a rubber dollar. This bill was stopped, but it has not been removed from their political calendar.', '8. They defeated a large part of the national economy measure proposed by the administration by their refusal to accept our recommendation, by reduction of ordinary expenditures from $250 million to less than $50 million, a part of which we subsequently rescued in the Senate.', '9. They passed the Garner-Rainey pork-barrel bill increasing expenditures by $1,200 million for unnecessary nonproductive public works, purely for the benefit of favored localities. We stopped this bill, but it is still on their political calendar.', '10. They passed the cash prepayment of the bonus calling for immediate expenditure of $2,300 million and for actual increase in liabilities of the Federal Government over the original act by $1,300 million. We stopped this bill, but it is still on their political calendar.', '11. They passed the provision for the issuance of over $2,200 million of greenback currency, a reversion to vicious practices already demonstrated in the last hundred years as the most destructive to labor, agriculture, and business. We stopped this bill and even as late as last night the Democratic candidate failed to frankly disavow it.', '12. They passed the Rainey bill providing for direct personal banking for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to everyone who wants money, and thus the most destructive entry of the Government into private business in a fashion that violates every principle of our Nation. I vetoed this bill, but Mr. Garner still advocates it, and it has not been removed from their political calendar.', '13. They injected an expenditure of $322 million for entirely unnecessary purposes in time of great emergency. The Democratic candidate complains daily that we do not spend this money fast enough. It is part of his economic program.', '14. The Congress passed proper authority to the Executive for reorganization and elimination of useless Government commissions and bureaus, but by refusing my recommendations for immediate action they destroyed its usefulness for a long time to come and probably destroyed its consummation.', '15. The Democratic candidate eloquently urges the balancing of the budget, but nowhere disavows these gigantic raids on the Treasury, under which no budget can ever be balanced.', 'Thus far I have recounted to you the program of the Democratic House under the leadership of Mr. Garner, whose policies have received commendation from the Democratic convention which ratified them by nominating him Vice President.', ""16. The Democratic candidate adds to this program the proposal to plant a billion trees and thereby immediately employ a million men, but the Secretary of Agriculture has shown that the trees available to plant will give them a total of less than 3 days' work."", '17. The Democratic candidate promises to relieve agriculture with a 6-point program which amounts to envisaging to distressed farmers a great structure of agricultural relief, but he has refused to submit it to debate. He has disclosed no details of the plan except six methods by which he can escape from the promise.', '18. The candidate has promised the immediate inauguration of a program of self-liquidating public works, such as utilization of our water resources, flood control, and land reclamation, to provide ""employment for all surplus labor at all times."" That is contained in a letter addressed to all the unemployed in the United States which has had enormous circulation. To employ the whole of the unemployed in the United States would exceed in cost $9 billion a year. These works are unavailable. If the works were there, the cost would destroy the credit of the Government, deprive vast numbers of the men now working of their jobs, and thus destroy the remedy itself. This fantasy is a cruel promise to these suffering men and women that they will be given jobs by the Government which no government could fulfill.', '19. The Democratic Party makes its contribution to the emergency by proposing to reduce the tariff to a ""competitive tariff for revenue."" Their candidate states that he supports this promise 100 percent. A competitive tariff today would be ruinous to American agriculture and industry.', 'These are the only reliefs to this emergency that I can find in the whole Democratic program. They are mostly destructive. I have given you some of the items of the Republican program. I submit to you this collection of 19 items which have been and are proposed to the American people.', 'Governor Roosevelt in his address of last night stated: ""I have been scrupulously careful to make no idle promises, to raise no false hopes.""', 'In St. Louis last night, I gave a list of about a dozen unclarified promises, some of which certainly raise high hopes.', 'Our opponents have devoted themselves in the last few weeks to the idea that the Republican Party is endeavoring to ""scare"" the American people. I have never found them very easily scared and would not believe the American people could be. The American people are not being disturbed by my reassurances from the record that men are being restored to employment at the rate of 500,000 a month as the result of great programs and policies inaugurated by this administration. What is disturbing the American people is the failure of the Democratic candidate to show any satisfaction in this, and his entire lack of assurance that these measures will be carried forward. Furthermore, they find a total absence of constructive proposals from the Democratic side for dealing with this emergency. They are confused by indefinite promises as to the future. They are dismayed by the measures proposed by the last Democratic House of Representatives which at no time have been disavowed by the candidate and would destroy the very foundations of the Republic. They resent appeals to protest on the basis of personal misfortune the causes of which have been so brazenly misstated. They are asking what the support of extreme radicals means to our American institutions. They wonder if the divergent parts in the Democratic Party, the sectional elements and political elements of which it consists, do not spell a repetition of the quarrels and lack of confidence in their candidate so evident before their convention, and thus an earnest of their own incapacity for united national action.', 'One issue of this campaign has become of more than normal importance, and I wish to speak on that question--that is, the maintenance of our protective tariff. These States are positively dependent upon the maintenance of protective tariffs as a measure of recovery from this depression. And the protective tariff is more in danger at this moment than at any time in recent history; first because our opponents propose to reduce this tariff to the basis of ""competitive tariff for revenue"" which means competition in the American market by the lower-paid labor, lowered standards of living, and the cheapest lands in any part of the world.', 'But beyond this the collapse of 30 nations unable to stand the accumulated strains growing out of the World War has brought about a depreciation of their currencies all the way from 10 to 50 percent. The result has been a further decrease in their wages, their prices and standards of living as compared to ours. Breaches are being made daily in your farm tariff walls.', ""I wished to make a public survey into the actual purchasing power as a consequence of wages in a number of countries to determine from their wages the amount of bread and butter which could be purchased at retail with a week's wages. I gave out those figures 4 years ago, and I gave them out several days ago. They show that in the United States nearly every group of labor can purchase somewhere between 900 and 1,000 pounds of bread and butter from their weekly wage. They showed 4 years ago that our nearest competitor, Japan, delivering goods here, could purchase there all the way from 600 to 750. They showed several days ago that this nation could only buy 100 to 159 pounds. That is the difference in wages."", 'And in the face of this, our Democratic opponents propose to reduce our tariffs. They propose to do this in violation of their historic duty and in order to appeal to other sections of the United States. Their candidate has referred to our tariff as exorbitant and a ghastly jest.', 'We must bear in mind that excepting wheat, 99 percent of our agricultural products in this and neighboring States are consumed within the borders of the United States, and the fate of American agriculture lies in holding the market within the boundaries of the United States.', 'I could give you a few indications in actual effect of the present situation other than those I stated at Des Moines, Indianapolis, Springfield. I would point out that butter, the indicator in dairy products, sells in New York at 21 cents, and yet, except for the tariff wall, it would be sold from New Zealand and Europe for 16 cents. And I would point out another exhibit: Flax is 72 cents north of the Canadian border and $1.08 south of that boundary owing to the protective tariff. These prices are depressingly low, but they actually could be lower. If this tariff were taken down, some 4 million acres, built up under the protective tariff, must go into other products, the competition of which will lower prices in every other commodity. Another industry to which Governor Roosevelt has given especial attention is sugar, as to which his promises would put another 750,000 acres into competition with other products.', 'One of the reasons why agriculture has not made progress as rapidly in increased prices in the last 4 months comparable with the increased employment of men is this increasing competition from depreciated currency countries. This indeed gives me the greatest concern. Fortunately, the Republican administration has been able to prevent the destruction of the flexible authorities of the Tariff Commission through which alone these breaches in the tariff wall might be repaired.', 'The Democratic candidate, the Democratic House of Representatives, and the Democratic Party in its platform promise consistently to destroy this authority of the Tariff Commission, and I ask: Can you look to these men to repair these breaches in the tariff wall when they propose to tear down the walls themselves ?', 'In a speech last night the Democratic candidate stated that the Tariff Commission ""during 2 long years, has investigated duties on only 73 commodities out of many thousands.""', 'Again he has been misinformed and is broadcasting misinformation to the American people. The Tariff Commission has considered over 250 items instead of the 73 he mentions. A great number of these items, when they appeared for consideration, were found to have no basis for action. They were withdrawn by the applicants upon a showing of the facts. But a greater misrepresentation lies in the fact that except for the very large task that I have recently given the Commission--that is, to reconsider the tariffs as affected by depreciated currencies owing to the collapse of foreign nations--its docket is practically clear. That means that this tribunal, which Governor Roosevelt says he will destroy, has attended to practically every tariff application presented by American citizens. If there were a greater number of items which needed change, is it not obvious that the need for this change would have been manifest, because the enterprising American citizen would long since have brought it to this tribunal for immediate adjustment ?', 'Beyond the possibilities of adjustment by the Tariff Commission, we will widen the protective tariff by legislation if necessary to protect agriculture. Our oils and fats are suffering, entirely unnecessarily, from foreign imports of these commodities. The American market should be and must be reserved for the American farmer at all times--whether emergency times or normal times.', 'Governor Roosevelt in his address last night also stated: ""I have been scrupulously careful to engage in no personalities, no unfair innuendoes, no baseless charges against the President of the United States.""', ""I would like to have someone else answer this, but it appears that I am the one to carry the answer across to the American people. I would recommend that anyone interested in this statement should read Governor Roosevelt's speeches from the beginning of this campaign."", 'I have been compelled to take the unprecedented action of calling attention to a few of them. I have been also compelled to frequently call attention to statements being put out through the Democratic National Committee and their agencies which amount to positive calumnies. In no case has the Democratic candidate disavowed this action of his official committee or agencies. He has naturally profited by his silence.', 'I have been informed in this State that someone is endeavoring to picture me as having voted in a foreign country as an indication that I am not a citizen of the United States. I know it is directed from the activities of the Democratic local committees. But why answer those things ? That picture is taken from the tax rolls of a foreign country where I at one time rented a house, and where there is a tax on every item of rent and where the rolls are made up from the tax rolls; where I never voted or had a right to vote. This has been privately and publicly denounced by the Secretary of State over the last 8 years.', 'I have just heard of another of these actions which took place yesterday in the State of Ohio--the circulation of thousands of handbills stating that the Farm Board spends $5 million annually in salaries and has a fund of $250,000 for traveling expenses. This statement is untrue. There follows a long .list of salaries purported to be paid by the Farm Board.', ""It states, incidentally, that Mr. Roosevelt will abolish the Farm Board. If that be true--but I don't believe it is true--that will be of interest to the 2 million members of farm cooperatives in the United States and especially in a great part of the Northwest."", 'As to the first point, the administrative expenditures of the Board are less than $900,000 per annum, and I would call attention to the fact that the members of the Farm Board receive about $10,000 a year. The salaries referred to in this circular do not refer largely to the employees of the Farm Board. Many are exaggerated, but the great bulk of them are officials employed by farmer-owned, farmer-controlled and farmer-managed cooperatives because they have sought for the highest skill in the marketing of their products. The Farm Board has no control of these salaries. They are paid at the will of the American farmer and his organizations. The organization you have built up in this State and the salaries are enumerated here as a matter of personal defamation of myself.', 'But the only point of importance for me to make now is that this is typical of stories being spread through the Nation with a view to misleading the people. I regret that I have to refer to them. They ought to be omitted from a political discussion.', 'Throughout the difficulties of the last 2 years there have stood out in high relief the courage and fortitude of the American people. Yet, steadfast and brave as have been our men in the face of suffering and disaster, our women have been braver and more steadfast. Upon them the rigors of the world depression, as did the rigors of the World War, have borne most heavily. Untold anxiety, self-denial, and drudgery have been their lot, that their loved ones might be assured of that care in mind and body that would equip them to meet the problems of the future. That the health of our people, both infants and adults, as evidenced by vital statistics, is now at its highest point is a notable tribute to the loving care and devotion of the women of the United States. Today their hearts are gladdened by a well founded hope of an early return to normal living conditions in our country. They must not be disappointed.', 'In the long dark days of recent months these women, bowed with the burden of their own troubles, have not been too preoccupied to send me many messages of sympathy and encouragement. Unmoved either by blind resentment or by cruel calumny, they have done much to sustain my belief in the justice as well as the courage of my countrymen. Whatever fortune may have in store for me during the remaining years of my life, my heart will ever be filled with gratitude to the women of America for the understanding, the faith, and the cooperation which they have given me without stint during all of my years of public service.', 'And not only in the homes of our country have women borne their full share of the burdens of the day. More and more in the changing conditions of modern life women have had to take their places side by side with men in factories, in business, in professional, and in political life.', ""Even before their enfranchisement, President Theodore Roosevelt realized the need for women in government when he appointed a woman to head his newly created Children's Bureau in the Department of Labor, and that office has always been held by a woman."", 'Many women are now holding posts of grave responsibility in city and county and State and Nation, and their number will be greatly increased.', 'A step forward has been taken in the last year. The first woman to represent the Government of the United States in a great international conference is Miss Mary E. Woolley, sent by me as a member of the American delegation to the Disarmament Conference at Geneva. Hers was a most distinguished service. I have appointed an imposing list of women to public duties, and they have proved to have the highest sense of service and the highest kind of ability.', 'Since the women of America attained the vote they have naturally forced certain questions into wider attention of the Nation. Education, home protection, and child welfare are as thoroughly bound up in the politics of the Nation as any other issues as a result of the enfranchisement of women.', 'I have observed in public discussions in this campaign that women frequently take a longer view of national life than do a great many men. That is natural with women. They are intensely concerned with the policies which guarantee open equality of opportunity for the future of their boys and girls. It is a comfort to find them familiar with the measures I have presented to add to this security, and they are also familiar with the lack of response with which the Democratic House met these measures.', 'I have long experienced their courageous and tenacious abilities in organization for public purposes.', 'During the Food Administration, it was my pleasure to cooperate with the women, and it was my first opportunity to see the women who organized a nation for saving that our soldiers and allies might be fed. Soon after, it was with the women that I organized the measures to save the lives of 10 million European children. Soon after, it was with the women that I organized the Better Homes movement.', 'A few years ago, when I began to organize the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, I discovered that the great majority fitted for leadership in that work, both by skill and experience, were women. Again, when I organized the Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership and it was necessary to create research committees to present conclusions to the Conference, I found the skill and spirit with which to carry on the special work largely among women in order to get a proper perspective on the subjects because they were the persons in the community that had the experience to do it.', 'Both these conferences brought high results in the advancement of public thought. They are already ringing through our national life in concrete public action.', 'I have come to know the great abilities of our womanhood for cooperative action. They never cease nor become discouraged until success is attained.', 'Of the great problems which demand safeguard probably none arises in higher value than that of preventing wars. This is a primary necessity to the future of the Nation. We cannot, as a people, run the risk of having our whole civilization degenerated and torn apart by such grim recurrences.', 'There is a fundamental source for prevention which has been too much overlooked in this campaign. No one can deny the fact that the depression would never have taken place had it not been for the destructive forces loosened by the Great War. If we are to ensure that our country shall not be racked and endangered by recurrence of such calamities, the first measure for safety is that we should have peace in the world. We have a vital part to play in the setup of machinery to replace war and force with the peaceful settlement of controversies between the nations. We properly refuse to entangle ourselves in age-old controversies in other parts of the world. Our face is turned forward, not backward. We have taken the position that we will not participate in trying to compel people to engage in the settlement of controversies by the use of force.', 'The Kellogg Pact has been advanced by this administration to a point now accepted by the world as of far greater potency than was even contemplated at the time of its inauguration. Under the policies we have advanced, we have definitely secured that the public opinion of the world will be mobilized and concentrated against those who violate that pact.', 'The whole history of this beautiful western country constitutes a monument to the heroism of American women; and that pioneer spirit which bore so large a part in the development of the farms and firesides that now cover the western plains has come to its fullest expression during these later years in the assumption by women of a full measure of political responsibility as American citizens. My deepest appreciation is given to the army of women who have borne so valiant a part in this campaign. Their lofty conception of governmental affairs and their keen understanding of political parties and issues have given a new meaning to the history of American progress.', 'In these closing hours, I am realizing that I have been drawn more deeply into this campaign than most Presidents.', 'The emergencies with which we have been dealing during the past 30 years have called upon me for such continued and concentrated attention at the Capital of the Nation; they have been so complicated and technical; they have required such imperative and instant action, that when this campaign began I was forced to the realization that few other responsible officials of the Government held the full knowledge of all the ramifications of a program which was not yet fully understood by the country. I have felt that the President of the United States, constantly reviewing the history of our many struggles, knowing the character of our people, should never flinch in confidence in the future.', 'I deemed it due to you and to the common cause we serve to bring to you the direct story of the endeavors that have been undertaken for the common good in these past years. In the past month I have received many thousands of communications from our people. I wish to express to you and to them the comfort I have had in the realization they have given to me that their concern has traveled with mine as we have discussed together the grave issues of the period.', 'In the solemn sense that belongs to last words of this campaign, I assure you that I have endeavored, in the presentation of these issues, to appeal to the thoughtful people of the United States, that I have kept foremost in my thought the welfare of my country, that my vision has been of their homes and their necessities. And I accept this great demonstration as evidence of the support which you are giving to me out of your convictions in this battle. I have made no effort to appeal to destructive emotions; I have made an endeavor to appeal to reason which I can only hope has been effective. I have fixed my faith upon the logical conclusions of the thoughtful people who have never failed this country in any hour of danger.']"
23,Herbert Hoover ,"November 06, 1932","['As you know, this is by no means my first visit to Denver. I came here first some 36 years ago while engaged in my engineering profession. I have been back many times and have many friendships which have grown steadily over these years.', 'It would not be proper for me on this Sabbath Day to enter upon a discussion of political issues. Sunday is provided as a day of rest. I have certainly been engaged in hard labor, and I am thankful for the Sabbath Day.', 'I do wish to express my appreciation for the generosity of your reception. It is encouraging to any man in public service to feel the enthusiasm which comes spontaneously.', 'There is one subject on which I can speak for a moment because it is not a matter of partisanship but a matter sacred to all faiths and to all men and women. I understand that you are about to enter upon your community chest drive in order to provide against distress over the forthcoming winter. The first obligation of man is toward his neighbor. The first obligation of a community is toward those in distress, and in this drive which you are about to undertake you are giving expression to the responsibility of both the individual and the community. It is important that distress shall be cared for, and it is also important that the spirit of giving and the sense of obligation shall be maintained in our people.', 'It is true that we have provided through the Federal Government a fund to supplement the efforts of local communities by way of loans to those communities whose resources have become exhausted and who have not been able to compass the problems of distress. This has not been done to relieve the responsibility of the individual or the community; it has been done as a guarantee by the United States Government that in this time of hardship no one shall go hungry or cold within our land. The sum provided by the Government is insufficient except as a supplement to local abilities when their resources are exhausted. But it is a mark of the resolution of the American people through their Government that they will make sure that our people are protected during the national emergency.', 'There is a phase of this entire problem of distress that has been of constant lift to me; that is the fact that under the leadership of the devoted women and men of our country, the general health of our children stands today on a higher plane than even in normal times. This is the result of the infinite effort and sacrifice on the part of our people. It is fundamental that this shall go on because we as a nation cannot afford for an instant to have the powers of the next generation in the slightest way diminished if we are to continue our great march of national progress.', ""A record of national and nonpartisan effort on behalf of children was recently made in the Children's Charter, drawn up at the conclusion of the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection. That was an expression of the national spirit and national thought and the national demand on behalf of children. The people of your State were represented on that important body. Your people have taken the conclusions of this able body of men and women with the utmost seriousness. You are developing those conclusions into definite community action. In so doing you are providing for us a generation in which the problems of handicap and disability in children will be infinitely lighter than those which we bear today. In the provision of a community nurse, you are substituting her, eventually, for a score of policemen."", 'There can be no partisanship in our obligations to our children. This is a subject that is worthy of discussion on this day.', 'In opening the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, I felt that I was voicing the feelings of fathers and mothers everywhere, without respect to political faith, when I said:', '""We approach all problems of childhood with affection. Theirs is the province of joy and good humor. They are the most wholesome part of our race, the sweetest, for they are fresher from the hands of God. Whimsical, mischievous, we live a life of apprehension as to what their opinion may be of us, a life of defense against their terrifying energy; we put them to bed with a sense of relief and a lingering of devotion. We envy them the freshness of adventure and discovery of life; we mourn over the disappointments they will meet.""', 'And in describing the ultimate goal of all our American passion for a better life for our children I said in conclusion:', '""The passion of the American fathers and mothers is to lift children to higher opportunities than they have themselves enjoyed. It burns like a flame in us as a people. Kindled in our country by its first pioneers, who came here to better the opportunities for their children rather than themselves, passed on from one generation to the next, it has never dimmed nor died. Indeed, human progress marches only when children excel their parents.""', 'To that end we can always devote some portion of our spiritual contemplation on the Sabbath Day.', 'Now, I wish to again express my appreciation for this tremendous reception. It fills me with hope. I would like to address you on questions of national issues. I shall be entering into that again tomorrow morning at an early hour.', 'I thank you.']"
24,Herbert Hoover ,"November 07, 1932","['[1.] EVANSTON, WYOMING (9 a.m.)', 'My friends:', 'I have to get up fairly early to do my job in Washington, but it appears that you get up even earlier than I do to be here at this time of day.', 'You will have to pardon me for my voice. I have been using it 30 or 40 times a day for the last 15 days, and it has come near its finish.', ""I deeply appreciate your coming to give us this greeting. It is encouraging, and it is an indication of where you will be in next Tuesday's election. There are many things that are of importance to the people of Evanston in the Republican program which is now in progress. As you know, we have gone through a very great crisis in this country. It has touched even Evanston, which is far from the Atlantic seaboard. We have had a number of very important agencies established in order to give protection to our people. Some are reaching into this town at the present moment. The agriculture banks have begun to function. They have begun to enable the cattle to move towards the Middle West, and I am in hopes that in a few weeks we can see an improvement in prices."", 'We have also the problem of the protection from the tariff to the cattlemen of this territory. During the last 2 or 3 months we have had a great depreciation in currencies of foreign countries because of the collapse of their governments. It enables them to produce their cattle at less cost. It has lowered prices, increased competition, and depreciated prices for cattle. We have the authority under the Tariff Commission to have those questions reviewed. We have them under review now, and we are in hopes that we can do something to be of assistance at a very early order in that direction.', 'The program of our party has begun to show its results in the industrial world. We are now bringing back half a million men to employment in the great cities every month. They increase the consumption of animal products, and that will undoubtedly begin to reflect upon the products of this country at a very early date. Altogether the situation in the Nation is infinitely more hopeful than it was even 4 months ago.', 'There is one matter in which I have some personal interest. I came into Evanston some years ago in the matter of the Colorado River, and we at that time held hearings in this neighborhood, and we then provided for the preservation of the rights of Wyoming in the diversion of water from that great river in its lower ranges. That has worked out, I believe, of enormous assistance to your people.', 'I could talk to you a long time about matters that are of interest. I see such a large number of children here about, and they look to me to be so well cared for that I can compliment all of the women of this locality on their work in the interest of our Nation, and that is that we shall have the next generation stronger and better than ours. And it looks to me as if it is going to be so.', '[2.] ECHO, UTAH', 'My friends:', 'I am deeply grateful for your greeting upon my entering the State of Utah. I have been through Echo many a time on other missions, but in this mission which I have now, I find in your greeting a very great encouragement and an indication of what you may do tomorrow in the ballot boxes.', ""It is not an occasion when one can speak about national issues at any length, and more especially as my voice has been under a good deal of strain this last 4 weeks, and I have got to try to keep it long enough to speak to you at 12 o'clock from Salt Lake City. I am in hopes you may listen over the radio, as I will have some remarks to make about our opponents on their side and what we have done on our side."", 'But I do wish to thank you for this greeting. It is generous, and it is encouraging.']"
25,Herbert Hoover ,"November 07, 1932","['My fellow citizens:', 'It is with difficulty that I can formulate phrases which would express my appreciation for the generosity and courtesy of your reception.', 'This is by no means my first visit to Salt Lake City. I came from the West, and one of my first professional engagements was the responsibility of carrying a chain and driving stakes on a ditch line in this State.', 'It has been a great relief and great stimulation in the last 2 days to come back to the West where I was born and reared. So I come to your State as no stranger.', 'We are going through an emergency unparalleled in the peacetime history of our country. The first great stake in this election and one which should give the deepest concern to every citizen is to save the principles on which this Nation was rounded and the ideals upon which it has grown great. The Republican administration has held that its first obligation as the party ""of the people, by the people, and for the people,"" has been to preserve the fundamentals of the Republic. In these trying times we have refused to adopt any of the evasions and resorts which have been installed by scores of other nations who have been precipitated into this crisis as the result of the World War. We have in no way countenanced the curtailment of public and private liberties. Thus we shall find, when this emergency is past, our governmental, social, and economic structure is functioning as before. And even at political cost to ourselves, we must preserve those precious forces which have builded up this Republic over 150 years.', 'In no community in all this broad land is there today any lessening of ordered liberty, of vitality, of initiative, of individual enterprise or sense of responsibility of the community or the responsibilities of the States upon all of which this Republic is based.', 'The second duty with which we were confronted was to recognize honestly the forces moving against us and to give them battle with all the reserve powers of the Federal Government, to protect our people where they were unable to protect themselves, by strengthening the State, the municipality or institution.', 'There is nothing more difficult than to face the facts unflinchingly. Nor could we afford to look at them through eyes colored by political interest. There is nothing more difficult in times of emergency than to say ""no"" to anxious people when ""yes"" would give momentary satisfaction and yet would undermine the stability of the Nation which is our first fundamental security.', 'We have provided a series of measures unprecedented in the history of the Republic. In all these measures we have preserved the recognition of the responsibility of the States, local communities, private institutions, and individual citizens. These have been tremendous undertakings and instrumentalities, unparalleled in the history of the United States. They have carried us through a crisis which, without these actions, would have left the Republic with a generation of chaos. These measures and weapons were created not only for defense in the great battle with invading forces, but they were built also for purposes of counterattack. We were delayed in this counterattack for 4 months by the destructive attitude of the Democratic House of Representatives which proposed day by day measures which pandered to sectional and group interest in preparation for this political campaign. These obstructive actions themselves have destroyed public confidence during that time.', 'We were thus fighting not only on the front preserving the Republic, but fighting an irresponsible enemy on our flank. It was not until we had defeated the flank attack that we were able to concentrate on the frontline of battle and carry the frontline trenches. We are moving forward today. A million men in 4 months have been restored to their normal jobs. Our agencies report that they are being taken back at the rate of 500,000 a month. So great has been the transformation in certain centers that in the great city of St. Louis where they had secured a large loan from the Reconstruction Corporation in order to care for the destitute, they are surrendering most of the loan back to the Government. With a magnificent sense of courage and community spirit and individual responsibility they announce that they can now take care of their own because of the increasing number of men who have returned to employment. I have just received a telegram showing that employment and business in all of the New England States, after deducting all seasonal factors, increased nearly 10 percent in the last 4 months.', 'I regret that agriculture has been lagging behind industry in this march to recovery. The reasons are, first, because our domestic markets must be reestablished by the reemployment of men; second, because we have met a new blow through depreciation of currencies in 30 governments which have collapsed under strains from the aftermath of the Great War. Their currencies have depreciated all the way from 10 percent to 50 percent, and depreciation of currency means reduction of wages and of standards of living. It has further increased their capacity to compete with our farmers. It has created breaches in the protective tariff wall which stands as the bulwark of our agricultural industry. Our first and immediate duty now is to repair these breaches in order that agriculture may resume a march forward parallel with industry within the next 30 days. That we shall do, either through the flexible tariff provision or, if necessary, through legislation. We propose to preserve the American market for the American farmer. You will realize that in these Intermountain States of ours nearly 99.5 percent of all your products are marketed within the borders of the United States, and that what you require is the protection of that market.', 'The Democratic campaign has been conducted from the start upon the theory that by misrepresenting the origins of this crisis as having been brought about by the Republican administration, they could then successfully play politics with human. misery. This pretext has been exploded. It was based on the assumption that the American people were an ignorant people, without knowledge of history or of current events. It was assumed they had no recollection that just such a crisis followed the Napoleonic wars, just such a crisis followed the Civil War and the wars in Europe which took place a few years later. They pretended that the World War had nothing to do with this crisis. They estimated that our people could not grasp the fact that increases in our own public debts due to the World War, together with the effect of the enormous inflation in values which took place during the war, had anything to do with our problems today. This indeed was an avoidance of the fact that these things all occurred under a Democratic administration. They assumed that our people were so ignorant as not to recognize that the overwhelming debts of foreign nations from increasing armaments from their continuing frictions, and finally their frantic attempts to secure their national liquidation, brought about the collapse of a great number of nations.', 'They assumed that the knowledge of these events and their effects upon us by their undermining of our credit, their reduction of buying power for our goods, were all unknown to the American people. They have had the political foolishness to misjudge that the intelligence of the American people would accept their claim that a boom on the New York Stock Exchange, participated in by Democrats as well as Republicans, was the cause of this world calamity. They attempted to establish this claim in spite of the fact that we have had similar booms 15 times in the last century, and deplorable as they are, they have never yet jeopardized our Republic or brought catastrophe on the world.', 'They have in this campaign also relied upon the spread of misinformation to convince the American people that the great final blow which brought the world to disaster was through the passage of the increased tariffs under the Hawley-Smoot act which took place 12 months after that boom had cracked. Most of those increases were for the benefit of our farmers. They attempted this particular foolishness in spite of the fact that it has been demonstrated time and again that this tariff law affected only $10 out of every $1,000 of world trade, and that similar increases many, many times before in our history, when we had to recover protection from Democratic administrations, had had no effect on the world. All of this gigantic pose was designed to fool the people.', 'We have pointed out on many occasions that this refusal to recognize the facts, this attempt to mislead the people, disqualifies that party for the Government of the United States. Again, I repeat that the object in all of this misleading is to find some way to place on the Republican Party the responsibility for this worldwide disaster, and thus to draw members of the Republican Party to their banner out of discontent. Furthermore, their strategy in this campaign was to rely upon the solid South as. an impregnable fortress in a political battle. They then would use their political brigades in the great cities. They sought by these misrepresentations, by nebular promises directed to the unemployed, to the farmers, to the miners, to every industry that is suffering, to attract from the Republican ranks a sufficient number to carry this election. They have, instead, driven many honest minded Democrats from their ranks, and their failure to draw thinking Republicans will be their rebuke for intellectual dishonesty.', 'The Republican Party, confronted with the greatest crisis that has come in peacetime, prepared and carried through a gigantic program. That program is in action now. It is showing its results.', 'When we search for their program with which to meet this depression, and their real views on long-view national action, we find ourselves compelled to search a series of acts passed in the last session of the Democratic House, calculated to attract sections, groups, and radical elements to their banner. They expounded here and elsewhere through their candidate a philosophy of government that would have destroyed the foundations of the Republic. Their party convention, by the nomination of Mr. Garner, ratified these acts. Their candidate for President, having failed to disavow them, has also ratified them.', 'I ask you to compare my review of their program for meeting this emergency, as outlined by me in an address at St. Paul and elsewhere, with the program which the Republican administration has already in action. Their long-view policies have the same weaknesses and the same evasions in frankly meeting national problems as their emergency program. In my addresses I have presented proof, step by step, of these facts. I have exposed their misstatements and their avoidances and their fallacies and their destructive philosophy of government. On the last point I have the gravest concern. If that philosophy were ever put into action, the America we have known in the past would be changed, and we would join with other decaying nations. Such a program put into action would destroy those principles which have given to us through these decades our great accretions of national progress, and which have sustained every man in his personal liberty and sustained the protection of his individual opportunity and has sustained the ideals of a great people.', 'The discussions in this campaign have largely revolved on economic issues and our material welfare, but there are issues in the campaign which far transcend the interest of our pocketbooks. While the immediate issue is to overcome this crisis, far beyond this is the higher duty to maintain faith in and fidelity to our institutions. These are the most necessary part of our problems of government and the problems of your life and of my life.', 'In all great crises our decisions have not been based on dollars and cents. When our people look anxiously toward the future they look to the preservation of our liberties and the safety of our institutions. We are a people devoted not to our own immediate self-interest, but we are concerned with the fate of our children and their children.', 'In this campaign, knowing the responsibilities of the Presidential office as I do, I have felt that I was leading a cause vital to the future of my country and to my children.', 'There is no community where the building up of the home and the advancement of children born amid the handicaps of the desert has called for more sacrifice by men and women, and where its hopes have been more nearly attained than in this city. I ask you to traverse the program which has been laid down by the Democratic Party, their program for long-view policies, and determine whether you think the growth which you have made here in the last 75 years can be continued if you project yourselves for the next 75 years into such a program.', ""I need not explain to you the principles of the protective tariff nor how dependent the Intermountain States are upon its maintenance. I may mention one fact alone and that is, outside of wheat 99.5 percent of your farmers' market depends upon the protective tariff. Nor do I need to point out to you that the only occasion upon which the Democratic candidate has expressed himself upon any particular schedule of the tariff was in a communication through the Cuban press to express his sympathy for the Cuban ambition to remove the tariff on sugar. And I might further call your attention to the explanation given, when confronted with the query as to whether this meant he would remove the sugar tariff, that he would not discuss any particular schedule. The same reply was made when he was asked what he would do about the tariff which today is the sole protection of your cattle and sheep industry, as distressed as prices may be."", 'Now, I submit that if any man is competent to discuss the protective tariff he must know whether the different schedules are too high or too low. He must also know that through the Tariff Commission these schedules can be instantly subjected to reexamination, and if found at fault they can be instantly remedied. I have repeatedly offered to submit any such schedule from the Democratic candidate to the Tariff Commission for their action. As I have stated elsewhere, his reply, when asked why he does not submit these facts or these faults in our tariff in order that they may be remedied, is that he will abolish the independent authority of the Tariff Commission.', 'I do not need to reiterate that I stand flatly for the protective tariff. I stand for the protective tariff which means always the preservation of the American market for the American producer. Further, I stand for the speedy repair of the breaches in its walls which have been made by the depreciation of foreign currencies as a result of this worldwide calamity.', 'This morning I issued the following statement, to the press which explains itself and is as follows:', '""My attention has been called to the misrepresentation by Democratic agencies upon the question of the restriction of Philippine sugar. The Democratic Hawes-Hayes bill provides for a probation for Philippine independence varying from 9 to 17 years, during which time the quota of sugar which can be imported free is to be increased from the present average of the last few years of about 600,000 tons up to 850,000 tons. At the end of that period a catastrophe will come to the Philippine people through the total break of their duty-free trade relations with us.', '""The Republican proposal is of a gradually modified relationship with the Philippines. We say that they cannot in their own interest attain political independence until they have secured economic independence. They depend for their prosperity upon being within the tariff laws of the United States. We therefore say that their amount of duty-free sugar and of other commodities must not be increased at all, but on the contrary must start, in the case of sugar, at 600,000 tons and be reduced every year in order to gradually establish their economic independence. That is in the interest of both the Philippines and the American farmer, and the Democratic proposal is not in the interest of the Filipinos or our farmers.', '""The Democratic proposal continues and makes worse the situation of the American farmer for 9 to 17 years and in the end plunges the Philippines into ruin as the price of their liberty. The Republican proposal, as usual a constructive proposal, gives immediate relief to the beet sugar grower and our other producers and brings about a safe basis of Philippine independence.""', 'And I wish to mention here and now that in securing these additional authorities to the Tariff Commission 2 years ago by which we have taken the tariff out of logrolling and placed it on a sound and effective basis and on a basis which can meet the emergencies with which we are now confronted, Senator Smoot of your State led not only in this fight but also in the fight for the protection of your industries in Utah and for the protection of the entire Nation. And I wish to make one other point. Senator Smoot is the doyen of the United States Senate. By his long service which has continued longer than any other Senator, he has a knowledge of the workings of the United States Government unparalleled by any other man in the United States Senate. It is necessary that Senator Smoot return to the United States Senate where he has given such untiring devotion to his constituents and has not attempted to promote local interests where they were in conflict with the interests of the country as a whole. Two of the political leaders in your neighboring State told me within an hour that they would be glad to have Senator Smoot for the campaign in their State.', 'This has been a campaign of peculiar misrepresentation from our opponents through failure to properly advise the Governor of New York as to facts and the consequent broadcasting time and again of misinformation both as to the origin of events and the actions taken with regard to them and in matters of common statistical accuracy which change the arguments.', 'One of these misrepresentations local to the Intermountain States has been as to my position as to silver. If I had no broader vision than my personal sympathy with every man who works with pick and shovel in the mines, every superintendent, and every owner of a mine, to which industry I devoted myself over a term of years, I would be anxious that their product could be salable at a price which would maintain their livelihood and the prosperity of these States from the national point of view. Increase in the value of silver would relieve us from strains of cheap production of goods which flow over our borders; it would rehabilitate the buying power of many foreign nations for our goods. We have long since determined that there can be but one standard of monetary value and that is gold, but yet we should restore silver to greater use for subsidiary coinage and other purposes in those countries which traditionally have used it and to do it without undermining the gold standard. The problem in the expansion of the use of silver thus becomes a problem which cannot be solved without international action.', 'For a score of years the Congress has been passing resolutions asking for an international conference for this purpose. I took the proper steps many months ago through our diplomatic agents to inquire of the nations, without whose attendance such a conference would be impossible, as to whether or not they would be willing to join in such a conference. They stated they were unwilling to do so at that time. Later on, when the question arose of a world economic conference to consider steps by which the international phases of this stupendous crisis could be further relieved, I stipulated as a condition of American entry into that conference that there should be considered also the methods for the restoration of the use and price of silver as a full part in that conference. That was finally accepted. I have given assurances to the people of the Intermountain region that I shall appoint a representative on the American delegation who will carry their point of view to that conference.', 'I call your attention to the fact that in the history of 30 years this is the only administration which has won for you the consideration of this question by the nations of the world and eight of those years have been Democratic administrations.', ""I have referred to my early visits to this State. The pursuit of that same profession as an engineer took me into many lands peopled by many races, living under strange and diverse philosophies of life and many different forms of government. Later, during the World War in Europe, I saw men of all these origins gathered on the fields of battle waging the deadliest war in human history. I am perhaps the only man who was permitted to move within the battle zone and freely among the people on both sides of the conflict when it was in action. In my mission I discussed--merely as a matter of discernment for my own use--the war with statesmen and generals on all sides of the conflict. Their leaders had summoned their people to arms on every one of a dozen different pleas that are made to persuade men to risk their lives upon the issues of war. Some had been called to resist a hateful philosophy of government; some had been called to preserve their national existence; some had been called to guarantee with their blood a theory of their country's economic interest."", 'Now I would be the last man in the world to say that war is never justified. Many men of my own family have borne arms. I myself in the course of the World War repeatedly stated that I was prepared to serve my country in any capacity from that of laborer to that of soldier in the frontline trenches. There are issues for which it is right that men, if need be, should sacrifice their lives to defend them.', 'Nevertheless, I had at that time 4 years of unique personal observation of the horrors of war, 4 years of study of its causes, and after the armistice I had another year in endeavor to stem the tide of famine to save the children and to reestablish economic life in Europe. I then had another 8 years of intimate study of its appalling aftermaths in dealing with the foreign commerce of our country. And I have grappled daily, in my last 30 years as President in the most responsible office of government in the world, with the fearful aftermaths which had overwhelmed the world from war. All these experiences have impressed upon my mind with ineradicable vividness the colossal error of war as an instrument of national policy. I have learned the futility of war as a solvent of great human problems, and I have perceived the fearful toll that war takes of the generations succeeding the one which fought the battles.', 'Indelibly impressed upon my deepest emotions is the profound conviction that the very first of all problems pressing upon the human race generally, in its large assemblage of nations, is the problem of prevention of future wars. The greatest safety of the world from these crises we are now passing is to prevent war. I see this not only in its terms of crushing economic burdens, not only in its fearful disorganization and dislocation of economic life for years to come, not only in its crushing burdens of taxation for generations innocent of responsibility, I see it far more intensely as a supreme human problem.', ""I see in wars the loss of the glorious young manhood of the world who, but for war's slaughter, would lead the bright columns of human hope and human idealism and human progress to levels far above the past. I see wars in terms of women, widowed or unwed, with fond hopes blasted of homes and children. I see war's most lamentable casualties in homes wrecked and in homes that never even had their chance of being. I see wars in terms of children born into lives foredoomed to ignorance and the toil that dwarfs both mind and spirit. I see war's fatal poison subtly invading the moral ideals of the people, bringing grossness and cynicism where should grow the fine flower of idealism. The world has seen enough of a postwar peace that is not peace, but rather smoulders on in racial hatreds."", 'For these reasons, it has been a major purpose through all of my administration to guide the foreign policy of this Nation so as to maintain our traditional peace with amity with all nations. But, of even more importance, I have sought to do everything in my power to place the full weight of the moral strength of the American people behind every agency, existing or that can be devised, which has for its purpose the upbuilding of the spirit of peace in the world and the maintenance of peace among nations. I have made but one reservation, and that is, we will join no movement that proposes to use military or economic force in its attempts to prevent war. For that is a contradiction in method.', 'And there has been real accomplishment in this direction by our country in this 3 1/2 years. Through strengthening of the Kellogg Pact, beyond even the scope visioned by my predecessor, its great proponent, we have accomplished its acceptance by the entire world as an effective agency through which the moral influence of the world can be, and more than once has been, effectively mobilized to prevent war and sustain peace. The force behind that is the force of mobilized public opinion of the world. That is the greatest force which the world can command. We have sought and secured a large measure of disarmament. We are today placing our every influence to secure further disarmament.', 'If time permitted, I could enumerate a score of other measures and policies and individual cases in which the United States Government, representing the passion of our people for world peace, has been able to advance that cause by practical and effective action.', 'And if it shall be the will of this Nation that for another 4 years I shall continue to lead in the execution of their purposes, they may be assured, both by the pledge of past endeavor and by my solemn pledge for future endeavor, and by the further knowledge of my personal conviction and deep emotion on this subject, that then for yet another 4 years this Nation shall continue to advance in leadership toward the precious goal of worldwide and enduring peace.']"
26,Herbert Hoover ,"November 07, 1932","['[1] OGDEN, UTAH (2:15 p.m.)', 'My friends:', 'It is difficult to find words to express oneself adequate in gratitude for so fine a reception.', 'There are one or two matters of national interest on which I should like to talk a moment with you. The first one of those applies to the question of the working people in the United States. Ogden is particularly a center of industry. You will recollect that in the first month of this depression we brought about an agreement between the employers and the leaders of employees of the Nation that there should be no reductions of wages--that wages should be sustained. And you will recollect that after more than 2 years, not until after the cost of living had decreased and the profits of industry had vanished that that agreement was held. I call your attention to it because this is the first time in the history of 15 depressions in the United States that the first action of the Government has been to protect the working family and the working home. Furthermore, we have sought to give that same protection continuously over this period.', 'Through an administrative order I stopped all immigration into the United States. Had immigration gone on at its normal rate we should have had another half a million men in the United States today to labor in competition with you at the doors of our works and factories. We have continued in that protection. And if you examine the buying power of wages in the United States today, somewhat depressed though they may be, you will find that it is greater in proportion at this moment than it was 4 years ago in comparison with foreign nations. In other words, whatever our difficulties may have been, we have sustained the working family in the United States more fully than any other government in the world. It has been our purpose not only that we should sustain the buying power of our working people, which puts us on a very low level, but it has been a higher purpose that we should remove all cause for industrial conflict in the United States. And we have witnessed for the first time amongst 15 depressions of a century that we have had no consequential industrial disturbances. The number of strikes and lockouts have not only been less in this than in those previous depressions but they have been very much less than even those in the normal course of American life. And in that, there is a tribute to all the working people of the United States and to our employers for a steadfast purpose to maintain the social calm of this country in a period of great crisis.', 'Now, there are many other points which I could go into. The unprecedented measures we have undertaken to carry this country through this crisis have had the greatest success in warding off the calamities which have overturned other nations. The construction work we have undertaken has been three times that known in history; the stimulation of private work; the initiation of another billion and a half of work through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; and finally the placing of the Federal Government behind all of the States in an assurance that there shall be at this calamitous time no single home in which hunger and cold shall enter--those are actions of a government solicitous for the welfare of the working people of the United States. And I am happy to tell you that during the last 4 months, since we have had freedom from the endeavors of the Democratic House of Representatives through its destruction of public confidence, that the measures which we have initiated have begun to show their effects. Over a million of men, up to the end of October, had been returned to work, and they are returning today at the rate of over 500,000 a month. And I have had telegrams as well the last 2 days from every section of the country showing that this reemployment is improving day by day. We are, I am confident, on the way out now.', 'And there are other matters of vital interest to the working people as well as the agricultural people. Every product of this State, from its copper to its sugar, to its lead, to its vegetable products, to its wool, and its cattle are dependent on the maintenance of the protective tariff. Our opponents have assured us that they are going to reduce those tariffs. They talk at times differently in the West from what they do in the East. But nevertheless, the historic action of the party at all times, the promises in their platform, the promises of their candidate can assure that if they are placed in power you will have to meet that catastrophe within the State of Utah.', 'Now, there are other questions of vital importance. They are questions that reach to the very philosophy and basis of our Government that are at stake in this election. To those ends I have endeavored in this campaign by presentation in a manner unprecedented by any President to bring before the American people the concrete facts, and to appeal to their logic, their sense, and their thought, with the hope that they would base their action not upon destructive emotion but upon constructive emotion and upon the logic of their own interest.', 'I want to thank you again for your reception. It is encouraging. It is hopeful. It is helpful, and it is a sign of what you will do on the 8th day of November.', '[2] ELKO, NEVADA (7 p.m.)', 'My friends:', ""At this stage of the campaign my voice has gone somewhat the way that I find Senator Oddie's has gone. I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to you a moment because I want to say something about the Senator."", ""I understand that the usual misrepresentation which seems to be the accompaniment of all the activities of our opponents these days has been directed against the Senator on the silver question. I know something about the history of that problem. I recollect very vividly the Senator's visit to China and the East and his return to Washington and his urgency of the necessity that something must be done in connection with silver if we were to restore the buying power of those countries and if we were to prevent them from manufacturing goods so cheaply as to flood our markets. In response to his urging I made inquiry of the principal nations of Europe as to whether they would accept an invitation to come to a conference in the United States to consider the entire problem, not from the point of view of displacing the gold standard, but from the point of view of increasing the use of silver throughout the world for subsidiary coinage and other purposes. I found unfortunately that some of the other nations were not prepared to enter upon the question at that time, and it went over after considerable delay."", 'The Senator never lost an opportunity to urge action. In fact, I came to more or less dislike him because of his pertinacity on the question. Nevertheless, at a later stage the question arose of an international conference to consider the whole of the problem of this depression, to see if we could find a method by which we would prevent these calamities which had happened from the failures of Europe. And I made it a condition of our attendance at that conference that the silver question should be taken up and should be considered as if it were a separate conference on silver. Then I had to go back to the Senator to secure an appropriation with which to send our delegation to that conference, and he helped in the Senate to secure that appropriation.', 'I have gone even further in this matter and have said that I will select somebody on the recommendation of our leaders in the West as a member of the American delegation that goes to that conference who will represent the western point of view on the silver question. So that you can disabuse your mind of any misrepresentations that have been made about the Senator because I know the character of the people that make them.', 'I am most appreciative of this reception. It is most heartening. It is encouraging as to what you may do on next Tuesday. We have gone through a great crisis. We have adopted unprecedented measures. We have brought our country through that period with less damage than any other country in the world that has been involved in it. Our measures were measures not only of defense but measures of counterattack, and since the chairman of the Democratic House of Representatives made a second destruction of public confidence--up until this gentleman had left Washington that program was beginning to work. And it has shown its results in the fact that, as I have said several times in the last few days, a million men will have returned to work before the end of October. I notice today that the American Federation of Labor revises my figures and puts them up 300,000 higher; in other words, that 1,300,000 have already been restored to their jobs, and they are being restored at the rate of more than 500,000 a month.', 'Another point that I might pass on to you that I have no doubt Senator Oddie has explained to you before, and that is the tariff. Our opponents promise you to reduce the tariff, and disheartening as the prices of our agricultural products are, they are far higher than the prices of any of our competing countries, and our prices would not hold if the tariff were taken down. Our policy has been not only to hold that tariff up but to strengthen it further.', 'And now I thank you again for your reception. I must not address you any further because I will have nothing left for this last radio speech tonight.', 'Thank you.']"
27,Herbert Hoover ,"November 08, 1932","['[1] COLFAX, CALIFORNIA (Rear platform)My friends of Nevada County:', ""I am deeply affected by your welcome. It is difficult to formulate phrases to express the feelings of one's heart on that part of a touching recollection. I recollect the full facts, and I recollect Nevada County with a peculiar vividness because at that age and that time in life one remembers everything that happens. When you are from 15 to 22 or thereabouts, everything is an adventure and everything is an event. As we get along further in life we don't mind, so much, some of us, what happened this month or next month. But at the time I spent in Nevada County I remember everything--the Harmony Mine, and I remember the Grass Valley and the Mayflower and the mine where I worked at one time. All of it I remember, and I remember the road all of the way from here to Nevada City and back again. I have recollections of Colfax from many hundreds of passages through later on, but none are so vivid as at that time."", ""It is fine of you to come down to welcome me so early in the morning. I have to get up about 6 o'clock in the morning to do my normal job, but I didn't know anybody else in the world had to. You will recollect that my voice has just about completed itself, and if the campaign had lasted another 48 hours I should have been whispering everything I had to say."", '[2] SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA (Rear platform, 8:30 a.m.)Fellow Californians:', ""It is always difficult for Californians to express the feeling they have on coming back. I think probably one of the disappointments of the last 4 years has been the inability to leave Washington for more than a night's journey because of the most difficult and terrible crisis which the United States has been going through."", ""The election is on today. Most of you have come to your own conclusions. There are many things that California is interested in in this election. All of our industries, practically, are supported by the protective tariff. However, our opponents say that they will reduce the tariff. California has seen in the last Democratic administration nine-tenths of the products of California placed on the free list, and if it had not been for the intervention of the World War, California's industries would have been destroyed. We are now faced with the same problem. And you have many problems which are important not alone to agriculture. California has many industries besides agriculture which are interested in the protective tariff."", 'I was reading this morning a circular put out by some labor organization here asking why I refused to employ white labor on the ranch I own at Palo Alto. I may say to you in reply to that that I am not unwilling to answer that question. I have not hesitated, and I have no hesitation now in answering any question during the whole of this campaign. First, I have no ranch at Palo Alto, only owning a half acre of ground there. Second, up to 2 years ago I had an interest in a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley, and the photographs which are being circulated were taken about a year and a half ago by a political trick.', 'And that leads me to make a remark on the conduct of the campaign here in California particularly. There has been such unceasing misrepresentation by the Congress of California, and particularly by the press of William Randolph Hearst, that one would have thought that the President of the United States, although he had come from the State of California, was a monster.', 'No attention has been particularly given to the people of California of the tremendous crisis through which the world has passed; the dangers that have been warded off from the American people; and that much as has been the distress we have had, we can point with pride to the fact that there is no starvation and cold in our country as there has been in every other country attacked by this calamity. We can point to the fact that we have made more progress than any other country in the world in emergence from that calamity.', 'During the last 2 or 3 days I can say that our Government departments have stated that during the last 4 months a million of men have been returned to their normal jobs. Last night I received the correction of that statement. The American Federation of Labor does not agree with my statement. They place the month of September increases of employment at 560,000 when I estimated it at 360,000. That increase has been more rapid than I had anticipated, and with that ratio of increase of 1,500,000 men returned to their jobs as the result of the constructive measures which we have introduced in Washington for the benefit of every family and fireside in the United States; the picture of the presentation of those measures has been distorted and has been misrepresented morning, noon, and night to the people of California.', 'I have gotten on to a vein which I had not thought to discuss because of the statement which was presented to me a few moments ago.', 'But I do want to express to you my gratitude for the welcome which you have given to me back to my native State--my State of California. I established my home here 17 years ago, and it has been my home ever since that time. The major absences from this State I have given in public service to the American people. Your reception gives me faith and confidence and hope, and I thank you for it.', '[3] OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA (Rear platform, 11:10 a.m.)Friends in Oakland:', 'It is difficult to phrase the expression and the depth of feeling I have at the welcome that I have received not only by yourselves in this courteous and gracious reception but that I have received in every village since I entered the State of California. I felt it was a homecoming not to the President of the United States but the homecoming of a fellow Californian.', 'Four years now our Nation has been in the depths of the greatest crisis ever known in its peacetime history. It has been involved in the fears of the calamities of a score of nations. I have not felt that California would want their representative in the Presidency to leave his station of duty for even an hour when it was necessary for national good. I have therefore not been away from the National Capital for more than a night for over 2 1/2 years. Now that things are becoming better, now that the country has turned the tide and is moving toward recovery with great rapidity, I have felt justified in returning back to my State to vote. I am not going to discuss national issues with you now.', 'I want to thank you from the depth of my heart for the welcome that you are giving me on my return home.', '[4] SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA (Civic Center)My fellow Californians:', 'I am deeply moved by the reception I have in coming home to my own State. I have been absent now for nearly 4 years. Any Californian suffers a deprivation if he is away for so long a period from its hills and valleys and from people of his own kind. Nothing but the greatest national crisis we have ever met in peacetime, nothing but the office to which you in California have elected me, would have held me so long from the refreshment of soul that comes to every man from the hills, valleys, and mountains and the people of California.', ""I have felt that I could only properly represent California which sent me to the Presidency by staying on the job day and night so long as there was peril to this Nation. Until this journey, I have not in 2ð years been able to be away from the Capital of the Nation for more than a night's journey. But the measures that have been taken by our administration have now proved such overwhelming evidence of the turn of the tide that I have felt justified in returning home to vote with my neighbors."", 'The other day a man discovered a fact that I had known for most of my life--that my first registration as a voter at the age of 21 was across the bay from this city and for the purpose of voting for President McKinley.', 'Now, the receptions I have had at every station and in every town since early this morning will remain as a never-to-be-forgotten memory of welcome, not as President of the United States but as a fellow Californian. This I feel to be the spirit today in this my home city. I have had memories raised as I have driven out from the ferry. Many landmarks have been wiped away before the march of progress.', 'I get a special joy out of the mass of children who have come to see me along the way and who are here in such numbers today. They are the dearest product of California, these our healthy, ambitious children. They are the sweetest things in our lives because they are nearest from the hands of God.', 'I wish again to express my gratification for the generosity, the courtesy, and the enthusiasm of your welcome. It is not my purpose to discuss national issues at this time. Today is the day when you are registering your views on the future conduct of your country. That is the most solemn act of your citizenship. You have already made your determinations, and the result will greatly depend upon the views expressed by my own State.', 'I have represented California for 4 years in the Presidency of the United States, and in many other years prior to that I have represented my country in great national undertakings. I can say to you that the name of California is wider known, the glories of its hills, valleys, and of its people have wider spread because of that, and there has been no time when the esteem of the Nation or the world for California and its ideals has not been upheld by my representation of your State.', '[5] PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA (Memorial Court, Stanford University)My friends:', 'I am just glad to come home. I have brought back everything with me except my voice. I can tell you the emotions of occasions like this are too much for expression. I just thank you.']"
