0,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"July 20, 1944","['I have already indicated to you why I accept the nomination that you have offered me—in spite of my desire to retire to the quiet of private life.', 'You in this Convention are aware of what I have sought to gain for the Nation, and you have asked me to continue.', 'It seems wholly likely that within the next four years our armed forces, and those of our allies, will have gained a complete victory over Germany and Japan, sooner or later, and that the world once more will be at peace—under a system, we hope that will prevent a new world war. In any event, whenever that time comes, new hands will then have full opportunity to realize the ideals which we seek.', 'In the last three elections the people of the United States have transcended party affiliation. Not only Democrats but also forward-looking Republicans and millions of independent voters have turned to progressive leadership- a leadership which has sought consistently—and with fair success—to advance the lot of the average American citizen who had been so forgotten during the period after the last war. I am confident that they will continue to look to that same kind of liberalism to build our safer economy for the future.', 'I am sure that you will understand me when I say that my decision, expressed to you formally tonight, is based solely on a sense of obligation to serve if called upon to do so by the people of the United States.', 'I shall not campaign, in the usual sense, for the office. In these days of tragic sorrow, I do not consider it fitting. And besides, in these days of global warfare, I shall not be able to find the time. I shall, however, feel free to report to the people the facts about matters of concern to them and especially to correct any misrepresentations.', 'During the past few days I have been coming across the whole width of the continent, to a naval base where I am speaking to you now from the train.', 'As I was crossing the fertile lands and the wide plains and the Great Divide, I could not fail to think of the new relationship between the people of our farms and cities and villages and the people of the rest of the world overseas- on the islands of the Pacific, in the Far East, and in the other Americas, in Britain and Normandy and Germany and Poland and Russia itself.', 'For Oklahoma and California, for example, are becoming a part of all these distant spots as greatly as Massachusetts and Virginia were a part of the European picture in 1778. Today, Oklahoma and California are being defended in Normandy and on Saipan; and they must be defended there—for what happens in Normandy and Saipan vitally affects the security and well-being of every human being in Oklahoma and California.', 'Mankind changes the scope and the breadth of its thought and vision slowly indeed. In the days of the Roman Empire eyes were focused on Europe and the Mediterranean area. The civilization in the Far East was barely known. The American continents were unheard of.', 'And even after the people of Europe began to spill over to other continents, the people of North America in Colonial days knew only their Atlantic seaboard and a tiny portion of the other Americas, and they turned mostly for trade and international relationship to Europe. Africa, at that time, was considered only as the provider of human chattels. Asia was essentially unknown to our ancestors.', 'During the nineteenth century, during that era of development and expansion on this continent, we felt a natural isolation—geographic, economic, and political—an isolation from the vast world which lay overseas.', 'Not until this generation—roughly this century—have people here and elsewhere been compelled more and more to widen the orbit of their vision to include every part of the world. Yes, it has been a wrench perhaps—but a very necessary one.', 'It is good that we are all getting that broader vision. For we shall need it after the war. The isolationists and the ostriches who plagued our thinking before Pearl Harbor are becoming slowly extinct. The American people now know that all Nations of the world- large and small- will have to play their appropriate part in keeping the peace by force, and in deciding peacefully the disputes which might lead to war.', 'We all know how truly the world has become one- that if Germany and Japan, for example, were to come through this war with their philosophies established and their armies intact, our own grandchildren would again have to be fighting in their day for their liberties and their lives.', 'Some day soon we shall all be able to fly to any other part of the world within twenty-four hours. Oceans will no longer figure as greatly in our physical defense as they have in the past. For our own safety and for our own economic good, therefore -if for no other reason- we must take a leading part in the maintenance of peace and in the increase of trade among all the Nations of the world.', 'And that is why your Government for many, many months has been laying plans, and studying the problems of the near future—preparing itself to act so that the people of the United States may not suffer hardships after the war, may continue constantly to improve their standards, and may join with other Nations in doing the same. There are even now working toward that end, the best staff in all our history- men and women of all parties and from every part of the Nation. I realize that planning is a word which in some places brings forth sneers. But, for example, before our entry into the war it was planning. which made possible the magnificent organization and equipment of the Army and Navy of the United States which are fighting for us and for our civilization today.', 'Improvement through planning is the order of the day. Even m military affairs, things do not stand still. An army or a navy trained and equipped and fighting according to a 1932 model would not have been a safe reliance in 1944. And if we are to progress in our civilization, improvement is necessary in other fields—in the physical things that are a part of our daily lives, and also in the concepts of social justice at home and abroad.', 'I am now at this naval base in the performance of my duties under the Constitution. The war waits for no elections. Decisions must be made- plans must be laid—strategy must be carried out. They do not concern merely a party or a group. They will affect the daily lives of Americans for generations to come.', 'What is the job before us in 1944? First, to win the war—to win the war fast, to win it overpoweringly. Second, to form worldwide international organizations, and to arrange to use the armed forces of the sovereign Nations of the world to make another war impossible within the foreseeable future. And third, to build an economy for our returning veterans and for all Americans—which will provide employment and provide decent standards of living.', 'The people of the United States will decide this fall whether they wish to turn over this 1944 job—this worldwide job—to inexperienced or immature hands, to those who opposed lend-lease and international cooperation against the forces of aggression and tyranny, until they could read the polls of popular sentiment; or whether they wish to leave it to those who saw the danger from abroad, who met it head-on, and who now have seized the offensive and carried the war to its present stages of success—to those who, by international conferences and united actions have begun to build that kind of common understanding and cooperative experience which will be so necessary in the world to come.', 'They will also decide, these people of ours, whether they will entrust the task of postwar reconversion to those who offered the veterans of the last war breadlines and apple-selling and who finally led the American people down to the abyss of 1932; or whether they will leave it to those who rescued American business, agriculture, industry, finance, and labor in 1933, and who have already planned and put through much legislation to help our veterans resume their normal occupations in a well-ordered reconversion process.', 'They will not decide these questions by reading glowing words or platform pledges—the mouthings of those who are willing to promise anything and everything—contradictions, inconsistencies, impossibilities—anything which might snare a few votes here and a few votes there.', 'They will decide on the record—the record written on the seas, on the land, and in the skies.', 'They will decide on the record of our domestic accomplishments in recovery and reform since March 4, 1933.', 'And they will decide on the record of our war production and food production- unparalleled in all history, in spite of the doubts and sneers of those in high places who said it cannot be done.', 'They will decide on the record of the International Food Conference, of U.N.R.R.A., of the International Labor Conference, of the International Education Conference, of the International Monetary Conference.', 'And they will decide on the record written in the Atlantic Charter, at Casablanca, at Cairo, at Moscow, and at Teheran.', 'We have made mistakes. Who has not?', 'Things will not always be perfect. Are they ever perfect, in human affairs?', 'But the objective at home and abroad has always been clear before us. Constantly, we have made steady, sure progress toward that objective. The record is plain and unmistakable as to that—a record for everyone to read.', 'The greatest wartime President in our history, after a wartime election which he called the ""most reliable indication of public purpose in this country,"" set the goal for the United States, a goal in terms as applicable today as they were in 1865—-terms which the human mind cannot improve:', '"". . . .with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the Nation\'s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan- to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all Nations.""']"
1,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 21, 1944","['I wanted to come here for two reasons. You know I come from the State of New York, and I have made a series of inspection tours here. I come from the State of New York and I practiced law in New York City, but I have never been to Ebbets Field before. I have rooted for the Dodgers. And I hope to come back here some day and see them play.', 'But the chief reason I came here today is to pay a little tribute to my old friend Bob Wagner. We were together in the legislature—I would hate to say how long ago—thirty-some years ago, in the Senate of the State of New York, and we have been close friends ever since, I think largely because we had the same ideals of being of service to our fellow men.', ""If anybody knew and could visualize all the way through the help that Bob Wagner has been to mankind, there wouldn't be any question about asking him to go back to the Senate for six years more, to carry on the splendid service that he has rendered."", 'And so I just came here to say that word in his behalf. He deserves well of mankind.', 'Thanks ever so much.']"
2,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 27, 1944","['This is like a homecoming. As a matter of fact, I think I am a little superstitious. Eight years ago, I came here, on the way to Philadelphia, and I said a few words; and four years ago I came here and said a few words. The results go by threes.', 'Somebody tells me that we are holding a national election, but remember that we are holding a national election while the Nation is at war—and this is the first time that an election has been held under these conditions since 1864—eighty years ago.', 'And that recalls to my mind a remark made by Abraham Lincoln- and I think I quoted him here the last time, or the time before—when Lincoln was campaigning against Stephen A. Douglas—a remark that I think is particularly timely and applicable in this campaign.', 'Lincoln said, about something that Douglas had said, ""In every way possible he tried to prove that a horse chestnut is a chestnut horse.""', 'It seems to me that that applies very neatly to some of the Republican political oratory that has lately been agitating the air waves.', 'I do not believe that this oratory is really disturbing the progress of events here in Wilmington, or in the State of Delaware. You have shown the way before, what to believe and what not to believe.', 'I think you all know the difference between a chestnut horse and a horse chestnut.', 'You know a great deal about the size and the quality of the effort that has gone into the performance of our great job of production.', 'The products of Wilmington have made quite a lot of noise around the world.', 'I myself—being, I might say, ""amphibious-minded""—am particularly interested in the landing ships that you have built right here along the Delaware River.', 'Remember that those landing ships—built in your back yards, so to speak—and all the various types of landing craft, have played a tremendous part in the winning of this war.', 'In the Pacific and eastern seas, and the European seas, we have had to send our troops thousands of miles, across both oceans, to land on beaches held by the enemy. We had to have entirely new kinds of vessels to do the final and the toughest job of all—Sicily, Salerno, and Normandy, the Marshalls, the Gilberts, the Marianas, and now, thank God, the Philippines—all of those historic operations have been made possible by the brilliant work of our Navy and our Army in developing new methods of amphibious attack.', 'And the workers—the ship builders—the industrial engineers—the chemists—and the plain citizens of this State of Delaware have contributed mightily to the victories that we have won.', 'And when I mention the word ""workers,"" I want to make it clear that I include all kinds of work. For example, there are the white-collar workers, who do jobs that are unspectacular but are of vital importance in our war effort and our whole American life.', ""In this national election, held in wartime, I hope that every citizen of Wilmington and of Delaware—every man and woman who is qualified to vote—will step up to the polls on election day and cast his or her ballot—in this State two ballots. I don't want to advise you to vote early and often, because I might go to jail."", 'But a big vote in this State, in this city, and every State in the Union this year will speak powerfully for the cause of democracy all over the world.']"
3,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 27, 1944","['My friends:', 'I am glad to come back to Philadelphia. Today is the anniversary of the birth of a great fighting American—Theodore Roosevelt.', 'This day—his birthday—is celebrated every year as Navy Day—and I think that Theodore Roosevelt would be happy and proud to know that our American fleet today is greater than all the navies of the world put together.', 'And when I say all the navies, I am including what was until three days ago—the Japanese fleet.', 'Since Navy Day a year ago, our armed forces- Army, Navy, and Air forces—have participated in no fewer than twenty-seven different D-Days- twenty-seven different landings in force on enemy-held soil.', 'Every one of those landings has been an incredibly complicated, and hazardous undertaking, as you realize, requiring months of most careful planning, flawless coordination, and literally split-second timing in execution. The larger operations have required hundreds of warships, thousands of smaller craft, thousands of airplanes, and hundreds of thousands of men.', 'And every one of these twenty-seven D-Days has been a triumphant success.', 'I think it is a remarkable achievement that within less than five months we have been able to carry out major offensive operations in both Europe and the Philippines—thirteen thousand miles apart from each other.', 'And speaking of the glorious operations in the Philippines, I wonder—whatever became of the suggestion made a few weeks ago, that I had failed for political reasons to send enough forces or supplies to General MacArthur?', 'Now of course, I realize that in this political campaign it is considered by some to be very impolite to mention the fact that there is a war on.', 'But, the war is still on and eleven million American fighting men know it- and so do their families. And in that war I bear a responsibility that I can never shirk and never, for one instant, forget.', 'For the Constitution of the United States says—and I hope you will pardon me if I quote it correctly- ""The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.""', 'And I am not supposed to mention that, either.', 'But somehow or other, it seems to me that this is a matter of considerable importance to the people of the United States.', 'You know, it was due to no accident and no oversight that the framers of our Constitution—in this City—put the command of our armed forces under civilian authority.', 'And as a result it is the duty of the Commander in Chief to appoint the Secretaries of War and Navy and the Chiefs of Staff—and I feel called upon to offer no apologies for my selection of Henry Stimson, the late Frank Knox, and Jim Forrestal, or of Admiral Leahy, General Marshall, Admiral King, and General Arnold.', ""Furthermore, the Commander in Chief has final responsibility for determining how our resources shall be distributed as between our land forces, our sea forces, and our air forces, and as among the different theaters of operation, and also what portion of' these great resources of ours .shall be turned over to our allies."", 'Our teamwork with our allies in this war has involved innumerable intricate problems that could be settled only around the conference table by those who had final authority.', 'The other day, I am told, a prominent Republican orator stated that: ""There are not five civilians in the entire national Government who have the confidence and respect of the American people.""', 'In fact, he went on to describe your present Administration as ""the most spectacular collection of incompetent people who ever held public office.""', 'Well, you know, that is pretty serious, because the only conclusion to be drawn from that is that we are losing this war. If so, that will be news to most of us—and it will certainly be news to the Nazis and the Japs.', 'Now, I like a thing called the record, and the record will show that from almost the first minute of this Administration—twelve years ago, nearly—I started to rebuild the United States Navy which had been whittled down during previous Administrations. What the Navy suffered from conspicuously during three Republican administrations was a drastic false economy, which not only scrapped ships but even prevented adequate target practice, adequate maneuvers, enough oil, or adequate supplies. Indeed, it reached the point that on some vessels the crews—who at least were patriotic—chipped in out of their own pockets to buy their own brass polish to keep the bright work shining.', 'The record will show that when we were attacked in December, 1941, we had already made tremendous progress toward building the greatest war machine the world has ever known.', ""Take, for example, just the other day, the ships of Admiral Halsey's powerful Third Fleet that helped to give the Japanese Navy the worst licking in its history."", 'Every battleship in his Fleet was authorized between 1933 and 1938. Construction had begun on all of those battleships by September, 1940—well over a year before Pearl Harbor.', ""All but two of the great force of cruisers in Admiral Halsey's Fleet were authorized between 1933 and 1940; and construction on all but one of them had begun before Pearl Harbor."", 'All of the aircraft carriers in that Fleet had been authorized by the present Administration before Pearl Harbor, and half of them were actually under construction before Pearl Harbor.', 'There is the answer- just a little part of it- once and for all —to a Republican candidate who said that this Administration had made, ""absolutely no military preparation for the events that it now claims it foresaw.""', 'Why, less than three months before Hitler launched his murderous assault against Poland, the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted 144-8 in favor of cutting the appropriations for the Army Air Corps.', 'I often think how Hitler and Hirohito must have laughed in those days.', 'But they are not laughing now.', 'And in the spring of 1940, before we were attacked, I called for the production of fifty thousand airplanes- and that same Republican candidate spoke scornfully of such a proposition, calling it a ""publicity stunt,"" and saying it would take four years to reach such a goal.', 'But, we have since then produced more than two hundred and forty thousand airplanes. Fifty thousand, and laughed at! But today we have attained a production rate of more than nine thousand per month—more than a hundred thousand a year.', 'And we have trained eight hundred and fifty thousand American boys to be the pilots, the navigators, the bombardiers, aerial gunners, and other members of their crews.', 'I admit that the figures seem fantastic—but the results were not impossible to those who had real faith in America.', ""I won't go on very long with these figures, but they ought to be known. In 1940, we had a regular Army of approximately two hundred and fifty thousand, and a reserve, including the National Guard, of three hundred and fifty thousand."", ""Today, there's a bit of a difference. We have eight million in our Army, including a hundred and twenty-six thousand women. And here's a piece of news: More than half of our Army is overseas."", 'Now the Navy. In 1940 we had three hundred and sixty-nine combat ships. We had one hundred and eighty-nine thousand men.', 'Today, we have more than fifteen hundred combat vessels, supported by an armada of fifty thousand other ships, including landing craft. As you know, a lot of those landing craft have been built not very far away from here, on the Delaware River. And we have more than three and a half million men in our Navy, and over one hundred thousand women.', 'Never before in history—at least, in our history—have the soldiers and sailors of any Nation gone into battle so thoroughly trained, so thoroughly equipped, so well fed, so thoroughly supported as the American soldiers and sailors fighting today in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific.', 'In his report to the Secretary of War, in 1943, General Marshall wrote, ""In matters of personnel, military intelligence, training, supply and preparation of war plans, sound principles and policies had been established in the preparation for just such an emergency as arose.""', 'After we were attacked by the Japanese, and Hitler and Mussolini had declared war on us, some people in this country urged that we go on the defensive- that we pull in our fleet to guard this continent—that we send no forces overseas.', 'That policy was rejected. In my first war message to the Congress, less than a month after Pearl Harbor, I said this:', '""We cannot wage this war in a defensive spirit. As our power and our resources are fully mobilized, we shall carry the attack against the enemy —we shall hit him and hit him again wherever and whenever we can reach him. We must keep him far from our shores, for we intend to bring this battle to him on his own home grounds.""', 'And that, my friends, is the policy that we have successfully followed.', 'In our over-all strategy, we planned our war effort in three phases:', 'The first phase could be called ""plugging the line""—that meant stopping the Germans, and stopping the Japs from expanding their conquests to such key points as Australia and the British Isles- for England then was still very vulnerable to invasion.', 'Within a month after Pearl Harbor, American expeditionary forces were moving across the Pacific many thousands of miles to Australia, and across the Atlantic more thousands of miles to northern Ireland and England. Our air forces went to the Southwest Pacific, to India, to China, the Middle East, and Great Britain.', 'In this first phase we furnished arms to the British that helped them to stop the Germans in Egypt—and arms to the Russians that helped them to stop the Germans at Stalingrad.', 'And our own growing forces stopped the Japanese in the Coral Sea and at Midway.', ""The second phase was the shattering of the enemy's outer defenses- establishing bases from which to launch our major attacks."", 'That phase began with the operations in New Guinea, in the Solomons, and in North Africa. It continued through all the operations—the Marshalls, the Gilberts, the Marianas, the Carolines, the Aleutians, and now the Philippines. And it went on in Europe with the landings in Sicily and Italy and finally in France itself.', 'The war in Europe has now reached the final, decisive phase, the attack on Germany itself.', 'It is true, we will have much longer and much farther to go in the war against Japan. But every day that goes by speeds it up.', ""All of these operations had to be planned far in advance. You can't imagine how tired I sometimes get when I am told that something that looks simple is going to take three months- six months to do. Well, that is part of the job of a Commander in -Chief. Sometimes I have to be disappointed, sometimes I have . to go along with the estimates of the professionals. That does not mean merely drawing arrows on maps- planning. It has meant planning in terms of precisely how many men will be needed, and how many ships- warships, cargo ships, landing craft-how many bombers, how many fighter planes—how much equipment—food—what types of equipment down to the last cartridge. And, it has meant getting all of them to the right place at the right time."", 'It has meant establishing for our Army and Navy supply lines extending over fifty-six thousand miles- more than twice the circumference of this earth. It has meant establishing the lines of the Air Transport Command—a hundred and fifty thousand miles of air-supply systems running on the clock.', 'It has meant moving supplies along these lines at the rate of almost three million long tons a month—requiring five hundred and seventy-six cargo ships to leave our ports with supplies every month. It has meant moving more than fourteen million barrels of gasoline and oil a month, requiring a hundred and fifty-six tanker sailings a month. And all those ships and all those tankers were built in American shipyards.', 'So, to sum it up, I think we can say that the production necessary to equip and maintain our vast force of fighting men on global battlefronts is without parallel.', 'I need not repeat the figures. The facts speak for themselves. They speak with the thunder of tens of thousands of guns on battlefields all over the world. They speak with the roar of more than a million tons of bombs dropped by our air forces.', 'The whole story of our vast effort in this war has been the story of incredible achievement—the story of the job that has been done by an Administration which, I am told, is ""old, and tired and quarrelsome.""', 'And while we have been doing that job, we have constantly investigated and publicized our whole management of the war effort. I call particular attention to the thorough and painstaking and completely non-partisan work of that committee of the Senate that was organized and presided over by Harry Truman.', 'I am very certain that the Truman Committee has done a job that will live in history as an example of honest, efficient government at work.', 'But there is one thing I want to say, and it cannot be told in figures.', 'I want to express the conviction that the greatest of our past American heroes—the heroes of Bunker Hill and Gettysburg-and San Juan Hill and Manila Bay and the Argonne- would consider themselves honored to be associated with our fighting men of today.', 'Those boys hated, and these boys hate, war.', 'The average American citizen is not a soldier by choice.', 'But our boys have proved that they can take on the best of our militaristic enemies, the best that they can put forward- they can take them on and beat them. And we must never forget that our allies, by resisting the aggressors to the last ditch, gave us time to train our men and prepare their equipment before they went into battle.', 'The quality of our American fighting men is not all a matter of training or equipment, or organization. It is essentially a matter of spirit. That spirit is expressive of their faith in America.', 'The most important fact in our national life today is the essential fact of eleven million young Americans in our armed forces—more than half of them overseas.', 'When you multiply that eleven million by their families and their friends, you have the whole American people personally involved in this war- a war that was forced upon us, a war which we did our utmost to avoid, a war that came upon us as inevitably as an earthquake..', 'I think particularly of the mothers and wives and sisters and sweethearts of the men in service. There are great numbers of these gallant women who do not have the satisfaction or the distraction of jobs in war plants. But they have the quiet, essential job of keeping the homes going, caring for the children or the old folks.', 'Mrs. Roosevelt and I hear very often from a great many of these women who live in loneliness and anxiety while their men are far away.', 'I can speak as one who knows something of the feelings of a parent with sons who are in the battle line overseas. I know that, regardless of the outcome of this election, our sons must and will go on fighting for whatever length of time is necessary for victory.', 'And when this great job in winning the war is done, the men of our armed forces will be demobilized, they will be returned to their homes just as rapidly as possible. The War Department and the Navy Department are pledged to that. I am pledged to that. The very law of the land, enacted by the Congress, is pledged to that. And there are no strings attached to the pledge.', 'While this agony of the war lasts, the families of our fighting men can be certain that their boys are being given and always will be given the best equipment, the best arms, the best food, the best medical care that the resources of the Nation and the genius of the Nation can provide. And I am not engaging in undue boasting when I say that that is the best in the world.', 'Take health, as an example. The health of our Army and Navy and Marines and Coast Guard is now better than it was in peacetime. Although our forces have been fighting in all kinds of climates, exposed to all the diseases, the death rate from disease has shrunk to one twentieth of one percent—in other words, less than one seventh of the death rate from disease for men in the same age group in civilian life. That is something to think over and repeat to your neighbor. And the mortality rate among the people who have been wounded is less than three percent, as compared with over eight percent in the last world war.', 'I have chosen Navy Day, today, to talk about the eleven million Americans in uniform, who with all their strength are engaged in giving us a chance to achieve peace through victory in war.', 'These men could not have been armed, and they could not be equipped as they are, had it not been for the miracle of our production here back home.', 'The production that has flowed from this country to all the battlefronts of the world has been due to the efforts of American business, and American labor, and American farmers- working together as a patriotic team.', 'And the businessmen of America have had a vital part in this war. They have displayed the highest type of patriotism by their devotion, their industry, their ingenuity, and their cooperation with their Government.', 'I am proud of the fact that in this Administration today there are a great many Republican businessmen who have placed patriotism above party.', 'But, unfortunately, there are some Republican politicians—in and out of the Congress—who are introducing a very ugly implication into this campaign- an implication of profound concern to all Americans, regardless of party, who believe that this war must be followed by a just and lasting peace.', 'These politicians are stating that the Republicans in the Congress would cooperate with a Republican President in establishing a world organization for peace while at the same time they are clearly intimating that they would not cooperate toward the same end in the event of a Democratic victory.', 'That, coming in the closing days of the campaign, it seems to me, is a deliberate and indefensible effort to place political advantage not only above devotion to country but also above our very deep desire to avoid the death and destruction that would be caused by future wars.', 'I do not think that the American people will take kindly to this policy of ""Vote my way or I won\'t play.""', 'May this country never forget that its power in this war has come from the efforts of its citizens, living in freedom and equality.', 'May this country hold in piety and steadfast faith those who have battled and died to give it new opportunities for service and growth.', 'May it reserve its contempt for those who see in it only an . instrument for their own selfish interests.', 'May it marshal its righteous wrath against those who would divide it by racial struggles. May it lavish its scorn upon the faint-hearted.', 'Finally, may this country always give its support to those who have engaged with us in the war against oppression and who will continue with us in the struggle for a vital, creative peace.', 'God Bless the United States of America.']"
4,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 28, 1944","['My friends of Fort Wayne:', 'I have to say on this occasion ""my friends of Indiana,"" because it is the only chance that I\'ll have to say just a few words in this State. This is a very big country, and of the forty-eight of the brethren, Indiana is only one; but I am glad to have a chance to come here, if only for these few minutes.', 'I have been here before several times, and I know that you citizens in this city have done and are doing so much to help us win the war.', 'I have heard some rather irritated comment by Republican campaign orators about taking a campaign trip.', ""They don't like it."", 'They seem to believe that I promised them- way back when I was nominated at the convention presided over by your Senator—they seemed to believe that I was not going to campaign under any circumstances, and therefore that they could say anything they wanted to about my policies and my Administration.', 'However, they conveniently overlook what I actually said in my speech of acceptance last July, and I think the Senator will bear me out. I am going to quote from that speech very briefly-and I am sure you will pardon me if I quote it correctly—because, you know, a long time ago, when I was Governor of New York, I formed the habit of quoting correctly. I said I wasn\'t going to conduct the usual campaign. I said, however: ""I shall, however, feel free to report to the people the facts about matters of concern to them and especially to correct any misrepresentations.""', 'So that is why I am going out to Chicago for another similar speech tonight. I believe the American people know what those misrepresentations have been. They know what they are, and they know just who made them. I think the American people know that in my speeches in this campaign I have pointed out and corrected many of these misrepresentations.', 'I have a conviction that the people of Indiana, the majority of the voters of Indiana, know that I am the same Franklin Roosevelt who started in campaigning twelve years ago. And between now and election day I expect to point out and correct some more misrepresentations—because if you are a betting person, the odds are that there will be a great many more misrepresentations.', 'You good people in Fort Wayne have had first-hand knowledge of the great production job which has been done in this State, and in this great railroad center.', 'For example, you know how efficiently, how quickly railroads all over the United States have delivered the goods.', 'It has been a tremendous job for these railroads, geared to the needs of a peacetime America, to be converted almost overnight to the demands of fighting this war. The way our railroads have transported munitions and men to all parts of the United States and to our sea coast, to be sent to our fighting fronts all over the world, has earned and deserved the admiration and gratitude of the entire American people.', 'And do not forget that American railroad men are doing a fine railroad job in this war with all our armies and our navy all over the world. A lot of them got their training right here. I think these railroad men deserve to know what the American people think of them as doing their bit in this war, just as much as if they were in the uniform of the Army or the Navy instead of the uniform of the railroad.', 'And it so happens that I discovered, about an hour ago, that on my train there is a brakeman named Morrison. He used to live in Fort Wayne. He is the kind of person who is doing his job in this war. He is somewhere here on the platform with me. That is a pure coincidence—but he is a type. And this year it so happens that he is running for the legislature in Indiana.', 'Well, I see by the papers that Indiana is a ""doubtful State."" And there are a lot of other ""doubtful States,"" according to the poll people. That means that the people who run the public opinion polls cannot agree with each other as to which way the State is going on election day.', 'Of course, I may have my hunch—which happens to be the same hunch as the Governor of your State has- and on several occasions our hunches have coincided and have proved to be true.', ""But there is one thing that is not doubtful about this State and that is the ability of its people to produce. That goes for Indiana's industries and Indiana's farms. You have all been greatly helpful in conducting—with other States—the greatest war that this world has ever seen in all the centuries."", 'And I hope that regardless of which party you support on election day, you will produce a record crop of votes.', ""I would hate to be reelected by a little bit of a vote. That wouldn't spell democracy. If I am reelected, I want it to be a big vote. And if I should be defeated, I don't want to be defeated by a small vote. I would always have the feeling that if everybody had come out and voted, I would be in again."", 'And so I just want to tell you that I am awfully glad to have a chance to make this stop.', ""I wish that I could campaign in the usual sense- but you know, as I said last night, in some circles it's not the thing to do. I am in the middle of a war. And so are you. We are all in it. We are going to win it, if we keep on with the same splendid cooperation that we have had in the past. It is quite a job, but I am perfectly able to take it, and you are too, until we win."", ""And so let me tell you that I am glad to see you, and I hope to come back once more in the next four years—as President of the United States. And as I said before, you will find me just the same, and I'll wear the same sized hat.""]"

I shall give the Republican campaign orators some more opportunities to say—""me too.""', 'Today, everything we do is devoted to the most important job before us—winning the war and bringing our men and women home as quickly as possible.', 'We have astonished the whole world and confounded our enemies with our stupendous war production, with the overwhelming courage and skill of our fighting men—with the bridge of ships carrying our munitions and men through the seven seas -with our gigantic fleet which has pounded the enemy all over the Pacific and has just driven through for another touchdown.', 'Yes, the American people are prepared to meet the problems of peace in the same bold way that they have met the problems of war.', 'For the American people are resolved that when our men and women return home from this war, they shall come back to the best possible place on the face of the earth- they shall come back to a place where all persons, regardless of race, and color, or creed or place of birth, can live in peace and honor and human dignity- free to speak, free to pray as they wish—free from want- and free from fear.', 'Last January, in my message to the Congress on the State of the Union, I outlined an Economic Bill of Rights on which ""a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for all.""', 'And I repeat it now:', '""The right of a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the Nation;', '""The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;', '""The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;', '""The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;""The right of every family to a decent home;', '""The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;', '""The right to adequate protection from the economic-fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;', '""The right to a good education.""', 'Now, what do those rights mean? They ""spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.""', 'Some people—I need not name them- have sneered at these ideals as well as at the ideals of the Atlantic Charter, the ideals of the Four Freedoms. They have said that they were the dreams of starry-eyed New Dealers—that it is silly to talk of them because we cannot attain these ideals tomorrow or the next day.', 'The American people have greater faith than that. I know that they agree with these objectives—that they demand them -that they are determined to get them- and that they are going to get them.', 'The American people have a good habit—the habit of going right ahead and accomplishing the impossible.', 'We know that, and other people know it. Today, there are those that know it best of all: the Nazis and the Japs.', 'Now, this Economic Bill of Rights is the recognition of the simple fact that, in America, the future of the worker, the future of the farmer lies in the well-being of private enterprise; and that the future of private enterprise lies in the well-being of the worker and the farmer. It goes both ways.', 'And the well-being of the Nation as a whole is synonymous with the well-being of each and every one of its citizens.', 'Now I have the possibly old-fashioned theory that when you have problems to solve, when you have objectives to achieve, you cannot get very far by just talking about them.', 'We have got to go out and do something!', 'To assure the full realization of the right to a useful and remunerative employment, an adequate program must, and if I have anything to do about it will, provide America with close to sixty million productive jobs.', 'I foresee an expansion of our peacetime productive capacity that will require new facilities, new plants, new equipment-capable of hiring millions of men.', 'I propose that the Government do its part in helping private enterprise to finance expansion of our private industrial plant through normal investment channels.', 'For example, business, large and small, must be encouraged by the Government to expand its plants, to replace its obsolete or worn-out equipment with new equipment. And to that end, the rate of depreciation on these new plants and facilities for tax purposes should be accelerated. That means more jobs for the worker, increased profits for the businessman, and a lower cost to the consumer.', 'In 1933, when my Administration took office, vast numbers of our industrial workers were unemployed, our plants and our businesses were idle, our monetary and banking system was in ruins—our economic resources were running to waste.', 'But by 1940—before Pearl Harbor—we had increased our employment by ten million workers. We had converted a corporate loss of five and one-half billion dollars in 1932, to a corporate profit (after taxes) of nearly five billion dollars in 1940.', 'Obviously, to increase jobs after this war, we shall have to in- crease demand for our industrial and agricultural production not only here at home, but abroad also.', 'I am sure that every man and woman in this vast gathering here tonight will agree with me in my conviction that never again must we in the United States attempt to isolate ourselves from the rest of humanity.', 'I am convinced that, with Congressional approval, the foreign trade of the United States can be trebled after the war—providing millions of more jobs.', 'Such cooperative measures provide the soundest economic foundation for a lasting peace. And, after this war, we do not intend to settle for anything less than a lasting peace.', 'When we think of the America of tomorrow, we think of many things.', 'One of them is the American home—in our cities, in our villages, on our farms. Millions of our people have never had homes worthy of American standards—well built homes, with electricity and plumbing, air and sunlight.', 'The demand for homes and our capacity to build them call for a program of well over a million homes a year for at least ten years. Private industry can build and finance the vast majority of these homes. Government can and will assist and encourage private industry to do this, as it has for many years. For those very low income groups that cannot possibly afford decent homes, the Federal Government should continue to assist local housing authorities in meeting that need.', 'In the future America that we are talking about, we think of new highways, new parkways. We think of thousands of new airports to service the new commercial and private air travel which is bound to come after the war. We think of new planes, large and small, new cheap automobiles with low maintenance and operation costs. We think of new hospitals and new health clinics. We think of a new merchant marine for our expanded world trade.', 'My friends, think of these vast possibilities for industrial expansion—and you will foresee opportunities for more millions of jobs.', 'And with all that, our Economic Bill of Rights—like the sacred Bill of Rights of our Constitution itself—must be applied to all our citizens, irrespective of race, or creed or color.', 'Three years ago, back in 1941, I appointed a Fair Employment Practice Committee to prevent discrimination in war industry and Government employment. The work of that Committee and the results obtained more than justify its creation.', 'I believe that the Congress of the United States should by law make the Committee permanent.', 'America must remain the land of high wages and efficient production. Every full-time job in America must provide enough for a decent living. And that goes for jobs in mines, offices, factories, stores, and canneries—everywhere where men and women are employed.', 'During the war we have been compelled to limit wage and salary increases for one great objective—to prevent runaway inflation. You all know how successfully we have held the line by the way your cost of living has been kept down for the necessities of life.', 'However, at the end of the war there will be more goods available, and it is only common sense to see to it that the working man is paid enough, and that the farmers earn enough, to buy these goods and keep our factories running. It is a simple fact, likewise, that a greatly increased production of food and fiber on the farms can be consumed by the people who work in industry only if those people who work in industry have enough money to buy food and clothing. If industrial wages go down, I can assure you that farm prices will go down too. After the war, we shall of course remove the control of wages and leave their determination to free collective bargaining between trade unions and employers.', 'And we of the cities, in this war, must remember that the American farmer has been called upon to do far and away the biggest food production job in all our history.', 'The American farmer has met that challenge triumphantly.', 'Despite all manner of wartime difficulties—shortage of farm labor and of new farm machinery- the American farmer has achieved a total of food production which is one of the great wonders of the world.', 'The American farmer is a great producer; and he must have the means also to be a great consumer. For more farm income means more jobs everywhere in the Nation.', 'Let us look back for a moment to 1932, a year of unhappy memories. All of us remember the spreading tide of farm foreclosures; we remember four-cent hogs, twenty-cent wheat, five-cent cotton.', 'I am going to give you, very simply, some figures of recovery —and I am sure you will pardon me if I quote them correctly. For as I remarked at Fort Wayne this afternoon, it is my habit to quote figures correctly, even when I was Governor of the State of New York, many years ago.', ""In those days of 1932, the American farmers' net income was only two and a quarter billion dollars."", 'In 1940 —a year before we were attacked- farm income in the United States was more than doubled. It was up to five and a half billion dollars.', 'And this year—in 1944—it will be approximately thirteen and one-half billion dollars.', 'I take it that the American farmer does not want to go back to a Government owned by the moguls of 1929—and let us bear it constantly in mind that those same moguls still control the destinies of the Republican Party.', ""We must continue this Administration's policy of conserving the enormous gifts with which an abundant Providence has blessed our country- our soil, our forests, and our water."", 'For example, the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority is closely related to our national farm policy—our farm program, and we look forward toward similar developments which I have recommended in other places—the valley of the Missouri, the valley of the Arkansas, and the Columbia River Basin out on the far coast.', 'And incidentally—and as an aside—I cannot resist the temptation to point to the gigantic contribution to our war effort made by the power generated at T.V.A. and Bonneville and Grand Coulee.', 'But, do you remember when the building of these great public works was ridiculed as New Deal ""boondoggling""? And we are planning—almost ready to put into effect—developments at Grand Coulee, which will provide irrigation for many tens of thousands of acres, providing fertile land for settlement—I hope—by many of our returning soldiers and sailors.', 'More ""boondoggling""', ""This Administration has put into the law of the land the farmers' long dream of parity prices."", 'We propose, too, that the Government will cooperate when the weather will not- by a genuine crop insurance program.', 'This Administration has adopted—and will continue—the policy of giving to as many farmers as possible the chance of owning their own farms.', 'That means something to those veterans who left their farms to fight for their country.', 'And after this war has ended, then will come the time when the returning servicemen can grow their own apples on their own farms instead of having to sell apples on the street corners.', 'I believe in free enterprise—and always have.', 'I believe in the profit system—and always have.', 'I believe that private enterprise can give full employment to our people.', 'If anyone feels that my faith in our ability to provide sixty million peacetime jobs is fantastic, let him remember that some people said the same thing about my demand in 1940 for fifty thousand airplanes.', 'I believe in exceptional rewards for innovation, skill, and risk-taking by business.', 'We shall lift production and price control as soon as they are no longer needed—encouraging private business to produce more of the things to which we are accustomed and also thousands of new things, in ever-increasing volume, under conditions of free and open competition.', 'This Administration has been mindful from its earliest days, and will continue to be mindful, of the problems of small business as well as large.', 'Small business played a magnificent part in producing thousands of items needed for our armed forces. When the war broke out it was mobilized into war production. Money was loaned to them for machinery. Over one million contracts and subcontracts have been distributed among sixty thousand of the smaller plants of our Nation.', 'We shall make sure that small business is given every facility to buy Government-owned plants, equipment, and inventories. The special credit and capital requirements of small business are going to be met.', 'And small business will continue to be protected from selfish, cold-blooded monopolies and cartels. Beware of that profound enemy of the free enterprise system who pays lip-service to free competition- but also labels every anti-trust prosecution as a ""persecution."" You know, it depends a good deal on whose baby has the measles.', 'This war has demonstrated that when the American businessman and the American worker and the American farmer work together, they form an unbeatable team.', 'We know that- you and I- our allies know that- and so do our enemies.', 'That winning team must keep together after the war, and it will win many more historic victories of peace for our country, for the cause of security, and for decent standards of living here and throughout the world.', 'We owe it to our fighting men, we owe it to their families we owe it to all of our people who have given so much in this war—we owe it to our children- to keep that winning team together.', 'The future of America, like its past, must be made by deeds—not words.', 'America has always been a land of action-a land of adventurous pioneering- a land of growing and building.', 'America must always be such a land.', 'The creed of our democracy is that liberty is acquired, liberty is kept by men and women who are strong, self-reliant, and possessed of such wisdom as God gives to mankind- men and women who are just, men and women who are understanding, and generous to others—men and women who are capable of disciplining themselves.', 'For they are the rulers, and they must rule themselves.', 'I believe in our democratic faith. I believe in the future of our country which has given eternal strength and vitality to that faith.', 'Here in Chicago you know a lot about that vitality.', 'And as I say good night to you, I say it in a spirit of faith—a spirit of hope—a spirit of confidence.', 'We are not going to turn the clock back!', 'We are going forward, my friends—forward with the fighting millions of our fellow countrymen.', 'We are going forward together.']"
6,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"October 29, 1944","['My friends:', 'This being Sunday, the Governor, cooperating with me in keeping politics out of it, says that he is not even going to introduce me.', 'I have been here before, and it is a great comfort to come on a Sunday in a campaign year, because on Sundays my life is made much more comfortable by not having to think about politics. Unfortunately, I do have to think about the war, because every day, including Sundays, dispatches come to me, on the train even, to tell me of the progress of our boys in Europe and in the Pacific and in the Philippines. I cannot get rid of that.', 'Coming up through the State today, I have been looking out of the window, and I think there is a subject that is a good subject for Sunday, because I remember the line in the poem, ""Only God can make a tree."" And one of the things that people have to realize all over the United States, and I think especially in West Virginia—I don\'t see the trees I ought to see. That is something that we in this country have fallen down on. We have been using up natural resources that we ought to have replaced. I know we can\'t replace coal- it will be a long time before all the coal is gone—but trees constitute something that we can replace.', 'We have to think not just of an annual crop, not just something that we can eat the next year. We have to think of a longer crop, something that takes years to grow, but which in the long run is going to do more good for our children and for our grandchildren than if we leave the hills bare.', ""I remember a story, and it is taken out of Germany. There was a town there- I don't know what has happened in the last twenty years—but this is back when I used to be in grade school in Germany—and I used to bicycle. And we came to a town, and outside of it there was a great forest. And the interesting thing to me, as a boy even, was that the people in that town didn't have to pay taxes. They were supported by their own forest."", 'Way back in the time of Louis something of France—the French king was approaching this town with a large army. And the prince of the time asked the townspeople to come out to defend their principality, and he promised them that if they would keep the invader out of the town, out of the principality, he would give them the forest.', ""The burghers turned out. They repulsed the French king. And very soon the prince made good. He gave the forest to the town. And for over two hundred years that town in Germany had to pay no taxes. Everybody made money, because they had no taxes. In other words, it was a forest on an annual-yield basis. They cut down perhaps seventy percent of what they could get out of that year's mature crop. And every year they planted new trees. And every year the proceeds from that forest paid the equivalent of taxes."", 'Now that is true more and more in this country. There are more and more municipalities that are reforesting their watersheds, putting trees on the top of their hills, preventing the erosion of soil. They are not on a self-sustaining basis because it has only been started within the last ten or fifteen years. And yet while only God can make a tree, we have to do a little bit to help ourselves.', ""I think that all of us sort of look at our lives in terms of ourselves, and yet your children, your grandchildren, your great-grandchildren, your great-great-grandchildren- some of them will be living right around here, right around where the population is today. Perhaps the old house- perhaps a better, new house. And more and more we are going to think about those grandchildren and great-grandchildren. It doesn't amount to very much, this cost of planting trees, and yet the hillsides of West Virginia of our grandparents' day were much more wonderful than they are now. It's largely a deforested State. And I believe that from the point of view of the beauties of nature, from the point of view of all that trees can be, and from the point of view of your own grandchildren's pocketbooks, the small number of cents, the small number of dollars that go into reforestation are going to come back a thousandfold."", ""Up where I live, in the country on the Hudson River, my family had—when I was a boy—five or six hundred acres. It wasn't valuable land. And my own father, in the old days, would go in every year and cut the family needs in the way of timber."", 'When I was a small boy, I realized that there was waste going on; and when I went to the State Senate as a young man, somebody appointed me to the Conservation Committee. Some parts of upstate New York were being eroded, a lot of topsoil was running away, we were getting more floods than we had ever had in the old days.', 'And just as an experiment, I started planting a few acres each year on run-down land. I tried to pasture some skinny cows on it. And at the same time, I went into the old woods and cleaned out no-account trees, trees that were under grown or would never amount to anything, crooked trees, rotten trees.', 'Well, the answer was this. When the last war came on, the old woods had some perfectly splendid trees, because I had cleaned them out, cleaned out the poor stuff.', ""And during that war, I made four thousand dollars, just by cutting out the mature trees. And I kept on every year. And in the winter time, when the men weren't doing much, they cleaned them out. And the trees grew."", ""And a quarter of a century later, there came this war. I think I cooperated with the Almighty, because I think trees were made to grow. Oh yes, they are useful as mine timbers. I know that. But there are a lot of places in this State where there isn't any mine timber being cut out."", ""And in this war, back home, I cut last year—and this is not very Christian- over four thousand dollars' worth net of oak trees, to make into submarine chasers and landing craft and other implements of war. And I am doing it again this year."", 'And I hope that this use of wood is growing, for all kinds of modern inventions, plastics, and so forth. I hope that when I am able to cut some more trees, twenty or twenty-five years from now—it may not be I, it may be one of the boys—we will be able to use them at a profit, not for building mine chasers or landing craft, but for turning them into some humane use.', 'And I believe that in this country—not in this State only, but in a great many more- we in the next few years, when peace comes, will be able to devote more thought to making our country more useful—every acre of it.', 'I remember eight years ago, out in the West, we knew that there were great floods and a dry belt in there. We knew, also, that trees bring water and avoid floods. And so we started one of those ""crackpot"" things, for which I have been criticized, a thing called the shelter belt, to keep the high winds away, to hold the moisture in the soil. And the result is that a great success has been made of that shelter belt. Not much ran downhill and the farmers are getting more crops and better crops out there on the prairies in the lea of these rows of trees.', 'Forestry pays from the practical point of view. I have proved that. And so I hope to live long enough to see West Virginia with more trees in it. I hope to live to see the day when this generation will be thinking not just of themselves but also of the children and the grandchildren.', ""I had a happy day this morning in looking out at this wonderful scenery, but I couldn't take my eyes off those bare hilltops. I couldn't take my thoughts off the fact that this generation, and especially the previous generation, have been thinking of themselves and not of the future."", 'Some day I hope to come back, and I hope to see a great forestry program for the whole of the State. Nearly all of it needs it. I hope to come back and be able to say, ""I stopped, once upon a time, in Clarksburg, on a Sunday morning, and just avoided politics and talked to the people in Clarksburg, and they must have heard me all over the State, because they started planting trees.""', 'And so I think my Sunday sermon is just about over. It has been good to see you, and I really do hope that I will come back here, one of these days soon.', 'Thanks.']"

It's just a visit from one neighbor to a lot of other neighbors, because, you know, from my place up on the Hudson River when I look east I can see into Connecticut, and it doesn't take me very much more than an hour to get down to Bridgeport from my house."", 'So let me just tell you as a neighbor that I am glad to be back.', 'This being war, though I am told not to mention that subject, I always remember back in 1917 or 1918 coming to Bridgeport when I was in the Navy Department, and seeing the building of ships, the manufacturing of munitions, guns, and bullets. And I remember very well the reputation that Bridgeport had in those days in the first war. And it has got the same reputation for a magnificent industrial effort and help to our troops in this war.', 'I hope that, while we are alive, Bridgeport will never be called On again to make munitions in a world war. And it is interesting, at this time, for the first time since the days of Lincoln, that we are conducting a war and carrying on a presidential election at the same time.', 'Some of us are trying to get excited about politics. Some of us become even rather agitated. You ought to know. Yes, there are a few politicians, even- men and women- who work themselves into such an emotional state that they say things I hope they will be sorry for before they die.', 'There isn\'t very much that I can say, except to talk about the record. You know that. A lot of people don\'t like me to talk about the record. They don\'t like to be reminded that people have been taken care of by the Congress through the passage of all kinds of social legislation. When I talk about those things again, some people say, ""Oh, why do they have to bring that subject up?""', ""I think we have made a pretty good record in running this war, and they don't like that talked about either. They like to talk about some kind of a wild, weird future. Well, believe me, you see it and then you don't see it. One candidate says one thing and in another place, simultaneously, another candidate says another thing. I get tremendously amused by some of this—not all of it—because I wish in a way I were back in 1910, when I was running for the State Senate in the State of New York, and I had a particularly disagreeable opponent, and he called me names. Well, I wasn't anything in those days- I wasn't President—and I answered him in kind. And the names that I called him were worse than the names that he called me. So we had a very joyous campaign."", ""In this campaign, of course, all things taken together, I can't talk about my opponent the way I would like to sometimes, because I try to think that I am a Christian. I try to think that some day I will go to Heaven, and I don't believe there is anything to be gained in saying dreadful things about other people in any campaign."", 'After next Tuesday there are going to be a lot of sorry people in the United States.', 'I want to say, looking into the future, that I hope some of my good friends who happen to be running for office—your candidate for Governor—your candidate for the Senate—both of them old friends of mine—will be elected; and I hope, too, that very soon after the first of January, Mrs. Roosevelt and I will have a call- in the White House—from the charming lady, Miss Connors [candidate for Congress against Clare Boothe Luce], on my right.', ""So it's good to see you all, and I'll be back some day, very soon I hope, as President."", 'Thanks.']"
8,Franklin D. Roosevelt ,"November 04, 1944","['I am glad to come back here. It\'s rather a happy surprise. Four years ago I was told terrible things were being circulated all over the country. People all over the United States were being told that if I got reelected, all of the Hartford insurance companies would go broke. So, coming in here, I expected to see vast, empty buildings not being used and employing no people. The insurance business was going to go flat. And yet they are still present. And, of course, the joke is that the insurance companies, not only of Hartford but of other places, are better off than they ever have been before. They are pretty good insurance companies, you know. They subscribe to the war loans. They have been patriotic. They just have only one unfortunate habit which they acquire every four years—in fact, the last few months of every four years. They say, ""If this man Roosevelt gets elected President, we will have to go out of business!"" So it is good to see them still going good to see that Hartford is not a city of empty homes.', ""But, you know, that was like a lot of other campaigns. Back in—what was it?— 1932, they said that grass was going to grow in the streets. But it didn't! And Mr. Hoover wasn't reelected President."", ""And then in 1936, some of the people all over the country-you know the kind I mean—tried to instill fear in the minds of the American people by saying that the social security funds of the United States were no good—they weren't safe. They even went to the extent of having some of their large financial backers put this type of scare material in the pay envelopes of millions of employees. And the interesting thing was that the employees didn't fall for it. They thought they knew better than the president of the company. And they took another chance with me."", 'Now, they will apparently never learn that this kind of campaign does not produce the results they look for. In fact, it usually produces the opposite result. It is going to do that again this year.', 'And they are making the fantastic claim this year that your Government is now engaged in some deep-dyed plot to take over the insurance business.', 'Well, it so happens that I have had some experience in the insurance business myself, and I know that the workers and managers in that business cannot be easily fooled by that type of propaganda.', 'Why, the insurance policies of the United States and your savings are safer than they ever were in the whole history of the United States—and so is the insurance business.', 'That was not true in 1933 when I took office. I don\'t have to recall to you the closing banks and the shaky insurance companies of those days. In fact, I think it is safe to say that a great many of the insurance companies in 1933, if they had tried to liquidate their assets for the benefit of policyholders, would have found themselves in the ""red."" They would not have had enough money. And the reason is obvious—because before 1933—a year before and the year before that—the value of the farms and mortgages and other properties on their books had depreciated so much that by March of 1933, they couldn\'t have been liquidated at anything like the figures at which they were carrying their assets on their own books. That\'s a pretty serious charge. But the record is there. Under the last Republican administration the insurance companies were ""bust.""', 'You know what happened in 1933. You know how quickly the action of this Administration resulted in increased earnings and savings and property values. And that is what this ""bungling, incompetent"" Administration has done for the people of the United States.', ""There is one thing that I have meant to say for the last two months, and haven't had a chance. It's a word about a group of our citizens that have been pretty hard hit by the war. They have not been able to earn the high level of wages that have been paid in shipyards and war factories—and yet, with amazing patience and fortitude they have continued in their essential jobs—carrying on as best they can. And those are the white-collar workers of America."", 'I think, however, that in addition to being thoroughly patriotic, staying at their work, they realize that this Administration has done a pretty good job in keeping down the cost of living-in protecting the purchasing power of their dollars in terms of rent and other necessities of life. Compared with the skyrocketing cost of living in the last war— twice as much of a rise as in this war- our record in this war, on the whole, has been very good. And I want you—as they used to say—t¢ give a hand to the white-collar workers of the United States.', ""Because during the war, for the first time in history, we have avoided wartime inflation. Inflation means nothing more than a rise in the cost of things, and the white-collar workers' wages haven't gone up anything like what the wages have gone up in other professions or trades."", 'The lesson of the last war was clear to us—nearly all of us—in the Administration, but to many Republicans it was not plain at all.', 'Time and again the Republicans in the Congress voted overwhelmingly against price control, and in favor of letting prices go skyrocketing.', 'So I make an assertion. The Democratic Party in this war has been the party of sound money. The Republican Party has been the party of unsound money.', 'If the Republicans had had their way, all of us—farmers, white-collar workers, factory workers, housewives—we would all have had our dollars cut by inflation and a higher cost of living.', 'I hope to come back here very often either as a private citizen, or as President of the United States. But I am very confident today that when I come back during the next four years it will be as President of the United States.', 'And in saying goodbye to you, after this very pleasing visit, I assure you that when I do come back, I will still be able to wear the same size hat.']"

I take it as a matter of wisdom that we should not dismantle the Springfield arsenals. This time we are not going to scuttle our strength.', 'Four years ago many of us knew that this war might come. We sought to prepare America for it, often in the face of mocking gibes from those who said that we had nothing to fear from Germany or Japan.', 'We went about the work of building the national defenses and of setting up a system of selective service. We had the stern resolve—that I expressed many times four years ago- that we meant this for defense and not for offense—and that we would not send our boys to fight abroad unless we were attacked.', 'The attack came—treacherous, deadly attack.', 'Our pledge was kept. We fought back when we were attacked—obviously, rightly.', 'We fought back—as our forefathers had fought. We took the offensive—and we held it. The kind of America we inherited from our fathers is the kind of America we want to pass on to our children—but, an America more prosperous, more secure -free from want and free from fear.', 'It was to save that America that we joined in a common war against economic breakdown and depression- and we won that war.', 'It was to save that America that we joined in a common war against the Fascist ruthlessness and brutality of Germany and Japan.

I told them in Newburgh that I was very glad that the legislature had taken my Congressman away from me, and that Hamilton Fish won't be my Congressman after the first of January."", 'You know, I go back into the history of this city quite a long way, because I had an ancestor who came up from New York to a place called Esopus about 1660, which is quite a way back. And he came up here just in time to take a musket and help to repel Indians who tried to kill all the original settlers. He was a member of what they called the militia in those days.', 'And that, perhaps, is why I inherited a good deal of love for the armed forces of the United States, who have been carrying on this war so magnificently.', 'The war is not in Kingston and Hyde Park physically. It is across the oceans. But it means the preservation of our homes in Hyde Park and in Kingston. The people are beginning to realize more and more that we are fighting for the defense of America. I think we are doing a pretty good job of it.', 'It takes me longer to go from Hyde Park to Kingston because you have taken off the ferry. I was complaining to the Mayor about it, and I think probably the only other thing to do is to build a bridge.', 'Well, it has been good to see you on this occasion.

And I hope that in the next four years when I come back for an occasional weekend at home from Washington I will be able to come over here and see you all.', 'In the meantime, I have heard of the great things you are doing in the war.

I have seen more children than I knew existed in these three counties. They are coming along in good· shape, and it encourages me greatly to think that the future of the country will be relatively safe in their hands, under a Constitution which has lasted more than 150 years—and I think as long as we increase as we are doing now- we shall still be living under the same old Constitution 155 years from now.', ""Down in Newburgh I went through a shipyard, having a few moments to spare, and then in the upper part of the city there was a crowd that was at least twice or three times the size it was four years ago. And that was encouraging. And I told them there that I did want to say a good word for our legislature because as you know, the duty of apportioning the Congressional Districts of this State is the duty of the legislature. And a curious thing happened recently. Our county used to be in the same District with Putnam and Orange counties. And quite a number of people were irked that the legislature changed it a bit. And then I think a Congressman was taken out of the District, insofar as Dutchess County goes. So, after the first of January we will be in a new Congressional District- we won't be with Orange any more, and therefore we will have a new Congressman."", 'Well, my friends, there is more than one way of getting rid of a Congressman.', ""Then I went up to Kingston, and there again the crowd was at least twice the size it had been before, and I remarked to them-you can see I am pure Hudson River when you come down to it—that my mother's family came from Newburgh- but up in Kingston—well, there was an old boy in 1660 who went up there from New York City. He was young, and I guess he was rather Dutch- with the old stubborn qualities. About that time the Indians attacked Kingston, and he became a member of the militia that rolled the Indians back."", 'And I think that it is for that reason, perhaps, that I am interested and have been all my life—though not in uniform—in military and naval affairs. It comes from the old Dutch boy in 1660 who belonged to the militia.', 'But one sad thing happened. I had to come all the way back down the west side of the river. They had taken off the Kingston ferry! Otherwise, the District and the county had changed very little in the last four years.', ""We were headed at that time- four years ago- into a war. We didn't talk about it very much. It doesn't do to scare people or alarm people. But we did a good deal of building and preparation, and by 1941 we had over two million men in the Army and Navy. We built up our munitions factories. We sent a great deal of aid to the people who were fighting Nazism and Fascism. And the result was that we were better prepared for this war than we had been in all our history for any war. We haven't been bombed in this country—rap on wood—and we haven't lost anything within our own boundaries during this war."", 'And now we are carrying on the offensive against the enemy, in order to make it quite certain that our own homes back here shall be safe.', ""I don't know—I think we have done a fair job of it, but anyway we have done it in the American way, with the approval of the American people, and that is something—to go on with our same ideals, our same form of government- as we have always done."", 'And I hope tomorrow that it is going to be said in this country that the war has been conducted constitutionally, and with the approval of the people of the United States. I hope that will be said. I think it will.', 'And so it has been good—it has been a good day. I have seen my near neighbors. I have seen the neighbors across the river and down the county—the southern end. I have seen an awful lot of people. It has been a good day, and I want to thank you for coming out tonight at this late hour, because it has given me a chance to see some of my nearer neighbors.', 'It is good to see you, and I am going to come back pretty often.']"
