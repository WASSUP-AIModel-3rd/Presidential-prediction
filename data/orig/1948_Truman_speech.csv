0,Harry S Truman ,"July 15, 1948","['I am sorry that the microphones are in the way, but I must leave them the way they are because I have got to be able to see what I am doing--as I am always able to see what I am doing.', ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate the honor which you have just conferred upon me. I shall continue to try to deserve it."", 'I accept the nomination.', ""And I want to thank this convention for its unanimous nomination of my good friend and colleague, Senator Barkley of Kentucky. He is a great man, and a great public servant. Senator Barkley and I will win this election and make these Republicans like it--don't you forget that!"", 'We will do that because they are wrong and we are right, and I will prove it to you in just a few minutes.', 'This convention met to express the will and reaffirm the beliefs of the Democratic Party. There have been differences of opinion, and that is the democratic way. Those differences have been settled by a majority vote, as they should be.', 'Now it is time for us to get together and beat the common enemy. And that is up to you.', 'We have been working together for victory in a great cause. Victory has become a habit of our party. It has been elected four times in succession, and I am convinced it will be elected a fifth time next November.', ""The reason is that the people know that the Democratic Party is the people's party, and the Republican Party is the party of special interest, and it always has been and always will be."", ""The record of the Democratic Party is written in the accomplishments of the last 16 years. I don't need to repeat them. They have been very ably placed before this convention by the keynote speaker, the candidate for Vice President, and by the permanent chairman."", ""Confidence and security have been brought to the people by the Democratic Party. Farm income has increased from less than $2 Â¼ billion in 1932 to more than $18 billion in 1947. Never in the world were the farmers of any republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the farmers of the United States; and if they don't do their duty by the Democratic Party, they are the most ungrateful people in the world!"", ""Wages and salaries in this country have increased from 29 billion in 1933 to more than $128 billion in 1947. That's labor, and labor never had but one friend in politics, and that is the Democratic Party and Franklin D. Roosevelt."", 'And I say to labor what I have said to the farmers: they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year.', 'The total national income has increased from less than $40 billion in 1933 to $203 billion in 1947, the greatest in all the history of the world. These benefits have been spread to all the people, because it is the business of the Democratic Party to see that the people get a fair share of these things.', 'This last, worst 80th Congress proved just the opposite for the Republicans.', 'The record on foreign policy of the Democratic Party is that the United States has been turned away permanently from isolationism, and we have converted the greatest and best of the Republicans to our viewpoint on that subject.', 'The United States has to accept its full responsibility for leadership in international affairs. We have been the backers and the people who organized and started the United Nations, first started under that great Democratic President, Woodrow Wilson, as the League of Nations. The League was sabotaged by the Republicans in 1920. And we must see that the United Nations continues a strong and growing body, so we can have everlasting peace in the world.', 'We removed trade barriers in the world, which is the best asset we can have for peace. Those trade barriers must not be put back into operation again.', ""We have started the foreign aid program, which means the recovery of Europe and China, and the Far East. We instituted the program for Greece and Turkey, and I will say to you that all these things were done in a cooperative and bipartisan manner. The Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House were taken into the full confidence of the President in every one of these moves, and don't let anybody tell you anything else."", ""As I have said time and time again, foreign policy should be the policy of the whole Nation and not the policy of one party or the other. Partisanship should stop at the water's edge; and I shall continue to preach that through this whole campaign."", 'I would like to say a word or two now on what I think the Republican philosophy is; and I will speak from actions and from history and from experience.', 'The situation in 1932 was due to the policies of the Republican Party control of the Government of the United States. The Republican Party, as I said a while ago, favors the privileged few and not the common everyday man. Ever since its inception, that party has been under the control of special privilege; and they have completely proved it in the 80th Congress. They proved it by the things they did to the people, and not for them. They proved it by the things they failed to do.', ""Now, let's look at some of them--just a few."", ""Time and time again I recommended extension of price control before it expired June 30, 1946. I asked for that extension in September 1945, in November 1945, in a Message on the State of the Union in 1946; and that price control legislation did not come to my desk until June 30, 1946, on the day on which it was supposed to expire. And it was such a rotten bill that I couldn't sign it. And 30 days after that, they sent me one just as bad. I had to sign it, because they quit and went home."", 'They said, when OPA died, that prices would adjust themselves for the benefit of the country. They have been adjusting themselves all right! They have gone all the way off the chart in adjusting themselves, at the expense of the consumer and for the benefit of the people that hold the goods.', 'I called a special session of the Congress in November 1947--November 17, 1947--and I set out a 10-point program for the welfare and benefit of this country, among other things standby controls. I got nothing. Congress has still done nothing.', 'Way back 4 1/2 years ago, while I was in the Senate, we passed a housing bill in the Senate known as the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. It was a bill to clear the slums in the big cities and to help to erect low-rent housing. That bill, as I said, passed the Senate 4 years ago. It died in the House. That bill was reintroduced in the 80th Congress as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. The name was slightly changed, but it is practically the same bill. And it passed the Senate, but it was allowed to die in the House of Representatives; and they sat on that bill, and finally forced it out of the Banking and Currency Committee, and the Rules Committee took charge, and it still is in the Rules Committee.', ""But desperate pleas from Philadelphia in that convention that met here 3 weeks ago couldn't get that housing bill passed. They passed a bill they called a housing bill, which isn't worth the paper it's written on."", 'In the field of labor we needed moderate legislation to promote labor-management harmony, but Congress passed instead that so-called Taft-Hartley Act, which has disrupted labor-management relations and will cause strife and bitterness for years to come if it is not repealed, as the Democratic platform says it ought to be repealed.', 'On the Labor Department, the Republican platform of 1944 said, if they were in power, that they would build up a strong Labor Department. They have simply torn it up. Only one bureau is left that is functioning, and they cut the appropriation of that so it can hardly function.', 'I recommended an increase in the minimum wage. What did I get? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.', ""I suggested that the schools in this country are crowded, teachers underpaid, and that there is a shortage of teachers. One of our greatest national needs is more and better schools. I urged the Congress to provide $300 million to aid the States in the present educational crisis. Congress did nothing about it. Time and again I have recommended improvements in the social security law, including extending protection to those not now covered, and increasing the amount of benefits, to reduce the eligibility age of women from 65 to 60 years. Congress studied the matter for 2 years, but couldn't find the time to extend or increase the benefits. But they did find time to take social security benefits away from 750,000 people, and they passed that over my veto."", 'I have repeatedly asked the Congress to pass a health program. The Nation suffers from lack of medical care. That situation can be remedied any time the Congress wants to act upon it.', ""Everybody knows that I recommended to the Congress the civil rights program. I did that because I believed it to be my duty under the Constitution. Some of the members of my own party disagree with me violently on this matter. But they stand up and do it openly! People can tell where they stand. But the Republicans all professed to be for these measures. But Congress failed to act. They had enough men to do it, they could have had cloture, they didn't have to have a filibuster. They had enough people in that Congress that would vote for cloture."", ""Now everybody likes to have low taxes, but we must reduce the national debt in times of prosperity. And when tax relief can be given, it ought to go to those who need it most, and not those who need it least, as this Republican rich man's tax bill did when they passed it over my veto on the third try."", ""The first one of these was so rotten that they couldn't even stomach it themselves. They finally did send one that was somewhat improved, but it still helps the rich and sticks a knife into the back of the poor."", 'Now the Republicans came here a few weeks ago, and they wrote a platform. I hope you have all read that platform. They adopted the platform, and that platform had a lot of promises and statements of what the Republican Party is for, and what they would do if they were in power. They promised to do in that platform a lot of things I have been asking them to do that they have refused to do when they had the power.', 'The Republican platform cries about cruelly high prices. I have been trying to get them to do something about high prices ever since they met the first time.', 'Now listen! This is equally as bad, and as cynical. The Republican platform comes out for slum clearance and low-rental housing. I have been trying to get them to pass that housing bill ever since they met the first time, and it is still resting in the Rules Committee, that bill.', 'The Republican platform favors educational opportunity and promotion of education. I have been trying to get Congress to do something about that ever since they came there, and that bill is at rest in the House of Representatives.', 'The Republican platform is for extending and increasing social security benefits. Think of that! Increasing social security benefits! Yet when they had the opportunity, they took 750,000 off the social security rolls !', 'I wonder if they think they can fool the people of the United States with such poppycock as that!', ""There is a long list of these promises in that Republican platform. If it weren't so late, I would tell you all about them. I have discussed a number of these failures of the Republican 80th Congress. Every one of them is important. Two of them are of major concern to nearly every American family. They failed to do anything about high prices, they failed to do anything about housing."", 'My duty as President requires that I use every means within my power to get the laws the people need on matters of such importance and urgency.', 'I am therefore calling this Congress back into session July 26th.', 'On the 26th day of July, which out in Missouri we call ""Turnip Day,"" I am going to call Congress back and ask them to pass laws to halt rising prices, to meet the housing crisis--which they are saying they are for in their platform.', 'At the same time I shall ask them to act upon other vitally needed measures such as aid to education, which they say they are for; a national health program; civil rights legislation, which they say they are for; an increase in the minimum wage, which I doubt very much they are for; extension of the social security coverage and increased benefits, which they say they are for; funds for projects needed in our program to provide public power and cheap electricity. By indirection, this 80th Congress has tried to sabotage the power policies the United States has pursued for 14 years. That power lobby is as bad as the real estate lobby, which is sitting on the housing bill.', 'I shall ask for adequate and decent laws for displaced persons in place of this anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic law which this 80th Congress passed.', 'Now, my friends, if there is any reality behind that Republican platform, we ought to get some action from a short session of the 80th Congress. They can do this job in 15 days, if they want to do it. They will still have time to go out and run for office.', 'They are going to try to dodge their responsibility. They are going to drag all the red herrings they can across this campaign, but I am here to say that Senator Barkley and I are not going to let them get away with it.', 'Now, what that worst 80th Congress does in this special session will be the test. The American people will not decide by listening to mere words, or by reading a mere platform. They will decide on the record, the record as it has been written. And in the record is the stark truth, that the battle lines of 1948 are the same as they were in 1932, when the Nation lay prostrate and helpless as a result of Republican misrule and inaction.', 'In 1932 we were attacking the citadel of special privilege and greed. We were fighting to drive the money changers from the temple. Today, in 1948, we are now the defenders of the stronghold of democracy and of equal opportunity, the haven of the ordinary people of this land and not of the favored classes or the powerful few. The battle cry is just the same now as it was in 1932, and I paraphrase the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt as he issued the challenge, in accepting nomination in Chicago: ""This is more than a political call to arms. Give me your help, not to win votes alone, but to win in this new crusade to keep America secure and safe for its own people.""', 'Now my friends, with the help of God and the wholehearted push which you can put behind this campaign, we can save this country from a continuation of the 80th Congress, and from misrule from now on.', ""I must have your help. You must get in and push, and win this election. The country can't afford another Republican Congress.""]"
1,Harry S Truman ,"September 06, 1948","['[1.] GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN (Rally, 9:10 a.m., E.D.T..)', ""My, what a wonderful crowd at 8:15 in the morning. I wonder what it would have been at 8:15 in the evening! I don't see how it could have been any greater. I am looking at three solid blocks of people spread out in three different directions from this square. It is remarkable. I never thought you could do it. It just goes to show that you are interested in the welfare of this great Nation, and that you want to hear some of the facts in connection with the coming campaign."", 'It is a great day for me. It is a great day for you. I am just starting on a campaign tour that is going to be a record for the President of the United States, and when I get through you are going to know the facts.', ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this welcome. It is a wonderful thing. It warms your heart--makes you feel like going out and making a fight for the people, when they turn out to see you like this."", 'I appreciate very much that key to the city which Acting Mayor Davis has given me, and I shall treasure it along with several more that I have. I appreciate it just as highly as I do the others. In fact, I have two keys to the city of Grand Rapids and that is a wonderful thing. That is the only city I have ever been in where I got two keys.', ""Your Mayor Welsh wrote to me that he was sorry he couldn't be present as he had to go abroad. He has been in to see me on several occasions with the mayors organization in the country and I have had some very pleasant talks with him."", ""This also is the hometown of my good friend and former colleague when I was in the Senate, Senator Arthur Vandenberg. The Senator and I have spent 10 years in the Senate. While we didn't always agree on domestic problems, I will say this to you, that Senator Arthur Vandenberg is intellectually honest and I like him."", ""I understand that there are three Congressional Medal of Honor men on this platform with me this morning. You know, that is a wonderful thing. That is a real record for one city, to have three Congressional Medal of Honor men. It was my privilege to hand the medals to these young men. They made wonderful records. If you haven't read those citations, I hope everyone of you will make it a point to read the citations which accompany these medals for these young men."", ""You know, that is the greatest honor that can come to any man. I have said it time and again, and I don't mind repeating it, that I would rather have that Congressional Medal of Honor than to be President of the United States. And I mean every word of it, and I know what I am talking about."", 'When the war ended there were some 12,500,000 young men and young women in the Armed Forces of the United States, and they were a cross section of the country, just as these three young men are a cross section of the country. I am not alarmed about the future of the United States as long as we have young men and young women like that.', 'Now these young men, and all those who were under arms when the war ended, were fighting for a principle. They were fighting for peace in the world, and they were fighting for the freedom of the individual.', 'We are still making that fight, and we are still making a fight for an honorable peace, and a just peace in the world. And I am here to tell you we are going to get it before we get through.', 'The working people of this country have demonstrated time and again that they are devoted to freedom and to world peace. They had an essential part in winning this war. Organized labor has been a leading force in international cooperation. Working people are also interested in building a better United States of America.', 'For the most part, workers have the same kind of problems that everybody else has-high prices, housing, schools for their children. In recent years, labor has become strong enough to have real influence. This is a development that I am very happy to see. Some people are not.', 'In November you will have a chance to use your influence in a manner that will be the determination of your destiny for years to come.', ""Now the necessity that faces us is one of voting on November 2d. You must register, you must vote, if you expect to get a square deal in this great Nation. Doesn't do any good to talk about voting, if you are not on the books. Doesn't do any good to talk about voting, if you sit around on election day, too lazy to turn out. The interests of this great Nation are such that every man and woman of voting age in this country ought to turn out and vote on November 2d."", 'If you will do that, I am perfectly willing to abide by these results, because I know it will be right.', 'You just have two parties to choose from in this election: the Democratic Party which stands for the peace and the welfare of the people and the little man, and the Republican Party which stands for special interests.', 'The record proves conclusively that the Republican Party is controlled by special privilege; and that the Democratic Party is responsive to the needs of the people.', 'Let us look at some of the instances of how that works and what it means to you. One of the things that worries you is high prices. During the war we were able to control prices, keep them at a fairly reasonable level. We could help rising prices now. It would be just as easy as it was to do it during the war. But the Republican Both Congress would not pass a price control law, although I recommended that they do that time and time again. As a result many of you and millions of other Americans are not able to buy the things you need, because prices are far higher than you can afford.', 'Another thing that troubles you in Grand Rapids is the housing shortage, and the shortage of school facilities. School facilities are short all over the Nation. Not only are we short in facilities, we are short in teachers and people to guide the young people through the lower grades in the schools. I tried every way within my power to get the Congress to do something about that. The Senate passed the bill. Most of the Democrats in the Senate voted for that bill, and some of the Republicans did. In the House that bill died along with the housing bill. I am told that within sound of my voice there are 62 veterans and their families with small children living in what was formerly a furniture factory, here in the heart of this city, subject to all the noise and confusion that goes on in a busy city.', ""There are other veterans in this community who are housed in temporary buildings with no early prospects of anything better. I have been doing everything within my power to get that Republican Both Congress to pass a housing bill to help meet the housing shortage. But the real estate lobby did not want low-rent housing, and did not want slums replaced by decent housing. That real estate lobby is one of the most powerful lobbies that ever came to Washington, and along later in this campaign I am going to tell you about a lot of other lobbies that came to Washington and got just what they wanted out of that 80th Congress--and the people didn't get a thing!"", ""The housing bill passed the Senate in the 80th Congress and was voted out of the House committee by 11 Democrats and 3 Republicans against 13 Republicans on the other side. But the Republican leadership wouldn't even let the full membership of the House vote on that bill."", 'Finally the special session of Congress in July--after I had made things so hot for them; it looked for a while like we might get some action on that bill--still managed to kill it in the Rules Committee of the House. In fact, Senator Taft ran out on his own bill. You know, the bill in the first instance was called the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. That is the bill that passed the Senate and died in the House. Along came the 80th Congress in 1947 and it passed the bill again. This time it was called the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill--a slight change. But when it was time for that bill to be pushed through the House, the Republicans voted against it, and Senator Taft ran out on his own bill. I am sorry to say that.', 'The veteran who needs a home is not greatly interested in the quarrel between the Congress and the President. What he wants to know is if he is going to have a place to live. The record shows that the Democrats want to use the full power of Congress to help provide homes. The Republicans do not want to do that.', 'Now you make your choice. You are going to have a chance in November.', 'There are many other ways in which the Republicans have proved that they serve special privilege and the privileged few at the expense of the people. I am going to talk about them a lot in this campaign, and I hope you will learn all about them. The fact that we have had a Republican Congress for 2 years has at least given you a chance to see what they are like and what they will do.', ""I call it the worst Congress, except one, this country has ever had. Because I was in the White House, however, they didn't get to walk backwards quite as fast as they wanted to. They have interrupted the progress which we have made, though, since 1932. If you want to resume the progress to go on as we have been going on, under this administration that believes in the welfare of the whole people and not just in the welfare of the real estate lobbies and a few other great lobbies, you will send the Democrats back to power on November 2, 1948."", 'Thank you very much.', '[2.] LANSING, MICHIGAN (Rear platform, 11:05 a.m.)', 'Governor Sigler, the citizens of Michigan, fellow Democrats:', 'It is a very, very great pleasure to me to see this turnout in Lansing at this time of day. I appreciate it most highly. I want to thank the Governor most cordially for his kind welcome to me. I appreciate it most highly. I have had the Governor at the White House, and I know he will be there several times again before I leave there.', 'We have had a wonderful day today. I opened the proceedings at Grand Rapids at 8:15 in the morning and it looked to me as if everybody in western Michigan was there. I think everyone in central Michigan is here.', 'You know we are facing a very important situation. We are celebrating Labor Day today, and it is going to be my privilege to address the combined labor organizations in Detroit at 12:30 this afternoon, a most momentous occasion.', 'I am starting out on a campaign for the Democratic election on November 2d, and I want you to bear in mind that the issues are very plainly drawn.', 'It is the people against the special interests--the people against the special interests. Bear that in mind. The people are made up mostly of those who work with their hands.', 'When the 80th Congress assembled in January 1947, I asked them to give me the opportunity to control prices. We had successfully controlled prices during the war and we could have successfully controlled prices during the peace, or the coming of the peace--awaiting the coming of the peace. And that peace is coming. All of you want it, and so do I.', 'I asked that 80th Congress to pass housing legislation, housing legislation which had been pending for 4 years. The bill known as the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill had passed the Senate more than 4 years ago. I was in the Senate at that time and voted for that bill. It died in the House. In 1947 they introduced another bill called the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill--a slight change you will notice. That bill passed the Senate and it slumbered in the House Banking and Currency Committee until 3 Republicans joined 11 Democrats and outvoted 13 Republicans and voted that bill out. Then it went to the Rules Committee, and the Rules Committee sat on the bill. The House of Representatives never did get a chance to vote on it because the real estate lobby did not want them to vote on it.', 'Now we have got a situation, I am told, right here in Lansing, that is most horrible so far as veterans are concerned. I understand in your State College out here the veterans are sleeping three deep in a gymnasium, and that there was a time when your Republican City Council here in Lansing could have helped remedy that situation. They decided not to do it.', 'They are running true to form, my friends. They are running true to form.', 'We could have passed that Taft-Ellender. Wagner bill at this session of Congress if Mr. Taft himself had not run out on his own bill. He decided that the real estate lobby should be kowtowed to. That is one of the most powerful lobbies that has ever been in Washington.', ""Before this campaign is over I am going to tell you about a lot more lobbies, the lobby that got the rich man's tax bill through and several others I will talk to you about. You will find before I get through the day, just why the rich man's tax bill was passed. It was not passed for the benefit of the common, everyday man. It was passed for the special interests. I will tell you all about it before the day is over, but I don't want to make all of my speeches in one place."", ""I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this hearty welcome, and for this wonderful turnout. I want to say to you again that I do appreciate most highly the courtesies of your Governor to the President of the United States. I appreciate the courtesies of all the Michiganders. They have been exceedingly kind to me in times past. I was here when I was running for Vice President of the United States in 1944. I did not stop at Lansing, but I was a speaker on the Labor Day program in 1944, and they estimated that there were 130,000 people out in Cadillac Square that day. I am told that if the sky doesn't leak this morning, there will be 300,000 here today."", ""One thing I want you to remember is that November 2d is election day. And it doesn't do any good to vote if you are not registered on the books. I want to see every man who labors get his friends out and get them on the books and when election day comes, go and vote. Don't sit at home-don't sit at home. If you really have the welfare of this country at heart, and want to prevent the country from being turned over to special privilege, you must vote on November 2d. That is the most important thing with which you are faced now. That is the most important thing that this country is faced with, to see that everybody in this country expresses his sentiments."", 'When they do that, I shall be perfectly satisfied with the result. I know what that result will be.', 'I want to thank you again for all the courtesies you have extended to me. I appreciate this welcome.', 'Thank you very much.', '[3.] DETROIT, MICHIGAN (Address in Cadillac Square at 1:40 p.m., see Item 184)', '[4.] HAMTRACK, MICHIGAN (2:45 p.m.)', 'Mr. Mayor, citizens of Hamtramck:', 'It certainly is a pleasure and a surprise to me to come out here today. I didn\'t know this was on the route. I am glad it was. The Mayor tells me that this is the greatest Democratic city in the world. Now he said ""the U.S."" when he introduced me. He took in a little more territory when he was talking to me. I understand that you are 97 percent Democratic. Now I wonder what\'s the matter with that other 3 percent ? See what you can do about that in November.', ""Today I initiated the campaign for reelection, in Grand Rapids, in Lansing, in Detroit, here, and I shall go to Pontiac and Flint, and by that time I think the Republicans will understand that I don't believe they have done much for labor."", 'As you know, back in the fall of 1946 they put out a slogan that they needed a change.', 'Well, on January 1st you got your change. As I told the people downtown, they gave themselves a tax cut, and they cut your freedom.', ""Now, if you return them again this fall, you will get just what is coming to you, and I don't think you are going to return them. I don't see how you can."", 'I want to thank you very much for this pleasure, for the honor that you have paid me here today on such short notice. And I want you to see what you can do about that other 3 percent this fall.', 'Thank you very much.', '[5.] PONTIAC, MICHIGAN (Oakland Park, 4 p.m.)', 'Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:', ""I am happy to join you in celebrating labor's holiday and I want to say that I am highly complimented and very much pleased that your broadcasting company was willing to interrupt the ball game to broadcast what I am going to say here this afternoon. It is very kind of them. I know there are plenty of people who would much rather hear the ball game than hear me."", ""As I have visited the great Labor Day celebration, I thought of the gains that labor has made in this country in recent years. You know it made tremendous gains from 1932 until 1947. Labor's gains have strengthened our democracy and increased the prosperity of the whole Nation. Whenever labor does well, of course the whole country does well. There never was a time in the history of the country when everybody and every segment of the population has been more prosperous, and that is because everybody is receiving his fair share of the national income. And that is the way it ought to be. It is possible to say that the gains are protected. We have only to look back to 1932 and realize how much things have improved for the wage earner."", 'In 1932 we were in the worst depression in history. Labor was bearing the brunt of it, as it does in every depression. During the last 16 years the Democratic administration managed to bring about a great improvement. People can get jobs now at decent wages, and there are more jobs than there are people to take them, for the first time that I can ever remember--and I am 64 years old.', ""As labor has prospered under Democratic administration the rest of the country has prospered at that same time. Farm incomes have increased. Farmers are making more money than they ever did in the history of the world. American farmers are in better condition than they have ever been in history. Business profits have increased tremendously. Corporation profits in 1947 were the greatest in the history of the country, after taxes. Our whole economy is busy turning out things which we need. All this didn't come about by accident. The Democratic Government took positive action instead of waiting for prosperity to come around the corner. You know the laws that were passed. This is the time when you ought to think carefully of how much they have meant to you and to all of us."", 'Let me remind you of just a few of them. The Wagner Act, which gave national protection to collective bargaining.', ""The Home Owners' Loan Act which saved millions of homes from foreclosure."", 'The Federal Deposit Insurance Act to protect banking deposits. There has not been a single loss to a depositor in a bank in 3 years. That is the greatest record in the history of the country.', 'The Fair Labor Standards Act which established a minimum wage and prohibited child labor.', 'Social security laws which provided protection for those who needed it most.', ""The list is longer than that, but I haven't got time to go over that whole list here this afternoon.

It is not only serious. It is inexcusable. They failed to act on bills to control prices, to provide adequate housing, aid to education, and to increase social security benefits.

Congress not only failed to pass a law to control prices, they actually passed laws that made prices go higher. They passed that so-called tax reduction bill.

But another blow to the heart of labor came in 1921 when the Republican depression put nearly 6 million workers out of employment. The strength of labor organizations dropped off and vicious campaigns of anti-labor propaganda swept the country. It was an era of the open shop and the yellow-dog contract.', 'A few years passed, and you all remember came the Republican panic of 1930 and the great depression, which dealt the workers of the country a terrible blow. There was no unemployment compensation under the Republicans. There was no floor under wages under the Republicans. Average hourly earnings in 1932 were only 45 cents under the Republicans. From 12 to 15 million workers were out of work and unemployed under the Republicans.', 'And then in 1933 came the administration of Franklin D.

I came to know and respect the minds and spirit of workers and union leaders. I saw them and talked to them, and visited their homes in scores of communities. I watched them at work in hundreds of plants.', 'I know that labor is just as willing as any other group in the country to cooperate with intelligent programs in the interest of the Nation as a whole.', 'I am one of those who believes in the fundamental good sense and good feeling of the American people. It is my conviction that Republican reaction will be rejected. The American public wants a Congress and an administration that will play fair with labor. The people will support a program under which labor makes gains consistent with the progress of our total economy.', 'I said a moment ago that the public is full of good feeling and good sense. That is certainly true of the great majority.', 'Nevertheless, I must point out that there are too many short-sighted and unthinking Americans who have adopted a ""damn labor"" attitude which doesn\'t become any citizen of this country.', 'It is time that every American recognize what our fathers knew--that it is an honorable thing to work with your hands.', 'Our basic social freedoms can be traced largely to the fact that labor had its birth of real freedom in the United States of America. That is why our fathers came to America-to find the country where the man who worked with his hands is as good as the next man.', 'Today, too many Americans in dining cars, in country clubs, and fashionable resorts are repeating, like parrots, the phrase ""labor must be kept in its place."" It is time that all Americans realized that the place of labor is side by side with the businessman and with the farmer, and not one degree lower.', 'One of the aspects of this Taft-Hartley agitation that has been most shocking to me has been the Republican attitude as expressed in the pious speeches of some of their leaders in Government and in business. They seem to think that labor is some kind of a spoiled child that needs to be spanked. They lift their eyes sympathetically and say ""it hurts me more than it hurts you."" It does not hurt them one bit, but it certainly does hurt you.', 'In practical terms, it means that labor needs to unite in common causes. They must unite, and it will be a great day for labor and a great day for the country when that happens.', 'All of labor stands at the crossroads today. You can elect a reactionary administration. You can elect a Congress and an administration which stands ready to play fair with every element in American life and enter a new period of hope. The choice is yours.', 'Do you want to carry the Taft-Hartley law to its full implication and enslave totally the workingman, white-collar and union man alike, or do you want to go forward with an administration whose interest is the welfare of the common man?', ""Labor has always had to fight for its gains. Now you are fighting for the whole future of the labor movement. We are in a hard, tough fight against shrewd and rich opponents. They know they can't count on your vote. Their only hope is that you won't vote at all. They have misjudged you. I know that we are going to win this crusade for the right!""]"

We have the most powerful country in the world. Let's live up to our ideals and keep working for that peace which all of us want so badly.

This is the first opportunity I have had to speak since I received the official confirmation of the tragic death of Count Bernadotte, the Mediator of the United Nations in Palestine. I am saddened and shocked. His death emphasizes again the difficulties in our efforts to secure liberties under law to all the peoples in the world.

Tonight in Crestline we take courage for our continuing efforts to reach such liberties everywhere."", 'My faith remains unshaken that we shall achieve a peaceful settlement of the problems in the Middle East.

Most of us are not appreciative of the Government under which we live until a tragedy such as that which took place today brings it home to us that what we have is liberty of the individual. We have a peaceful country in which to live. We have rights, which protect us from the infringement of the Government on those rights. That is what we fought two great world wars to attain in the world.', 'It was my duty, immediately after I was sworn in as President of the United States on April 12, 1945, to decide whether the conference to organize the United Nations should go forward in San Francisco or not, on the 25th of April.

The issue is the people against the special interests, and if you need any proof of that, all you need to do is to review the record of this Republican 80th Congress.', 'You remember in 1946, when everybody said he wanted a change, that he thought the country had had enough, and they put out such propaganda as that, most of you stayed at home, and by a minority vote of about a third of the voters, you elected a Congress that I think has given you enough!', 'The object of this 80th Congress, it seemed to me, was to take the bargaining power away from labor and give it back to the special interests. It was also the idea of the lobbies that controlled that 80th Congress to see that prices were not controlled. You know, I think they really like to have a ""boom and bust."" You know, that Congress had some of the most terrific lobbies that have ever been in Washington in the history of the country. They had the real estate lobby, the one that turned the rent control program loose, and they had the speculators lobby, and they had the National Association of Manufacturers lobby, whose interest is not the public interest it is special interest.', 'I want to bring it home to you that you must yourselves analyze the condition of the country at the time the 80th Congress took over, and you must also analyze the condition of the country over a 16-year period, 14 years of which were in the hands of a Democratic administration. You must also go back and compare that situation with the one with which we were faced after 12 years of ""normalcy,"" shall we call it?', ""That is what they want to go back to. We don't want to go back, we want to go forward!"", ""Dozens of times--I won't say that--at least half a dozen times I'll say--I asked the Congress to give us a price control bill that would gradually release those controls as production caught up with consumption and prevent a runaway inflation."", 'You were informed by the National Association of Manufacturers in 1946 that within 1 year prices would adjust themselves. They have adjusted themselves. They have gone all the way off the chart. It has not been in the interests of the common man either.

I hope you will keep that in mind, and I hope you will do that on November 2d."", 'In order to get that done, you have got to get on the books and get registered.

Today at Dexter, west of Des Moines, I am going to tell you just exactly what my program is on the farm and the farmer, and then you will have a chance to make a choice between Republican reaction and Democratic forward-looking administrations.

The first thing that they set up was a church. The next thing they set up was a schoolhouse. The University of Iowa is one of the first of the educational institutions set up west of the .Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi line. You know, Missouri and Iowa were from the same territory, first Louisiana, then Missouri territory, then Iowa decided they wanted to become independent and became the great State of Iowa where the tall corn grows. I contend that we grow corn as tall in Missouri, but I have never been able to prove it.', 'I am also very much interested in education. You know, we have reached a saturation point in our educational institutions because there are so many more people interested in getting an education.

But I know I don't have to convince you about conservation and crop insurance and rural electrification and those other things which the Democratic Party instituted and which have given the farmers the greatest prosperity they have ever had in their history."", 'There is only one thing I want to caution you about. Prosperity sometimes is a bad thing for some people. It makes them lazy and indifferent to the welfare of their country and their neighbors.

They didn't exercise their right on election day, and a very small minority of the voting population of the country gave us the worst Congress we have had in the history of the country, except one.

You know what that program is, but I'm going to reiterate it and bring it home to you and try to get you into a frame of mind so that you'll exercise your responsibility this fall when it comes time to vote. Your greatest responsibility is the responsibility of seeing that your Government is the sort of government you want because you are the Government.

My father used to always raise so much fuss about a skip place on an oat field or a wheat field that I was very careful never to have a skip place. I accomplished it by putting a marker on the drill--it was like planting corn.', 'I have had some other experiences that are interesting. In those days, we had what we called a gang plow, two 12-inch plows on the same frame with three wheels on it, and the locomotive power was four horses, or four mules, or three mules and a horse, or whatever you could get to pull it. It moved at a rate where it turned over a 2-foot furrow, and you could count the revolutions of the big wheel, from which you could tell how long it would take to plow an acre or to plow a field--3 or 4 days, sometimes longer.', ""Now you can get on a tractor and plow night and day--you don't have to feed it or water it--you can get off it whenever you please, take a nap, come back and run it again.

5,Harry S Truman ,"September 18, 1948","['Mr. President, and all the good farmers who are responsible for this wonderful demonstration:', 'It does my heart good to see the grain fields of the Nation again. They are a wonderful sight. The record-breaking harvests you have been getting in recent years have been a blessing. Millions of people have been saved from starvation by the food you have produced. The whole world has reason to be everlastingly grateful to the farmers of the United States.', ""In a very real sense, the abundant harvests of this country are helping to save the world from communism. Communism thrives on human misery. And the crops you are producing are driving back the tide of misery in many lands. Your farms are a vital element in America's foreign policy. Keep that in mind, that is of vital importance to us and to the world."", 'And while I am on that subject--I know that the war talk which is so prevalent today is causing all of you deep concern. It is plain enough that we are facing a very disturbing international situation. I should like every American to realize that this country is making every possible effort to preserve the peace.', 'In this critical situation, my motto has been: ""Keep your temper and stand firm."" We have kept our tempers. We have stood firm. And we have been reasonable and straightforward at all times.', 'It is the policy of this Government to continue working for peace with every instrument at our command. At the same time, we have been rapidly building up our strength. The peace of the world and the prestige of the United States require that the Nation be strong and vigilant.', 'But that is not the main point I wish to cover today. In addition to the issue of peace, there is another important reason why this is a critical period for America. I am talking about our economic future--your economic future.', 'Will this Nation succeed in keeping its prosperity ? Will it preserve its high standards of living next year, and the year after, and the year after that ?', 'I know of only one way to get assured prosperity. That is by cooperation of agriculture with labor, cooperation of agriculture and labor with business, large and small.', 'When these groups work together in a common cause, this country can achieve miracles. We saw that during the war. We saw it before the war. By common effort, in the last 15 years, every group in the Nation steadily increased its income. Our people rose from despair to the highest living standards in the history of the world.', 'So long as the farmer, the worker, and the businessman pull together in the national interest, this country has everything to hope for.', ""But it is terribly dangerous to let any one group get too much power in the Government. We cannot afford to let one group share the Nation's policies in its own interest, at the expense of the others."", ""That is what happened in the 1920's, under the big business rule of the Republicans. Those were the days when big corporations had things their own way. The policies that Wall Street big business wanted were the policies that the Republicans adopted. Agriculture, labor, and small business played second fiddle, while big business called the tune."", 'Those were the days of Republican high tariffs--tariffs which penalized the American farmer by making him pay high prices for manufactured goods, while he was receiving low prices for his crops.', 'You remember the results of that Wall Street Republican policy. You remember the big boom and the great crash of 1929. You remember that in 1932 the position of the farmer had become so desperate that there was actual violence in many farming communities. You remember that insurance companies and banks took over much of the land of small independent farmers--223,000 farmers lost their farms.', 'That was a painful lesson. It should not be forgotten for a moment.', 'Since then the farmer has come a long way. The agricultural program of the Democratic administration in 16 years has enabled farmers to attain decent standards of living. Interest rates on farm credit have been sharply brought down. Farm mortgage indebtedness has been reduced by more than 50 percent. Farm mortgage foreclosures have almost disappeared. In 1947 the smallest number of farm foreclosures in the history of the country took place.', 'All this was done under a Democratic administration.', 'Today the world needs more food than ever before. There is every reason for the American farmer to expect a long period of good prices--if he continues to get a fair deal. His great danger is that he may be voted out of a fair deal, and into a Republican deal.', 'The Wall Street reactionaries are not satisfied with being rich. They want to increase their power and their privileges, regardless of what happens to the other fellow. They are gluttons of privilege.', 'These gluttons of privilege are now putting up fabulous sums of money to elect a Republican administration.', 'Why do you think they are doing that? For the love of the Republican candidate? Or do you think it is because they expect a Republican administration to carry out their will, as it did in the days of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover?', 'I think we know the answer. I think we know that Wall Street expects its money this year to elect a Republican administration that will listen to the gluttons of privilege first, and to the people not at all.', 'Republican reactionaries want an administration that will assure privilege for big business, regardless of what may happen to the rest of the Nation.', 'The Republican strategy is to divide the farmer and the industrial worker--to get them to squabbling with each other--so that big business can grasp the balance of power and take the country over, lock, stock, and barrel.', ""To gain this end, they will stop at nothing. On the one hand, the Republicans are telling industrial workers that the high cost of food in the cities is due to this Government's farm policy. On the other hand, the Republicans are telling the farmers that the high cost of manufactured goods on the farm is due to this Government's labor policy."", 'That\'s plain hokum. It\'s an old political trick. ""If you can\'t convince \'em, confuse \'era."" But this time it won\'t work.', ""The farmer and the worker know that their troubles have been coming from another source. Right here I would like to cite you an example of the situation that they were faced with not so long ago. In 1932, under the Republicans, we had 12,500,000 unemployed, with average hourly wages at 45 cents, and we had 15 cent corn and 3 cent hogs. In fact, you burnt up some of your corn, because you couldn't market it, it was too cheap."", 'Those gluttons of privilege remember one plain fact. Never once during the great crises of the past 50 years have the Wall Street Republican administrations lifted a finger to help the farmer. Wait a minute-wait a minute!--they did once. They gave you a Farm Board. That was their great contribution.', ""How well you must remember the depression of the 1930's! The Republicans gave you that greatest of all depressions, as I said before, when hogs went down to 3 cents, and corn was so cheap you were burning it up."", 'All through this country, the American farmer and worker have been the victims of boom and bust cycles--with accent on the bust, especially for the farmers and the workers. And they have suffered alike in these misfortunes.', ""I wonder how many times you have to be hit on the head before you find out who's hitting you? It's about time that the people of America realized what the Republicans have been doing to them."", 'Why is it that the farmer and the worker and the small businessman suffer under Republican administrations and gain under Democratic administrations?', ""I'll tell you why. It is the result of a basic difference in the attitude between the Democratic and the Republican parties."", 'The Democratic Party represents the people. It is pledged to work for agriculture. It is pledged to work for labor. It is pledged to work for the small businessman and the white-collar worker.', 'The Democratic Party puts human rights and human welfare first.', 'But the attitude of the Republican gluttons of privilege is very different. The bigmoney Republican looks on agriculture and labor merely as expense items in a business venture. He tries to push their share of the national income down as low as possible and increase his own profits. And he looks upon the Government as a tool to accomplish this purpose.', 'These Republican gluttons of privilege are cold men. They are cunning men. And it is their constant aim to put the Government of the United States under the control of men like themselves. They want a return of the Wall Street economic dictatorship.', 'You have had a sample of what the Republican administration would mean to you. Two years ago, in the congressional elections, many Americans decided that they would not bother to vote. Well, others thought they would like to have a change. And they brought into power a Republican Congress-that notorious ""do-nothing"" 80th Republican Congress.', ""Let us look at the results of that change. This Republican Congress has already stuck a pitchfork in the farmer's back."", 'They have already done their best to keep the price supports from working. Many growers have sold wheat this summer at less than the support .price, because they could not find proper storage.', 'When the Democratic administration had to face this problem in the past, the Government set up grain bins all over the wheat and corn belts to provide storage.', 'Now the farmers need such bins again. But when the Republican Congress rewrote the charter of the Commodity Credit Corporation this year, there were certain lobbyists in Washington representing the speculative grain trade--your old friend.', 'These big-business lobbyists and speculators persuaded the Congress not to provide the storage bins for the farmers. They tied the hands of the administration. They are preventing us from setting up storage bins that you will need in order to get the support price for your grain.', 'When the farmers have to sell their wheat below the support price, because they have no place to store it, they can thank this same Republican 80th Congress that gave the speculative grain trade a rake-off at your expense.', 'The Republican reactionaries are not satisfied with that. Now they are attacking the whole structure of price supports for farm products.', 'This attack comes at a time when many farm prices are dropping and the price support program is of the greatest importance to the farmer.', 'The Democratic Party originated the farm support program. We built the price support plan out of hard experience. We built it for the benefit of the entire Nation--not only for the farmer, but for the consumer as well.', 'Republican spokesmen are now complaining that my administration is trying to keep farm prices up. They have given themselves away. They have given you a plain hint of what they have in store for you if they come into power. They are obviously ready to let the bottom drop out of farm prices.', 'The purpose of price support is to prevent farm prices from failing to ruinously low levels. Every consumer should realize that these supports apply only when farm prices have dropped below parity.', 'The Government is not now supporting the price on major food items such as meats, dairy products, and poultry.', 'The Government has just begun to support the price of wheat, which has dropped from around $3 a bushel to about $2 a bushel.', 'This support price has nothing to do with the price the consumer is paying for bread.', 'Now, listen to this! When wheat prices were going up, the price of bread rose steadily. It went up from 10 cents a loaf to 11 cents--to 12 cents a loaf--to 13 cents--to 14 cents.', 'Now, wheat prices have fallen a dollar a bushel. But the price of bread has come down not one cent!', 'There you have the policy of the reactionary big business. Pay as little as you can to the farmer, and charge the consumer all he can bear. That is a fair sample of what the Republican reaction has meant to you in the past 2 years--to you, and to every consumer, in the cities and on the farms.', 'When the Republicans claim that the wheat price supports are to blame for the high price of bread, they are trying to stir up the city consumer against the farmer by downright dishonesty.', 'The truth of the matter is that by encouraging the record production of the last few years, the support program has actually kept the consumer prices down.', ""Those who are willfully trying to discredit the price support system don't want the farmers to be prosperous. They believe in low prices for farmers, cheap wages for labor, and high profits for big corporations."", 'These are the facts the people need to know. I am going to keep hammering away at the facts until the whole country rings with the truth about these gluttons of privilege.', 'The record of the Republican 80th Congress is one long attack on the welfare of the farmer.', 'Under the Democratic administrations since 1933, the Government sponsored the great soil conservation program which helped to lay the foundations for the present prosperity of the American farmer. But that ""do-nothing"" Republican 80th Congress, under the false mask of economy, cut and threatened to kill the soil conservation program. You people here know best the importance of soil conservation to American agriculture. You bet you do! You know what the reactionary attack on soil conservation will cost the farmer if we let the Republicans have their own way.', 'At every point the Republican 80th Congress did what the speculative grain lobby wanted it to do.', 'They have killed the International Wheat Agreement, which would have assured the American wheat growers a large export market for 5 years at fair prices.', 'They started a move to put a death-tax on farm cooperatives.', 'They ruled out the grain bins that help make the ever-normal granary effective.', 'They have invited a depression by refusing to curb inflation.', 'And now they are attacking the farm support program.', 'The Wall Street Republicans are not worrying about whether you like it or not. Their political wiseacres have assured them that the farmer has fallen back into his old habit of voting Republican, whatever happens. The Republicans are saying, ""Don\'t worry about the farm vote. It\'s in the bag.""', 'So long as you had a good year once in a while, you would be satisfied. So they thought. And so they think today.', ""You and I know they're making a big mistake. From what I have seen, the farmers of this country have their eyes open. You're not going to be fooled again by the slick propaganda of Wall Street."", 'In only 2 years, with only the Congress under their control, the Republicans were able to weaken your position gravely.', 'Well, imagine what would happen if they were to get both the Congress and the Presidency for 4 years. What they have taken away from you thus far would be only an appetizer for the economic tapeworm of big business.', 'Your best protection is to elect a Democratic Congress and a President that will play fair with the farmer--an administration that will reinforce soil conservation, provide adequate storage facilities for grain, encourage production, and help the farmer make enough on his crop to meet the cost of living, and have something left over.', ""I don't need to tell you how long it takes to get a good crop, and how big the dangers are. You can work a year, plowing and cultivating, and then at the last minute, a sudden drought or flood can wipe you out. You all know how terrible these disasters of nature can be."", 'Now you are faced with the danger of another kind of disaster--a man-made disaster bearing the Republican trademark. For 16 years the Democrats have been working on a crop of prosperity for the farmer. We have been plowing, and seeding, and cultivating the soil of the American economy in order to get a crop of prosperity that you have been enjoying for the past several years.', 'The question is: Are you going to let another Republican blight wipe out that prosperity?', 'I have reminded you of the evils wrought by the Republican administrations in recent times. But my purpose has not been merely to bring up the past. I am trying to point the way to a healthy future. The Democratic Party is looking forward, not back. We are planning to aid the farmers of America meet their pressing problems and avoid catastrophe.', 'Today farmers are faced with the threat that markets will fail to keep up with their production. The reactionary Republican answer is to let prices crash to the bottom. But the Democratic Party has a constructive way of preventing such a collapse.', ""We are reaching out to develop world markets that will absorb production above America's own needs. Scientific research is discovering more and newer uses for farm products. We know that the world can absorb the farmers' output, if the right conditions are created, and we are working to insure continued prosperity for American agriculture."", ""The Democratic Party is fighting the farmer's battle. We believe that farmers are entitled to share equally with other people in our national income. We believe that a prosperous and productive agriculture is essential to our national welfare."", 'But the Democratic Party does not stand in defense of he farmer alone. It stands for the people of the United States--the farmer, the industrial worker, and the white-collar worker.', 'Our intentions are made clear by our deeds. In this 20th century, every great step forward has come during Democratic administrations of the National Government. Every movement backward has come under Republican auspices, and it is the people who have paid dearly for these reactionary moves.', 'Too much is now at stake--here and throughout the world--to take the wrong path now.', 'There is one way to stop the forces of reaction.', ""Get every vote out on election day, and make it count. You can't afford to waste your votes this year."", ""I'm not asking you just to vote for me. Vote for yourselves! Vote for your farms! Vote for the standard of living that you have won under a Democratic administration!"", 'Get out there on election day, and vote for your future!']"

They had to be regimented, their sons and daughters had been in the fighting forces and they felt that they would like to have some relief.', 'A great many of them, in fact, two-thirds of them, did not exercise that great privilege for which our forefathers fought from 1776 to 1781, and for which they fought an internecine war from 1862 to 1865 to keep the free ballot. They did not exercise that privilege, and look what they got--just look what they got!', 'They got a change all right. Remember the signs all over the country ""Had Enough?"" Well, they apparently thought they had had enough and now they have had too much.', 'It is your civic duty, no matter how you feel, to go to the polls on election day, after you have been properly registered on the registration date, and vote your sentiments, because you are the Government of the United States, the only Republic in the history of the world where the people are the Government. You elect local officials, nonpartisan mayors and councils, nonpartisan judges; and partisan congressmen and senators, and partisan Presidents and Vice Presidents. In that way, you are the Government.', 'Now, I want you to tell all your friends and everybody you know, whether a Republican, a Mugwump, or a Democrat, to come out and do his duty civically on the 2d day of November.', 'Now this is a wonderful club, and they are springing up all over the United States. You know, back in April of this year, they had your President out in the Atlantic Ocean, so far as politics were concerned. And in May we heard people deciding that it would be best for the country if certain other persons, many of whom you have in mind, could be named to head the Democratic ticket. And then, along in July, after the Republicans had had a convention and had written a platform--which, in my opinion, is the most hypocritical document that has been put into writing--people began to understand that for 3 long years the President of the United States had succeeded to an almost impossible situation.', 'There were 12,800,000 men and women under arms on September 2, 1945. Two wars had suddenly come to an end, one of them 6 months ahead of the estimated time, and the other one a year and six months ahead of the estimated time; and people began to talk it down, they did not understand that the period succeeding a world conflagration like that would, in all probability, be much more difficult to handle than the carrying on of a war when everybody was behind the Government putting everything he had into it to make it work.', 'And so dissension. We had dissension in the Democratic Party and had dissension in the Republican Party. Look at the votes, and on the Congress of the United States in 1945 after war ceased, and in 1946; and then look at what they did in the elections of 1946. It is hard to understand how we could continue to make the Government run.', 'But it did run. We had no riots--we had no bloodshed--we had no Ku Klux Klan. But we did make an effort to keep the country running, and we have succeeded in putting 61,000,000 people to work. We have succeeded in creating the greatest national income in the history of the world, and that income has not been just in the hands of a few people. It has been distributed to the farmers, to the man who works with his hands, and to the white-collar man; and since the Republican Both Congress came in, the special interests have been getting a lot of it, too.', ""Now I want you to weigh all these things in this Truman-Barkley Club, and I want you to go out and tell the citizens exactly what the situation is, and I don't believe there is a man in the country, if he thinks, that would want to turn the clock back. That is what you are being asked to do."", ""Weigh all these things, read all the speeches of the opposition, read all the statements of your President--not one of these statements but what are based on absolute fact. I know! And then, on November 2d, I am not going to ask you to vote just for me. Vote for yourselves. Vote for yourselves, and tell everybody else to vote for themselves, and you won't have to worry who will live in the White House for the next 4 years."", '[4.] COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO (Rear platform, 4:26 p.m.)', ""I am very happy to be in Colorado Springs again. I have been here on numerous occasions. It's a lovely place, beautifully situated, and you don't dare talk about the climate of Colorado Springs in California-or Florida either, for that matter."", ""One of the reasons you are prosperous and happy is because you've learned how to use your resources to the very best advantage, especially your water resources."", 'You know, the Reclamation Act has been on the books for more than 30 years, but nothing much was done about it or the development of this part of the world until 1932, when you elected Franklin D. Roosevelt.', ""Most of you in 1932 had given up hope and were thinking of going somewhere else, along with the Okies and the other people who were moving around the country; but much to your satisfaction you didn't do that."", ""At that time the income of the great State of Colorado was about $350 million. Do you know what it was last year? It was a billion, five hundred million dollars. And that wasn't due to any accident. That was due to the development of the resources of this great State."", ""It's a wonderful thing that has happened to this part of the world in the last decade, and I am wondering whether you are going to let the present propaganda machine fool you into turning the clock back to 1932 again. I am very sure you won't do that. If you'll just study the facts and the figures, you can't do anything else but keep an administration in power that has been trying to do things for this part of the world."", 'I made a speech in Denver at noon, in which I made the statement that due to the example of that terrible 80th Republican Congress elected in 1946, I could say definitely that the Republicans Â¶re trying to sabotage the West.', ""In 1946, you know, two-thirds of you stayed at home and didn't vote. You wanted a change. Well, you got it. You got the change. You got just exactly what you deserved."", ""If you stay at home on November the 2d and let this same gang get control of the Government, I won't have any sympathy with you. But if you go out to the polls on that day and do your duty as you should I won't have to worry about moving out of the White House; and you won't have to worry about what happens to the welfare of the West. Those two things go together."", ""I have been most happy today to travel around over Colorado with your Democratic candidate for Congress and your Democratic candidate for the Senate, Ed Johnson, and with your wonderful and able Democratic Governor who introduced me up in Denver today. It's been a pleasure to be with those gentlemen, and I want to see Colorado come out of the kinks entirely and send us a Democratic delegation in toto to the Congress."", '[5.] PUEBLO, COLORADO (Rear platform, 6:07 p.m.)', 'Mr. Chairman, Governor Knous, Senator Johnson:I am most happy to be in this great city of pueblo. I have been here many a time. One of the times I was here was a very, very sad one. I was here at the funeral of Alva Adams, one of the great Senators from Colorado. He was my personal friend. I was very fond of him, and he made history while he was in the Senate.', 'I hope that Pueblo will always stay in the Democratic column.', ""I understand that you've almost doubled your population in the last 10 years; and that wasn't by accident. It was because the Democrats in power in Washington were able to help you improve your conditions here."", 'You know, Pueblo is the site of one of the greatest controversies that ever took place in the history of the country; and as a result of that controversy and the Pullman strike in Chicago, and the Homestead Steel strike in Pittsburgh, labor began to come into its own. And, when Franklin Roosevelt was elected President of the United States, we got a bill of rights for labor. That bill of rights became effective, known as the Wagner Act, 13 years ago.', ""Well, in 1946 labor stayed at home and didn't vote, and a lot of other people stayed at home and didn't vote because only onethird of the people entitled to vote in 1946 did vote; and we got the Both Congress."", ""The first thing that Both Congress did-and I vetoed it 3 times; it took 3 times to get it; I vetoed it 3 times--they passed a rich man's tax bill. They began to line their own pockets."", 'And the next thing they did was to take some of the freedom away from labor, that famous Taft-Hartley Act.', ""Well, now, you're faced with this situation; as I told you a while ago, you thought you wanted a change in 1946. You got it. You got that rich man's tax bill and you got the Taft-Hartley Act. I wonder if you want to go any further with that sort of change? All right; if you don't, on November the 2d you better get out and vote. You better get out and vote, and you better elect a Democratic Senator and a Democratic Congressman from this district. And, well, if you do that, you can't help but elect the President because he's on the ticket ahead of them."", 'There are a lot of other things besides those two things which I shall just call to your attention. One of them is reclamation and irrigation.', 'The Reclamation Act was passed about 30 years ago. Not much was done about it until you elected a Democratic administration in 1932, and then things began to happen. Since that time, more than 5,000,000 acres have been put to work, that otherwise would be desert, by the Democratic policies, and more than 90,000 farms have been put under cultivation as a result of that policy.', ""Now, you've got a great project here in this neighborhood, known as the Gunnison-Arkansas project. If that project is carried out--and it won't be carried out if the Republicans have their way, and if you let them have their way that will be your fault--if that project is carried out, that one project will create more power by 10 or 15 times-22, I think--22 times as much power as is used right here in Pueblo. That will mean more industries for this part of the world. It will mean more desert land under cultivation. It will mean prosperity for this part of the West."", ""And that's what the Democratic administrations have stood for: the welfare of the common people. And the big interests don't like that. They are interested in their own special privileges. And if you stand around on election day and let them get away with it, you'll get just exactly what you deserve, as you did in 1946."", 'You\'ll get a Republican administration that\'s interested in the real estate lobby, that\'s interested in the power lobby, that\'s interested in the grain speculators\' lobby, and a dozen others that some day I\'m going to name to you and tell you just how much money they spent in Washington on this ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress. It\'s most interesting.', ""The public interest was not looked after one little bit after that Congress went into effect. I can stand here and talk to you for an hour and tell you what they didn't do that they ought to have done, and tell you what they did do that they should not have done. But you all know it. I don't have to tell you."", 'Now, use your judgment. Keep the people in control of the Government who work for your interests, the interests of the common people and who are not working for the special interests.', ""Why, the campaign funds subscribed by the big interests for the Republican campaign-well, I'd say a very small part of it would make the Democrats the happiest people in the world. You know, we never do have any money. I've been told that when a man gets as much as a thousand dollars in his pocket, he votes the Republican ticket. Some of these thousand dollar fellows and some of these farmers are finding out that their best interest is with the Democratic Party whether they have a thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars. And they better keep that in mind."", 'I do appreciate most highly your courtesy to me and the courtesy of your Governor and the public officials who have been so kind to me all day today.', ""I've had a grand time in Denver and we had a crowd about half this big in Colorado Springs, and if Colorado Springs was as big as Pueblo, I guess the crowd would have been bigger."", ""And I can't tell you, as I say, how much I appreciate all these courtesies. It makes me feel good that I've taken the effort to come out here and tell you just exactly what the facts are."", ""I hope you'll study the speech I made in Des Moines, Iowa, yesterday--or Saturday-and the one I made in Denver this morning. You'll find that the interests of the common people are at stake, that I'm trying to look after the fellow who has to work for a living, either on the farm or as a laboringman, or as a white-collar worker. I don't think you'll find anybody in the Republican Party that's very much interested in the welfare of these people."", '[6.] CANON CITY, COLORADO (Rear platform, 7:32 p.m.)', ""Well! I guess this is all the rest of Colorado. I can't tell you how very much I have appreciated the cordiality of the welcome I have received in Colorado today. In Denver I never saw such crowds. And Colorado Springs and Pueblo. I think this crowd here in Canon City is bigger than either one of the crowds in Colorado Springs or Pueblo. I believe that Colorado is interested in Democrats. Particularly in your Democratic President."", ""As we came down from Denver to Pueblo today, we passed by Pike's Peak, and I understand tonight we are going to pass by Mount Elbert, which next to Mount Whitney is the highest mountain in the country. And I was thinking about those high mountains and these high prices under which we live. Prices are higher than Mount Elbert or Pike's Peak or Mount Whitney, either one; and that was brought about because we have special interests who want to profit by those prices, and they have prevented a control of those prices to make things fair for the fellow that has to work for a living. I don't know whether they want to do it. I think 7 or 8 or 9 times I asked for legislation that would improve that price situation, but I didn't get anywhere with it at all."", 'This 80th Republican ""do-nothing"" Congress was not interested in your welfare and mine. They were interested in certain special interests in the country who want to control the country as they did in times past. In fact, they would like to put the West back where it was in 1860 as a sort of colony of the East.', ""You remember when we were trying to build the Pacific Railroad across the United States, Daniel Webster made a speech in the Senate of the United States. Daniel Webster was one of the original Republicans, and he made a speech in the Senate of the U.S., and he said he did not want to open up the West, he never did think this part of the country was any good, he didn't think it ever would be any good."", 'And you remember when he sat down with Lord Ashburton to write a treaty about 54-40, he and Lord Ashburton took a ruler and drew a line across the map and said this will do, the country is no good anyway.', 'I think the Republicans have always thought that. At least this Republican 80th Congress seems to think it, because they are trying to keep you from trying to get your projects built out here.', 'I have asked for funds for reclamation projects, for power projects, and for those projects in this part of the country that mean so much to you people; and they have turned me down every time.', ""I don't think they want you to prosper. They are afraid of you."", ""I want you to help me keep the Government in the hands of the people. The 'people west of the Mississippi River can do that if they want to do it, because there are enough people east of the Mississippi River who are in sympathy with what you believe in--conservation, public power, and the implementation of our national resources for the benefit of all the country, not just for a few people who speculate on the stock exchange in Wall Street."", 'In Des Moines on Saturday I told the farmers what was good for them. In Detroit on Labor Day I told the men who work what was good for them. Today in Denver, Colo., I told you people out here what would be best for your interests and for the interests of the country as a whole.', ""The Democratic Party doesn't stand for any special interests. The Democratic Party wants every man, woman, and child to have his fair share of the national income."", 'I am not so sure that is what the Republicans want. At least they did not show it when they had control of the country. They gave us a phony boom and a bust. They ruined the farmer, the worker, and the ordinary citizen.', 'And who pulled you out of that boom and bust?', 'In 1932 you elected Franklin Roosevelt. In 1934 you sent me to the Senate. In 1944 you elected me to be Vice President of the United States, and I succeeded the greatest President this country has ever had--Mr. Roosevelt.', ""I have been trying my best to carry on for the welfare of the country. Of course, I had a different situation than we had in wartime. You know, people will get together and cooperate when the country's existence is in danger. But, you know, it has been most difficult to operate things since hostilities ceased, because special interests and various other people were not very anxious to see a Democratic administration come out very successfully."", 'Now I have had to come out here and tell you what the facts are and to urge you to use your judgment, for your own interests. And your own interest is a Democratic administration in Washington, in the Congress, and in the White House for the next 4 years.', ""We had a shining example of what the Republicans intend to do to you by this 80th Congress. They have done immense damage to the farmer, to labor, and to the white-collar worker in the 2 years they have been in control of that Congress. I don't know what they would have done if they had a President in sympathy with them."", 'Now, you had better look out for your own interests on November the 2d, and vote for the welfare of the United States as a whole by sending the Democrats back there, on November the 2d.', ""Your Governor and all your public officials have been kind to us today, and I can't tell you how very much I appreciate it.

It looks to me like you've got 10 times 50 and maybe more, and I appreciate it."", ""We've had a grand day in Colorado today, my family and myself. Denver--well, Denver turned out with I think everybody in town and about a hundred thousand on the outside. And then at Colorado Springs I think everybody in the city was there. In Pueblo we had about twice as many, but Pueblo is twice as big as Colorado Springs. And then when we got to Canon City they said that was the center of all the Republicans in Colorado and there wouldn't be anybody out unless they opened up the penitentiary and let all the prisoners out. But they were very much mistaken. There were at least 5,000 or 6,000 people out there in Canon City, and I didn't see anybody with stripes at all."", 'And then look here at Salida. This is a wonderful city. You know, my family used to take their vacations up here at Buena Vista and they would come down to Salida for various reasons; my boss, Mrs. Truman, used to come down here to see the doctor, Dr. Thompson, years ago.', ""This is a wonderful country, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of a lot of people; and I want to see it continue its growth. I want to see it improve and become greater and greater as the years go by. I'm not so sure that my Republican opponents want that to happen."", 'They have a very peculiar idea that special interest and special privilege is the reason for government. I have exactly the opposite idea.', ""I think the Government belongs to you and me as private citizens. That's one thing in this country that makes it great. Every single man and woman in this country can have his say and have an interest in the Government of the U.S. and his State and his county and his city, if he wants to, but he has to exercise that privilege on election day. And if he doesn't do that then he throws away his privilege."", 'That\'s what two-thirds of the population did in 1946. They were disgruntled. They said they wanted a change. They got the change, in the form of the 80th Republican ""do-nothing"" Congress.', ""That Congress did not do very much for the common people. It took some of the privileges away from labor; it passed a rich man's tax bill; it refused to do what was necessary for the farmers; it refused to do anything about prices. In fact, the things that it did not do will fill a whole page, and the things that that Congress did add up to what they did to the people and not for them."", ""Now, you've got another chance to redeem yourselves. On November 2d you are going to elect a Senator from Colorado and you're going to elect all the Congressmen from Colorado, and if you do what you ought to do you'll elect Ed Johnson to the Senate, you'll elect a Democrat from this district for Congress and every other district in Colorado, if you're looking after your own interests."", 'I not only want you to vote for me but I want you to vote for yourselves, and if you vote for yourselves, you\'ll vote the Democratic ticket; and if you don\'t vote the Democratic ticket you\'ll have a continuation of just what you have had in the last 2 years, and if you do that--if you want that sort of government--I\'m not going to worry about your welfare. You can take what you get, just like you had to take this 80th ""donothing"" Republican Congress.', ""Now, real patriotism, if you have it, will show in your turnout on November 2d. I hope there won't be a single person who is entitled to vote in the State of Colorado, who does not go out and vote."", 'The income of the State of Colorado has trebled since 1932. It was about 350 million at that time, and do you know what it was in 1947? It was a billion, five hundred million dollars.', ""There are 61 million people at work in the United States today, and I've heard people say that that could not happen in this country. It was not a fact in 1932. There were about 12 or 15 million people who didn't have jobs in 1932, and jobs are going begging now."", ""The income is the greatest in the history of the world in this country, and it's being distributed so that the farmer, the laboringman, the white-collar worker, and everybody who is entitled to it is getting his share of that tremendous income."", ""I don't think you want to vote against your own interest.

8,Harry S Truman ,"September 20, 1948","['Governor, Senator, distinguished politicians, and members of the Democratic Party of Colorado, ladies and gentlemen:', 'Every time I come out this way I feel again the tremendous vitality of the West. That feeling comes not only from magnificent .scenery and bracing air. It comes from talking to the vigorous, confident people who live out here.', 'This is a straight-from-the-shoulder country, and it has produced a great breed of fighting men. I am going to call upon your fighting qualities now. For you and I have a fight on our hands--a fight for the future of this country and for the welfare of the people of the United States.', 'The other day, a cartoonist for a Republican newspaper drew a cartoon of me that I enjoyed. He showed me dressed up as Patti Revere, riding through a colonial town yelling to the townspeople: ""Look out! The Republicans are coming!""', 'It was a good cartoon. There\'s a lot of truth in it. But it\'s not quite accurate. What I am really telling you is not that the Republicans are coming, but they are here. They have been in Washington for the last 2 years in the form of the notorious Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress.', 'Today I want to talk to you about what that Republican Congress has been doing to you, and to your families, and to your country.', ""Understand me, when I speak of what the Republicans have been doing, I'm not talking about the average Republican voter. Nobody knows better than I that man for man, individually, most Republicans are fine people. But there's a big distinction between the individual Republican voter and the policies of the Republican Party."", 'Something happens to Republican leaders when they get control of the Government or even of a part of the Government--something that shocks and dismays many of their own loyal supporters.', 'Republicans in Washington have a habit of becoming curiously deaf to the voice of the people. They have a hard time hearing what the ordinary people of the country are saying. But they have no trouble at all hearing what Wall Street is saying. They are able to catch the slightest whisper from big business and the special interests.', ""When I talk to you here today about Republicans, I am talking about the party that gets most of its campaign funds from the special interests in Wall Street. I am talking to you about the party that gave us the phony boom of the 1920's, and the Hoover depression which followed it. I am talking to you about the party that gave us that Republican 80th Congress."", 'The Republican Party today is controlled by silent and cunning men who have a dangerous lust for power and privilege. The Republican Party is fundamentally the party of privilege. These men are now reaching out for control of the country and its resources.', 'It is your votes which will decide whether or not they have their way. That is why I have come out here today.', 'I want you to know the facts.', 'I repeat: The most reactionary elements in the country today are backing the Republican Party in its effort to take over your Government on election day.', 'If they succeed, I predict that they will turn back the clock to the day when the West was an economic colony of Wall Street. That is terrible even to contemplate.', 'Election day this year, your choice will not be merely between political parties. You will be choosing a way of life for years to come. This is a fateful election. On it will depend your standard of living and the economic independence of your community.', 'You can choose to be governed by Republican puppets of big business--the same breed that gave you the worst depression in our history.', 'Or you can choose to be governed by the servants of the people, who are pledged to work for the welfare of all the people, the nominees of the Democratic Party.', 'Some of you may feel that I am attacking the leaders of the Republican Party rather sharply. I am. And I have good reasons for doing it--reasons like the obstacles placed in the way of conservation of our natural resources; reasons like the housing conditions in this country; reasons like the high cost of living; reasons close to your hearts, and to mine.', 'You people out here have been thinking about these problems. You have a right to know what your Government is going to do about them.', ""Let's go into them a little bit. Let's see where the Republicans stand on these vital issues, and where the Democratic Party stands."", 'We all know that the housing situation in this country is a national disgrace. It is almost unbelievable that we should have made so little progress in providing decent housing conditions for millions of American families.', 'From the first day of that Republican 80th Congress, there was a housing bill before it, which would meet the problem. That bill was a full-scale program to provide housing for all our people and not just for those who can pay high prices. But the Republicans refused to act.', ""The situation became more and more desperate. Veterans' groups, labor groups, mayors of cities, Governors of States, pleaded with the Republicans to pass the housing bill. Even that hypocritical Philadelphia convention made a plea for it. Can you beat that? They still did nothing."", 'The Republican stand on housing was clearly exposed last July, when I called the Congress into special session and demanded again that they enact housing legislation. The bill was ready. It had been studied and discussed, times without number. It was supposed to be nonpartisan.', 'But what happened? There was a certain real estate lobby which had its high-priced agents operating in Washington. These men, representing big real estate interests, were in close touch with the Republican leaders. The Republican leadership in the House of Representatives cracked the whip. And the Republican Senate killed the nonpartisan housing bill.', 'This was no accident. It was Republican policy. In 1947, Senator Taft joined with two Democratic Senators--Senator Wagner and Senator Ellender--in introducing the housing bill. But in 1948 he voted against the bill with his own name on it. What a whip they must have cracked over Taft.', ""Why did the Republicans kill the bill? The answer is plain. They wanted to leave housing under the control of the profiteers. There is a lot of money to be made out of providing houses for the 'people--if private interests are allowed to exact exorbitant profits from the people."", 'Have you felt the pinch of the housing shortage? Put the blame where it belongs.', 'And remember, if the Republicans were to come into power for the next 4 years, the future of American housing would be in the hands of the same men who killed that housing bill--the men who obey the lobbyists of selfish interests, the powerful real estate lobby, and half a dozen others which I am going to talk to you about later on in this campaign.', 'Now, about high prices. I know you are troubled by high prices. Well, put the blame where it belongs--on the leaders of the Republican Party. The Republican record in dealing with inflation is typical.', 'When I called the Republican Congress into special session this year and asked them for price control measures, they said that my request was made for political purposes. They used that as an excuse and did nothing about prices. They very conveniently forgot that I had called a special session of the same Congress in 1947, and asked for the same price control. And 1947 was not an election year.', 'If they had put into effect the controls I asked for, the prices on such things as meat, milk, steel, and automobiles would have been stabilized or reduced.', 'The Republicans could easily have taken this issue out of politics merely by doing something about it. But they chose to do nothing about it.', 'I have been talking about the conservation of our economic well-being. Now I come to a particular phase of that conservation that has special interest for you of the West. You live in a region whose whole future depends on its wise use of the rich resources that Nature has provided.', 'Early in this century, a unique Republican President, Theodore Roosevelt, fought for conservation, only to be repudiated by his party.', 'All through the Republican administrations from 1921 to 1933, the big business pressure groups prevented adequate conservation measures from being put into effect. They wanted quick profits, the easy way. And so western forests were logged off and left barren. Range lands were grazed off and ruined. Farmland was worked to the point where its fertility was gone. Precious water ran unused past barren land. There was no soil conservation program, no range conservation program.', 'The Nation lost tremendous quantities of its most valuable resources. The West continued to bow to Wall Street furnishing raw materials at low prices and buying back finished goods at high prices.', 'Then, in 1933, came the Democratic administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'Under his leadership, conservation was made a living reality. You know better than anyone how much it has meant to the West.', 'The Democratic administration won its fight for conservation and for western development against the bitter opposition of Wall Street and the special interests. You of the West see the results of our victory every day. You see those results in bigger and better crops; in new industries; in the growing national parks and forests and the tourists who visit them; in the rising standards of living of the people of the West; and in the stronger economy of the whole Nation.', 'But we still have a long way to go. We are still using our timber faster than we grow it. Thousands of acres of land are still being washed away every year. Disastrous floods are still frequent. Conservation in the West is of first importance to the whole country.', 'In the face of all this, what did the ""donothing"" Republican Congress do?', 'Remember, the record of that Congress is the actual test of the attitude of the Republican leadership toward the people.', 'The Republicans in Congress consistently tried to cut the ground from under our conservation program. Last year, the Republican-dominated House of Representatives voted to cut the agricultural conservation program in half in 1947, and to end it entirely by 1948.', 'The Democrats in the Senate led, and finally won, a fight to save the life of that program. They saved it, but they could not completely restore it. The program was seriously damaged by the Republican 80th Congress.', 'Here is a significant fact. Nineteen forty-seven was the first year in a decade and a half that the Republicans had control of Congress. And that was the first year in which the Congress took a step backward in the field of soil conservation since that program was begun.', 'The first time the Republicans had a chance they began to undermine conservation.', ""Now, let's look at another subject that is closely bound up with your future--the industrial development of the West."", 'I know that all of you recognize the importance of creating new industries in this region, using the resources of the West, so as to reduce your industrial dependence upon the East.', 'For my part, I am convinced that rapid and sound industrial development in the West will make a vital contribution to the living standards and the well-being, not only of the people of the West, but of the whole Nation.', 'The heart of the western industrial development program is hydroelectric power. Coupled with the irrigation projects and flood control, electric power is of fundamental importance to your future.', 'The Democratic Party, for the past 15 years, has been energetically developing the great dams, irrigation projects, and power systems which have contributed so much to the prosperity of the West.', 'But as soon as the Republican Party gained control of the Congress, it began to tear down the whole western development program. The Republicans slashed funds right and left. They cut back projects to bring water to the land and electric power to industry.', 'Right here in this State, the Colorado-Big Thompson project is under way. It is an inspiring project, involving the transfer of water from one side of the Continental Divide to the other. The Republican Congress sharply reduced the funds for that project. When I pointed out the danger of that action and requested them to restore those funds, they refused to do it.', ""Wherever you turn, no matter what field of activity, you find the same story. In the light of the evidence, I say flatly that the Republican leaders have been working against the interests of the people. I say they have been eager agents of the big business lobbies and the most reactionary elements in American economic life. They jump for these lobbyists, but they won't do anything for the people."", 'In the last 16 years, Democratic administrations have built a firm foundation for a new and greater West.', 'We restored grazing lands for the sustained production of livestock. Millions of cattle and sheep feed today where only prairie dogs and rattlesnakes existed before.', 'We restored forests for a sustained yield of timber. Trees stand for the future where exploiters would have wiped them out.', 'We established a sound conservation policy to prevent land erosion and restore the fertility of the soil.', 'We built the Federal system of hydroelectric and irrigation projects which are now providing water for more than 5 million irrigated acres in the West and for better living for millions of people.', 'We have been leading the fight for decent housing, effective reduction of the cost of living, and a rise in living standards--all for a better Nation of happier people.', 'That is the Democratic record--a record of which I am exceedingly proud.', 'There is more to do, much more. What we have done so far is only the beginning. This is no time to permit progress to be checked, when you can foresee great new developments of your agriculture, your industry, and your commerce, if you have the aid and support of the Federal Government.', 'Your need is to insure the election of an administration pledged to give you that aid and support--in other words, you need a Democratic administration.', 'There is a hard fight ahead. We shall have to fight the slick political propaganda of the special interests and the Republican leadership.', 'We shall have to fight the millions of dollars that Wall Street is pouring into the treasury of the Republican Party.', 'We shall have to fight the Republican undercover sabotage of the West.', 'But we of the Democratic Party are eager for that fight. In fact, I am taking it to them right now. We believe that we owe to future generations the bequest of a strong America, mighty in its resources and wise in its use of them.', 'We are firmly determined to leave after us a land that is better than we found it.']"

Colorado, you know, is about half made up of Missourians. Every place I go, when people came in to see me, they very carefully inform me that either they themselves were born in Missouri, or that their parents came from Missouri to Colorado.', 'My grandfather used to run a wagon train from Westport, now part of Kansas City, Mo., to Salt Lake City and Denver and San Francisco, from 1846 to about 1860, and I have heard a great many stories from him on how the opening of this country came about.', ""It was a long time, you know, before the people east of the Mississippi River could understand that the people out here didn't wear horns and a tail. Some of them still think that."", ""There are a great many people east of the Appalachian Mountains who are not yet sure that it's safe to come out West, because they're afraid Wild Bill Hickok or some Indian chief will scalp them."", ""I was at one time hopeful that at some time or other we could establish a summer capital between Denver and Colorado Springs and bring all those eastern fellows out here to let them see just exactly what kind of a country they have on this side of the Mississippi River. I haven't been successful in getting that done."", 'You are vitally interested, however, from your own economic welfare, in the policies pursued by the Federal Government. The Federal Government if it does what it should, can cause the development of the West to proceed from now on at a much greater rate than it has up to date.', 'There are a great many projects in which the Federal Government is vitally interested: reclamation, irrigation, and power. They are the lifeblood of the West.', 'And I want to say to you that in 1946 a great many of you stayed at home on election day--about two-thirds of you. Onethird of the people elected a Congress which I call the Republican ""do-nothing"" Both Congress, and the policies pursued by that Congress are an index as to what will happen to you if the Republicans get control of the Government. Now, if you stay at home this time on election day and let them get control of the Government you\'ll deserve just what you get.', 'The Reclamation Act has been on the books for 30 years and not much was done about it until the country, in 1932, elected Franklin D. Roosevelt to be President of the United States. From that time on developments of the West assumed a rolling advancement. More projects, more land was opened up than ever before in the history of the whole reclamation law during that administration and during the 3Â½ years that I have been in the White House.', ""If you'll just study history you can't possibly afford to go along with those people who want to turn the clock back. The Republicans haven't any program, they haven't any program. They're still crying the same thing that they cried in 1946--that there ought to be a change. Well, you got a change in 1946 and look what you got. You got your reclamation projects cut down. You got your power projects, in most instances, wiped out. Every appropriation that affects the West was slashed, and it was slashed with malice aforethought, because the people who were in charge of those Appropriations Committees in the Senate and the House--one of them comes from upper New York, the Chairman does, and the other comes from New Hampshire. What do they know about the West? I don't think either one of them set foot west of the Appalachian Mountains. The Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate may, some time or other on some Senate jaunt, have been out here, but he didn't know what he was looking at when he saw it."", ""You want to be careful, now, when you go to the polls next November the 2d.

I was a colonel in the Reserve Corps.', 'The General pulled down his specs on the end of his nose, like that, and said, ""How old are you?"" I said, ""Well, I am 56.""

I have been told that in real prosperous times you produce as many as 5 million tons of bituminous coal here in a year. That's a wonderful production; and that you furnish the coal for the steel plant down at Provo. You know, that's been one of my ambitious enterprises since I have been in the Congress of the U.S. and in the Presidency of the United States--to see that the industrial development of the West goes forward."", ""That great steel plant was built at Provo while I was chairman of an investigating committee in the U.S. Senate and I watched that plant grow from the start to the finish, and the location of that plant there was so that this great coalbed here could be used. They tell me that it's inexhaustible, and I hope that's true, because the time is going to come some time or other when we are going to have to make a lot of oil from coal. We have experimental plants now in the East, trying to develop, to make oil out of coal; and we have a shale plant going over in Colorado which is endeavoring to make oil out of shale, and if you have inexhaustible coalbeds here--and I understand you also have inexhaustible shale beds--that means that the fuel for our machine age economy will be absolutely dependent at some time or other upon this great West."", ""Tonight at Salt Lake City I'm going to go into the things that the Democratic Party stands for with regard to this great West. And I hope all of you will be able to hear me, and I hope you'll give heed to what I have to say."", ""I understand that there are a great many people who labor in this community, and if those men weigh their interests as the farmer should weigh his interests and as the small businessman should weigh his interests I don't think there's any doubt about my not having to be troubled by the housing problem next year--I'll still stay in the White House."", ""I wish it were possible for me to see some of these great mines in this neighborhood.

I came here as Chairman of the Special Committee to investigate the National Defense Program when this steel plant was partly completed, and I was here after the steel plant was completed and made a complete and thorough inspection and a report on it.', ""I was very much pleased when that plant was located here in Utah. As I said back in the coal country at Helper, industry in the West is absolutely essential for the economic welfare of the West.

In fact, you are the Government.

It will continue to exist because I think Almighty God intended this republic to assume the leadership in the world. We refused it in 1920. We did not refuse it after this last conflagration, and we must continue to push forward as the leader for the moral well-being of the world as a whole.

That cash income of all Utah people rose from less than $150 million in 1932 to more than $700 million in 1947. And that is why I wonder, that is why I wonder--back in 1946 you said you wanted a change; and only a third of you-two-thirds of you stayed at home--only a third of you went to the polls, and you elected that awful 80th Congress.

I don't feel sorry for you about it at all."", ""I am trying to tell you what you are about to get, if you go to the polls again, and a half of you, or a third of you go to the polls again, and the rest of you don't vote. You will have something that will make the Western States sorrowful, because the sympathies of the Republican leadership don't come very far west of the Mississippi River. In fact, I think it stopped at the Mississippi River, and most of it stopped at the Appalachian Mountains."", 'This great increase in this income was not accidental. It was due to the plans and policies of the Democratic administrations to develop the western resources for the benefit of the western people themselves, not for the benefit of the few bloodsuckers who have offices in Wall Street.', 'The Republicans have fought bitterly against the Democratic program for soil conservation, reclamation, and irrigation.

I think you are not only going to vote for me, but you are going to vote for yourselves."", ""And when you do that, that will keep me from suffering from a housing shortage on January 20, 1949, and I won't have to move out of the White House."", 'It has been a very great privilege for me to be with you tonight.

Tonight I am going to name these forces, so that you will all know whom we are fighting.', 'First, let us see how this battle began. You here in the', 'West know a great deal about conserving natural resources, so that they will be useful to our children as well as to ourselves. You have learned by experience, and learned well.', 'What is the magic word in the prosperity of the farmers and the livestock men of this region? That word is water. The first thing the Mormon settlers did, when they came here, after giving thanks to God for a safe arrival, was to dig irrigation ditches. They knew what they were doing. So long as you have water enough for farming and grazing, the basis of your welfare is assured.', 'I think it is no exaggeration to say that as the water goes, so goes this part of the country.', 'Irrigation has given to the West a prosperous agriculture; it has brought thriving industries and enabled you to make use of your natural resources. With the aid of the Government, you have built the great dams that provide you with water and hydroelectric power.', 'Water for irrigation and electric power for homes and farms and industries have gone hand in hand.', 'It is fair to say that those who have helped you obtain the water and the power you need are your friends. And, by the same token, those who have hampered you in obtaining irrigation and electric power are your enemies, they are not your friends.', 'This is not a new battle. Selfish men have always tried to skim the cream from our natural resources to satisfy their own greed. And they have always sought to control the Government in order to accomplish this. Their instrument in this effort has always been the Republican Party.', ""The Republican administrations of our time have done their best to make the West [p.532] an economic colony of Wall Street. In the 1920's, under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, quick and greedy exploitation was the order of the day. Many parts of the West were withering--withering from the failure to develop its power and irrigation, withering actually from Republican sabotage."", 'Selfish men had control, and the great resources of the West were wasted with sinful disregard of the people.', 'Never before in history had so much been wasted by so few.', 'In some of the Western States the population had actually begun to decline, reversing the historic progress of western expansion. Hope began to disappear.', 'That was the situation in 1932 after 12 years of Republican rule. At that time there were only 28 reclamation projects in operation. Only 3 1/2 million acres of land were under irrigation, and much of the irrigation was pitifully inadequate. Power plant capacity was very small. There was no comprehensive program to give the West access to its water resources. That was the Republican way with the West.', 'The people of the West cried out for a change--and finally, at long last, there came a change. The birthright of the West was finally restored to the people. It was restored by the Democratic Party under the leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'The long, costly job of rebuilding after the ruinous Republican years was begun with hope and vigor. Conservation of the forests and grazing land, control of soil erosion, propagation of fish and wildlife, and other sound measures were put into effect.', 'Development of the river basins was begun, with full attention to hydroelectric power and flood control.', 'Today, after 4 Democratic administrations, there are some 60 reclamation projects completed or under way in the West. When these projects are finished they will provide water for over 10 million acres, and will produce over 5 million kilowatts of power.', ""That's the record the Democratic Party has made."", ""This record on western reclamation, the record of pledges made and kept, is one that Franklin Roosevelt was proud of--and I'm proud of that record, too."", 'As President, I shall never cease to fight for the public power and reclamation policies of the Democratic Party.', ""This is the time of year, every 4 years, when there are a lot of guessing games going on--guessing where some people stand. You have to guess, because some people won't come out in the open and tell you where they really stand."", ""Well, you don't have to do any guessing to know where the Democratic Party has stood for 16 years on public power and reclamation-and where it stands today. And you don't have to translate any double talk to know where I have always stood--and where I stand today."", 'I stand, and the Democratic Party stands, for rapid and uninterrupted development of the land and the forest and the water and the mineral resources of the West, in the interest of the people. I stand, and the Democratic Party stands, for building a strong western economy, based on full use of our natural resources and healthy development of industry. I stand for the rights of the people.', 'But where does the Republican Party stand ? Where do its candidates stand ?', 'The record is clear enough for all of you to see.', 'In the first place, we all know that low-cost electric power is of tremendous importance to the West. Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams brought about the establishment of a great aluminum industry in the Pacific Northwest.', 'A continuing increase in hydroelectric [p.533] power could bring other great industries to the West.', 'One of these is phosphate production. The West has enormous deposits of phosphate. Yet western farmers have to buy their phosphate fertilizer from processing plants 2,000 miles away--and they have to pay the heavy cost of the long haul to the West. This comes to as much as $60 a ton more than the farmers in the East have to pay. You have that prospect planned under any one of these great projects we are trying to build in the West.', 'It takes no great vision to see that phosphate fertilizer production is a natural industrial development for the West. All that is needed is a constant supply of low-cost electric power.', 'Then what stands in the way of more hydroelectric power for the West? The answer is: Republican policy.', 'For the last 2 years, that Republican 80th Congress, listening obediently to the voice of its masters, has sabotaged industrial development of the West.', 'And I want you to get this!', 'In 1947, at the first session of the 80th Congress, I requested an appropriation of $160,000,000 as the minimum necessary for the work of reclamation to continue on an economical basis. Here was the first test of the attitude of the Republican leadership toward the West in 14 years. The Republican-dominated House Appropriations Committee sliced nearly $90,000,000 off my request.', 'When that happened a great storm of protest arose over all the West. You made yourselves heard so loudly in Washington that you startled the Republican Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.', '""The West,"" he cried, ""is squealing like a stuck pig.""', 'There you have the Republican attitude toward the West summed up in a single phrase. ""The West is squealing like a stuck pig."" He squeals every time he has to make an appropriation in the public interest. The Republicans are ready to lead you to the slaughter, and they resent it if you protest.', 'This public pressure from the West eventually forced the reluctant 80th Congress to appropriate $104,000,000. But this sum was still more than $50,000,000 short of the amount needed to keep the work of reclamation going forward continuously.', 'Before the year ended, work on power and reclamation projects in the Columbia Basin and the Central Valley of California, on David Dam on the Lower Colorado, and on the Colorado-Big Thompson project had to be sharply curtailed. On some big jobs work had to stop.', 'At last, continued public pressure from the West--and constant pounding from me--compelled the Republican Congress to appropriate a supplemental amount in order to continue operations on these projects. They did it very reluctantly.', 'That is the Republican way, the way by which the West would soon be ""economized"" once again into stagnation.', ""This year, to step up the construction program to meet the expanding needs of all the West--I requested an appropriation of almost $285,000,000 for the reclamation program. That was the largest reclamation request in our history. I want you to understand that these are self-liquidating projects, they aren't giving you anything, they are merely advancing the money so that you can develop the country and pay it back."", 'The Republican 80th Congress realized that in this election year, it had better pay some attention to the West. It finally approved an appropriation $40,000,000 less than was needed to do the work. Even this appropriation was not aimed to benefit the people so much as to benefit the power interests.', 'While the Republican 80th Congress was considering this appropriation bill, highly paid lobbyists of the power interests poured into Washington. The influence of these agents of big business was plainly marked in the bill that passed the Congress.', 'The Republican 80th Congress wrote into that bill some clauses that strike a dangerous blow at people in the West.', 'Some of these clauses prohibit or slow down construction of new transmission lines and the extension of existing lines. You had better think that one over.', 'Ask yourselves a question: Who benefits from the building of dams if the Government does not also build transmission lines to carry the power from the dams to the people ? Who benefits? The private power interests benefit, of course--at your expense! These interests, for years, have sought to force the Government to sell them low-cost Federal power in bulk at the dam--power which they could then sell to the people on their own terms.', 'The measures passed by the Republican 80th Congress will result in bigger profits for the private power companies, and higher living costs for the people. Unless different action is taken in the next year, these measures will deprive consumers of cheaper power.', ""They will deprive the Government of 'power revenues from transmission and distribution-revenues which should be used to repay the costs of these power and reclamation projects."", 'This is a heavy and damaging blow to the development of the West.', 'You have been crudely and wickedly cheated by the power lobby in Washington, operating through the Republican 80th Congress. The facts are plain. The private power monopoly, in the last 2 years of Republican congressional reaction, has fought the people. It has won a battle that threatens to cost the people of the West hundreds of millions of dollars for years ahead.', 'The record is clear. Under the Democrats, you will get imagination, initiative, and progress. Under the Republicans you get strangulation.', 'You have a clear-cut choice in the election on November the 2d.', 'The Republican Party has shown in the Congress of the past 2 years that the leopard does not change his spots. It is still the party of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. It is still the party that gave you the phony Coolidge boom and the Hoover depression.', 'It is still the party whose money at election time comes from Wall Street. It is still the party which passes bills at the dictation of lobbies, and sacrifices the interests of the people for the profits of big business.', 'The Democratic Party is the party of the people. We are fighting with all our strength to prevent the gluttons of privilege from swallowing up the country. We are fighting the battle of the West, because it is the battle of all the country. We are fighting the battle of the farmer and the worker and the small businessman, because that is the battle of all the people.', 'Your Government is now planning the most ambitious irrigation development in all our history. The goal of our program is to bring every possible western acre under irrigation and to develop to the fullest extent the hydroelectric resources of this great region.', ""Now, I'm going to fight for this program with all I've got. Now, can I count on you?"", 'You have the decision to make.', 'A vote for the Republicans stops the program.', 'A vote for the Democrats is a vote for a glorious West with wealth and security for our people.', 'On election day, the plain people of the country need to roll up a wide tide of votes that will sweep the forces of fear and reaction out of the Government, and open the gates again for hope and progress. We must go forward together, toward the fulfillment of our American destiny--the use of all our resources for all our people.']"

The Democratic Party has always been the party that's interested in the welfare of the people as a whole. It's been the policy of the Republican Party to take care of the special interests. They are the special interest party.

That's not the principle of the Democratic Party."", ""The Democratic Party believes in the fundamental principles of the Constitution of the United States, which says that the people are the Government. And you are the Government when you exercise your franchise on election day--that is, the right to vote--when you go to the polls and pick the candidates who are going to represent you in your local offices and who are going to represent you in the Congress of the United States and the man who is going to be President for the next 4 years. You at that time are exercising a privilege that is the greatest privilege of your life. And, when you don't exercise that privilege, you usually get into trouble."", 'Look what happened to you in 1946 when most of you stayed at home. One-third of the voters in this United States in 1946 elected this Republican 80th Congress. Look what you got. Look what they did to you.', ""A little later on in the day I'm going to elaborate on that and tell you just exactly how they did it and why they did it.

You have got to decide whether you want to continue with a bunch of people in control of the Government who want to turn the clock back, or whether you want to go forward with people who have your interest at heart.', 'You have that choice on November the 2d. If you want to send another 80th Republican ""do-nothing"" Congress back to Washington, that will be your affair. It will cost you. I am asking you not to do that.', 'I have been talking about that Republican 80th Congress and the Republican Party all over this country, and I want to explain to you just how the Republican Party, through that 80th Congress, failed to act in the public interest.', 'The Congress elected in 1946--and elected by only a third of the voters--had 245 Republicans and 188 Democrats in the House, and 51 Republicans and 45 Democrats in the Senate. Now bear these figures in mind. That meant a lot of changes in the operation of the Congress. It put the Republicans in as presiding officers of the House of Representatives and of the Senate. It put Republicans in as chairmen of every committee in the Congress--both House and Senate. That is of vital importance. That is control of the Congress. Committees in Congress do the basic work of the Congress. Practically nothing can be voted on by the House or the Senate unless it is first approved by a committee.', ""About the only thing you can vote on in the Senate--and I was there for 10 years-without a committee's approval is a motion to adjourn. The chairmen control all the committees and have the whip hand as to what subjects the committees can take up."", 'In the 80th Congress the chairmen were the Republicans who have been in Congress for the longest period of time. They are a bunch of old mossbacks. They are living back in 1890, and they tried to make that Congress act like 1890--and I think they succeeded pretty well.', 'These chairmen, together with the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, decide what Congress shall do.', ""Now, I can't tell Congress what to do. I can only point out to the Congress what needs to be done."", 'For example, I asked the Congress to do something about inflation. I set out specific plans to control high prices. Democratic Congressmen introduced specific bills to accomplish what I had in mind, but in the House of Representatives, the chairman of the committee that handles such things would not even let the committee vote on the bill which I urged.', 'The same sort of thing happened on housing. The committee chairmen and the Speaker of the House of Representatives acted together to prevent the whole House of Representatives from voting on the housing bill which I wanted, and which they admitted most of the Representatives would have voted for.', 'There is a funny thing in connection with that housing bill. That bill was introduced way back about 4 1/2 years ago in the Senate, and it was called the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. That bill passed the Senate, but it died in the House. Then the bill was reintroduced in 1947 in the Senate, and it was introduced as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill--a little change in the way the names were set up, you see.', 'Mr. Taft was the leading man on that bill. That bill passed the Senate, and I sent a special message to the House of Representatives, to the Speaker of the House himself, requesting that the House be allowed to vote on that Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill.', ""The chairman of that committee roosted on that bill and would not let it come out of committee--would not even let the committee vote on it. The committee did finally vote on it--two forward-looking Republicans voted with the Democrats and the bill was reported out; but it couldn't pass the House for the simple reason that the Rules Committee of the House kept that bill from coming out. When it finally came to the conclusion, Mr. Taft ran out on his own Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. He joined with the reactionaries and kept that bill from being acted upon. I think he is going to rue the day he did that, too."", 'Now, this is what I mean when I talk about the Republican Party and Congress. I mean men who control the Republican Party and Congress. I am here to tell you that there are a lot of good individual Republicans who are willing to look forward and vote with the Democrats on fundamental issues. But the leaders of the Republican Party are living back in 1890. I want you to bear that in mind when you go to the polls.', ""If the people in this country elect a Republican President and Vice President as well as a Republican Congress, they will have the same committee chairmen back in the same jobs in Congress and doing the same things that they are doing now. There won't be any change in the complexion of that Congress, if you send Republicans back as a majority in Congress."", 'A vote for the Republican ticket this year will not give you any change in that respect. You will still have that sort of a ""do-nothing,"" backward-looking Congress. It will give you the same kind of Congress as the 80th Congress was. It will give you more of the Wolcotts and Tabers, Aliens and Martins--those men who roost on progressive legislation that should have been passed by the Congress.', 'If any body in this campaign wants a change, I am the one who wants that change. I want a change from a Republican to a Democratic Congress. I want a Congress to vote along with me--to vote for the people. I want you to send to Congress Congressmen that I can work with. I want you to vote for Congressman Baring from this district. He knows his way around Washington.

Last night from Salt Lake City I outlined some principles on public power and public power transmission lines, and those policies are the policies of the Democratic Party, and have been ever since the Democratic Party took control of the Government back in 1932.', 'It has been our policy to develop these great valleys in the country, and to develop these valleys in the interest of the people. These investments--they are not loans, they are not gifts--these investments in the control of the water resources of this part of the world are for the benefit of the people in this part of the territory; and when these water resources are used for power purposes, the people ought to be able to obtain that power at the same cost that it comes from the dams.', 'I don\'t think anybody ought to share in your investment, for that is what it amounts to. This Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress tried to choke you to death in this valley by cutting off appropriations that would have provided for public power lines so that power could be brought to these municipalities who want to buy direct from the Government. They did that with malice aforethought.', 'You see, the 80th Congress is a special interest Congress, and it represents the Republican Party; and the Republican Party always has been a special interest party.', ""If you have your own best interests at heart, on election day, November the 2d, you will make it a point to turn out and vote. In 1946 a third of you did not vote and you got this special interest controlled Congress, and you got just what you deserved because you did not go and exercise your franchise. And you will get it again if you don't do it this time--and I won't feel a bit sorry for you."", ""I sincerely hope that all of you will bear that in mind. The most important thing in this country is the free ballot. You are the Government. The people of the United States are the Government, but when you don't exercise the privilege you have as a citizen, and if you get bad government, then you haven't anybody else to blame for it."", ""So don't forget that on November the 2d, if you believe that the paramount issue in this campaign is the special interests against the people, you will go and vote the straight Democratic ticket, and save the country."", 'That is what I hope you will do.

The effort of your Federal Government to keep the resources and the development of America free from the grasp of monopoly are being attacked now as radical and un-American.

Here the Federal Government is investing--investing, not spending or lending--it's making an investment, which will be returned to the taxpayers, of about $20 million a year in reclamation and power projects. We're making this investment for the benefit of the people of the Central Valley, and not for the benefit of the speculators and monopolists."", ""The Republican 80th Congress slashed at this Federal investment. It tried to cut the 1948 appropriations for reclamation projects more than half.

But the power monopoly wanted to get its hands on the distribution of this Government power. They are always out to do that if they get a chance.', 'The power monopoly wants to own the transmission lines which carry the power from Government dams to the users--rural cooperatives, industries, and towns. The monopoly wants the transmission lines so that it can charge what it likes for the power. The power companies want to take their cut out of the investment made by the Government for the benefit of the people.', ""The Republican Congress obeyed the orders of the power monopoly and refused to provide the money for public transmission lines. That not only affects the Central Valley of California; it affects the great Northwest, the Bonneville Dam, and the Grand Coulee Dam.

They did it with malice aforethought."", 'I know that the farmers and the businessmen and all the residents of the Central Valley feel the power shortage. You can blame the so-called leaders of the Republican Party who are obedient servants of big business.', 'The policy of my administration is to see that power developed on great reclamation projects is delivered to the people at the lowest possible cost, regardless of what the power monopolies want. All I ask of you is to look at what the real leaders of the Republican Party have done in an attempt to frustrate your growth.

What do you reckon these birds would have done with the public power and the public interests of this Government?"", 'I know what they would have done. They would have taken it all and it would have sent us back to 1890 or further. They want to turn the clock back. I want it to go forward. I believe this is the fundamental principle of American Government, and a fundamental reason for prosperity in America.', 'I intend to fight on this line no matter what the monopolists and their congressional henchmen may do about it.', ""You know where I stand. I would like you to try to find out where the opposition stands. You'll get a lot of double talk if they ever tell you anything.

I have been here on several occasions and you always have been cordial and good to me; and I appreciate it. I was here when the United Nations Charter was finally signed and delivered. I talked to the citizens of San Francisco at that time on that subject. I am proud of the opportunity which was afforded me as President of the United States on that occasion to take part in the birth of the organization which, I am confident, will one day bring a just and lasting peace to the world.', 'I have heard from time to time comments by well-meaning but misinformed Americans that the United Nations is not working. I think I can understand their concern. All of us have been disappointed in the slowness with which the world is settling down after World War II. However, I am firmly convinced that our progress toward peace is much faster than it would have been without the United Nations.', 'Let me recall for you briefly just what it was we had in mind when we set up the United Nations. The United Nations was established for three basic purposes. The first was to prevent future wars by creating a kind of economic condition throughout the world which is necessary for peace. The second purpose was to provide the kind of organization which would help countries settle their differences peacefully without shooting each other. The third purpose was to provide an organization by which the peace-loving countries could act collectively against threats to peace by an aggressive country.', 'Now that you have in mind the reasons why the United Nations was set up, let us look at the record of what it has accomplished. I am sure you will agree that the United Nations has proved its worth. It has been meeting all three purposes. I think we can hope for peace in the future.', 'When the United Nations was less than a year old, the Security Council was faced with the problem of Soviet troops invading the small and weak country of Iran located south of the Soviet Union in the Middle East. Action by the Security Council helped to persuade the Soviet Government to pull its troops out of Iran. Iran remained an independent country.', 'The Security Council of the United Nations protected the independence of two other small countries in the Middle East when it persuaded the British and French Governments to withdraw their troops from Syria and Lebanon.', ""Greece is still another small nation whose independence has been maintained with the aid of the United Nations. The United Nations has taken action against Greece's northern neighbors. Among other things it has sent a commission to Greece whose job it is to patrol and to make sure that Greece's neighbors do not invade that country again."", 'The Security Council of the United Nations secured a truce in the conflict between the Dutch and the Indonesians. A United Nations committee brought about an agreement between the Dutch and the Indonesians on a set of principles which are being used as a guide for the creation of a United States of Indonesia. This act alone involved the peace and security of almost 60 million people. The two new countries of India and Pakistan brought their dispute over Kashmir to the United Nations. The United Nations has not yet ended the dispute, but it has succeeded in keeping violence from breaking out into open war.', 'I have described only a few of the actions which the United Nations has taken since it was founded, but I am sure that those I have mentioned are evidence of the way in which the Security Council and the General Assembly are helping maintain peace in the world.', 'There are many other activities of the United Nations besides the General Assembly and the Security Council. There is the International Refugee Organization which is taking care of refugees in displaced persons camps in Europe. There is the International Trade Organization, which is working to increase the flow of trade among all countries. And there are still other organizations, like these two, connected with the United Nations which are successfully working to improve the welfare of all the peoples of the world.', 'Of course, looking back over the first 3 years of the United Nations, to ignore the problems which the Soviet tactics have caused would be foolish. I have never, for one moment, since I became President underestimated the multitude of the problems which the Soviet Union could cause if that country were unwilling to join with other nations in working for peace.', ""At the same time I am so firmly convinced that all the plain people in the world want peace, that I have never regarded the Soviet Union's present policies as insuperable obstacles to peace."", 'Twice in one generation the United States has had the opportunity to lead the countries of the world to peace.

It can be conclusively proven, if you study the various instances which I have cited since this campaign started.', 'It was my privilege to start out in Detroit, Mich., on Labor Day and I discussed there the tactics of this Republican 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress towards labor. I told the laboringmen exactly where they stood, and where they would stand if by any mischance the Republicans got complete control of the Government.', 'And I went to Des Moines and I discussed the farm problems with the citizens of Des Moines, and I told the farmers just exactly what this 80th Congress had done to them, and what they intended to do to them if they had the opportunity to control the whole Government.', 'Just yesterday, at Salt Lake City, Utah, I set out to this part of the world just exactly what that Republican Congress had tried to do to the people of the West. You ought to study that situation. It is your interest that is at stake. It is the interests of the whole country that are at stake. It means that if you get Republican control of this Government, you might just as well turn it over to the special interests, and we will start on a boom and bust cycle, just like we did in 1920. We will end up with a crash which in the long run will do nobody any good but the Communists.', ""The situation is a grave one, and I am asking you to face it and face it realistically. Think of your own interests when you go to the polls on the 2d of November. You will not only vote for me but you should vote for yourselves. Vote for your own interests. Vote for the interests of the laboringman-vote for the interests of the farmer--vote for the interests of the white-collar worker--vote for the interests of the little businessman-vote for the interests of California--vote for the interests of the Nation as a whole, and you can't help but elect a Democratic Congress with a Democratic President."", ""I could stand here all evening and go over all the fundamental issues of this campaign and point out to you just where your interests lie, but I will tell you what you will do.

You have already been hurt by the failure of this same Republican Congress to take suitable action to meet the housing shortage and the crisis in education. You have been hurt by many other failures of the Republican leadership.', 'Here in the Oakland area, you have a serious housing shortage. You need more housing at lower prices--prices which families of moderate means, particularly veterans, can afford to pay.', ""You also desperately need low-cost rental housing so that the thousands of families living here in temporary dwellings can be taken care of. If the Republicans have their way, you'll live in those temporary dwellings for the next 20 years."", 'In July 1948 I called the Congress into session and asked it to pass the Taft-Eliender-Wagner bill, which would have given us more housing at lower prices and at lower rents.', ""The bill was bitterly opposed by the housing lobby. They've got one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington that's ever been there in the history of the country. The Republican leadership had a choice to make between the interests of the housing lobby and the interests of the people."", 'They chose to go along with the housing lobby. Even Senator Taft ran out on his own bill--and voted against it. One of the most remarkable things that ever happened in the history of the Congress.', 'The same thing happened to my plea to the Congress to pass the Federal aid to education bill. Our schools are badly overcrowded and our teachers are underpaid.', ""There isn't a city or county in the country that isn't short of schoolhouse room and short of teachers. Most of the teachers in the big cities are teaching two and three times as many children as they can possibly do successfully. This same thing happened to that plea. The Republican Congress didn't do anything about it."", 'The Republican Congress refused to come to the aid of the people.', 'The most significant thing about the failures of this Republican Congress is that they show so clearly the attitude of the special interests who dominate the national Republican Party. Their actions set a definite, clear pattern. And that means a lot to your future.', 'Above and beyond the problems that affect all our people, you folks here have a vital interest in this election, because it involves the question of what happens to the water supply of California. That is a matter of life and death to Californians, and particularly to all those who are affected by the welfare of the Central Valley--and I think all of California is affected by the welfare of that valley.', 'With the Sacramento River flowing down from the north, and the San Joaquin flowing up from the south, this great valley stretches 500 miles from above Redding to below Bakers field. It is a vast inland empire, richly blessed by Nature with millions of acres of fertile soil.', 'Already the Central Valley has become one of the richest agricultural regions in the world. It has the richest county in the world, the Central Valley has. And it has millions of acres still lying idle with vast possibilities for further development.', 'But the life of this valley depends on bringing water to the land. That is the limiting factor in the fabulous things that can be done in the Central Valley--water. Water--all the West is interested in water.', ""The water resources in the valley are limited. Unless they are used boldly, millions of California's fertile acres will continue to lie barren. As a matter of fact, unless your water is conserved wisely, the farms and towns you have already built here are in danger of withering away."", 'What does this have to do with politics in a national election? Well, I think most of you already know.', 'If all the great riches of the Central Valley are to be put to use, there must be unified development of its resources--the water and the land--and the wisest use of water for irrigation and power. This calls for great engineering structures--dams, canals, and transmission lines. The job is so big that only the Federal Government can handle it.', ""I'm glad the Federal Government can handle it. I rejoice, when I consider how the people of our country have joined their strength together to build our great reclamation projects--projects so big they stir our imagination."", ""These reclamation projects are good for all the Nation, not merely just one section. The money they cost is invested--not spent. A lot of these fellows would lead you to believe that they're making a donation to you, when they're making a reclamation appropriation. It isn't doing any such thing. It's an investment, because that money goes back to the Treasury, eventually. The Government gets its money back and our national strength and resources are increased at the same time."", 'If we can keep to the present schedule, the Central Valley project now being constructed will, by 1951, bring under irrigation more than half a million acres of land now dry, and will bring more water to another half million acres now being irrigated. The project is already pouring 300,000 kilowatts of power into the lines in California, and within a year will add another 150,000 kilowatts.', 'These are big figures, and they stand for big increases in the economic strength of California and the Nation. But can we do it?', ""But big as this project is, and big as the Folsom Dam is going to be, they are only a good start toward what's needed in the Central Valley."", 'California--and the whole country--need the additional agricultural production we can get from more irrigated land. California-and the Nation--need more electric power.', 'And we can get it.', 'The severe drought and the ""brownout"" of the past winter in California have shown how urgently we need to go ahead to build more dams, more irrigation canals, more power capacity, and more transmission lines.', 'I have had the experts preparing plans along these lines. They have come up with plans which look ahead to the time when all the water in the Central Valley that can possibly be controlled will be put to use. These plans will permit us eventually to double the present irrigated area of the Central Valley, and much more than double the power output in the valley.', 'To my mind, these plans have the vision, the foresight, and the imagination to match the dramatic growth and promise of this great State.', ""But it isn't enough just to have good plans. There must be will and determination to put the plans into operation."", 'You know the Democratic Party has that will and determination. The record proves it. It was the Democratic Party that saw the possibilities in the Central Valley project. It was the Democratic Party that put the resources of the Federal Government behind it. It was the Democratic Party that started big reclamation projects all over the West--in the Columbia Basin, the Missouri, and the Colorado.', ""You can count on the Democratic Party to support the Central Valley project, and to see it through to its conclusion. But you can't count on the Republican leaders to go ahead with the full development of any of these projects in Central Valley, or anywhere else."", ""You know how the Republican 80th Congress has delayed construction work already started on this great project. Apparently they don't even want to finish the work that's already begun. Obviously you can't count on them to go ahead on the bigger job that isn't yet started!"", 'The reason for the opposition of the Republican leaders is plain.', ""The big business interests in the East who control the Republican Party don't believe in reclamation projects in the West. They don't see how it does them any good to spend Federal money for that purpose, so they're against it. They are willing for the projects to be constructed--provided they can get a rake-off in distributing the power produced at the dams. They don't want power from which they themselves don't get profit."", ""That's what you can expect from the special interest Republicans--fewer and smaller reclamation projects for irrigation and power, with the power that is produced being turned over to private monopolies. That is their record--that is their record!"", ""The 80th Congress showed the attitude of the real rulers of the Republican Party on this question, as it did on so many others. They hurt you and they hurt this great Central Valley. They gave you a sample of what you could expect if both the administration and the Congress were controlled by the Republicans. You would be in some fix, if you hadn't had somebody at the door to fight these battles."", ""And they brought up these reclamation and power projects by way of the back door. They didn't do it openly and aboveboard. That Republican 80th Congress cut the 1948 appropriation for the Central Valley in half. Only when construction actually had to be halted on several phases of the project, could those Republican leaders be persuaded to restore the funds to prevent further loss of time and money."", 'It was all I could do to wring from the reluctant reactionaries the consent to carry on this great project. What hope would there be of getting the Republicans to approve the vast new works that are still needed to be undertaken ?', 'In the Central Valley the people have also felt first-hand the results of the influence that private power lobby wielded so successfully with this Republican Congress. Time and again the Congress refused to appropriate money to build public transmission lines to distribute the power now available at Shasta Dam. Why was that? Because the private power crowd wants to buy the power at the dam at a low price and sell it to the consumers at a high price, and you would pay the bill.', 'This private power crowd is the same shortsighted group whose restrictive practices were responsible for the ""brownout"" that caused you so much trouble last winter.', ""You can't get the benefit of low-cost power by dealing with outfits like that. The private power lobby is holding you up and the Republican controlled Congress is helping to do it."", 'I see no reason why you should let a monopoly, which is run only for private profit, obstruct the progress and the economic advancement of this whole great State of California.', 'I see no reason why you should suffer a ""brownout"" to gratify the greed of corporate monopoly. Nor do I see any reason why you should have to keep on getting up an hour earlier every day, when all the rest of the United States is going off daylight saving time this fall. It wouldn\'t happen if it weren\'t for these greedy fellows.', 'But the Republicans who control the Appropriations Committee and other committees of Congress think otherwise.', 'Cheap and plentiful public power is of so little importance to them, as compared with increasing the profits of their corporate friends, that they will let you have the ""brownout"" and the early daylight, and everything else.', 'The Republicans who control the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, on which the future of this great project depends, are not Californians.', 'They are not Westerners.', 'They are Eastern Republicans.', 'They belong to the dominant element of the Republican Party.', 'They are so dominated by the private power lobby that they are willing to cut off the hopes of the West for progress and industrial growth. That is typical of their limited vision.', 'The election of a Republican administration in November would not change this situation one little bit. The same men with the same backward ideas would continue their stranglehold on the appropriations for the Central Valley projects--and all the other great projects throughout the West.', 'The only way to get them out of this position is to elect a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.', ""You've got a good man right here in Buell Gallagher. And if you prefer to keep that backward fellow in there, instead of electing a good man like this, you ought to get what you deserve. If you elect a Congress that is working in the public interest, we'll get these projects through."", 'With a majority of Democrats in Congress, these Eastern Republican mossbacks will be removed from their chairmanships on the first day of the new Congress.', ""You know what happened in 1946. Twothirds of you stayed at home. You didn't think it was worthwhile to go out and vote. The facts of the case are that all of you had jobs, all of you had good incomes. You didn't think it made any difference who ran the Government. So you elected that Republican 80th Congress. And the people who got the chairmanships in the House and the Senate were the old mossbacks who are living in 1898, and they're trying to run the Government on the 1898 basis. If you want that, you ought to send them back."", 'Now, if you do the right thing, these fellows will be replaced by representatives of the Democratic Party, whose record is on the right side of the ledger, and whose plans for the future stand for speedy, vigorous development of the economy of the West.', 'These are simple facts of American political life.', 'In this election the future development of California--indeed, of our whole country-is at stake.', 'If you want a Government dedicated to the development of the resources of this great State and this Nation, in keeping with their rapid growth and glorious future, it is in your power to get it.', 'I am going to continue to fight to achieve this goal with everything I have.', ""And if you honestly believe in the welfare of the people, and will do your duty on the 2d of November, I'll accomplish that purpose. But if you're going to stay at home, because the national income of this country is the biggest it's ever been in history, and because 61,000,000 of you have jobs, and because the farmers have the greatest income they've ever had in history--if you're going to stay at home and let nature take its course, you'll get just exactly what you deserve. I don't believe you're going to do that. I think you're going to turn out on election day, and you're going to turn out these backward looking fellows and put in some people who know where they are going--and they will be people who are going to work in the public interest--and that means you're going to vote a straight Democratic ticket on the 2d of November.""]"

Your interest, of course, is agricultural, and the party that has been interested in agriculture and that has made it possible for the farmers to have the greatest income they ever had in their history is the Democratic Party. I don't think the Republicans ever did anything specific for the farmer. If they did, it was by accident and not intention."", 'You remember the old Farm Board. Well, as soon as the Democrats took over, after everybody was broke and all the farmers in the country were being foreclosed, it was necessary for the Democrats to do something to save the farms for the farmers.', 'In 1932 there were 123,000 farms foreclosed. Do you know how many were foreclosed last year? Just about 800.', 'The farm debt has been reduced 50 percent. The farm income is the greatest ever in the history of this country; and the farmers have $18 billion on deposit in the banks.', 'Now that was not an accident. That happened because the policy of the Democratic Party is to see that the national income is equitably distributed, to see that the workingman, the farmer, the small businessman and the white-collar man gets his fair share of the national income.', 'The Republican policy is to let the big fellows get the big incomes, and let a little of it trickle down off the table like the crumbs fell to Lazarus.', ""That is not the policy of the Democratic Party at all.

I didn't claim any exemption on account of that farm, nor did I claim any exemption for being 33 years old. I went over and joined a battery of field artillery. There are a few fellows on this train that have been with me in that division. I am not bragging about that because that is just what I ought to have done, but I wanted to impress upon you that I know something about the farm situation."", ""In that day and age we had no Federal Government interested in the farmer.

Do you know how many were kicked off their farms last year who couldn't pay their debts? lust 800! That's some difference--that's some difference!"", 'Do you know what caused that difference? Because the Government of the United States became interested in the farmer and the workingman, and the white-collar man, and the little businessman.', 'Well, along in 1946 the farmers were all fat and rich, and had money in the bank, and they turned almost economic royalists and they didn\'t go and vote. That let the country become entangled under this Republican 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress. The first thing that happened to them--that Congress began immediately to cut the ground from under the farmer, and they have almost succeeded in doing it. They have made it impossible for the Commodity Credit Corporation to furnish storage for those crops under the support price, and that was done with malice aforethought, because that Republican Congress does not believe in price support.', ""I wonder where you raisin fellows would be out here in the valley if it weren't for the farm policy of the Democratic Party?

We want the clock to go forward, and if you want to go forward--if you want to go with the forward-looking people--go forward with the Democratic Party, and I claim that the Democratic Party is the forward-looking party in this United States, and that the Democratic Party has the interests of the farmer and the laborer and the white-collar man and the little businessman at heart. The Republican Party has always represented special interests, and I think they still represent special interests."", 'You can\'t afford to have that. The way to overcome that is to do your duty on election day. In 1946 you didn\'t do your duty on election day. Two-thirds of you stayed at home.

I am vitally interested in the welfare of the Central Valley of California because if the affairs of the Central Valley of California are settled in the public interest, it not only helps the great State of California, but it helps the whole United States. Not only does it help the whole United States, but it helps the world.', ""The situation is such that if you don't watch your p's and q's, your valley is liable to be ruined. For years and years we have been endeavoring to implement a policy of water and power in this valley that would save it, due to the water table in this end of the valley going down. In order to do that, we have got to have people in the Congress and in the Government who are interested in the welfare of the people."", 'You have had a sample of how the Republicans act when they get control of the Government.', ""Two-thirds of you stayed at home in 1946 and didn't vote, and you got a Congress that began to work for the special interests. That Congress did its level best to cut out the reclamation projects of the West. I made a terrific fight and got some of them restored-- -not all of them."", 'I am particularly anxious to see that the proper development is made here in this valley. It can be done.', ""The Democrats have created a plan for this Valley which not only will give more water to the acreage now under cultivation, but it will create a situation where we can put more acreage under cultivation in this valley and that's what you want."", 'The Democratic Party, as soon as it got into power in 1933, inaugurated a farm program which was in the interests of the farmers. The first thing the Republicans did when they got into power was to make an attempt to sabotage that farm program of the Government. Their first effort to do that was when they cut off the reclamation appropriations for this part of the world.', ""Now, that's a shining example of what's likely to happen to you if you put these people in complete control of the Government."", ""One of the things that has saved the farmer has been the price support program. That price support program was inaugurated by a Democratic administration, it's been administered by a Democratic administration, and if you continue the Democrats in power, it will continue to exist."", ""I have an idea that the Republicans are not interested in the price support 'program except from a selfish motive."", 'Mr. Stassen made a statement in Albany in New York in which he made the statement that the farm price support program should be revised. Now, this is an editorial from the Wall Street Journal, a Republican paper, and this is what this Wall Street Journal has to say about the price support program--and the Wall Street Journal is a wholehearted supporter, both financially and editorially, of the Republican campaign. This is the editorial, and it comes from a column called ""Progress of the Week.""', 'Now, I\'m going to quote from the editorial now: ""Nevertheless, the whole import of Mr. Stassen\'s press conference at Albany was just what Secretary Brannan said it was.""', 'Now, this is what Secretary Brannan said: ""In essence an attack on the price support system. Mr. Stassen is, in fact, proposing a far-reaching reform of the farm price support policy or he doesn\'t make sense.""

That is, the farmer should get his share, the laboringman should get his share, the white-collar man should get his, and the small businessman should get his.', ""They don't like that, and this last 80th Republican Congress conclusively proved that when they get control of any part of the Government they work only for special interests."", ""Now, it's in your interest to see that that party which has the interest of the people at heart is in control of the Government. In order to get that done, on November 2d you should go to the polls and vote a straight Democratic ticket, and then you won't have any trouble."", ""If you'll do that I won't have any trouble with the housing shortage, which I am going to talk about in Los Angeles tonight."", '[7.] BURBANK, CALIFORNIA (4:25 p.m.)', 'Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that introduction.', 'What a crowd!

And I am convinced of one thing: the American people are sold on the idea that nobody deserves to win a championship fight by running away. I do not believe that anybody is going to win this fight by running away from the record or ducking the issues.', 'In our system, the people have a right to know exactly what our two major parties stand for on specific issues. They have a right to know who is for them and who is against them.', 'The decisive battle has arrived. The people are going to have to choose one side or the other. The Democratic Party and I have nothing to conceal. We are proud of our record. The underlying struggle in this campaign is a struggle between two sets of ideals.', 'The Democratic ideal of America is summed up in the Four Freedoms: Freedom from Want; Freedom from Fear; Freedom of Worship; and Freedom of Speech.', 'The Republican ideal, as I have seen it in action, is summed up in one phrase, ""Big business first.""', 'Today, I regret to say certain great business interests are trying to corrupt the American idealism. With the Republican Party as their instrument, they are waging a war against the aspirations of our people.', 'These shrewd men aim to take advantage of the prosperity which you have attained in the last few years with Democratic government. They know that in the throes of prosperity, voters are not easily excited. They hope that this year a large number of voters will not bother to go to the polls. That is their only chance of winning. Some of their franker spokesmen have said in so many words that they are counting on a light vote on election day.', 'With that in mind, they are trying their best to avoid any suggestion that there is something to fight about in this campaign. They are trying to lull you to sleep with ""high-level"" platitudes. They are saying in effect: ""Everything is all right, everything will go on being all right, if you will just forget about politics and leave things to us.""', 'I wish from the bottom of my heart that that were true. I wish from the heart that it were possible to say to the American people, with sincerity, that it does not make any difference which party they elect this year, that everything will be all right, no matter what happens.', 'But that is not true. As President of the United States, I know that everything will not be all right, unless the American people exercise care and vigilance to. keep the gains which they have won. These past 2 years have shown us evidence--frightening evidence-that if the country falls into the hands of the leaders of the Republican Party, everything is likely to be all wrong within a very short time.', 'We in this country know how abruptly conditions can change. Just 20 years ago the Republicans were assuring us that everything was going to be all right. But a few months later everything was all wrong. And everything stayed all wrong, until the American public elected Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'No one can deny that this country has benefited from Democratic administrations. It is the Democratic Party that has been working for the people for the past 16 years, and getting results for them. It is the Democratic Party that ended discouragement and fear under the Republicans, and opened the gate to a new era of prosperity in this country.', 'Farmers, workers, homeowners, small businessmen--every American has reason to remember the constructive work of the Democratic administrations since 1933: social security; the farm program; collective bargaining; the minimum wage law; slum clearance; low-rent housing; TVA; soil conservation; reclamation and irrigation projects; full employment; world leadership; the highest standards of living in the history of the world.', 'You can sum up in these few words an era of progress with Democratic administrations which believed in the people and worked for the people.', 'But these are things that happened in the past. And you and I, and all of us, are concerned with what is happening now and what will happen in the days immediately ahead.', ""I don't expect the American people to vote my way just because the Democratic Party served them well after the Republican Party had let them down. But I do expect the American people to wake up and realize right now, this very instant, their standard of living and their hopes for the future are at stake."", ""I'm not going to use high-sounding words. I speak plainly and directly. I am going to use hard facts. The people of California and of the entire Nation are entitled to the facts."", ""We'll start with some hard facts about housing."", 'This is a great and growing city.', 'People are pouring into it every day. But the supply of houses is pitifully inadequate. Why? The real estate lobby and the Republican Party in Congress have seen to that.', 'Eight years ago, only 5 percent of the houses sold in Los Angeles cost under $3,500. Today only 1 out of 30 sells for so little--if you can find it.', 'Eight years ago, only 5 percent of the houses sold in Los Angeles cost over $10,000. Today, 50 percent cost over $10,000--again, if you have one--if you have the $10,000, and can find the house.', ""Many people can't find a house at any price. Many are doubling up with other families. Thousands of citizens in this city are forced to live in trailers and unsanitary shacks."", 'The Democratic administration knows that not all families can afford to buy their own homes at a price that yields a profit to the bankers and builders. We know that many families, particularly young veterans, need low-rent housing, which requires Federal support.', 'Almost 3 years ago, after long and exhaustive study, the Wagner-Ellender-Taft housing bill was introduced in the Congress. This represented a long-range program to provide the 15 million new homes we shall need. Among other things, it provided for slum clearance, rural housing, and low-rent housing projects.', 'Time and again I urged the passage of that bill. But it was opposed by a million-dollar real-estate lobby in Washington. It passed the Senate, only to be killed in the House of Representatives.', 'Last year the same bill was introduced again. Again it passed the Senate. It was murdered by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, by some of the ugliest trickery in the history of the Congress.', 'Last July, because the need for housing was so desperate, I called a special session of the 80th Congress. Since the Republican National Convention had specifically endorsed slum-clearance and low-rental housing in its platform, I hoped that we could finally get some action.', 'But the real-estate lobby was still at work, And again the Republican Congress obeyed the voice of its masters. The House Republicans blocked the bill. The Republican head of a powerful committee in the House used his power to refuse to let the House of Representatives vote on public housing.', 'The fight went into the Senate. What happened there? Senator Taft of Ohio, who had helped to sponsor the original measure, actually took the lead in fighting his own bill, and voted against it.', 'By their votes ye shall know them!', 'These are hard facts. These facts tell you as plain as day what Republican leaders are doing to you right now, and what they will do to you ten times over if they get full control of your Government.', 'These facts tell you, too, how little faith you can have in Republican platform promises and campaign promises.', ""Let's look at some more hard facts. Facts about social security, for example. In 1944 the Republican Party spoke out boldly for extending social security. That was a fine platform promise. But what happened ?"", ""The Republican Both Congress actually passed a law, not to extend social security, but to take social security away from hundreds of thousands of American workers. That's the way they kept their promises. I vetoed this measure. Ninety-eight percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to override my veto."", ""Let's look at the facts about health legislation. You know how hard it is to find a room in a hospital. You know how hard it is to pay the bills, when sickness hits your family."", 'We worked out a painstaking plan for national medical care. It was designed to meet the medical needs of the American people. It provided for new hospitals, clinics, health centers, research, and a system of national health insurance.', 'Who opposed it? The well-organized medical lobby. Who killed it? The Republican 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress.', 'After the Republicans had killed the bill as a whole, we still tried to pass parts of it. The Republican Party in Congress had become a little uneasy by that time. They were not quite sure how the people would like what they were doing. So they tried to make their record on health legislation look a little better.', 'They passed a dental research bill. But having done that, they failed to provide any money to carry it out.', 'Then these Republican so-called ""representatives of the people"" passed a bill to conduct research in heart disease. That\'s an important thing for this country, for as you know, heart disease is on the increase. On the basis of the best advice, I recommended nearly $7 million as the minimum requirement. But the Republican Congress cut the appropriation to a mere half-million dollars, only 1/14 of what was needed.', ""Everywhere you look, it's the same story."", 'I asked for aid to education for the benefit of the children of this country. No action by the Republican 80th Congress.', 'I asked for a curb on inflation. No action by the Republican Congress.', 'The story of the fight on inflation is especially revealing. When I called the Congress into special session this summer, I urged it to deal with the high cost of living. The Republican leadership replied that this was a political maneuver on my part in an election year.', ""Let's nail that one right now. The Republicans know perfectly well that I had previously called a special session of the Republican Both Congress in November 1947 to deal with inflation and the high cost of living. And 1947 was not an election year."", 'When I called the special session for the same purpose in 1948, it was because the Congress had failed to act for the preceding year and a half.', 'The dangers of inflation are continuing to grow. The cost of living is continuing to rise. The Republicans cannot conceal their responsibility by hurling charges of ""politics"" at me.', 'There is no great mystery about how to stop the cost of living from going higher and higher. The best way to stop it is with price control. Everybody knows that when we had price control the average family was not gouged by inflated prices.', 'Everybody knows that rents under price control have not skyrocketed. But meat, and other foods, and automobiles and building materials, without price control have gone up and up and up.', 'These are the facts. I have been urging price control, because it is a realistic way, a tested way, of holding down the cost of living. A program that does not include price control will not, and cannot, hold down the cost of living. We have learned that from hard experience.', 'Instead of dealing vigorously with inflation, the Republican leadership preferred to try to make a political issue of it.', 'They blame Government expenditures for the rising cost of living. The fact is, that the Government expenditures were vastly greater during the war than they are now, and yet we stabilized the cost of living.', 'They blame the foreign aid program for the rising cost of living. During the war we shipped far more goods and supplies overseas than we are shipping now, and yet we stabilized the cost of living.', 'These are the hard facts that you voters will want to bear in mind, when you go to the polls on election day. These are the facts that make this election a decisive battle in the life of our country. These are the facts which show that this is a critical struggle between the forward forces of liberalism and the backward forces of reaction.', 'While I am talking about the forces of progressive liberalism, I want to add a word to all the people of California who believe in liberal ideas.', 'You, like Americans everywhere today, are disturbed about the threat to peace and the failures of the 80th Congress to deal with basic economic problems here at home.', 'Most of the people realize that the Democratic administration is doing everything that can be done to preserve the peace. And they realize that the Democratic administration is eager to put an end to the reactionary policies of the 80th Congress.', 'There are, however, some people with true liberal convictions, whose worry over the state of the world has caused them to lean toward a third party.', 'To these liberals I would say in all sincerity: Think again.', 'The fact that the Communists are guiding and using the third party shows that this party does not represent American ideals.', 'But there is another and very practical reason why it is folly for any liberal to put his hope in this third party.', 'The third party has no power in the Government and no chance of achieving power. The simple fact is that the third party cannot achieve peace, because it is powerless. It cannot achieve better conditions here at home, because it is powerless.', 'The Democratic Party is the party which truly expresses the hopes of American liberals, and which has power to fulfill those hopes. We have worked for peace in a difficult international situation, and we shall continue with all our strength to work for peace.', 'We have worked for the improvement of the conditions here at home--to curb inflation, to provide low-rent housing, give aid to education, extend civil rights, and scores of other ways.', 'I shall continue to work for these goals with all my strength.', 'A vote for the third party can only weaken the efforts of the Democratic Party to build a healthy nation and a peaceful world.', 'A vote for the third party plays into the hands of the Republican forces of reaction, whose aims are directly opposed to the aims of American liberalism.', 'A vote for the third party will not promote the cause of American liberalism; it will injure it.', ""I say to those disturbed liberals who have been sitting uncertainly on the outskirts of the third party: Think again. Don't waste your vote."", 'This is the hour for the liberal forces of America to unite. We have hopes to fulfill and goals to attain. Together we can rout the forces of reaction once again.', 'We are strong in faith and strong in energy. We must entrust our destiny to those who will safeguard our rights, our freedom, and our national honor.']"

In that platform, they stated that they were for certain things. When I called them back into session in July, what did they do? Nothing. Nothing.

When you go through this beautiful country, it almost makes you weep to think of what could be done if you just had the water to put on this land.', 'Now, if you will remember, when President Roosevelt was down here, he ordered this aqueduct to be built because it was necessary to furnish water not only to this part of California, but to keep the naval works and airplane factories going that were in San Diego. The first thing the Republicans did, as soon as they got into office, was to try to sabotage that great project, but we succeeded in getting it restored; and the Democrats--are now working on a plan which we hope will increase the water supply to this part of the country.', 'You are interested in housing.

The Democratic Party has always stood for the full development of the Nation's resources.

They want to keep it an economic colony of the East. They want to have these developments in the hands of special interests and big corporations so that they can skim the cream off your own labor. The Democratic Party does not believe in that sort of stuff. This is proved by the efforts of Republican leaders to cut the reclamation program by more than half. That program was saved from destruction by the Democrats in the Congress, and by the protests of you people in the West.', 'You know, they took a meat axe to my recommendation for reclamation in the West, and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee sent one of his Republican friends out here to see how much more he could take off; and he met some of his Republican friends out here and they raised so much fuss he was afraid to cut it any more and I succeeded in getting most of it restored.', 'You have got three choices before you in November.

You all know what the Democratic record has been in building up the West. In 1933 the Democrats took the reclamation program out of moth balls and put it into practice. This was because the American people had elected a president who believed in the West--Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'Today, reclamation projects irrigate 4 1/2 million acres of land and provide more than 3 million kilowatts of power.', 'You people in El Paso know how important these things are. Over $20 million has been spent on the Rio Grande project. Right here in your area, it irrigates 160,000 acres.', 'The Republicans have consistently fought this program for the development of the West. That is why I have been amazed in this campaign to hear spokesmen for the Republican Party claim that the Republican Party is a friend of reclamation. The record proves that that is not so. There is not a word of truth in that claim. The record shows that the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives cut the reclamation program for the West by more than 50 percent in 1948. You people here in the West rose up in anger at this slaughter.', 'Now, what do you suppose the Republican Chairman of the Appropriations Committee thought about your protests? ""Well,"" he said, ""the West is squealing like a stuck pig."" That is what the Republican leaders thought about you. That same Republican Chairman squeals himself every time he has to make an appropriation that would be helpful to this part of the world.', 'The Democrats in the Senate and in the House succeeded in restoring some of the necessary funds. Ninety-five percent of the Republicans in the House voted against providing the money I said was necessary for reclamation. Ninety-two percent of the Democrats voted for the restoration.', 'By their votes ye shall know them. That is the difference between the Republican and the Democratic attitude toward the West.', 'These are hard, cold facts. That is why I am amazed when I hear Republican campaign orators trying to take credit for a program that the Democrats had to save from the Republican meat axe.', 'That is just one example of what the Republicans tried to do to the West last year.', 'Now, what do you suppose they are planning to do if they gain complete control of the Government next year? Let me give you one example of that. Let me tell you about their plans for electric power, which is so vitally important to the continued growth and prosperity of all the West.', ""You know how public power from publicly constructed dams has helped bring new industries out here. The Republicans don't like to see cheap public power, because it means that the big power monopolies cannot get their rake-off at the expense of the public."", 'The Republican Congressman, who would be Chairman of the Committee on Public Works in the House of Representatives, if we get another Republican Congress, has just written a very revealing article for a magazine.

I can\'t give you the chapter and verse, and I am going to give you some quotes from it. If you want to read it in full, you can get it.

That is what it means.', 'Congressman Dondero goes on to say that our present laws, which let the Government build lines to get power from public dams to the users at the lowest possible rates, and I quote him again: ""can and should be changed by the next Congress.""', 'This ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress changed it by cutting off the money to build the powerlines.', 'Mr. Dondero says that he has every reason to believe that the Republican candidates will go along with this policy.', 'Listen to this, and I am still quoting from this article in this public utilities magazine: ""We Republicans are divided on many issues, but on this one issue, we are of one mind.""', 'Of course, they are of one mind. They want to give the big interests the control of the Government once more. That is only a start. They are trying to turn the clock back.', ""Why you know, in 1947 this country had an income of $217 billion--the greatest in the history of the country--of any country; and that income was distributed fairly to the farmers and the workingman and to small business, and everybody else got his fair share of that income. That is not what these Republicans want. They don't want a fair distribution. They want the special interests to have control, and let a little of it trickle down to you."", 'What Congressman Dondero means by this article, which was published only 2 weeks ago, is that Republicans believe that the benefits of low-cost power at the Federal dams should go to private utilities who will get the power cheap from the dam from the Government, and sell it to you at a high profit.', ""If that is public interest, then I don't belong in the Presidency."", ""I think that these facts give you people of the West a clear idea of how you ought to vote next November. You can vote for the party that will slow down--or maybe even stop--the construction of Federal reclamation and power projects; you can vote for the party which promises to give the benefits of Federal power to the private utility interests so they can get rich at your expense--the record proves that is what the Republican Party believes, and there isn't any question about it; or you can vote for the party which promises continued development of the West for the benefit of the whole country."", 'This is the party that believes that all the people, not just a few, should receive the benefits of low-cost public power. The record conclusively proves that this is what the Democrats believe. It is a record of action. You have men on this platform here with me who have contributed to the carrying out of that action for the Democratic Party.', 'When Speaker Rayburn was Speaker of the House of Representatives, he put his foot down on this special interest business, and he had to do it time and time again. I am hoping Sam will be the Speaker in the next Congress too.', 'If you stay away from the polls, as you did in 1946, you will get the same crew of men who tried to wreck, and did cripple the western resource program. I am confident that the citizens of Texas will study the record and vote for the best interests of themselves and the country.', 'I am hoping that they won\'t do like a great many people did in 1946. In 1946, in a great many States, people stayed away from the polls, and one-third of the voters elected this good-for-nothing, ""do-nothing"" Both Congress.', ""You know, a Congress is as its leaders direct, and the leaders of this Congress are Republicans--backward looking Republicans. There are a great many good men who want to go forward in that Congress but they haven't a chance so long as the publicans control it."", ""Now!--listen to me!

Our farmers would have had guaranteed markets, domestic and foreign, for billion-bushel wheat crops for a minimum of 5 years, at prices at least as good as those assured by our price support program.', ""The Wheat Agreement was submitted to the United States Senate to be ratified as a treaty. What happened to it? The Republican leadership of the Senate wouldn't even allow it to be brought up on the floor of the Senate for consideration."", ""The Republicans killed the International Wheat Agreement. That is how they love the farmers. This is the kind of treatment the farmer has been getting from the Republican Party, and that's the kind of treatment he can expect to keep on getting from that party. Don't you forget that, now, on election day."", 'Look at what they have been saying about cotton. The Republican press has been having a field day warning people that the Government may have to make a lot of cotton loans this year at a rate of around 30 cents a pound. They talk as if that is a bad thing to do. They use it as an argument against the whole support price program.', ""They don't tell you how cotton loans rescued the farmer from the mess of 1932, or how useful Government stocks were during World War Two. They don't tell you that the Truman administration set up a vigorous cotton export program at the end of the war and completely wiped out the last of the cotton surplus--the headache that had plagued farmers for a quarter of a century."", ""Yes, and we've still got a vigorous cotton export policy. Sam Rayburn can tell you about the $150,000,000 revolving fund that he finally pushed through a reluctant Congress in June. That fund will help us keep on using American cotton in the occupied areas of Germany and Japan."", ""As long as I have anything to say about it, we'll keep on knocking down trade barriers and opening up foreign markets for American cotton. And we will drive just as hard to hold and expand the home market, by improving the product, finding new uses, and cutting costs of production."", 'The Republicans tell you not to worry, while they threaten the Reciprocal Trade Agreements, not to worry while they refuse international cooperation through a wheat agreement, and not to worry while they attack your price supports.', 'This shows very clearly the real principle of the Republican Party. That is the ""trickle-down"" principle. Take care of the big boys and some of the money will trickle down to the little fellow.', ""That's just the opposite of the Democratic way. Our primary concern is for the little fellow. We think the big boys have always done very well, taking care of themselves, and they will always take care of themselves. It is the business of the Government to see that the little fellow gets a square deal."", ""As a matter of fact, I have nothing against the big boys until they get in the way of progress. You sometimes find one who wants the little fellow to get a break. But that is very seldom; you don't find them very often."", ""Ask Sam Rayburn how many of the big money boys helped, when he was sweating blood to get electricity for farmers and the people in the small towns. You know, Sam was one of the fathers of the Rural Electrification Administration. It's a great monument to him."", 'When he started working to get REA, you folks in Texas had electricity on very few farms--only on 23 farms in every thousand. Last year, over half of the farms in Texas had electricity. And we intend to push that program vigorously during the next 4 years.', ""That's an example of what I mean, when I say that the Democratic Party works for the people. And in this case, as in so many others, the Democratic Party did it over violent Republican opposition."", 'There have been six record votes in Congress on REA. In all but one of those record votes, only about 12 to 25 percent of the Republicans voted in favor of the REA. The vast majority of Republicans opposed REA, and the vast majority of Democrats supported it. The REA program owes its birth and its present life and vigor to the Democratic Party.', 'I am deeply concerned about what the Republicans would do to the rural electrification program, if they could get control of the whole Government. I know that the Republican Both Congress was not willing to bring low cost electric power to consumers that would stand in the way of the profits of the private power monopolies. And that power monopoly had one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington that ever came there.', ""I could go on and on about Republican failures. They've made enough mistakes to give me ammunition to talk from now to Christmas. But I don't want to wear out my welcome in Texas. After all, nothing I could say about the Republicans is half as bad as their record. In fact, it is because the Republican record is so bad that I am sure the Democrats will win this election."", 'I have a profound faith in the people of this country. I believe in their commonsense. They love freedom and that love for freedom and justice is not dead.', 'Our people believe today, as Jefferson did, that men were not born with saddles on their backs to be ridden by the privileged few.', 'We believe, as Jefferson did, that ""God who gave us life gave us liberty."" We protect our liberty against those who threaten it from abroad, and we do not propose to give it up to those who threaten it at home.', 'We will not give up our democratic way to a dictatorship of the left; neither will we give it up to a despotism of special privilege.', 'The people of this congressional district have shown that they share these convictions. They have shown it by sending Sam Rayburn to Congress time after time.', ""And when I go down to the Capitol to address the Congress next January, I expect to see Sam Rayburn sitting up in the Speaker's chair where he belongs."", 'Thank you very much.']"

Some of the very people who had led the uphill battle for suffrage assumed posts of leadership in the Democratic Party, where they and their successors have carried on the battle for human progress.', ""Democratic Women's Day, which you are meeting to celebrate in thousands of communities throughout the country, was set aside a decade ago at the suggestion of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, to commemorate the admission of women to the Executive Committee of the Democratic National Committee.

For American women always have understood that human rights come first; that progress today is the best guarantee of our children's security tomorrow."", 'I say the Democratic Party has relied on you women. And I must turn this sentence around, and say that you women have relied on the Democratic Party. As mothers and homemakers, you must be concerned with the prices you pay in the stores and with the proper schooling of your children. And you have learned through bitter experience that the Republican Party cannot be relied upon to bring your children a better tomorrow. For proof of that, you have only to look at the record of the Republican 80th Congress.', 'You are the housewives of our country. What is the campaign issue foremost in your minds? We all know the answer. Day after day, when you do your marketing, you must face the soaring prices the 80th Congress has forced upon you.', 'You know what the big business lobbies, through the Republican leadership in Congress, did to price controls in 1946. I vetoed one of their fake price control bills, but they passed a second and then immediately adjourned, so it was that or nothing. I warned when I signed it that inflation would come, with all its hardships. I called a special session of Congress this year and urged it to rectify this mistake, and do something to keep down the cost of living.', 'The Republican Both Congress turned me down, and it turned you down. I do not see how you can expect these same Republicans ever to solve the cost of living problem.', 'I have said that you are the housewives of our Nation. You are the mothers, too. I am a parent, and I can understand your feeling that your children must have the best education available. Education will bring them the skills and the knowledge which will enable them to lead useful and happy lives. The Democratic Party advocates Federal aid for education administered by the States. We insist upon the right of every child to obtain a good education, no matter what his color, no matter where he lives, or what the economic status of his parents may be. We fought for the appropriation of $300 million as a beginning of Federal aid to education. The Republican Both Congress ignored my request.', 'Women hold the balance of power in this election. You women of America have a million and a half more potential votes than men. I am confident that you will use this power to bring about a secure and good future for yourselves and your families. Only through the Democratic Party can you reach this goal. I know that you will put faith in our party, and return it to full power on the first Tuesday in November.']"

I have been traveling around this great country and making many stops to discuss with the people the issues in this campaign.', 'Here in Oklahoma City, in the heart of the Nation, I consider it appropriate to discuss a subject of great importance to all Americans--the relationship of communism to our national security.', 'I should like the American people to consider the damage that is being done to our national security by irresponsible persons who place their own political interests above the security of the Nation.', 'I regret to say that there are some people in the Republican Party who are trying to create the false impression that communism is a powerful force in American life. These Republicans know that this is not true.', 'The time has come when we should take a frank and earnest look at the record about communism and our national security.', 'First, let me remind you of a few basic facts which are often overlooked.', 'Our country is strong enough to resist and overcome all the forces of communism-and it will remain so.', 'Our Government is not endangered by Communist infiltration. It has preserved its integrity--and it will continue to do so.', 'The FBI and our other security forces are capable, informed, and alert--and will remain so.', 'I am going to give you the hard facts which prove what I have said.', 'The Republicans ought to realize that their failure to deal with the big practical issues of American life, such as housing, price control, and education, is too plain to be hidden by any smoke screen. They ought to realize that their reckless tactics are not helping our national security; they are hurting our national security.', 'I am forced to the conclusion that Republican leaders are thinking more about the November election than about the welfare of this great country.', 'I charge that the Republicans have impeded and made more difficult our efforts to cope with communism in this country.', 'I charge that they have hindered the efforts of the FBI, which has been doing wonderful work in protecting the national security.', 'I charge that the Republicans have attempted to usurp the constitutional functions of the Federal grand juries and of the courts.', 'I charge that they have not produced any significant information about Communist espionage which the FBI did not already have.', ""I charge the Republicans with having impaired our Nation's atomic energy program by their intemperate and unjustified attacks on our atomic scientists."", 'I charge them with having recklessly cast a cloud of suspicion over the most loyal civil service in the world.', 'I charge them with having trampled on the individual freedoms which distinguish American ideals from totalitarian doctrine.', 'I charge finally that, in all this, they have not hurt the Communist Party one bit.', 'They have helped it.', 'The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party is unwittingly the ally of the Communists in this country. That is clearly shown in the election record of the Communist Party.', 'The Communist Party reached its greatest popular strength in the 1932 elections, when it polled over 100,000 votes. That was at the bottom of the worst depression this country has ever known--a Republican depression, brought about by 12 years of Republican indifference to the needs of the people.', 'By 1936, under a Democratic administration, the strength of the Communist Party had dropped to 80,000 votes. In 1940, when the Communist Party was attacking President Roosevelt as a warmonger, it polled only 46,000 votes. That is less than one-half of what it got in 1932 under Republican rule.', 'In 1944 there was no Communist Presidential candidate. There is none this year. The Communists are backing the third party.', 'Let us ask ourselves the question: Just why are the Communists backing the third party?', 'They are backing the third party, because they want a Republican victory in November.', 'The Communists feel that by backing the third party they will take votes away from the Democratic ticket and thus elect a Republican President.', 'The Communists want a Republican administration, because they think that its reactionary policies will lead to the confusion and strife on which communism thrives.', ""The Communists hate the Democratic administration, because of this country's strong foreign policy, and because the economic and social gains which we have put through make it impossible for them to make any progress whatever in this country."", 'The Democratic program has brought prosperity, security, and confidence to the American people--and confident people do not become Communists.', 'I ought to know something about communism. I have been honored by its bitter enmity and its slanderous statements. The controlled papers of communism at home and abroad, have showered me with libelous venom. That is because I have been fighting communism not merely where it is a contemptible minority in a land of freedom, but wherever it is a marching and menacing power in the world.', 'The greatest danger to us does not come from communism in the United States. The greatest danger has been that communism might blot out the light of freedom in so much of the rest of the world that the strength of its onslaught against our liberties would be greatly multiplied. To meet this danger, my administration has moved vigorously to aid the democratic governments of foreign nations in maintaining the independence and freedom of their peoples.', 'In spite of considerable opposition from the Republican rank and file in both Houses of Congress, I urged, and the Congress finally approved, programs for economic aid to free nations.', 'These programs, which began with the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall plan, have made it possible for many nations to stand with us in opposition to Communist encroachment throughout the world.', 'As a result of these measures, the Communist tide has been checked.', 'It is a plain and unanswerable fact that all these great programs were conceived and sponsored by the Truman administration.', 'And while we worked to strengthen democracy in the world, my administration worked with equal vigor to strengthen democracy at home. For we know that this is the best way to kill communism at its roots â¢', 'People who are well-fed, well-clothed, well-housed, and whose basic rights are protected, do not become victims of communism.', 'With this object in mind, I repeatedly presented a legislative program to the Congress.', 'Among the big elements in that program were:', 'Inflation control, to stabilize the cost of living;', 'Housing, not merely for the privileged and the rich, but also for the people of average and low income;', 'Adequate medical care for millions of our people who are not getting it now;', 'Improvement in our educational facilities, to reduce illiteracy, and to raise the entire level of American life;', 'An increase in minimum wages;', 'An extension of social security to large groups not now covered, and an increase in benefits to the aged, to the crippled, and to widows, mothers, and children.', 'But what happened to this program to strengthen American democracy?', 'It ran into a reactionary Republican Congress-the Both--and there it was stopped dead.', 'The truth is, the Democratic Party has been leading the fight to make democracy effective and to wipe out communism in the United States.', 'Long before these Republicans started their Communist talk for political purposes, my administration was engaged in a direct attack on subversive organizations and persons in the United States.', 'We worked at it every day--and not just before elections. We continue to work at it, and not just before election.', 'A part of our effort has been to make sure that Communists and other disloyal persons are not employed by the Federal Government.', 'I want to tell you about that. I want to tell you some things that you have not heard from the Republicans.', 'Since 1939 the employees of the Government have been required to swear under oath that they are not Communists. That means that there is not one single employee of the Federal Government who is an admitted Communist.', 'Nevertheless, we all know that Communists are trained to lie. There is no doubt that they, as well as other disloyal persons, have tried to worm their way into the Government service.', 'So, in 1947, I set up the employee loyalty program to require an individual check on all Federal employees and to discharge them if they were found to be Communists, or if there were other reasonable grounds for doubting their loyalty.', 'This was a real program to meet a real situation, and it was worked out by competent people who had the facts and understood how the Federal Government actually works.', 'At the start, the Congress delayed the program for months through slowness in making appropriations, and when it did come through, when the appropriation did come through, it was much less than I had requested. The Republicans at that time said the program was too elaborate.', 'Now, in an election year, they say it is not elaborate enough. That is Republican consistency.', 'This program meant the checking of over 2 million Federal employees. I gave the FBI complete charge of this part of the program. And they have handled their job with such efficiency that all present employees have now been checked.', 'The FBI check showed that the loyalty of 99.7 percent of all Federal workers was not even questionable.', 'The remaining three-tenths of one percent represented every last instance in which the FBI found any shred of unchecked loyalty information about any Federal employee. It even included employees who were the victims of accusations by malicious, anonymous persons. Each of these employees was investigated intensively by the FBI from their first birthday to the present time.', 'The results of the FBI loyalty investigations have been turned over to loyalty boards in the agencies which employ these persons involved. The review of these FBI investigations by the loyalty boards has shown that the large majority of these three-tenths of one percent are good, loyal Americans.', 'At the same time, in those instances where the FBI investigations reveal sufficient evidence, the loyalty program provided that cases be presented by the Department of Justice to Federal grand juries.', 'Thus the employee loyalty program not only provides a means for removing employees of doubtful loyalty from Government service; it also provides a method for discovering and punishing offenders.', 'The agency loyalty boards are disposing of these cases as quickly as possible. Each individual-now listen to this, this is the meat of the thing--each individual is given a full opportunity to protect himself against charges which may be unfounded, distorted, or biased.', ""Only in the case of about one in 6,000 Government employees has loyalty been found doubtful. That's an amazing record. It is proof of the vigilance of the Government that so small a number of disloyal men and women have been able to work their way into Federal jobs."", 'Certain Republicans have been shouting for faster action. They seem to want us to fire employees, without hearings, on the basis of unsupported charges. They resent the democratic safeguards of the loyalty program.', 'Those safeguards are a vital part of the program. The American sense of justice demands for every man a right to defend himself against accusations, the right to a fair hearing, the right to counsel, and the right of appeal.', 'In the periods of tension such as the present, loose charges against individuals are all too frequent. An innocent man may easily find himself accused of terrible things. I am determined that Communists shall not work for the Government. I am equally determined that loyal employees against whom unfounded charges are made shall not suffer injustice.', 'We have been concerned, not merely with Communists in the Government, but with Communists in the United States of America, wherever they are.', 'Evidence of Soviet espionage has been presented to a special Federal grand jury which even now is in session in New York City. The FBI has been quietly and efficiently assembling this evidence for several years. The evidence was being presented to the grand jury long before the Republican congressional committees began their recent hearings. Now these committees are trying to win credit for digging up evidence. They are trying to cash in on the work of the FBI, and to usurp the functions of the grand jury and the Federal courts.', ""Grand jury deliberations, of course, must be confidential. So must the work of the FBI. But the House Un-American Activities Committee doesn't care about that. By its irresponsible publicity, this committee has already done damage to the work of the FBI and other security agencies. Through its press-agent stunts for political ends, this committee has made confidential information available to the intelligence services of foreign countries. And with reckless disregard for the Bill of Rights, this committee has injured the reputations of innocent men by spreading wild and false accusations."", 'This committee has also deprived the Government of the services of a number of atomic scientists, who are so badly needed to enable this Nation to maintain its leadership in the field of atomic energy. Recently, eight of the most eminent scientists in this country pointed this out as a danger to our national security.', 'My administration has been steadily and successfully fighting communism. We have acted instead of just talking about it.', 'We are deporting subversive aliens. We shall continue to do so to the limit of the law. The Attorney General asked the Republican 80th Congress for legislation that would assist this deportation drive, but the 80th Congress did nothing.', 'The FBI, the greatest counterespionage organization in the world, headed by J. Edgar Hoover, is alert, vigorous, and skillful. It is watching the Communists closely, and systematically protecting our internal security.', 'So long as the FBI and our other security agencies can do their job without having the ground cut from under them by the committees of Congress, we have little to fear from spies and subversives. Our record during World War II speaks for itself. This country was completely free from foreign inspired sabotage. Enemy spies and saboteurs who entered this country were caught, and quickly tried and punished severely.', 'On the basis of evidence collected by the FBI and submitted to the grand jury, twelve top Communist leaders will go to trial in New York on October 15. We have prosecuted and we shall prosecute subversive activities wherever we find them. But we must have real evidence. We cannot use speeches of Republican politicians as evidence.', 'This is the United States of America. We are the oldest major democracy on earth. Our democratic values are deep and sound. They cannot be destroyed by a few Communists. We must protect ourselves against communism, but we must not abandon the fundamental ideals of our democracy. To do so would be a surrender to totalitarian doctrines.', 'The Republican leaders have been trying to make communism an issue in this election. They are trying to make you think that the Republican Party has a monopoly on patriotism.', ""Don't let them fool you!"", 'I think most Americans will understand that they are trying to divert your attention from the shocking record of the Republican 80th Congress.', 'Here is something for every American to think about. Why have the Communists lined up solidly to help put a Republican President in the White House? Why do they want a Republican victory? Could it be that their position is now so weak, under a Democratic administration, that their only hope is in a change? Could it be that they are counting on a Republican administration to produce another economic crash, which would play into the hands of world communism? Think that one over.', 'The record is plain for all to see.', 'Republican politicians have contributed nothing against the fight on communism in this country.', 'The Democratic Party has steadily improved the well-being of the American people-the best defense against communism; and we have successfully prevented the spread of communism in this world.', 'The Democratic Party is for free. government and against totalitarianism.', 'We are for free enterprise and against communism.', ""But we are against those who raise the cry of communism to slander and obstruct policies conceived in the people's interest."", 'There is nothing that the Communists would like better than to weaken the liberal programs that are our shield against Communism.', 'There is no power on earth which can bring communism to this country if you, the people of the United States, and your Government, work steadfastly and calmly to maintain the ideals and principles of effective American democracy.', 'I ask your support for your Government in the achievement of that great purpose.', 'Thank you very much.']"

It is the people against the special interests. And this last Congress made a sincere effort for the special interests to abolish our farm program. I just want to give you some statistics on things that happened in the House of Representatives in this last Congress."", 'The Republican House Appropriations Committee, headed by one of the worst old mossbacks in Congress, John Taber of New York, said, ""To hell with the farmers out West."" That\'s an exact quote from him. And they voted to cut the funds of the Department of Agriculture by 37 percent. The cuts they made put the axe to your program of rural electrification, school lunches, and small farm loans and soil conservation. Those are among the most important things to the farmer that ever have been on the law books of the country.', 'Then my friend Clarence Cannon, a great Democrat and your neighbor over here in Missouri, who used to be Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, tried to get those cuts restored; and he was supported by every one of the Democrats on the Committee and every one of the Democrats in the House, including all the Representatives from the great State of Oklahoma. The Republicans ganged up against us and they defeated that attempt to put those appropriations back, by 180 to 174. But there happened to be a very good bunch of fighting Democrats in the Senate, and they got most of it restored.', ""But it just goes to show you that if these Republicans could get complete control of the Government of the United States I don't think the farmer would have a chance. They'd take every gain that the farmers made in the last 16 years away from him. I'm just as sure of that as I'm standing here; and I started out this campaign on this trip at Des Moines, Iowa, and explained to the farmers just exactly where they stood with these Republicans. Stassen has made it very plain that they want to revise the price support program down to the point where the farmer won't have a chance in these high markets."", ""I hope you weigh these things very carefully and that you'll consider your own interests when you go to the polls on November 2d and vote for yourselves. Vote for yourselves as well as vote for the Democratic ticket, and when you do that you'll be sure that the country is in safe hands."", ""Now, I'm particularly interested in these young people who come out to these meetings.

And I think we're going to get that done before we get through. If you really want to implement these policies, if you really want to do the proper thing for the most people in the United States of America, you'll send Bob Kerr to the Senate and you'll send my good friend Steed, here, to the House of Representatives.

I don't represent any special interest. But you'll find that this 80th Congress was completely surrounded by lobbies from every special interest in the country, and they listened to those lobbies, as the results show. They tried to tear up the rural electrification program. They cut the appropriations for the farmers to the point where it was almost necessary to close up shop. If it hadn't been for the fighting Democrats in the Senate of the United States the farm appropriation would have been cut 37 percent."", ""Now, you're interested in soil conservation. You're interested in farm support prices. You're interested in REA. I am, too. I want to continue those things.

And now if you want to throw it away, the best way to do it is to take these special privilege fellows and let them take it away from you and give it to the power trust. That's what they want to do. They cut out the appropriations for the feeder lines from the dams where most of this power is developed for rural electrification, and tried their best to make it possible for the power trust to take that power at the dam and then charge you whatever they pleased for it."", ""I'm against that.

One out of every five houses is structurally unsound, and four out of five lack one or more of the facilities considered to be basic in American living standards. About 3 million new homes are required over the next 10 years.', ""The Democratic Party has a plan for meeting this need and tried to get this plan through the Both Congress. There was a bill called the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill which the Senate signed and passed this spring, after long drawn-out attempts on the part of the real estate lobby to have it killed. If we could have gotten that bill, it would have authorized $300 million to be used for the benefit of the construction of farm homes. This program held bright promise of breaking the back of the farm housing problem, but the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives killed that bill deader than a doornail. They didn't even let the House vote on it. When it came right down to brass tacks, the name of that bill was Taft-Ellender-Wagner, and Senator Taft ran out on his own bill when the showdown came. He could have gotten that bill passed, if he had wanted to."", ""If the Republicans get control of the Senate and House, you know, Senator Taft is going to be one of the leaders in the Senate in the next Congress, and he is going to be most influential in top legislation. You don't want to let them do that. Send Bob Kerr to the Senate, and send Tom Steed here to the House. If you do that in Oklahoma, and all over the United States, the Republicans won't have a chance to sabotage the people's program in the next session.

Soil was just another of those natural resources that was just there to be plundered. You people here in Oklahoma know better than anybody, because you know what happened under that system. You remember the dust storms when good, hard-working farmers in this State and others saw the soil, on which their livelihood depended, blown away, and the rich farmlands were about to become a desert."", ""That was one of the great crises faced by President Roosevelt when he took office in 1933. He saw that our land would have to be saved if our Nation were going to be saved. He initiated a great soil conservation program, unprecedented in the Nation's history. That program has been continued by me. We have only just begun to right this battle of the land."", 'The Republicans have never gotten away from their Hoover philosophy. They still are doing their best to stop my efforts for soil conservation so that our land and your land cannot be plundered.', 'Look at the record of the Both Congress. House Republicans cut the appropriation for soil conservation one-third. Fortunately, we got most of this cut back in the Senate. Again in 1948 the House voted to cut the soil conservation appropriation. One hundred percent of the Democrats voted for that appropriation, and 95 percent of the Republicans voted against it. That shows how they stand. In the Senate the Democratic leaders over there got these cuts restored. One hundred percent of the Democrats in the Senate voted to support that restoration, and 93 percent of the Republicans voted against it. The result was that $37.5 million, or 12 percent, of the soil conservation payments proposed by this administration were cut out by the 80th Congress.', ""Can anyone doubt what a Republican Congress and a Republican President would do to these very Democratic farm programs if they get into power?

Farm price supports benefit the farmer with a guarantee that the price of the things he sells will be high enough to cover the cost of the things that he must buy.

It encouraged the highest farm production in our history to meet the war and postwar emergency food needs of the entire world."", ""You don't suppose we would have had these great and magnificent crops if the farmer had not been sure he wasn't going to have his throat cut when it came time to sell.

The farm price support program has made the taxpayers over $80 million.', 'The Republicans never told you that. They never tell you anything that is good for the country.

That is why I was so deeply concerned a couple of weeks ago when, after a conference with the Republican candidate, Governor Stassen came out with an attack on the farm price program. And here is what the Wall Street Journal says. The Wall Street Journal doesn\'t represent the farmer. The Wall Street Journal speaks for the Republican Party and the special interests. And they called Mr. Stassen\'s statement an attack on the price support system, and it said further, ""Mr. Stassen is in fact proposing a far-reaching reform of the farm policy, or else he doesn\'t make sense.""', 'I think he knew what he was talking about, and I think he was talking under orders.', 'The hue and cry that was raised by this attack was so great that the Republican Party immediately issued statements in favor of farm price supports--in principle, they said.', 'Does that mean that they are for the farm price program, or are they against it?', 'I think you will find that they are against it, when you get right down to brass tacks. The first thing this Congress tried to do was to cut the throat of the farmers in cutting appropriations for the Agriculture Department of the United States. The next thing they tried to do was to take the freedom away from the laboringman. They are not for the common everyday citizen.', ""The income of the United States was $217 billion this year, and it has been distributed fairly evenly to all the people, the farmers, the laboringman, and the small businessman. They have had a fair share of this $217 billion income--which was in 1947--I said this year--it is a great deal more this year, but we can't add it up until we get to the last day of the year."", 'But that situation was not brought about by accident. It is the policy of the Democratic administration--of the Democratic Party--to be for the people.

Do you know why they did that?', ""I've been out in Omaha, Nebr., and I told the farmers out in the farm belt at Omaha, Nebr., just exactly what the 80th Congress was doing to them. That was back in June. And as quickly as the farmers heard that speech they put so much heat on that Republican Congress that just 1 hour before they adjourned they passed a half-baked farm bill--just a half-baked farm bill--and they passed that, they said, because they'd have time to work on it a little more in 1949 when they had both the Congress and the presidency."", ""They're not going to get either one."", ""You know--and I've tried to make it perfectly plain--that the Republicans are only for the farmer in an election year when they think they can get his vote. That's been the case ever since I can remember, and I've been a politician a long time. That shouldn't surprise you because this Congress had the biggest lobbies surrounding it of any Congress in the history of the country. They had the real estate lobby and the National Association of Manufacturers lobby, and they had every kind of a lobby you can name-and the money flowed up there like water."", ""And this Republican Congress never acted until it heard its master's voice--the chief lobbies for whatever bill was pending before the Congress.

26,Harry S Truman ,"September 29, 1948","['Governor Turner, Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests, and fellow Democrats:', 'I am very happy to meet you here in Tulsa this afternoon. I can understand why this. is the ""Magic City"" and the area surrounding it called the ""Magic Empire."" I want to thank this color guard, this VFW color guard. I understand that they were all in the 35th Division in the First World War. That is wonderful. They seem to be able to wear the same belts they could in 1918. Now, contrary to what some people say, I know that you still have the same courage and vision and faith of the men who built this great region.', 'And I know that you are looking forward with me, and not backward with the Republican Party. Now, if that\'s the case--and I believe it is--you can\'t help but send Dixie Gilmer to the Congress, and you must send Bob Kerr to the Senate, and then we\'ll be well on the road to curing that ""do-nothing"" Both Congress. I know that Oklahoma is always on the beam.', ""It sent one of the best divisions to fight in World War Two, and Oklahoma in the First World War was the training ground for the 35th Division, of which I was a member, over here at Fort Sill. I spent one of the coldest winters in my life at Fort Sill, Okla. And when it wasn't cold, why, it was blowing Texas up one day and blowing Kansas down the next. But I still like Oklahoma and always shall like it, because I've been coming here all my life."", ""As a veteran of World War One, I know what it takes to make a good division, and I know that that Thunderbird Division had a record that's unsurpassed. It is fearless men who know what they are fighting for, and I believe that is a characteristic of all the people of this great State."", 'I know you still have the spirit of the men who built this region because you are still carrying on in their tradition. Today, you are fighting the forces of drought and flood just as your forefathers fought the wilderness.', 'You have carved out of a semi-arid region a land of agricultural abundance.', 'You have made such progress that I am happy to be able to report to you that this year, for the first year in your history, Oklahoma will reach a farm production worth $1 billion.', 'Just think of that, $ 1 billion income for the Oklahoma farmers this year!', ""I remember all too well in the early 1930's when Oklahoma's agricultural production was only a little over one-tenth of this year's figure. Much of your farmland was wasting away. Farmers all over the State were moving away in despair."", 'What is responsible for this great change between the early thirties and today? I will tell you what it is. It is the result of wise Federal farm programs.', 'These programs were conceived in the interest of all the people of the United States and by the administration of our great Democratic President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. They have been extended, and ably executed, in the interest of all the people of the United States, I am proud to say, by my own administration, too.', 'The basic issue facing the people of the United States today is this: Shall States like Oklahoma continue to expand and reach a better living, or shall their progress be stopped dead in its tracks ? Shall the Democratic program that brought this wonderful record to Oklahoma be continued, or shall it be thrown back into the dark ages by the Republicans?', 'Let me remind you of the Democratic and Republican records as they affect the West.', ""I'll give you two sets of figures. The first figure will be for the period ending in 1932, after 12 years of Republican neglect of the welfare of the people."", 'The second will be for 1948 after 16 Democratic years of work for all the people, farmers, workers, businessmen, and white-collar people.', 'In 1932 the value of Oklahoma farm produce was $106 million. Today it is a billion.', 'In 1932 only one Oklahoma farm in forty had electricity. In 1948, one-half of all the Oklahoma farms have electricity.', 'Between 1920 and 1932--those 12 long Republican years--only four reclamation projects were completed in the entire western section of the United States.', 'Between 1933 and 1948, the Democratic years, thirty-two reclamation projects were completed.', 'Under 12 years of Republican rule, only 706,000 new acres were brought under irrigation by Federal projects. The Democratic years saw the tremendous figure of over 1 1/2 million new acres brought under irrigation.', 'The Republican years saw an increase in hydroelectric capacity in the West of 78,000 kilowatts.', ""The Democratic years saw a staggering increase of almost 2 1/2 million kilowatts. The Republicans are trying to wipe that out. This 80th Congress did its best to hamstring the public power policy of the United States, which has been the policy since 1933, and they almost succeeded in doing it. If you hadn't had somebody in the White House who was looking out for your interest, they would have done it."", 'You all know what this program has meant to the West. Here in Oklahoma the irrigated cotton yield is 3 1/2 times as high as dry farm cotton. Average income per acre in Oklahoma on irrigated land is 6 times as high as on dry-farmed crops.', 'The facts are all the sales talk the Democratic program needs.', 'The Democratic Party is committed to continue and expand this program. Now, what do the Republicans plan to do?', 'They have made a lot of campaign promises, but the best proof of the pudding is in the eating. Look what the Republicans do, not what they say. You can always judge a man by the way he acts and not what he says.', ""Let's take up some of the issues that mean a lot to you people here in Oklahoma."", 'The Republican 80th Congress attacked our reclamation and public power policies. The Republican House passed a bill which would have cut out six of the largest reclamation projects and would have forced Federal power prices up as much as 48 percent!', 'The Republican House of Representatives voted against an increase in funds to expand the rural electrification program.', 'The Republican House voted to cut reclamation funds for 1948 by more than half.', ""Why, the Republican Congressman from Tulsa even fought the Grand River Dam project right here at his front door! I don't know what he wanted to do that for. His record is one of the worst records in the Congress, so far as the interests of the people are concerned, and he's got a brother up in Missouri that's got the same kind of record. That's the reason I want you to send Dixie to the Congress."", 'My threat of a veto on some of the worst Republican bills and loyal support by Democratic Congressmen are all that saved your reclamation and public power programs from ruin.', 'There isn\'t time to tell you today all about the things the Republicans did to you during the 2 long years of the 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress.', 'But there is one matter that every voter in the country should know about.', 'The Republican 80th Congress passed a law which has already begun to hurt the farmers.', ""They passed a law extending the life of the Commodity Credit Corporation, but that law had a joker in it. They took away from the CCC the right to provide emergency storage for farmers' grain when regular grain storage facilities are full."", 'Because the CCC cannot build storage bins this year, thanks to the Republicans, farmers have been unable to meet the requirements for Government support prices. In a great many places they have had to sell their grain for whatever prices were offered by speculators in the grain trade.', ""That's what the Republicans would like to do to you right now. They would like to turn the clock all the way back and turn the farmers back over to the speculators. As long as I'm President, they're not going to have a chance to do that. Look how they treated the workingman. The first thing they did as soon as they got there was to try to take some of the liberties away from labor. We have it right now--on the front page of the paper today--what they propose to do to labor if they get back in there. Now, farmers and laborers and small businessmen are exactly on the same boat. All of them must be prosperous, if the whole country is going to be prosperous. Now, what are some of the Republican plans if they win this election?"", 'They have already attacked the farm price support program throughout the country. Republican campaign propaganda is being spread through the country in an attempt to make the workers think that the farm program is to blame for high prices. At the same time, Republicans are telling the farmers that wages are to blame for high prices.', 'The Republican Chairman of the House Public Works Committee has attacked the power and reclamation program and promises to reverse the present Federal power and reclamation policies in the next Congress.', 'In an article he recently wrote for a private utility trade magazine, he promised that, if the Republicans are elected, they will stop Federal projects and take the power from existing projects and turn it over to a private utility monopoly. In other words, the Republicans intend to take the power that is already yours as citizens, away from you, and give it to private monopolies to sell back to you on their own terms.', ""Is that what you want? I know you don't. If you really don't want it, you'll go and vote the Democratic ticket straight on election day. Now, this article I refer to, about these utilities, was written by a Republican Congressman from Michigan, who again would be Chairman of the Committee on Public Works in the House of Representatives, if we got another Republican Congress. His name is George A. Dondero, and he's one of the most backward-looking men in the Congress."", 'This Republican spokesman made the flat statement that the Republicans ""are of one mind"" in changing our Federal reclamation and power laws.', 'Now, I disagree completely with the Republicans on this issue. I believe we should expand our programs for building up the country--not tear them down.', 'Just for example, my administration is now working on plans for seven new reclamation projects for your State of Oklahoma that will irrigate 89,000 acres of land that is not now producing.', 'I have taken a great interest in the development of the Arkansas River. I conferred on this subject at length with my good friend Bob Kerr, when he was Governor of your great State.', 'I felt a real sense of satisfaction, when he told me this morning that my efforts with reference to the Arkansas had speeded up that development by at least 10 years.', 'I want to assure you people of Oklahoma that I shall continue my efforts in behalf of the Arkansas River development.', ""For the first time in the history of this country I had a complete flood control power and dam site survey made of the whole Mississippi Valley, from the Appalachian Mountains on the east to the Rocky Mountains on the west, and from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico; and I've got a program for that whole river system that will cure floods and give us all the power we need here in the Middle West."", 'Now, the issues are clear enough in this campaign. You can vote for continued price supports, more rural electrification and greater reclamation, irrigation, and hydroelectric power projects. Or you can vote for the candidates who threaten to reverse the established policies and turn the clock back to the boom-and-bust Republicanism of the twenties.', ""I just don't believe you're going to do that. I think you're going to take this thing in hand. I think you're going to inform yourselves, and I think on the 2d day of November you're going out there and pile up such a record Democratic vote that these fellows never will again try to turn the clock back."", 'Thank you very much.']"

I am also most happy to see all your good Democratic candidates out here this morning--your next Senator, your next Congressman, and your local officials.', ""I understand you have a Congressional Medal of Honor man on the ticket, a wonderful young man. I pinned that medal on him, and I told him I would much rather have that medal than be President of the United States--and that's just exactly what I mean."", 'The country is very prosperous today. The country is in financially as good condition as it has ever been in the history of the whole term of the life of this Republic. The wealth of the country has been fairly evenly distributed. The basic proposition in this campaign is that we must continue that program, both locally and internationally.', 'There are two theories of government on which you have to make a decision on election day. One is the theory that the people are the government, and the other is that special privilege should run the government. The Republicans have the special privilege theory, and the Democrats have always been for the people.', 'You know, you are the Government. You are the Government. And when you exercise your right of franchise you remain the Government, but when you do like you did in 1946--shirk your duty--you get just what you got this time in that 80th Congress.', 'Now, the Democrats have, ever since 1933 when they took over the Government, tried to make a fair approach to these things. They passed the Wagner Act, which gave labor its fair place in the good things of life. Then it passed farm security acts--the AAA and all those things that has made the farmer prosperous.', ""In 1932 there were 123,000 farmers who were kicked off their farms because they couldn't pay interest--their mortgages were due. Last year there was less than 800. The farmers had an income of $4 Â½ billion in 1932. Well, they had an income of over 18 billion last year."", ""Right here in Mount Vernon, in Jefferson County, you can see the great difference between the Republican and the Democratic records. Under the Republicans people all through this county were losing their farms and their homes. Now Mount Vernon has plenty of credit available, backed by the Farm Credit Administration, created in 1933 by the Democrats. You have a National Farm Loan Association in Mount Vernon and the Production Credit Association in Lawrenceville. Last year this Production Credit Association had 816 members and loaned $1,516,000. It doesn't look like you're in need of anything."", ""This is the headquarters city for the Tri-County Electric Cooperative. This cooperative received loans from the Federal Rural Electrification Administration totaling $2,155,000, to build 1,583 miles of line to serve 5,524 rural customers. And you know, the Republicans would like to stop that rural electrification thing. They tried their best to raise the rates on rural electrification something over 50 percent. If you hadn't had a Democratic President and enough Democrats with fighting spirit in the Sen ate of the United States they would have succeeded in doing that very thing."", ""The Republican leaders under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover didn't worry about giving Federal credit and electric lights to the farmers. Well, you got them because you had a Democratic administration that was interested in the welfare of the whole people,"", ""Now, you can't afford to stay at home this time, as you did in 1946, and let nature take its course, because if you do, this gang of special privilege fellows will get complete control of the Government. Well, you had a sample of what will happen. They tried to take the liberties away from labor. They did their level best to ruin the farm program."", ""I have been going up and down this country, trying to explain to the people just exactly what the fundamental issues are in this campaign. And I think I have made some impression because people come out. They're interested. Look here at this early morning crowd here in this great farm community at Mount Vernon. Look at it! That's been the case all over the United States."", ""I began over in Rock Island, Ill., as your new Senator can tell you. We had a tremendous crowd there at Rock Island. And they kept growing and growing and growing. We've had crowds as large as 100,000. We had the biggest turnout in Tulsa, Okla., yesterday that they have ever had in that town--and Tulsa, Okla., is ruled by a bunch of economic royalists who made a lot of money out of oil.

This is the people against the special interests.', ""Now, you're interested in mining and agriculture here in this community. There are people who work for wages here, there are people who work the soil to produce things to eat and things to wear. Those two balance the economy of the United States, along with the merchants and the white-collar people--and every single segment of that population ought to have its fair share of the national income."", ""I've been fighting for that ever since I went to the Senate in 1935. I've been fighting on a Democratic platform just for that."", 'When the Democrats took over in 1933--in March, when President Roosevelt was sworn in as the Democratic President of the United States--he and that administration immediately went to work to balance that income. He had a farm program; he had a labor program; he had a program that protected the white-collar man and the merchant. Now, I\'m trying to prolong that program into the future. I\'m trying to save that program, because a lot of you stayed at home in 1946 and you elected that ""donothing"" 80th Congress. And you were to blame for it because you didn\'t go vote. One-third of the voters of the United States elected that Congress. Two-thirds of you stayed at home because you were not interested in government. You are the Government, and when you stay at home and do not vote you are shirking your duty and you got just what you deserve when you got something like that 80th Congress.', ""Now, you mustn't do that this time. It's too serious."", 'I stood to protect the interests of the people, and there were a lot of good Democrats in that Congress who stood shoulder to shoulder with me to save these great forward-looking measures which had been put on the books by the Democrats.

I want to see you elect John Upchurch here to the Congress of the United States, and Paul Douglas to the United States Senate; and then you ought to elect Adlai Stevenson to be the Governor of Illinois. You know, Mr. Stevenson comes of a line of public servants. His father was Vice President of the United States with Grover Cleveland, and he has rendered tremendous public service during this emergency through which we have just passed. He is a good administrator, and I am sure you can't do better than to make him Governor of Illinois."", 'If you will send Paul Douglas and John Upchurch to the Congress, and if Illinois will go down the line and give us a Democratic delegation in the Congress of the United States, we won\'t have any more 80th ""donothing"" Congresses.', ""Here are just a few examples to prove it to you that this Congress is a special interest Congress. The first thing they did when they got there was to vote themselves a rich man's tax bill, which I vetoed. Then they took it back and modified it, and I vetoed it again. Then they passed it over my veto. It is a rich man's tax bill, if you analyze it."", 'Then the next thing they did was to take some freedom away from labor, and to pass the Taft-Hartley Act which tried to emasculate the Wagner Act. Now labor got its magna charta from President Roosevelt under the Wagner Act back in 1935, the act that gives to labor the right to free collective bargaining, and guarantees that right. Well, this Taft-Hartley law endeavored to take that right away from labor.', 'And if the laboringmen stay at home, as they did in 1946, I have just received information as to what the Republicans intend to do further to labor.', 'Then they took on the farmer, and they are going right down the line to undo everything that has been done to keep his income on an even keel, to evenly distribute the income so that everybody will have his fair share. Then, on the price support program, they almost wrecked it by a joker which they put into the recharter of the CCC, which does not allow the Government to furnish storage space for the grain on which they make loans.', ""Corn, right now, in this vicinity is selling 45 percent below the support price just for that reason, and the speculators will get the benefit of the Republican change in that Commodity Credit law. And it isn't fair. It isn't right."", ""I have been going up and down this country pointing out specific examples of what happened. We wanted to build a steamplant--a standby plant for TVA, which would be of some benefit to you people right here and cost $4 million. They knocked that out. I asked them to put it in again at the special session, but they never did it. They did not intend to do anything for the welfare and benefit of the people. The power trust lobby stood out here at the rathole and wouldn't let them do it. There are bigger lobbies in Congress this time--in that 80th Congress--than ever before in history."", 'We have been making a crusade up and down this country, trying to convince the people that their interests are with the Democratic Party, and if you believe that, you will send me back to the White House, and you will elect a Democratic Congress to take the place of this ""do-nothing,"" good-for-nothing 80th Congress.', 'Thank you.', '[8.] CARMI, ILLINOIS (1:05 p.m.)', 'I certainly appreciate this grand welcome in Carmi.

They are coming out to hear what I have to say about the issues in this campaign, and I hope that they will weigh those issues carefully, and then I hope that they will go and do what is best for the country; and I believe they will.', 'You know, there is just one fundamental issue in this campaign, and that is that it is the people against the special interests. The people are represented by the Democratic Party, and the special interests are represented by the Republican Party. And if I had the time, I could stand here all afternoon and tell you example after example to prove what I am saying is true.', ""This is a farming community, and one of the first things that that Republican 80th Congress did when it came into session was to begin to cut the ground from under the farmers; and they took a crack at labor, and they took a crack at the farmer, and they almost sabotaged our public power and reclamation program. They are interested in the people at the top, they don't care whether the little man has a house to live in, they don't care whether the farmer gets a fair price for his crops, they don't care if labor has a bill of rights."", 'But those things are fundamental Democratic principles. We inaugurated a farm program in 1933, when we elected Franklin D. Roosevelt to be President of the United States; and that farm program has worked in the interests of the farmers.', ""The farmer's income in 1932, the year before the Democrats took office, was about$4 1/2 billion. Last year it was more than $18 billion. The total income in this country was $217 billion for 1947, and it is fairly evenly distributed. That is the greatest income of any country in the history of the world, and everybody has been getting their fair share."", 'If we could have gotten this Republican Congress to go along with us on lowering prices to prevent inflation, we would have made that income sufficient for the welfare of everybody in the country.', 'Now, when it came to butchering the farm program, when rechartering the CCC, they put a joker in it so that the CCC could not furnish storage for grain on which they were to make the parity loans, so that now corn is selling below parity. Wheat has been selling below parity, and they want that to happen because they want to turn the farmer back to the speculators.', ""Now, if the farmers stand idly by this time and don't do their duty on election day, they will deserve to go back to the speculators, that's all I have got to say about it."", 'You know, this situation came about because of the indifference of the people, because everything was going great with them. In 1946, when election time came around, two-thirds of the people stayed at home, and the other third elected the 80th Congress. I have said all over the United States that I think this is the second worst Congress that ever met in Washington; and it had more lobbies than any other Congress I ever heard anything about. Those lobbies accomplished their purpose. There was the real estate lobby, the power lobby, and they had the lobby that was working for the grain exchange up here in Chicago, the speculators lobby, I call it. I know that there were a dozen others that were there for special interests, they were not interested in the welfare of the whole people; and I am asking you, in order to remedy this situation, to elect a Democratic Congress, and if you do so, you are bound to send me back to the White House. And if you do that, the interests of the people will be safeguarded and the Government will be run for the whole people and not for just a few of them.', ""Now you have a wonderful man here running for the Senate in this great State of Illinois--Paul Douglas. I hope you will send him to the Senate. He is a forward-looking citizen. He doesn't want to turn the clock back."", 'You have got the same situation here with Congressman John Upchurch--send him to the House. Send Paul Douglas to the Senate, and go the whole way while you are doing it, and elect Adlai Stevenson to be Governor of this State of Illinois, and you will be on the safe side of progress, instead of in the hands of people who want to turn the clock back.', 'I sincerely wish that I could spend the time going into the issues of this campaign in detail, and outline it to you, I think I could convince you that I am telling you what is right.', ""I am making a crusade across this country, trying to convince the people that their own interests are at stake when they vote the Democratic ticket in the fall, that it will be a vote for themselves, you won't necessarily have voted for any individual or voted for me for President."", 'Get up early on election day and go down to the polls and get that ticket and make no mistake--just vote the Democratic ticket straight, and then you will be on the safe side.', '[9.] MOUNT VERNON, INDIANA (Rear platform, 2 p.m.)', ""I am very, very sorry that we got held up in Illinois and lost a couple of hours, but I couldn't help that.

Therefore, your vital interest is at stake in this campaign, for the simple reason that the first thing the Republicans tried to do when they got to Washington-there were three first things they tried to do: they tried to sabotage labor, they tried to sabotage the farmer, and they tried to do away with all our public reclamation and power projects.

If you remember, the farmer was about as low as he could possibly get, financially, in 1932. He was being foreclosed. He could get nothing for his produce. If I remember correctly, corn was as low as 15 cents a bushel, and wheat went to a quarter. Hogs were selling for $3 a hundred, and you couldn't sell a fat steer at all, unless you brought in the skin, and you had to almost give him away."", ""This situation has been almost reversed since 1933.

That's what we started to give the country, and that's what we did give the country over the last 16 years."", ""Then along comes the terrible 80th Congress, and they're trying to undo it. They did their level best to undo those things. They cut the ground from under the farmer and the price support program. They tried their best to abolish labor's Bill of Rights by passing that Taft-Hartley Act, and they're working on reclamation and irrigation projects and public power. They would like to abolish TVA. They've cut out the power transmission lines from these great dams which the Government has built and which belong to the public and which are intended to furnish cheap power to the public. They are a special interest Congress, and they are representative of the Republican Party."", ""Now, I want you to keep that situation in mind, and I want you to be sure and send a Democrat, Senator Virgil Chapman, to the Senate this fall, and I want you to send Frank Chelf back to the House--and then we'll have a start on a Congress that will be in the interest of the people--and goodness knows we don't want another duplicate of the 80th Congress.

For hamburger in August 1948, you were paying 56 cents.', 'These prices certainly did adjust themselves--they just doubled.', 'Now, the policies of the NAM were carried out by the Republican Party. We have proof of that. Senator Wherry of Nebraska, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, told an NAM group in February 1948, and I quote him--this is what he said:', '""I do not need to remind the membership of this association that it was the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House that was responsible for ending OPA."" I want to read that to you again. Listen to this. This is the Republican attitude in the public interest: ""I do not need to remind the membership of this association that it was the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House that was responsible for ending OPA.""', 'The Senator not only admitted that the Republicans killed the OPA, he boasted about it.', ""That's the plain, factual record on inflation. The forces of big business, operating through the Republican Party, tore down the protection against high prices, which had been built up for our people."", 'The people who told you in 1946 that your Democratic administration was wrong, when we wanted to continue price control-the people who told you that prices would take care of themselves--these same people are telling you now that, if you will turn the Government of the United States over to them, everything will take care of itself.', ""I don't think you're going to be fooled again by that sort of tommyrot."", 'Since they killed price control in 1946, the Republican Old Guard have given ample proof that they were quite satisfied with prices going higher and higher and with profits of big business getting bigger and bigger.', 'Time and time again in 1947 and 1948, I asked the Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress to concern itself with the way our people were suffering from high prices, and to do something constructive to hold down the cost of living. Every time, the Republican Congress refused to take effective action.', ""That's what I mean when I say that the Republican Party is acting for the benefit of big business and against the best interests of the people."", 'Now, have you benefited from high prices?', ""Have you found it easier to make ends meet now, than you did 2 years ago? Well, of course you haven't."", 'But there are some who have benefited by high prices.', 'Profits, after taxes, of all corporations were running at the rate of 12 billions a year in the spring of 1946, before price control was ended. Two years later, in the spring of 1948, they were running at the rate of $21 Â½ billion--an increase of 70 percent in corporation profits.', ""There are some people whose incomes have gone up faster than prices, even if yours hasn't. One of America's largest corporations reports that it paid its top ten executives $865,000 in 1946."", 'Do you want further proof that the Republican Party is the instrument of special privilege?', 'Look at the record on housing.', 'What kind of housing do our people need ? We need good low-priced low-rent housing.', 'For 3 years there has been legislation before the Congress to bring more good housing at lower prices and lower rents. For 3 years the real estate lobby, operating through the Republican Party, has blocked that legislation. As a result the Government today can do nothing to help the cities and towns build low-rent housing, nothing to help cities and towns clear their slums, and nothing to bring better rural housing.', ""That's the plain, factual record. That's another reason why I say that the Republican Party is the party of special interests, and not the party of the people."", 'Who has benefited from this housing situation? Not the people who have had to pay three or four times the normal value of a house. Not the veterans who have had to mortgage their future to buy housing at exorbitant prices to have a roof over their heads.', 'Only the special interest group--represented by the real estate lobby--has benefited.', 'Would you like still another example of what I mean when I say the Republican Party serves special interests instead of the people?', 'Look at the record on social security.', 'The 1944 Republican platform, like the Democratic platform--now the Republican platform and the Democratic platform were alike--promised to extend the benefits of our social security system to millions of workers who are not now protected by it. Well, what happened?', 'Have the Republicans extended social security? They have not. Instead of extending social security to more people, they passed a law--over my veto--actually taking away social security rights from nearly a million people who already had them.', ""That wasn't for the benefit of the people. That was for the benefit of employers who didn't want to pay the social security tax."", ""That's what I mean when I say the Republican Party works for the benefit of special privilege. That's why I say we need a Democratic victory in this election because the Democratic Party stands for the people. The Democratic Party stands for the people!"", ""Now, let's just take another example. Look at the record on monopoly. The plain facts on monopoly are these:"", '--Two hundred giant industrial corporations own nearly half of all our industrial assets.', '--One hundred commercial banks control one half of all the bank deposits in the United States.', '--Three steel companies own 59 percent of all the ingot capacity of the United States.', '--Two corporations produce 83 percent of all the tin cans.', ""These facts shout a warning to all of us. They mean that big business can manipulate prices and production at its own discretion, regardless of the public good. That's not healthy for this country--it's the biggest threat there is to our free enterprise system."", 'My administration has been doing what it could to break up monopolies through the antitrust laws. And we asked the Republican 80th Congress to strengthen those antitrust laws to plug up some of the loopholes.', 'Studies by the Federal Trade Commission have shown that big corporations have been gobbling up small businesses faster than ever during the past few years. And this process cannot be stopped until the Congress passes legislation to stop up these loopholes.', ""Did the Republicans give us unity in our fight against monopoly? Well, of course not. That's not the kind of unity they believe in."", 'Instead of strengthening the antitrust laws, the Republican Congress passed-over my veto--an act which exempts one whole segment of industry from those laws. Under this act, the railroads no longer have to worry about antitrust laws when they set rates. The Republican Congress fixed that for them.', ""That's what I mean when I say the Republican Party is willing and eager to listen to the voice of big business and special privilege."", ""That's the only conclusion that can be drawn from an honest look at the record."", ""And that's why I say it's time for a change--a change from the Republican Congress we've been suffering under for the last 2 years."", 'Give us a Democratic Congress and we will get action against high prices. That will be a change.', 'Give us a Democratic Congress and we will get action for more housing at lower prices. That will be a change.', 'Give us a Democratic Congress and we will take action against monopoly. That will be a change.', 'Give us a Democratic Congress and we will move forward for the benefit of all the people, toward better housing, better medical care, better education--all the things that mean a happier and more secure life for the average American family.', ""That is the sort of change we Democrats propose. That is the kind of change the American people need and want, and you can get that change, if you'll do your duty and vote on election day.""]"

Then he went to Missouri--was afraid to go back home. And about 3 or 4 years after that, why his father-in-law sent for him to come home, he wanted to see the first grandchild. That settled things and they got together, and my grandfather Young and grandmother Young lived right around here. My grandmother was the youngest of 13 children, and they lived out here on the farm between here and Louisville. The house sat half in Jefferson County and half in Shelby County, and when my grandmother's brother--she was raised by her oldest brother--didn't want to serve on the jury in Jefferson County, he would move over to Shelby County, and when he didn't want to serve in Shelby County, he moved to Jefferson--he was very conveniently fixed."", 'But I am proud of my Kentucky ancestry, naturally. Kentucky and Missouri are just symbolic of the ancestry there. Missouri was settled by people from Kentucky and Tennessee mostly, and the central part of Missouri from St. Louis to Kansas City is just a cross-section of Kentuckians, so I know exactly what you think about, and how you like things. If you will come out to Jackson County, I will show you a slice of Kentucky.', 'You are interested, of course, in this campaign, and it will be one of the most historic campaigns in the history of the United States, because there is just one issue in this campaign, and that issue is do the people rule the country or do the special interests rule the country.', 'Now, you are a great farming community here, and the first thing that this Republican Congress did, as soon as it got into session, was to begin to cut the ground from under the farmer.', 'You see, the Democratic administration, in 1933, took over the country when the farmers were broke, when the banks were closing all over the country so fast you were afraid to go into one for fear it would blow up in your face before you could get out. The laboringman was considered just a part of the cost of production.', ""The Democratic administrations inaugurated a policy which put the farmer on his feet in the right place, and gave him a fair share of the income of the country, and they did the same for the laboringman, and did the same for small business. And there hasn't been a bank failure in the United States in the last 3 years, due to the fact that we inaugurated the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."", ""I don't think these Republicans dare tear up what the Democrats have done for the country. The farmer's income this year is $18 billion, compared with 4 1/2 billion in 1932. One hundred and twenty-three thousand farmers were put off their farms in 1932, and only 800 last year."", ""Now, if the farmers know which side their bread is buttered on, they will send the Democrats back to Congress, and they will let me live in the White House another 4 years, and I won't be troubled with the housing shortage."", 'You are interested in farm products, particularly tobacco. If it weren\'t for the price support program, you tobacco raisers would be out the window. That is Democratic policy, but the Republicans want to tear that up, and they have indicated that they will tear it up, if they get control of the Congress as well as the White House. They would have done it this time, if I hadn\'t been sitting there to prevent them from doing it. Now, in order to prevent that Republican Both Congress from being repeated in the 81st Congress, you will elect Virgil Chapman to the Senate of the United States from Kentucky, and you will elect Frank Chelf to the Congress; and if you do that all over the United States, we won\'t have another ""donothing"" Congress like we have had for the last 2 years.', '[2.] FRANKFORT, KENTUCKY (Rear platform, 9:30 a.m.)', 'Mr. Chairman:', 'I certainly appreciate the privilege of stopping here in Frankfort this morning in the capital of the great State of Kentucky, and I am highly appreciative of this wonderful reception which you have given me.', 'It shows that you are interested in the affairs of state.

It shows that you are citizens of the greatest Republic in the world, and that you want to exercise the privileges of a citizen of this great country of ours.

Two-thirds of the people of the United States stayed at home and did not go out and vote, and that is how we got that 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress, the Congress that is the special privilege Congress. That Congress immediately went to work to cut the ground from under labor, and from under the farmer, and from under the general workingman, and the businessman who had a small business.', ""The Democratic Party believes in a fair distribution of the income of this country, so that everybody gets his fair share. We believe that labor ought to be well paid, we believe the farmer ought to get good prices, and we believe that small labor ought to be protected so he won't be gobbled up by the trusts."", 'That is the fight that we are making in this campaign now, and I want you to use good judgment and send Virgil Chapman to the Senate, and send Tom Underwood from the 6th District to represent this district in the Congress.

In fact, the prosperity of this country is at stake. For the last 16 years our country has enjoyed increasing prosperity. The farms are prosperous, business is doing well, and the workers are reaping the benefits of full employment.', 'You know, last year this Nation had the greatest income in the history of the world. The national income was more than $217 billion, and there was a fair distribution of that income. The businessman got his fair share, the laboringman got his fair share, and the farmers got their fair share.', 'That was not a Republican policy, that was a policy inaugurated by the Democratic Party in 1933, when the farmer was at the bottom of the pile, and the workingman was out of work--14 or 15 million idle people in the country in 1932 when Franklin Roosevelt took over the Government.', 'Since that time, the farmer is at the top of the heap. We have 61 million employed, the greatest number of employed in the history of the world. And if we had inflation control, which I have asked for from the Congress time and time again, everybody would have been extremely happy.', ""Now, I wonder if you people here want to go back to 8-cent tobacco, and 3-cent hogs, and 15-cent corn, and 25-cent wheat. Well, that is what you were getting in 1932, when your farms were being taken away from you. You almost didn't have a market for your tobacco because you didn't have a place to raise it part of the time because the mortgagers were taking away your farms. There were 123,000 farmers taken off their farms in 1932. The smallest number of foreclosures in the history of the country was last year, less than 800."", ""That's all there is in this campaign--it's the special interests against the people.

You are going to have a man from Kentucky for Vice President this year, one of the greatest legislators that ever was in the Congress. He ranks with Henry Clay and those other great men of Kentucky.', 'Kentucky will take the place of Texas in the Congress, if Kentucky will just send a Democratic delegation to the Congress. You know, there was a time when Texas controlled all the principal committees in Congress under their chairmanships. Kentucky this time will have a Vice President. Kentucky, if it has a delegation in the Congress, will have some of the greatest chairmanships there are in the Congress.', ""Don't fail to do that now.

I know you are really with me on that request.', 'The key question in this campaign is whether we are going to keep running smoothly under a Democratic administration or whether we are going to let the country slide backward. I have known a lot of good Republicans in my life, but the Republican leadership of the 80th Congress have never listened to them, they have been doing what the lobbies said, not what the people said. This Congress has been completely surrounded with lobbies. More lobbies worked for this Both Congress than ever before in the history of the country. And they accomplished their purpose. This Congress did not work for the welfare of the whole people, they worked for the benefit of the lobbyists and the special interests. That is the reason I am very anxious for you to make a change there.', 'I told you last night in Louisville that there ought to be a change, you ought to change that Congress and put in a Democratic Congress that will work for the people. I am very sure that is what you are going to do before you get through.', ""Now if you remember, back in 1932, the Democratic administration is the difference between 15-cent corn and $1.47 corn, the difference between 8 1/2-cent tobacco and 50-cent tobacco. I don't believe you want to turn the clock back to the old days of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, and again go broke and have all your farms foreclosed, as was done in 1932. Last year there were fewer foreclosures than ever before in the history of the country."", ""You people who get your living from the soil, in my opinion had better go to the polls on election day and vote in your own special interest, and that is the interest of all the people.

It is country that reminds me of home. We have a part of Missouri that looks exactly like Kentucky.

The Democrats usually sustain me on my vetoes, and I put through more vetoes than any President except Grover Cleveland.', 'I want you to keep in mind that this is a crusade for the people against special privilege, and if you want to make that crusade work here in Kentucky, you will send Virgil Chapman to the Senate, and Joe Bates back to the House of Representatives, and then I will have some people to support me in the next administration--for I expect to be the next President--who will not allow the undermining of the program which the Democrats set up in 1933 for the farmer.', ""As you know, if it weren't for the price support program, which was inaugurated by the Democrats in the Agricultural Adjustment Act, you would be back probably getting 8 cents a pound for your tobacco, 3 cents a pound for hogs, and 15 cents a bushel for corn, and a quarter a bushel for wheat. That policy was inaugurated by the Democrats, with an objective in view: to put the farmers on a parity with industry, and that parity has been working."", ""We have a price support program that has caused the farmer to create a production situation that is the greatest in the history of the world. We have produced in the last 7 years food to feed ourselves and our army while it was in the field, and food to keep the world from starving to death. If it hadn't been for this country's wonderful production, encouraged by Democratic policies, millions of people would have starved to death."", 'Now then, the Republicans, as soon as they got the chance, tried to undermine that program.

In 1934 the Democratic administration put through the Wagner Act. the Magna Carta of labor. Labor began to get its rightful share of the national income. And that's what the Democrats believe in. It believes that every single person should have a rightful share of the national income. The Republicans want the big fellows at the top to get the income and let a little trickle down to the everyday fellow."", 'Now, what did the Republicans do as soon as they got control of this ""do-nothing"" 80th Republican Congress? They passed the Taft-Hartley Act to weaken the strength of organized labor. The whole purpose of the Taft-Hartley Act is to undermine unions. And if labor is unable to secure decent wages so as to maintain its purchasing power our whole economy will suffer--not just labor alone. That\'s why I vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act.', ""You see, when the income is fairly distributed-when the farmers get high prices and can have great production and are assured that they are going to get fair prices for that great production, when labor gets fair wages, when the merchants can sell their merchandise at a fair profit, when the white-collar man has a fair salary--that means that everybody is getting a fair share of the good things of life. And that's what the Democratic Party stands for."", 'The Republicans aren\'t satisfied with all the damage they have done in this 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress. They want to finish tearing up the Wagner Act. They want to finish putting the farmer back where he\'ll get 3 cents for his hogs, 8 1/2 cents for his tobacco, 15 cents for corn, and a quarter a bushel for wheat.', ""Now, I'm going to prove to you that the Republicans are not through with either labor or the farmer."", ""One of the authors of the act, Congressman Hartley, proposed only a few days ago to bring the unions under the laws against monopolies. That's a typical Republican Party act. They want to put the laboringman, in his fight for good wages, in the same class with the billion-dollar corporation. They want to do that so they can cut down on the workingman's share of the national income."", 'It will be up to you on election day to determine whether you want that kind of Government or not for the next 4 years.

Huntington has a great river port, and when you have a great river port, you can always make those fellows behave on freight rates.', 'One of the chief difficulties now is high prices and inflation. The farmers are getting good prices for their products, the laboringmen are getting good wages, but the special interests were very careful to see to it that we did not get the necessary laws to control inflation. So, those increased wages and increased prices are usually eaten up by the inflationary prices for the things you have to buy.', 'I did my best to get things stopped, but I had no luck with this 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress.

But the Republicans have been trying to cut down the living standards of workers even more. They have been trying to weaken labor unions so that unions no longer can fight for better wages and working conditions for their members.', ""That is why the Republican 80th Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act.

It covers about 3/4 of the things pressed on us very strenuously by the employers.""', 'I vetoed the Taft-Hartley Act, and I shall do everything in my power to get this vicious, antilabor legislation wiped off the statute books.

And I wish you would read my veto on that. Then you would understand just exactly how I feel on the subject. Then they passed a law to undermine the farmers.

You cannot make a greater sacrifice than that, my friends, for this great country--and you cannot make too great a sacrifice for this great country, I will say that to you, too.', 'You are faced now with one of the most important campaigns in the history of this great United States. This is a campaign, the issue of which is the people against the special interests. That is the issue in this campaign, and if you want to meet that issue, you will not fail to study just exactly what the Republican Party stands for and what the Republican candidate is preaching.', 'The Republican candidate was nominated over here across the river in Philadelphia, and they wrote a platform over there, and that platform is the most hypocritical document that I ever read in my life. When I read that platform, I decided I would go out and tell the people just how many lies it contained; and when I read that platform I decided I would call them back into special session and see whether they meant it or not.', ""They didn't mean a word of that platform, as they showed in the special session."", 'I asked them for price control. I asked them for housing. I asked them for several things in which you are vitally interested. And then, you will remember, that Republican Congress who claimed to have been the friend of the people, wrote that terrible Taft-Hartley Act which took the liberties away from labor.', ""But, they were very careful to write a rich man's tax bill, which took care of their friends, all right."", 'Camden is vitally interested in housing. When I first became an occupant of the White House, I asked the Congress for a housing bill which would help meet the situation with which you are faced right here, and with which they are faced over across the river in Philadelphia. But did they do anything about it? They did not. That last session of the 80th ""do-nothing"" Republican Congress passed a fake housing bill, and are now trying to make you believe that they passed a housing bill. That bill is not worth the paper it\'s written on, so far as the welfare of the people is concerned, the real estate lobby has seen to that.', 'I wish I had time to stand here this afternoon and discuss with you all the issues in this campaign, but it would take me all night to do it. I am going to discuss some of them over in Philadelphia tonight, and I hope you will listen to what I have to say, because it is of vital interest to you and to the country.', ""Now then, in order for you to do your duty, you must get out early on election day, and you must elect a Democratic Senator from New Jersey -- Archie Alexander. Don't forget that now."", ""And you must elect a Democratic Congressman from this district--John Dungess.

I want to tell you what kind of law that was, but just so I won't be accused of making a partisan statement, I'll quote from a Republican Senator--one who has had more experience in labor matters than any other Republican in the Senate."", 'This is what Republican Senator Wayne Morse said about the Taft-Hartley Act, and I quote from the Congressional Record. This is what he said: ""This bill is a device for making unions so weak they cannot carry on effective collective bargaining.""

I don't believe the American people think so, either. And on November the 2d, I believe the American people will repudiate the enemies of labor at the ballot box."", ""Now, let's get back to that famous 80th Congress."", 'I am not attacking the institution of the Congress. I served in Congress for 10 years and I am proud of that service. The Congress is one of the great bulwarks of our liberties. That is why I am unhappy when the control of Congress falls into bad hands.', 'I am not attacking all the individual members of the 80th Congress. For many of them were fine, forward-looking men-doing all they could for the people. I might add that those fine, forward-looking men were Democrats.', 'The 80th Congress was controlled by its Republican leadership. That is the same leadership that would control the next Congress, if the Republicans were in the majority. That is the leadership that made the record that tells you what you can expect from the Republican Party.', 'It was an unholy alliance between the Republican Party and big business that actually created the most pressing domestic problem facing the country today--the high cost of living.', 'Let me tell you some history.', 'During the war, such a large part of our national production was required for war purposes that we were not able to meet all the civilian demands at home. Of course, when the demand for goods greatly exceeds the supply, prices naturally go up.', 'To prevent this, President Roosevelt proposed, and a Democratic Congress adopted, price controls. We made sure that the goods which were available would be sold at a fair price, and would be fairly distributed. We made sure that the wages and salaries we were earning would not lose their purchasing power during the wartime.', 'From the time of President Roosevelt\'s ""hold-the-line"" order in May 1943 until the Republicans killed effective price control in 1946, prices remained almost unchanged. They increased only 6 1/2 percent. This was the greatest job of stabilizing a wartime economy any country ever did.', 'There was no good reason why prices could not have been held down after the war ended--until supply caught up with demand.', 'Our Democratic administration had a careful plan for keeping controls on goods in short supply, and gradually taking them off as supply caught up with demand. Under that plan, the country would have gone forward steadily and firmly to a peacetime economy.', ""But the unholy alliance of big business and the Republican Party did not want it that way. Big business wanted to make more money. Corporate profits, even under price control, were more than double what they had been before the war. But that wasn't enough for big business."", 'So the biggest corporations in the country chipped in $3 million to one organization to convince the American people that price control was bad. This $3 million campaign was a huge success. The National Association of Manufacturers actually boasted about it. They said that when NAM started the campaign against OPA, a survey showed 85 percent of the people believed that OPA was absolutely necessary. They said in November 1946, after the NAM campaign, only 26 percent of the people believed that OPA was vital. You see how that organization misled everybody in the country.', 'Once public support was destroyed, it was not too hard to get the law changed. The Republican leaders in Congress were ready, willing, and able. They killed OPA by amending it to death.', 'They were so proud of their accomplishment that Senator Wherry, the Republican whip, stated to the lumber manufacturers, and I quote Senator Wherry, who is the Republican whip in the Senate: ""It was the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House that was responsible for ending OPA.""', 'That, of course, is not the story they tell you now. They blame high prices on everything and everybody, except the Republican Party and excessive business profits.', ""They're using the farmer as their whipping boy in the cities, and labor as their whipping boy on the farm. Apparently, they figure that, if they can get the city folks good and mad at the farmers, and get the farmers good and mad at the city folks, they will have unity."", ""I want to say something to you here and now--because I don't talk out of both sides of my mouth at the same time. I am just as strong for the welfare of the farmer as I am for the welfare of the city worker. I believe the prosperity of one helps the prosperity of the other. I want you to know that I am in favor of fair prices for the farmer, just as I want the farmer to know that I am in favor of good wages for labor."", 'Farm price supports have not caused high prices. As a matter of fact, the farm price support program is a great blessing to city people. It has resulted in such great increases in farm production that consumer prices are far lower than they would be, if we had no farm price support program.', 'Now, how about our workers? Since OPA was killed in 1946, workers have been on a treadmill, running as hard as they could trying to keep from falling behind. And workers have been losing the race. While weekly earnings have gone up 22 percent, prices have gone up 29 percent.', 'White-collar workers, retired people, disabled veterans, and others on fixed incomes have taken an even worse beating.', 'It could all have been easily avoided.', 'The Republicans will, of course, tell you that every price increase has been made necessary by wage increases.', 'Now, since OPA was killed, big business has made every cost-of-living wage increase the excuse for rising prices. And those price increases have paid for wage increases many times over.', 'Look at the steel industry, for example. It had a wage increase recently which will cost it $160 million. So it increased prices enough to bring in $600 million more--more than 3Â½ times as much as the industry needed to cover wage increases.', 'No wonder corporate profits have increased 70 percent since the end of OPA.', ""That's the true story of why prices are so big."", ""That's the story you'll never get from the big corporations."", ""That's the story you'll never read in the reactionary Republican papers."", ""That's the story you'll never hear from Republican campaign orators."", ""The murder of price control is a skeleton in the Republican family closet, and they don't want to draw it out."", 'Now, there is no secret to this problem of controlling high prices. We did it before-during the war--and we could do it again.', 'I called a special session of the 80th Congress for that purpose in November 1947, when the cost of living had shot up so far that everybody could see how wrong the Republicans were with their soothing promises and prophecies of 1946. They refused to act. Prices went higher.', 'In the State of the Union Message this last January, I said that the high cost of living was the most urgent domestic problem before the Congress. Still the Republicans refused to act. And prices climbed still higher.', ""So I called this year's special session in July. And the Republican Congress again refused to act."", 'The directions received from Albany were to hang around a week or two and then go home. And they did just that.', 'The Republican attitude was summed up by Senator Taft, when he said-- and I quote him: ""If consumers think the price is too high today, they will wait until the price is lower. I feel that in time the law of supply and demand will bring prices into line.""', 'There is your answer from the Republicans. If it costs too much, just wait. If you think 15 cents too much for a loaf of bread, do without it, until it comes down.', ""If you don't want to pay 60 cents a pound for hamburger, just don't buy any hamburger, do without it--wait!"", ""How long will you have to wait? Well, I'll tell you."", ""You will never get anything done about high prices by a Republican President or a Republican Congress. Their big corporation backers don't want prices to come down."", 'But with a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, the country will get action on high prices, I can guarantee that.', 'We Democrats believe that America is big enough and prosperous enough to produce plenty for everybody.', ""We believe that we Americans have it within our power to control our Nation's destiny."", 'That is where you can do your part. Make sure that all your friends know what the issues are.', ""Don't let the Republicans hide from the truth. That is what they are trying to do now."", 'We can take heart from a comment made by that great American heavyweight champion Joe Louis. In one fight, some time ago, he had a hard time catching up with his opponent. But Joe finally did catch up with him, and he knocked him out.', 'After the fight, this was what Joe said: ""Well, he could run away, but he couldn\'t hide.""', ""Don't let the Republicans hide the truth from you."", 'We can have the kind of America we want, if the people vote for it on election day.', ""Don't let the Republicans hide the truth.

They met first in January 1947, and I went to them with a Message on the State of the Union asking for certain things. They didn't do anything I talked with them about. Then in November 1947 I called a special session and asked them to do certain things about prices, and in the interests of the general public. They did nothing. Then in my Message on the State of the Union in 1948, I put the same proposition up to them. They did nothing."", 'Then they went to Philadelphia, and they wrote the most hypocritical platform that has ever been put before the public. I called them back into session to do some of the things they said they were for. Do you know what they did? They went home without doing a single, solitary thing; and now they think they are going to fool the people.', ""They did nothing about prices. You know, Taft said that if we would let the price controls off, everything would level off, particularly clothing. Now, all you people who have to buy clothing for your children starting school this fall, know exactly what the situation is--that prices went up, and up, and up--went through the roof. Didn't hurt Mr. Taft or the economic royalists."", 'Remember those things now when you go to the polls on the 2d of November, and watch what I am saying to you people. They dare not answer me.

I addressed the Traffic Club here and explained to them something about what the accidents in this country were costing the United States.', 'Now, this time I\'ve come back to Reading and I find that the Volunteer Firemen of America are meeting here. I regret exceedingly that in the town where I grew up they didn\'t have a volunteer fire company or I certainly would have belonged to it. But that\'s been remedied. Here is what I received this morning: ""Mr. President: At a regular meeting of the Rainbow Fire Company No. 1 of Reading, Pennsylvania, held on the above date, the following resolution was unanimously passed: \'Resolved that Harry S.

Now, I'm a member of the America's Democratic Club, the oldest one in the country, and I am a member of the Volunteer Firemen's Association of the Reading Fire Company No. 1, which puts me in the National Association of Firemen. I think now I can proceed on a firefighting, whirlwind campaign, just like I have been in all along."", ""This is a wonderful reception from a wonderful town. I am more than glad that I decided to get off the train and come up here. I don't believe they could have gotten all these thousands and thousands of people around that station. It looks to me-measuring the people by the acre--it looks to me like there are 5 or 6 acres of people here this morning. I am glad so many of you want to see the President, to hear him tell the truth about the issues in this campaign."", ""I want to congratulate the Democrats on having out-registered the Republicans here two to one. That sure is a record. It's no good, though, if you don't get out on election day."", ""Some fine people come from this part of the country. One of my good friends was born near here, General Tooey Spaatz, who commanded the greatest air force that was ever assembled in the history of the world. Because of that, the Government of the United States made him a four-star General for life with full pay. That's a very great honor, and General Spaatz deserved it."", ""Then you have another very able man from this district, George Rhodes over here. And I'm sure you're going to send him to Congress from this district so that when Congress meets in January, we can eradicate some of the terrible things that that awful 80th Congress did to us."", ""There's one big issue in this campaign. That's whether the country is going to be run for the benefit of all the people by the Democrats, or whether it's going to be run for just a few special interest groups by the Republicans."", 'The Democrats believe we can keep our prosperity and have it fairly equally distributed.', 'You know, at this time the farmers have the greatest income in the history of the world. The farmers are getting a fair share of the income of this country. Last year we had an income of $217 billion in this country, and it was reasonably fairly distributed. The farmers got their share, the workingman got his share. Everybody--small business, big business, and all the businesses, all the white-collar people and everybody else got a reasonably fair share of that income.', ""Now, if the Republicans would have listened to me, it would have been much more fairly distributed. But they didn't, as I'll tell you a little bit more about later on."", ""I've been fighting for laws to curb high prices and see that everybody gets what he needs at prices he can afford to pay."", ""The Republicans don't want any price control for one very simple reason: the higher the prices go up, the bigger the profits for the corporations."", 'Just think of this: the profits of corporations have gone up 70 percent since the Republicans killed OPA. When we had price control in 1943 and 1944 the corporations earned twice what they did before the war, and in 1947 they had the greatest income, after taxes, in the history of the country. And that income is much greater this year. Last year it was $17 billion and it is estimated to be over $20 billion this year.', ""I think the American people are more interested in lower prices than they are in big profits, and I'm going to continue the fight for price control from here on."", ""Now we have another situation. Take a look at the record of the Republicans on minimum wage laws. I believe that minimum wages should be raised to at least 75 cents an hour. But the Republicans say $16 a week is enough, and in the 80th Congress they wouldn't touch the 40 cent minimum wage, although I asked them time and again to raise that minimum wage. The Republicans were too busy in the 80th Congress even to consider raising wages, but they weren't too busy to pass the Taft-Hartley law."", ""I want to raise minimum wages because it will help workers who are just barely getting along under today's Republican high prices. But I want to raise the minimum wages because it will also help the people all over the country, and particularly here in Reading. It will end the unfair competition that you are now getting from low-wage areas."", ""Let's take a quick look at another issue in this campaign. I wish I had time to thrash them all out for you but this is another in which you are interested: that is, housing."", ""The Democrats believe the Federal Government ought to step in and meet the acute housing shortage that exists all over the country. But the Republicans don't want to do anything to help clear the slums, build more rural housing, or build low-rent city housing. Now, those things are absolutely necessary for the welfare of this country, and that doesn't mean that that is going to cost the taxpayers more money because those are investments, and over a long period of time, the investment of the Federal Government can be amortized in such a way that everybody will benefit--everybody but the real estate lobbies who have been trying to get away from that sort of thing."", ""There's one thing for you to do if you want to get some help on high prices and housing and on minimum wage laws and other things that are needed.

I will just tell you about one of those issues, and then I hope you will get interested in it and inform yourselves on the facts about the others."", 'I want to tell you about the battle the Democrats have been fighting for a decent minimum wage. The minimum wage law in our history was put through under the leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 protects nearly 20 million workers. Twenty million men and women know there is a 40-cent floor below which their Government will not permit their wages to fall. Even when the law was being passed, the Republicans fought it tooth and toenail. Sixty-one percent of the House Republicans and 87 percent of the Senate Republicans voted against it; but the Democrats voted for it by an overwhelming majority and it passed both Houses.', 'By the end of the war, increases in the cost of living had made the 40 cent minimum wage obsolete. Now that is only $16 a week--40 cents an hour is only $16 a week. I wonder how many of you--if you are single--could live on $16 a week? Yet, the Republicans think you ought to live on $16 a week and support a family.', 'I asked for an increase to protect the standard of living of 5 million workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, and ever since then I have been fighting for at least a minimum wage of 75 cents an hour; but the Republicans and their big business allies are still fighting against the minimum wage--94 percent of them voted against increasing even to 60 cents an hour when it came before the Senate last year.', 'Maybe the Republicans think $24 a week is too good a wage for the average man. That is what 60 cents an hour would mean-they think $24 a week is too much for the ordinary fellow to get.', 'You people of Allentown are going to have to decide on November 2d whether or not you want a higher minimum wage law that will help everybody. It would help these people at the bottom who are having a hard time getting along, and it would help the high wage areas to stay away from unfair competition with the cheap wage areas. You are going to decide whether or not you want a decent housing program. You know, I made a recommendation for a housing program for this great country of ours to meet the situation, and which would require about an million houses between now and 1960--20 million dwellings, I will say, not houses, we want low-rent houses as well as dwellings. The Republicans have said that that is a socialistic approach, although it is an approach which would give us the necessary housing to meet our terrible shortage. Joe Grundy says that that is socialistic, and Mr. Taft had his name on that bill and I understand Joe Grundy turned him down because he said Taft was sponsoring a socialistic housing bill. Taft came back to the Senate and voted against his own bill.', ""You are going to have to decide whether or not you want to bring prices down. We have all learned from experience that a Republican President and a Republican Congress won't do anything on any of these matters."", ""Now, if you want to protect yourselves and vote for your own interest, let me advise you what to do on November 2d. Get out there to the polls early in the morning and vote the straight Democratic ticket, and you will be voting for yourselves and your own interest--and you will put me in the position where I won't be up against the housing shortage, I can stay in the White House another 4 years."", '[4.] BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA (At the railroad station, 1:40 p.m.)', 'Congressman Walter, and fellow Democrats of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania:', ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this wonderful welcome.

And yet there are a few people who seem to want to let the Republicans wreck the country again."", 'Well, two-thirds of you stayed at home-you didn\'t, here--but two-thirds of the people of the United States stayed at home in 1946 and they put in the Republican ""donothing"" Both Congress that has already done as much wrecking as it possibly can. Don\'t let that happen again.', ""I know you're not going to let it happen because you were not in that two-thirds. You sent Tad Walter back to the Congress-the right sort of a man."", ""High prices are a real threat to every one of us because if they aren't checked, they will lead straight to another bust, like we had under Herbert Hoover. But the Republicans absolutely refuse to act. The Democratic program of price control during the war kept a ceiling on prices. Everybody got what he needed at a fair price, and he got his share of what was to be distributed. The Republicans killed price control and they refused to do anything to help slow down the fantastic increases in the cost of living. I even called two special sessions of that 80th Republican Congress and asked for price control laws. Both times I asked for price control each year in the Message on the State of the Union."", 'My great running-mate, Albert Barkley, forced a showdown in the special session last July. He put my price control program directly before the Senate. He forced the Republicans to stand up and be named if they were going to vote against this bill to keep prices down. Believe it or not, 98 percent of the Republicans in Congress stood up and voted against controlling prices.', ""You here will determine on election day what kind of government you're going to have during the next 4 years. If you want to, you can turn your Government over to those who like inflation and high prices because they are thinking of making more money at your expense. Or, you can send an administration and a Congress to Washington that will extend social security, keep down the cost of living and not kick labor unions in the face, but help them move forward to greater things."", ""All I ask you and all your friends and neighbors is just to look at the record.

The only people who have prosperity under the Republicans are those who live on the fat profits made by exploiting the workers, farmers, and the common, everyday citizen. Need I remind you of what was going on here in this great city back in the Republican Hoover depression? You know what was going on. People were walking up and down the streets hunting for jobs. People were being evicted from their homes. Farmers were being thrown off their farms. Factories were closed. They gave you breadlines instead of pay lines. Remember that. That's what you're faced with now, if you let these special privilege fellows get control of ours."", 'The fundamental difference between the Democratic and Republican Parties is clear, and the record is there for all to see. Look at the record in the field of labor. The Democratic Party wrote the Wagner Labor Relations Act on the law books of our country in 1935, and I was there to help put it through the Senate. Every real American has been proud of the record labor has made under the provisions of this monumental labor law.', 'Back before the Wagner Act the union membership in this country was only about3 million. Today nearly 17 million industrious, patriotic, hard-working Americans are proud of their membership in the AF of L and CIO and many independent unions.', ""The average wage of workers in this country is three times what it was before the Wagner Act became a law. The high wages earned by our people are a tremendous factor in maintaining prosperity. High wages mean great purchasing power, and great purchasing power means that our factories and our farms will run at full production-and that's what the Democratic Party stands for."", ""Now, what is the Republican attitude toward labor? One of the first acts of the Republican 80th Congress was to take steps to destroy the Wagner Act. The Republicans in Congress did this by passing the Taft-Hartley Act. The Taft-Hartley Act was passed for one main reason--to weaken the strength of our labor unions so that ultimately wages could be forced down. That's the theory of big business, which controls the Republican Party. Big business operates on a policy that if you can force wages down you can increase the already tremendous corporation profits--and that's what the Republican Party is interested in."", 'I reject this Republican policy of trying to force wages down as a fallacy. I shall fight with all my strength not only to keep wages up but to increase them.', ""Now, the old elephant never seems to learn anything. He has fixed ideas. He's trying to make you believe he has the new look, but he hasn't. That Republican policy of forcing wages down causes the purchasing power of our workers to drop. This leads to distress on farms and it closes factories and puts people out of work in the city."", ""To maintain high wages, to keep our prosperity, to look ahead to an even higher standard of living you must vote the Democratic ticket. Don't forget that."", ""I wish I could stand here all evening and discuss the differences between the Democratic policy and the Republican policy.

The same problem exists in practically every community in this country. The need is so great that private industry and the States cannot handle it. In this audience are veterans with wives and children. They need decent homes for their families but they can\'t find them. I\'ve received letters from all over the country asking for help in finding homes. I went to the 80th Congress and told them the story. I asked for a law which would permit the Federal Government to give aid in building low-cost rental housing, the kind of housing that would contain decent living quarters for $50 or $60 a month.

The Republican slogan today is, ""Two families in every garage.""', 'That terrible real estate lobby is made up of the wealthy interests who are perfectly satisfied with the housing shortage because it keeps rents up and profits higher.

That Republican 80th Congress has repeatedly refused to restore the power to hold down prices. They have protected the excessive profits for big business but they haven't protected the buying power of your wages and salaries."", 'The record is clearest of all a little further along. Republican favoritism for big business is shown most clearly by repeated attacks on the workers. This affects all workers, whether or not they are members of unions. Big business wants to keep wages low.', ""For years the Republican Party has been the ally of big business. The workingmen and women have turned to the Democratic Party, which has always been the workingman's friend."", ""Labor suffered under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. The false prosperity of the 1920's crumbled because workers, along with farmers, were getting the little end of the stick. The Republicans would like to give the farmers and the workers the little end of the stick again. If you are fool enough to accept that little end again, you ought to have it."", ""That era of the 1920's was the era of the open shop and the yellow-dog contract; and the reckless use of labor injunctions. The strength of labor unions was reduced to less than 3 million members. Sweat shops abounded and child labor was the order of the day. When the crash came, labor suffered the brunt of it."", 'In 1932, more than 12 million men and women were unemployed. Wages-for those lucky enough to have jobs--were about 45 cents an hour.', 'In 1933, this Government got a President and a Congress with a heart. They cared something about labor. They cared something about the farmers. They cared something about the people--more than they did about money.', 'The Democratic Party set out to do something for the people and did it. We did something for labor, not at the expense of anybody else but to round out a program for the good of all the people. We gave real protection to the right of workers to join together in their own unions. We gave national recognition to the right of collective bargaining. We established a minimum wage and outlawed the sweat shops. We saved homes from foreclosures and helped to provide new homes on terms that workers could afford.', ""If you remember, back in 1932, 123,000 farmers were kicked off their farms. Last year, there were less than 800 who couldn't pay the interest on their mortgage. People were pushed out of their homes so fast that when the Democrats came in, they had to form the great Home Owners Loan Corporation which saved millions of homes for millions of people. The Republicans didn't do anything about it."", 'We provided protection against the loss of earnings due to old age and death.', 'The Democratic Party gave the country a New Deal. And that New Deal paid off too. It was good for the country. It was good for labor. It was good for the farmer. It was good for every citizen in the United States.', ""There is this difference: We have 61 million, nearly 62 million people at work in this country today. There is nobody walking the streets, hunting for a job. If a man wants a job, he has the opportunity. The farmers are in the most prosperous condition they have ever been in in the history of the world--and they are not in that condition at the expense of the country. Farmers and labor go along side by side, and when they are both prosperous the whole country is prosperous and everybody profits by it. The big corporations that they talk so much about have made more money in the last three than they ever made before in history--and that's money made after taxes. And yet they cry about it and say that we are trying to hold them down. Why, they are in better condition now than they have ever been in history."", ""Now, when a man does work these days, his hourly pay is about three times as much as it was in 1932. Now, labor unions have 16 million members, and that's a good thing for the whole country. Some people have complained that the Democratic Party paid too much attention to the things that labor wanted. I'm going to confess something to you; I've gotten a lot of advice from labor leaders, and most of it has been good advice. When it wasn't good, I didn't take it. They have the welfare of the country at heart just as much as anybody--and I will say, a great deal more than a lot of people. And I intend to keep getting advice like that for the next 4 years."", 'One of the worst things that ever happened was the election of that Both Congress. That interrupted our progress.', 'I have talked a lot about this Republican, ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress, and there is a very good reason for my talking about them. That Congress has shown clearly what we can expect from the Republican Party. That\'s the reason I\'ve been going after them hammer and tongs.', 'So far as labor is concerned, the Republicans made this very clear. They passed the Taft-Hartley to weaken the strength of labor unions. They refused to increase the minimum wage above 40 cents an hour, although 40 cents will only buy about as much as 23 cents would buy when the minimum wage law was first passed. They wrecked the Labor Department. This tells you what to expect from them in the future.', 'They have done the same thing to the farmer. They started in to wreck the farmer, just as they have tried to wreck the laborer.', 'And the record of the 80th Congress is the handwriting on the wall--""MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN."" They better beware.', 'Do you want an even stronger labor legislation than the Taft-Hartley law? Do you? Then you better not vote the Republican ticket. Do you want to return to sweat shop wages in the United States? All right-vote Democratic. Do you want your social security benefits endangered? Well then, you better not vote Republican. Do you want to play second fiddle to big business? All right--vote the Democratic ticket on the second of November.', ""The Democratic Party offers you another choice. You can apply the same test to the Democratic Party that you apply to the Republican Party. What does the Democratic Party promise you, and does its past performance back up those promises? The record of the Democratic Party is a record of performance. All we ask is that you look at the record. The record shows that you can count on the Democratic Party because it is your party, the people's party."", 'What do you want your Government to do ? Do you think the minimum wage ought to be more than 40 cents an hour? All right--vote the Democratic ticket. Do you think the Taft-Hartley Act ought to be replaced by a law that gives labor a fair deal ? All right, remember--vote the Democratic ticket on the second of November. Do you feel that social security benefits ought to be increased? Vote Democratic. Do you believe in a government that puts people ahead of property, that thinks the little fellow has just as many rights as the big fellow? All right--then you better vote the Democratic ticket.', 'Now, this, my friends, is a great Nation. This is the greatest Nation in the history of the world, the greatest Republic the sun has ever shown upon, and we got that way because we have a government of and by and for the people.', 'This Government believes in ideals that are an inspiration to people all over the world. Our great economic strength is the bulwark of democracy through the whole world. Our opportunities and our obligations extend far beyond our own shores. We can contribute as no other nation ever could to building a peaceful world. And, my friends, peace in the world comes before everything else.', ""I wish to repeat: I work for peace and I pray for peace because it's much more important to have peace in this world than for me to be President of the United States. But, we can make our full contribution to peace only if we maintain a strong and vigorous democracy at home. To do that, we must fight for the great causes in which we so deeply believe--for equal treatment and equal opportunity for all the people. A return to reactionary government in the United States would be a tragedy not only for this country but for the whole world and every person in the world."", ""My friends, we just can't let that happen. It will not happen if the people of America turn out in full force on election day. That, my friends, is your sacred duty. You owe that to the country."", 'Remember, the second of November is the day of destiny. Be sure you vote on that day and send this country down the right road.', 'NOTE; In the course of his remarks on October 7 the President referred to Democratic candidates for Representative Harry Keller, George M. Rhodes, and Wynn James, Jr., Mayor John F. Davis of Reading, former Representative Daniel K. Hoch, Mayor Donald V. Hock of Allentown, Mayor David L. Lawrence of Pittsburgh, former Senator Joseph R.

35,Harry S Truman ,"October 08, 1948","['[1.] ALBANY, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 8:25 a.m.)', 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for that introduction, I appreciate it most highly. I am very glad to be in Albany this morning, and I want to say to you that this is the first real Democratic day we have had on this trip.', 'I am more than happy to have your Mayor, your Congressman William T. Byrne and State Senator Peter Dalesandro here on the platform with me. The Mayor of Baltimore has almost that same name, and I always have trouble saying it.', 'I understand that Peter Dalesandro owns the Congressional Medal of Honor for valor in combat against the enemies of the United States. I hung that medal around his neck at the White House about 2 years ago, and I told him at that time that I would much rather have that Medal of Honor than to be President, and I feel the same way about it today. That is the greatest honor that can come to any man. That means that he is willing, and has been willing, to do things outside the line of duty in the service of his country. Since I have been President of the United States, it has been my privilege to present that medal to more heroes than it has ever been presented to before. I have had some wonderful conversations with these men about their ideas and what they believe about the welfare of the world and their country. Every one of them is a solid citizen of the United States, and believes in what this Government stands for--and that is a wonderful thing.', 'I have been told that Albany is a very prosperous city. You know, the main issue in this campaign is simple. Are we going to keep on the high road to prosperity together, or are we going to let ourselves be bamboozled into another depression.', 'Here in New York State, the Republican Party has been forced to take a few steps along progressive lines, laid down by Alfred E. Smith, Herbert Lehman and Franklin D. Roosevelt. They had to go along whether they wanted to or not. But the Republican Party still stands for the old policies of taking care of the rich and letting the rest of us shift for ourselves.', 'The people of Albany know the difference between a Republican administration and a Democratic administration. You know it, because you have been voting for Democratic candidates in your city for a long, long time. I know that most of you will recall the difference in prosperity under the Republicans and the Democrats.', 'In 1946 under a Democratic administration, and before the Republicans killed our price control bill and brought on high prices, the total personal income of New York residents amounted to nearly $23 billion. In 1932 it amounted to $8 billion. You are getting three times as much income now in the State of New York as you did under the Republicans.', 'Do you want to go back to that situation? All right then, you had better vote the Democratic ticket!', 'The total national income is now $217 billion. Sixty-one million people have jobs-more people at work than ever before in the history of the country.', 'The farmers are more prosperous, the businessmen are more prosperous. Why in the world do you want to upset the apple cart now and throw the administration out that brought on this situation ?', ""The total national income of $217 billion is the greatest in the history of all the world, and that income is distributed on a fair basis, everybody gets his fair share of that income. It is not a special privilege distribution. That is the reason the Republicans don't like it."", ""We also believe in making investments for peace. The Democratic Party has taken the lead in working to create conditions of peace throughout the world. The first requirements of peace are sound and prosperous free nations all over the world. We are rebuilding war-torn countries, and strengthening the free nations against communism by such programs as the policy in Greece and Turkey, the Marshall plan, and the extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements. The Republicans at this last session tried to hamstring the Reciprocal Trade Agreements. That is just the first step back to isolationism. They haven't changed a bit in their policies, and you cannot afford to take a chance on this situation now."", 'We are faced with the greatest campaign so far as the people are concerned, in the history of this country for a long, long time. This is merely a campaign in the interests of the people against the special interests--and that is your interest.', 'I am not asking you to vote for me, particularly, on election day. I am asking you to go out and vote for yourselves. Vote for the interests of the United States. Vote for the interests of the people of the United States. And when you do that you will just walk into that booth early in the morning of November 2d, and vote a straight Democratic ticket, and then you will be safe and sound.', ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate your willingness to turn out at this time of day on a morning like this. It shows that you are really interested in the welfare of this country. Keep it up, now, until November 2d."", '[2.] SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK (10 a.m.)', 'Thank you very much. I appreciate this welcome more than I can tell you. I appreciate the high compliment that your good Mayor has paid to me, and I hope that I can live up to it for the next 4 years. I think I Can.', 'You know, I have been going up and down these United States of America, meeting people, talking to people, and telling the people just what the issues are in this campaign, and telling them in very plain language just where I stand on those issues. I think you are entitled to know what those issues are. This is one of the most important campaigns in the history of the country. You are going to make a decision on election day as to whether you want your Government operated for special privilege or whether you want it operated in the interests of the people, as it has been for the last 16 years. I base those statements on facts which have taken place as a result of two-thirds of you staying at home in 1946 and electing this awful Both Congress which has tried its best to give the country back to the special interests. If I had not been standing there with the veto, they would have succeeded in it.', ""One of the first things they did was to pass a law putting a halter on labor. Then they passed that awful Taft-Hartley bill which takes some of the liberties away from labor-it's a step in the direction in which they want to go."", 'You see, when the Democrats got control of the Government in 1933, one of the first things that they did was to pass a bill of rights for labor, known as the Wagner Labor Act--Senator Wagner of New York sponsored that bill. That bill has been in effect for 16 years, and it has made the workingman prosperous. When that bill went into effect, there were 3 million members of labor unions. Today there are nearly 17 million men in labor unions that are working for the benefit of the country.', ""The next thing that they attempted to do was to put the farmers out of business. Now, the farmer's interests and the laboringman's interests and the small businessman's interests are all the same. When farmers and laborers are prosperous, the country is prosperous. In 1932 we had 15 million people walking the streets trying to find someplace to work. We now have 61 million people at work, and any man who wants a job can have it, and his rights are protected under the laws put on the books by the Democratic administration during the last 16 years."", 'I understand you have a very fine college here in this town, and that you have got a very able professor running for Congress. I want to say a word or two to you about the educational situation in this country.', 'The educational plant in this country has become, to some extent, obsolete, because there are so many more people interested in education now than ever before in the history of the country. Young people have found out that there is one thing that cannot be taken away from them and that is the brains they have in their heads. If they organize those brains and educate them as they should, their outlook on life is much better for the country and for themselves.', ""Well now, the educational plant of the country and the pay of teachers is below what it ought to be for a country as rich and prosperous as we are. But we inaugurated the Federal aid to education bill, and that bill passed the Senate but the Republicans killed it in the House. They don't want Federal aid to education. I am anxious to see that educational bill become the law, so that every young man and young woman in this country who wants it may have an education that will fit him for his future in life."", ""That is the best safeguard there is against communism. When you have an educated people, communism hasn't a chance in the world."", ""So, let's go to work, and get that educational bill. Let's protect the farmer, let's protect the laboringman, and in order to do that you must get yourselves registered now and get on the books. You have got today and tomorrow to do that in this part of New York. Get on the books because if you are not you cannot vote."", ""I don't want to see the electorate stay at home this time. Your responsibility is the Government of the United States, and if you exercise that responsibility you are bound to have good government."", ""I can't begin to tell you how very much I appreciate this turnout in this great city. I have been here on several occasions, inspecting plants during the war when I was chairman of the committee to examine the national defense program. I always had a welcome here. Way back in 1935 when I first went to the Senate, I came here to Schenectady and made a farm speech. That farm speech is just as good today as the day I made it. If the farmers look after their own interests, they will still be for the man who made that speech here in Schenectady in 1935."", ""I could stand here and discuss with you the issues in this campaign from now until noon, but I haven't got time and there are several things I have not mentioned, but I want you to get your book out and study these issues and then make up your mind in your own interest."", 'When you go to the polls, you are not voting for me. When you vote the Democratic ticket, you are voting for yourselves-you are voting for your own best interests. Just think that one over.', ""If you do that--there are a lot of things I could have talked to you about--if you do that, I won't be troubled with the housing shortage, I will stay in the White House for another 4 years."", '[3.] AMSTERDAM, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 10:30 a.m.)', 'Ladies and gentlemen:', 'You know, I certainly do highly appreciate this turnout. I thank Mayor Carter most sincerely for that fine introduction, and I hope he is a good prophet, that I will be the next President of the United States--and I think he is right.', 'This is a very happy day for me to be in your city of Amsterdam. During the war, it was my business as chairman of the special Senate committee investigating the defense program to become somewhat familiar with your factories here in this city. You made a great contribution to the war effort. You turned your factories over from warwork to peace work and you did it expeditiously. I want to express my appreciation as President of the United States for the contribution that you made.', 'Now, this campaign that I am making up and down the country is a campaign in the interests of the people. This is a campaign in which I am trying to explain to you that it is your own interest that you vote for on November 2d. It is not necessarily me you are electing President, you are voting for your own interests--for this campaign is a campaign of the people against the special interests. The Republican Congress conclusively proved that, as soon as they got control.', ""What was the first thing they did when they got control of the Congress of the United States? They immediately began to tear up labor's bill of rights. The first thing they did was to try and amend the Wagner Labor Act so it would no longer work in the interests of labor, but would work in the interests of special privilege."", 'I vetoed that, and I hope every one of you will read that veto message, because it strikes at the fundamental foundation of the Democratic plan to make the Government for all the people.', 'The next thing they did was to try to tear up the farm program. They tried to leave the farmer out on a limb so he could no longer have a floor under his prices, and they are trying to tell the people that that floor under prices to the farmers is causing the high cost of living. That is not true. You cannot tell how much the price support program has been worth to this great country of ours, because the farmer was willing to go out and raise tremendous crops that have been necessary to feed the world and to keep enough in this country so that prices would not go sky high.', 'If these people had been willing to give me the necessary controls for allocation of these things, everybody would have had his fair share, and prices would not have been out of sight.', 'I want you to weigh these things. I want you to consider very carefully the record of the Congressman in this district, then I think you will want to vote for Professor Murphy for Congressman from this district, who knows what these issues are and has been trying to tell you what they are.', ""The best interests are the people's interests-in voting for a government that is of the people and for the people."", 'Now, you are the Government. You are yourselves the Government, when you exercise your rights to vote. When you do not exercise that right to vote, you are shirking your duty.', ""In 1946 two-thirds of the people of the United States who were entitled to vote stayed away from the polls--and look what they received as a result of that! They got a Congress that immediately began working for special privilege. There were more lobbyists and more higher paid lobbyists around this 80th Congress than ever before in the history of the country. And those lobbyists got just what they wanted. The real estate lobby kept the housing bill from going through. The big corporation lobbyists got the Taft-Hartley bill through. Mr. Taft said that he wrote that bill for the benefit of employers. I don't think that is anything to brag about."", 'I want you to study all the things for special privilege that would have gone through if I had not been standing there in the interests of the people with the veto. Why, I vetoed more bills than any other President since Grover Cleveland, and I am proud of that record because I was working in the interests of the everyday man in this country.', ""Now, let me give you just a good piece of advice. I understand that today and tomorrow are the last days for registration. I want to get every voter who is entitled to the privilege on the books, then I want him on the 2d of November to get up very early in the morning to go to the polls and vote the Democratic ticket straight--then the country will be safe for another 4 years and I won't have a housing problem myself."", '[4.] LITTLE FALLS, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 11:25 a.m.)', 'Thank you. Thank you very, very much. You know, it is very, very encouraging when people are willing to come out on a morning like this to get information on what the issues are in this political campaign. In nearly every place we have been this morning, the weather has been just like this, yet it looks as if everybody in the surrounding territory had come out to look at their President, to see what he looks like, and hear what he has to say. That is most encouraging.', 'You know, this is quite a community. I was in the Senate for about 10 years. A long time ago, you used to make a lot of good cheese here. The Senator from Wisconsin-his name was Ryan Duffy--brought a cheese down to the Senate that was about that high, and about as big around as a wagon wheel--weighed 300 pounds; and the Senator from New York who at that time was Dr. Royal Copeland, said he knew a place in New York where he could get a better cheese and that he would get it on his next trip back--and he did. But you make other things here now. Naturally, the world moves along.', ""That is what I am trying to get over to you in this campaign. We don't want to turn the clock back, and go back--go back. We want to go forward--go forward. But you can't go forward when you have a legislative body that is made up of a lot of pull-backs as that Both Congress is."", ""Please don't send another Congress to Washington like that, because if you do, you will get just what you deserve. You know, some two-thirds of the people of the United States stayed away from the polls on election day in 1946, and they sent that Congress there by a one-third vote of the United States. That Congress immediately began to turn the clock back. You can't turn the clock back. In the 1920's, we tried our best to turn the clock back, and go back into our shells, go back to 1908. It didn't work."", 'Now we are faced with another situation where it is necessary to have that clock move forward and in order to have that clock move forward you must have people in charge of the Government who have a forward-looking outlook.', 'Just as soon as this 80th Congress got to Washington, it began to tear up the labor laws, it tried to tie the hands of labor again so they could not collectively bargain effectively with industry. The Wagner Act, as you know, was named after Senator Wagner of New York which gave labor its bill of rights. That bill of rights has been successful over this 10-year period.', ""In 1932 there were just about 3 million men who were organized. There are 17 million now. In 1932 there were some 12 to 15 million people who didn't have any jobs. There isn't anybody now that hasn't a job if he wants it. There are 61,200,000 people at work in this country--the greatest labor force in the history of the world; and that doesn't include the military, or anything like that, that means people who are working productively for the welfare of this country."", ""Now, I want to keep that going. I want to keep the clock running forward, I don't want to turn it back."", ""This Both Congress was not satisfied with trying to cut the throat of labor, it went to work on the farmer. The farmers were in an awful fix in 1932. One hundred and twenty-three thousand of them were kicked off their farms because they couldn't pay the interest on the mortgages. Do you know how many farmers lost their farms last year for that reason? Less than 800. The farmers' income at that time, in 1932, was $4,500 million. You know what it was last year? It was $18 billion."", 'The income of the whole Nation in 1947 was $217 billion--the greatest income any country ever had in the history of the world; and that income has been reasonably distributed. That income has been distributed so that labor had its fair share, so that the farmer had his fair share, so that small business had its fair share, and so that big business had its fair share--but it wants more than its fair share now.', ""You know, the profits of big business in 1939 were about $5 billion--they were $8 billion in 1943--they were $17 billion in 1947, and they are going to run over 20 billions now. They will try to run that up at the expense of the farmers and the laboring people. They will use a Congress like the 80th Congress to do that. You can't afford to let that happen to you."", 'When you go to the polls on the second of November, you ought to elect this good man who is running on the Democratic ticket here in your district because he will go along with me for the next 4 years and work for the people.', ""Vote for yourselves on election day--that's all you need to do. You not only vote for me but you vote for yourselves. Don't forget that now."", 'Get yourselves registered in these last 2 days and then go out on election day and vote for your own interests. When you do that, you will vote the Democratic ticket straight.', 'Thank you very much.', '[5.] UTICA, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 12:10 p.m.)', 'Mr. Mayor, and fellow Democrats of Utica:', 'This is certainly heartening and encouraging, when the citizens of this great country are interested enough in the views of the president of the United States, to turn out at this time of day and on a day like this-although this is Democratic weather.', ""I have been most agreeably surprised and heartened at the way the people have turned out since I started to tour the United States and instruct them on just what the issues are in this campaign. They are very grave issues, and you must study them very carefully--and then I want to urge you to vote in your own interest. If you know what your interests are, and if you know what the issues are, you can't help but do just one thing on election day, and that is to vote for yourselves--and if you do that, you will vote the Democratic ticket."", ""Over the last 15 to 16 years, the Democratic Party has been in control of the Government, and we took some very forward-looking steps while we had control of the Congress. We passed the Fair Labor Standards Act, better known as the Wagner Labor Relations Act. That act was labor's Magna Carta, that act gave labor certain rights and privileges. Then, in addition to that, we abolished child labor--we put a floor under wages--we passed the farm program which has caused the farmers to become more prosperous than they ever were in the history of the world."", ""We so arranged things and passed laws to prevent monopolies from taking over the entire business of the country. Well now, in 1946, about one-third of the people exercised that privilege to vote. You are a shirker when you don't exercise your voting privilege, because you are the Government. When you exercise that voting privilege, you run the Government. When you don't exercise it, you get just what you got in 1946 you got this backward-looking Congress, the 80th Congress, which has been going to turn the clock back ever since they met in January 1947."", ""The very first thing they did was to hogtie labor by passing the Taft-Hartley Act which I vetoed. I wish you would read that veto message, you would find out just exact!y--I haven't the time to tell you-exactly what that Taft-Hartley Act did to labor's rights."", ""Now, under the Republicans, up to 1932, we had about 3 million people organized. Under the policies pursued by the Democratic administration, there are some 16 million people organized. At that time, in 1932, there were about 12 to 15 million men who weren't working at all, and when the Democrats came in, we began to put measures into effect which abolished that idleness of labor. Now there are 61 million people at work in this country and any man who wants a job can get one now at reasonably fair pay. There were only 3 million people in 1932--12 to 15 million walking the streets, trying to get a job."", 'Now, the income of the man who worked in 1932 was less than a third of what it is now. People who work are receiving somewhere in the neighborhood of $134 billion in income. It was less than 31 billions in 1932.', 'The farmers in 1932 received about 4 1/2 billions in income. Now they are receiving 18 billion, and they are not afraid that they are going to get kicked off their farms the next day. There have been fewer farm foreclosures in 1947 than ever before in the history of the country.', ""There are fewer people now out of work than ever before in the history of the country, and your lifetime savings are guaranteed. We haven't had a bank failure in this country in 3 years. Back in 1932, you were afraid to go into a bank for fear it would blow up in your face. That doesn't happen any more."", ""Now, I want you to weigh all these things and consider that the Republican policies haven't changed one little bit. They immediately began to show what they thought as soon as they went in there. They began to want to turn the clock back. You can't turn the clock back. We have got to go forward with progress, or we have got to go backward into the ditch."", ""Now, it is to your interests to study all these issues, and I know you are interested in them or you wouldn't be out here to listen to me this morning. Study those issues, and then as I said before, vote for yourselves-vote in your own interest."", ""When you do that you will send Jack Davies to Congress and you will send a whole Democratic Congress there for the next 4 years, and I won't have the trouble I have had in the last 2 years."", ""Why, I had to exercise my power of veto oftener than any other President of the United States except Grover Cleveland.

I understand that today and tomorrow are the last days for registration in this great part of the State of New York.

It is your fault if the Government goes wrong and you stayed at home on election day."", ""Now, get out there first thing on election morning and be sure you're right by just voting the Democratic ticket straight--the country will be safe for another 4 years, and I won't have any housing problem."", '[6.] ROME, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 12:43 p.m.)', 'Thank you very much. Thank you very much.', 'I was discussing where we were awhile ago in this great State of New York and somebody said we would be in Rome in 20 minutes, and I said, ""That\'s mighty quick-to be in Rome in 20 minutes."" And he said, ""Oh, I mean Rome, N.Y."" But I want to say to you that we are living in an age where that would not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the simple reason that we have gone forward at a terrific rate in the last decade, and in the last 30 years so much that you cannot recognize the same country when you go into it.', 'I was out in Iowa at the beginning of this tour I have been taking around the United States, and they were having a plowing contest, and there were 100,000 farmers at that meeting. And I asked them if there was any possibility of my having a chance to drive a four-mule team to a two-gang plow, and they said, ""No, that\'s obsolete. You\'re living in a past age. We have no mules on the place. You\'ll have to go to Missouri to get one."" I said, ""All right, I\'m not one to turn the clock back."" I wouldn\'t attempt to do that because when we try to turn the clock back we never profit by that procedure.', 'And from 1933 until the present day we have been turning the clock forward. We have been doing things for the welfare of the people as a whole. We gave labor a bill of rights. We gave the farmer a farm program which has made him more prosperous than he has ever been in his history. We so arranged things that the distribution of the income of this country is on a fair basis for everybody. Now, I want to keep that condition going forward.', ""But in 1946 a great many of the voters of this great country, and one-third of the people entitled to vote, elected a Congress that wants to turn the clock back. The first thing that 80th Congress did when it got in was to try to put a halter on labor. They wanted to repeal labor's bill of rights, the Fair Labor Standards Act--or the Wagner Act, as it is commonly known. The first thing they did was to pass the Taft-Hartley Act just as quickly as they could get to it, and they said they passed it so as to put labor in its place. Now, I think labor is in its place when labor is prosperous, along with industry and along with the farmers."", ""There were only 3 million people in labor organizations in 1932. There are about 16 million in those organizations now and they are getting about three times the pay they did in that day. The farmer is getting more income this year than he ever got in his history. They only received about 4Â½ billion in 1932. Last year they had 18 billion-and they weren't expecting to be sold out every minute either."", 'You know, there were 123,000 farmers taken off their farms in 1932. There were less than 800 in last year. The farm debt has been reduced. Labor is in a better condition than it has ever been in the history of the country. There are 61 million people at work in this country. Nearly anybody who wants a job can get one in this day and age. There were some 12 or 15 million people walking the streets back in 1932, wondering where the next breadcrumb was going to come from, that they could live on.', ""The Republicans, I think, would like to take you back to that condition, and I don't want to do it, and if you have your own interests at heart, you won't let them do it.

That's in your own personal interest."", ""I have been most happily and agreeably surprised in coming across this great State of New York this morning. I thought that with the weather in the condition it is nobody would be interested in hearing what the President had to say about the issues.

They want to know what the issues are, and I'm sure they are going to use their God-given intelligence in their own interests."", ""When you vote on election day you are voting for yourselves if you do your duty, because you are the Government; and if you vote the Democratic ticket you will do yourselves just as much good as you will me-and if you do that I'll still stay in the White House for another 4 years and won't have to go out house hunting, and that will be a very fine thing."", 'I want to thank you very much for this wonderful turnout. It is a compliment to the President, and I appreciate it. I want to thank our Legion friends over here for coming out here this morning.

That issue can be met if you people do your duty on election day. And you can do your duty very easily if you get yourself registered and on the books in these 2 days that are set aside for that purpose, and then get up early in the morning on election day and go down to the polls and just vote a straight Democratic ticket. Then you will be voting in your own interest.', 'There are a great many issues in this campaign.

You are the Government if you exercise the privilege that the Constitution gives you. But if you do like you did in 1946 and are too indifferent to get out and vote on election day and one-third of the backward-looking people elect a Congress that tries to turn the clock back, you have nobody to blame but yourself for the conditions that we are now faced with. I want all of you to vote this time, and then I know that the country will be in safe hands, because when the people are aroused and when the people know what the issues are we have never had any difficulty making this Government run in the interests of the people, for the people, and by the people. I am going all up and down this country telling you that your interests and my interests and the interests of all the people are at stake in this campaign.', ""Now, this Republican Congress--this 80th Congress, this backward-looking Congress-made an attempt to turn the clock back. And if you hadn't had an advocate in the White House looking after your interests, who was perfectly willing to use the veto power which the Constitution gives him, then there is no telling what would have happened in the last 2 years."", ""They tried to put a halter on labor. They tried to undermine the farm program, and they have tried with everything at their command to turn the country over to the special interests. I hope you won't let that happen, really. I hope you, here in this great progressive community, will study these issues. I hope you will carefully fill your minds with the facts. Then I don't have to fear what the result will be."", ""You know, what pleases me most at these meetings is to see so many young people, young men and young women, out here listening and gauging the situation. That's a healthy sign because this country is going to be in your hands in the next generation, and if you are well informed I will be perfectly willing to turn it over to you because I know you'll go forward and not back."", ""We can't go backwards. We tried it in 1920. This Republican Congress tried it again in 1947, but it didn't work because they couldn't carry out their program.

I know that the farmers around here and the city people here in Syracuse are pulling together as a team to provide this country with the greatest prosperity it has ever known.', 'The Democratic Party believes in that kind of teamwork--in that kind of unity. I want to see farmers and workers prosper side by side. There are some Republicans, however, who talk unity out of one side of their mouth, then do their best to set the people in the cities against the people on the farms. That is one of the things they are trying to do in this campaign. You must listen to the facts and not allow that to happen, because your interests are mutual. Whatever makes the farmer prosperous makes you prosper. What makes the everyday man prosperous makes the farmer prosper. It is mutual.', 'They are telling the city people that we have high prices because the farmer is getting too much for his crop and then they go out and tell the farmers that prices are high because workers are getting too much money in wages.', 'That is not the truth. It is a very peculiar brand of unity. It is not my brand.', 'I believe that the farmers can be prosperous only when workers in the cities are getting good wages, and I believe that you people in the cities will be prosperous only when the people out on the farms have enough money to buy what you have to sell.', 'I wish I could talk to you about all the issues in this campaign. I have been on a crusade, going around the country, telling the people just exactly what the Democratic Party stands for, and where I stand.', ""I would like you to get the Republicans to tell you where they stand on that subject. You just can't find out where the Republicans stand, for they won't tell you. They just talk in platitudes and not in facts."", 'I do not have time to talk about all the issues, but there is one I want to discuss here in this city which is famous for its great educational institutions--Syracuse University and LeMoyne College.', 'I might say right here that I am exceedingly happy to see so many of you young people out here from these schools for the simple reason that that shows you are interested in your Government and in the welfare of this country. If you will inform yourselves, you will make better future citizens, and you can also do something for your country by preventing it from going backward.', 'Now, the issue I want to discuss with you today is the issue of Federal aid to education. Schools all over the country are terribly crowded. There is a shortage of teachers. Teachers are so badly underpaid in many places that they are having to leave school and get other jobs. I consider that a tragedy; for the future welfare of the country depends on the education that you young people get.', 'I believe that every American, regardless of race or creed, color or national origin, or whether he lives in a poor area or a rich area should be entitled to and should get an education.', ""I believe that the Federal Government should provide generous assistance to States to help them improve their educational systems. I have repeatedly asked the Congress to provide Federal aid to States. In my last budget, I asked for $300 million to be provided for that purpose. But the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives killed that bill. They saw to it that the Federal aid to education bill did not even come to a vote in the House. They wouldn't let the House vote on it, because the House would have passed it, I think."", 'What do you think would happen to our schools if the Republicans got complete control of the Government next January? Let me read you what the Democratic Party platform says on that subject. This is the Democratic platform: ""We advocate Federal aid for education administered by and under control of the State. We vigorously support the authorization which was so shockingly ignored by the Republican 80th Congress for the appropriation of $300 million as a beginning of Federal aid to the States, to assist them in meeting the present educational needs. We insist upon the right of every American child to obtain a good education.""', 'Now, now, I want you to listen to the Republican platform. Listen to this Republican platform and see if you get anything out of it: ""We favor equality of educational opportunity, and the improvement of education and educational facilities.""', ""That's all they say. They don't say much, or how to do it or how they will do it, or what they will do. They just make a lot of platitudes just like they have in their campaigns. The Republican Party ducked the issue. I do not see any hope of Federal aid to the State for education if the Republican Party gets control of the Government."", 'You know that the present Republican leadership of your great State of New York claims to have done wonders for your New York schools since 1942. They even said that State assistance for schools has been increased by 80 percent since 1942. I am afraid that is not quite an accurate statement. State aid to schools in New York last year represented an actual payment increase of only 28 percent over the year the present Governor took office. It seems to me there is a big difference between 80 percent and 28 percent. Educational experts have compiled figures which show that this great State of New York is now trailing in 37th place in the adjustment for pupil expenditures to the rising costs between 1940 and 1947.', ""Now, New York State shouldn't do that. If New York State had a forward-looking Governor, it wouldn't do that. New York State aid to schools, in proportion to local support, has actually dropped since 1940. The true facts are that even the State of New York under Republican rule has not provided additional funds for education sufficient to meet increased costs. When you see what has been happening in so prosperous a State as yours, I am sure you can understand why the Democratic Party believes that Federal aid to education is vitally necessary."", 'I wish I could talk to you about more of these issues which you are faced with in this campaign--about extending social security, raising minimum wages, providing a national health program, and our needs for comprehensive housing laws which would give us better housing at prices people can afford to pay.', ""I want you to study the record on each one of these issues. You will find that the Republican Party stands for those policies which would unify us under the rule of big business and special privilege. But the Democratic Party stands for 'progress--for programs which will unify our people in the interests of the whole Nation and the whole world."", 'Now, you have got one great privilege in this country, and that is the privilege of controlling your Government.

One hundred and twenty-three thousand farmers were dispossessed in 1932. Now, last year there were less than 800 farmers who lost their farms because they couldn't pay the interest on their mortgages. And those mortgages have been reduced by more than 50 percent. The farmer's income has been increased from $4,500 million to $18 billion in 1947--and he will have a greater income this year because he has a bigger crop and is getting a fair price for it.

The Veterans Bureau in the early 1920's was unfortunately used as an opportunity for grafters and shysters to get rich. Dishonesty in the Veterans Bureau in the 1920's cost the Government $200 million, and several officials went to jail.

Veterans received mustering-out pay and readjustment allowances to help fit them back into civilian life; and second, there has been an excellent medical care program for the wounded and the sick. Third, the veterans have received educational and vocational training so that they may be prepared for the best possible jobs-and you know, we had a terrible time getting that educational program implemented. The heads of colleges in this country decided that the veteran wouldn't be a good student, that he would be a nuisance, that he would cause them trouble because in a lot of cases he was married and he would have to have his family at school with him.

And corn now in the Middle West is selling for 47 cents under the support price, and the speculators are getting the difference between that and the price way above the support price that corn is bringing on the farm market."", 'That Republican Congress crippled our electrical program for the benefit of the power lobby. You know, there are certain great developments in this country. The St. Lawrence Waterway is one of those great developments that I would like to see carried to its proper conclusion. But there are great developments all over this country which furnish public power to municipalities at the cost at the dam by having power lines to take that power to those municipalities. This Republican Congress cut all the appropriations to build those power lines. They did that because the power lobby was working on that.', ""My veto stopped the Republican Congress from passing the tidelands oil bill for the benefit of the oil lobby. You know, there has been a great deal of talk about these tidelands. You know what the tidelands are? Tidelands are the lands from high tide to low tide, and nobody has ever made the contention that the tidelands did not belong to the States--that is, from high tide to low tide. But the people of the United States own the resources under the land outside that low tide, and it ought to go to all the people and not to a few oil millionaires. That's what I'm fighting for. Now, this Republican Congress passed a rich man's tax bill over my veto. I vetoed that bill three times. It was a terrible bill when it first came to me and it was a terrible bill the last time it came to me, but it wasn't quite as bad then as it was the first two times I vetoed it. They passed that bill for the benefit of the rich. Fellows making $100,000 a year saved $16,000 on that rich man's tax bill; and the fellow making $60 a week saved $1.50 a week--and that $1.50 a week went for high prices which they wouldn't help me control."", ""That Republican Congress took away, over my veto, social security benefits for a million people. And they said, in their platform of 1944, that they wanted to spread social security. That's just like the platform they wrote in Philadelphia--that hypocritical platform that I gave them a chance to carry out in that special session, which they didn't do."", 'I have told you now what they have done to the taxpayer and what they have done to the farmer. The next crack they took was at labor.', ""You see, we passed a labor act in 1935 known as the Magna Carta of labor. That's the Fair Labor Standards Act, better known as the Wagner Labor Act. Well, you know what they did. They passed the Taft-Hartley law which put a halter on labor, which tied labor up. Mr. Taft himself said he did everything that the employers wanted."", ""Now, that Wagner Act has helped to create the prosperity in this country, just as the Farm Support Act helped to create prosperity among the farmers. In 1932 there were 3 million people who were organized. Last year there were 16 million people who were organized, and they were getting three times the pay they got in 1932--and if you remember, there were 12 million people walking in the streets trying to get jobs, and they couldn't get them. Now we have got 61 million people at work, and nobody has to do without a job. If he wants to work, he can get it."", ""Now, that's a condition that never has been in this country before, to my memory, and it happened under a Democratic administration."", ""Well, I told you part of the record of that 80th Congress. I wish I had time to stand here all night and tell you all about it. It would take me all night to do it. They didn't do a thing in your favor--I can tell you that."", ""Now, it is your duty to go to the polls in November and elect a Congress that will be genuinely interested in legislation for the welfare of the country as a whole, and not for just a few people. Legislation ought to be for the whole people--the whole 145 million of you--and not for just a few fellows who want to exploit the rest of you. That is the sort of thing you'll get if you stay at home, as you did in 1946. Right here in this town you stayed at home in 1946, and if you hadn't stayed at home, you might still have Rogers in Congress and have some representation that will work for your benefit."", 'I have the figures here, and I\'m going to assure you that I know exactly what I was talking about w-hen I said that two-thirds of the people stayed away from the polls. These are the figures: In 1944, this town cast 90,000 votes--this town cast 93,369 votes for the Democrats and 88,762 for the Republicans. In 1946, because you were fat and lazy and didn\'t think it would make any difference, 55,531 Democrats voted and 84,862 Republicans voted. Now, there were 4,000 fewer Republicans who voted in 1946 than voted in 1944, but there were 45,000 Democrats who didn\'t vote. And they got just exactly what they deserved-they got the 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress.', ""Now, when you do go to the polls in November, I want to tell you what you ought to vote for. You ought to vote for a party that believes in holding down prices to a fair level, and vote for a party that believes in providing Federal aid to education. That is the best antidote to communism I know of. Vote for extending social security instead of cutting it down. Vote for permanent farm legislation to insure farm prosperity, because unless the farmers and laborers and small business and white-collar people are prosperous the country can't be prosperous if just one of them exploits the other. That's what the Democratic Party stands for. The Democratic Party stands for the people. The Democratic Party is your party. It is the party of the everyday man. Its interest is in the whole people and not just one segment of the population."", ""When you go to the polls, vote for yourself. Vote for yourself, and if you vote for yourself, you'll vote the Democratic ticket-and I'll stay in the White House another 4 years, and won't be troubled with the housing shortage."", '[13.] BATAVIA, NEW YORK (Rear platform, 7:40 p.m.)', 'Mr. Chairman:', 'Thank you very much. It certainly is uplifting to come out here and see all these good people who have come out to find out just exactly what the President looks like, and what he believes, and what he is trying to do. I have had a most pleasant day across this great State of New York today. The weather has not been what it should be, in nearly every place except Rochester and here it has been pouring down rain every time the train stopped, yet people came out in spite of the rain because they are interested in the issues in this campaign, and they want to find out just what their President thinks. I think they want to find out what he looks like and I think they want to find out whether all this propaganda that has been put out--about the President not being able to do his job--is true or not.', ""Now, what I want you to do is to study the issues in this campaign. The Republicans say there are no issues and they are talking platitudes about home, about home and mother, and what a wonderful thing unity is, and a lot of other things that have nothing whatever to do with the issues in this campaign. You see, they are ashamed of that 80th Congress, they don't like to talk about its record, so they talk about something else."", ""I don't. I talk about the record of that 80th Congress, and I talk about the record of the Democratic Party. I like the people to know where I stand. See if you can find out where the other fellow stands. I bet you can't. I bet he won't answer any questions that you put to him on the issues in this campaign."", 'When you come out this way, I know that you are interested in the welfare of this Nation. You are interested in whether this Government is run by those who believe in special privilege, or whether it is run in the interest of the people; and that is the issue in this campaign--the people against special privilege. That has been the issue right along between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. The Democrats have always stood for the people. They still stand for the people, and it has been conclusively proven by the actions of this last Congress.', 'You know, for 16 years--it will be 16 years on the 20th of January--the first Monday in March, because President Roosevelt was sworn in under the old law--in March it will be 16 years that the Democrats have been in control of this Government. They took it over when things were at their very lowest. There were 12 million unemployed. Farmers were losing their farms wholesale. Banks were closing so fast that you were afraid to go into one for fear it would blow up in your face. That was true all down the line.', ""When the Democrats took over in March 1933, they began immediately to put legislation on the books which would cure all those ills. One of the first things they did was to pass a farm support act. That farm act took the farmers out of their doldrums. Instead of 123 thousand farmers losing their farms as they did in 1932, last year less than 800 farms were foreclosed. The farmers' income in 1932 was about $4 1/2 billion. Last year it was $18 billion. There were 12 million unemployed. There were 3 million members in labor unions in 1932. Last year there were 16 million members in labor unions. This year there are 61 million people employed, and if a fellow wants a job he doesn't have to walk the streets, he can get one. That was not true in 1932."", ""Now, these people are asking you to go back to that situation. These people who have been in control of the 80th Congress want to turn the clock back. The clock won't run backwards, it runs forwards, and you want to go forward with the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is the forward-looking party, it is the party that looks after the people. It is the party that you should vote for, because you will be voting for your own interests when you do that. You won't be voting for me, you will be voting for yourself."", ""Go to the polls and vote to keep the forward-looking party in control of your Government for another 4 years. I think that is just exactly what you are going to do, or you wouldn't be turning out this way."", ""You won't find out the facts from Republican platitudes, you won't find out the facts from Republican press, because they don't want you to know the facts. They know that you will do the right thing if you know the facts and vote the Democratic ticket. Now, be sure and go to the polls on the 2d of November and vote for yourself and your own interest, and then I will stay in the White House another 4 years and I won't be troubled with the housing shortage."", ""Again, I can't tell you how very much I appreciate your interest in the welfare of this country. I think that is what the turnouts mean. I think you are interested in the welfare of the country. I am particularly interested when I see young people here, because the young people are going to run this country in the next 20 or 30 years. I wish I were 14 instead of 64 so I could see the next 50 years of development in this country. I think we are facing the greatest age in history, and if you don't turn things back to those people who want to turn the clock back, you will see the greatest age in history."", ""Of course, if you want to go backwards, go on backward, but you won't go that way long. Go to the polls, now, on November 2d, and vote for yourself. Vote the straight Democratic ticket, and the country will be safe for another 4 years, I can assure you of that.""]"

They are years which are likely to hold the answer to two great questions in the hearts of most of us today.', 'These questions I can briefly sum up as: (1) war or peace? (2) hard times or prosperity?', 'Now, as to the first question, war or peace.', 'I know that every right-thinking American wants peace.', 'I believe that our prayers will be answered and that we will have peace. No one wants peace in the world more than I do. I have said time and again that I would rather have peace in the world than to be President of the United States.', 'Of course, present world conditions are of grave concern to all of us. Because of these conditions, I have found it necessary to cancel visits I had planned to make to a number of cities tomorrow. I must return to Washington to meet with Secretary of State Marshall, who is flying back from Paris to confer with me. I shall discuss with Secretary Marshall means for working out constructive and peaceful solutions to our problems abroad, within the framework of our basic American principles, and within the framework of the United Nations.', 'I am sorry to disappoint so many of my friends whom I had expected to see tomorrow. But I know that they will forgive me.', 'Now, tonight I am going to talk to you about the second great question I mentioned-hard times or prosperity. The election in November clearly presents that question to the people of the United States.', ""Of course, there is no open argument on this question. Nobody wants hard times. Everybody wants prosperity. The Republicans are quite sincere in saying that they want prosperity just as much as the Democrats. I believe they do. Who doesn't?"", 'But the leaders who now control the Republican Party want prosperity for special privilege groups first, and for other people, if they can get it. They want high profits for their campaign contributors, and high prices for special interest lobbies.', 'In the mad scramble to get that selfish kind of prosperity, they forget about the rest of the country. They forget about the needs of the farmer, and labor, and small business. They forget about housewives struggling with their budgets, and families using up their savings to meet the high cost of living. They forget about the prosperity of the consumers and wage earners of this country.', 'Then, of course, their own prosperity goes to smash under those circumstances, and they are all in depression together.', 'Real prosperity is based on justice. Real prosperity depends on fair treatment for all groups of our society. That\'s a rule as old as the Bible. That\'s what the Bible means when it says, and I quote: ""We are....every one members, one of another."" That is the very thing the economists have found out about our economy, after 50 years of studying booms and depressions.', 'We judge people and parties by what they do, not by what they say. We judge the Democratic Party by its record of achievement over the last 16 years.', 'We judge the Republican Party by its record of the last 2 years in the Congress where it has had absolute control of the legislative branch of the Government, and complete responsibility for that branch.', 'If we look at that record, we can see that the Republican leadership has changed very little in its policies since the days of Hoover. And we can see that the Republican Party is following the same fatal course--privileges for the few, neglect of the many--that led us into the disaster of 1929.', ""I know that this kind of talk is very painful to Republican leaders. I can't help that."", 'The Republicans say I ought not to talk about the past. They would like us to forget the period from 1929 to 1932.', 'They would like to forget it themselves, I am sure.', ""Let me assure you that when I talk about the Republican past, I do so with regret. I wish with all my heart that the Republican Party no longer had anything in common with the party that produced the depression of the 1930's."", 'But it is important for the people of this country to recognize that time has not changed the fundamental outlook of the Republican Party since it was last in power.', ""The leopard has not changed his spots; he has merely hired some public relations experts. They have taught him to wear sheep's clothing, and to purr sweet nothings about unity in a soothing voice."", ""But it's the same old leopard."", 'The Republican strategy in this campaign is increasingly clear. The Republicans have carefully appraised their assets and liabilities and have reached the conclusion that they have one main liability and one main asset.', 'The liability is the issues in this campaign.', ""They have concluded that their record is so bad on the important issues of the day, that they can't even discuss them."", 'The problems that affect the welfare of every person in this country are completely ignored by the Republican orators.', 'Now the main asset of the Republicans is the tremendous financial support they are receiving.', 'Much of it is being utilized to conduct a widespread propaganda campaign designed to fool you into believing that the result of this coming election is a foregone conclusion. How wrong they are!', 'I believe that the American people will not be fooled by this insidious propaganda.', 'I believe that the American people--and not the propagandists for special interests-will decide in whose hands their government will be placed.', 'Now let us look at some of the issues in this campaign.', 'I do not claim that all Democrats are perfect or that all Democratic Congressmen are wise. But in general, most Democrats vote for the people, and most Republicans vote for special interests.', 'Just take, as an example, my proposals for the control of high prices. In 1947, in the Senate, 90 percent of the Democrats voted for these proposals, and 10 percent of the Democrats against them; but only 5 percent of the Republicans voted for them, and 95 percent of the Republicans voted against those proposals. In 1948, 81 percent of the Democrats voted for these proposals to hold prices down, and 98 percent of the Republicans voted against them.', 'I want you to realize that when I speak of the actions of the Republican Both Congress, I am speaking of actions which represent the prevailing views of those who control the Republican Party. That Congress was merely a symbol and instrument of Republican Party policy.', 'Lately there has been talk by Republicans that while the 80th Congress might have been pretty bad--and I say it is more than pretty bad--that has nothing to do with the Republican leaders. They are attempting to build up the illusion that a Republican Congress and the Republican candidate for President do not stand for the same policies. Can you beat that?', 'Well, the Republican candidate has now dispelled that illusion. He has indorsed the Both Congress. He said, and I quote: ""The 80th Congress delivered as no other Congress ever did for the future of the country."" How they delivered !', 'Make no mistake: When we talk of the failures of the 80th Congress, we are talking of the policies of the Republican candidates, as well as most of the Republican Congressmen and Senators. They are tarred with the same brush--that brush that big business uses to brush off the needs and the claims of the people.', 'Now the point I want to drive home to you and to all the people of the United States is this: Your prosperity is endangered by the Republican policies.', 'I want you to look at the facts, think about them, and be guided by them.', 'And I am not asking you to vote for the Democratic Party, just because during the past 16 years, Democratic policies turned hard times into good times. What I want you to do is to look at the present Democratic policies, as they affect you and your family in the years ahead.', ""Let's take a specific example."", ""Let's take the struggle to get sufficient housing in this country."", 'This year, in the United States of America, 5 million families are living in slums and fire traps. Another 4 million families are living in houses that will soon become slums unless something is done to prevent it. Three million families, including many families of war veterans, are living doubled up with other families.', 'And things are getting worse. There are twice as many couples getting married each year as there are homes being built.', 'This housing situation is intolerable and inexcusable. A great, rich country like ours can afford decent homes for its citizens.', 'We must do three things: We must build more houses, we must build homes that people--particularly young people--can afford, and we must clear out and rebuild the slums.', ""Houses are being built--by private enterprise, as they should be. But they aren't being built in sufficient numbers, or at low enough prices. And without Government help, they can't be. Without Government help, cities are not financially able to wipe out their slums."", 'So the Government has a big and important role to play in housing, not in conflict or competition with private enterprise, but supplementing it.', 'In my postwar message to the Congress, I urged early action by the Congress to enact a real housing program to meet these needs. That was in September 1945--3 years ago. My Message on the State of the Union, September 26, with 21 points in it, had one on housing.', 'A splendid bill for this purpose was introduced. It was sponsored by two Democratic Senators and one Republican. One of the Democrats was your own fighting, great liberal--Bob Wagner.', 'The other Democratic Senator was Senator Ellender of Louisiana, and the Republican was Senator Taft of Ohio.', 'I was hopeful that we could start helping our people with their housing problems. But I did not reckon with the influence of the real estate lobby.', 'The real estate people have one of the most powerful, best organized, and most brazen lobbies in Washington. And the Republican Party has proved to be its faithful servant.', 'The Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill passed the Senate in 1946, but was blocked by the Republican members of a House committee in the House of Representatives.', 'In 1947, we had the Republican 80th Congress--and you got that by staying at home and not doing your duty--and the housing bill was introduced again. The Republican leadership in the Senate stalled for time.', 'Do you know what they did?', 'They set up a joint committee to find out if there was a housing shortage.', 'I sent a message to Congress asking them please to hurry up and do something. Housing conditions were getting worse and worse, and are getting worse and worse.', 'Thereupon, the Senate passed the bill for a second time and it went to the House. There were enough favorable votes in the House to pass it, if it ever came to a vote. So the Republican leadership decided to keep it from coming to a vote. They pulled every trick in the parliamentary book, and some that had never been heard of before; and they were successful in keeping that housing bill from passing. It was a most shameful performance.', 'The Democrats tried again and again, in both the Senate and House, to get that bill through.', 'But they were blocked at every turn by the Republicans. And the sad truth is that the Republican leadership in the Congress murdered that housing bill.', ""Congress adjourned shortly after that, and the Republicans went to their convention in Philadelphia, and they drafted a platform plank on housing. And what do you think that plank said? Don't be surprised now. It announced the stern determination of the Republican Party to provide Federal housing aid for local slum clearance and low-rent housing programs--the very provisions they have been fighting against so hard for 3 years."", ""Beat that, if you can! That wasn't all the tommyrot they put in that platform, they put a lot of things in that platform that they had been fighting me on ever since I came to the presidency."", ""And then I got a glimmer of hope--not much, but a little. I thought they really wouldn't dare go back on their own platform--at least, not until the ink was dry on it--and that they might now pass the legislation they promised to the people. And I called them into special session, you remember, when I made that acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention."", 'Well, you remember what happened.', ""I called the Congress back into special session. I pointed out that unless it acted on housing, the next Congress would have to begin all over again, and there would be another year's delay. I asked the Congress again to pass the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. You see, they turned it around. In the beginning it was the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill, and they turned it around and called it the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill."", 'Were the Republicans grateful for the chance to prove they meant what they said ? Not a bit! They accused me of playing politics.', 'Now, we come to the end of this sorry story of Republican trickery.', 'Senator Taft himself--one of the sponsors of the bill--turned against it, and asked the Senate to kill it--to kill his own bill.', 'Also very interesting is the fact that one of your Senators from New York--who is, close to the Republican candidate for President--had the chance to take a position or the housing bill.', 'And Senator Ives voted against the bill. So the Senate killed the Taft-Ellender Wagner bill, and the Congress passed a bill, which does nothing about low-cost public housing, nothing about slum clearance, nothing about rural housing--nothing, in short, that they said they would do for the people in their platform.', 'One of the aims of my administration has been to give all our people a chance to have decent housing. Our major effort has been to enlarge the effective field of private enterprise and to give public support only to housing for those low-income families that private enterprise cannot serve.', 'The Republican Congress flatly refused to aid those low-income families.', 'What was the result of this great Republican runaround ? The real estate lobby won. And the people of the United States lost-lost homes they could have had--lost years of health and happiness in decent surroundings that might have been theirs.', 'I have gone into this story at length because it shows the way in which the Republican Party has thwarted the will of the people.', 'Republican policies are depriving millions of families of the housing they need. Republican policies are keeping up prices of much of the food you eat, and the clothing you buy.', 'And worst of all, these Republican policies, by permitting inflation to continue without proper curbs, are threatening the very foundations of our prosperity. They are not only injuring American living standards by high prices--they are also pushing the country into the terrible risk of another crash and another depression.', 'That is why I must say to you that a Republican victory in November would be a victory for a policy that makes for hard times.', 'The Democratic Party is not perfect, but its leadership, its policies, and the great majority of the Democratic Members of Congress stand squarely behind a policy aimed to preserve the prosperity of the people. That, my friends, is the major issue in this campaign.', 'That is why I feel justified tonight in asking you to cast your votes, on election day, for a Democratic administration that has faith in the people, and that plays fair with the people.', 'And we shall need a Democratic Congress this time. We need a Democratic Congress to protect your pocketbooks, your homes, your futures, and the happiness of your children.', ""Ever since I started out in this campaign, I have urged the people to exercise their rights in the Government. The Government is yours, if you are willing to accept the responsibility, and when you accept that responsibility, you will go to the polls on election day and vote your sentiments. I have been urging everybody in these United States to be sure to go to the polls on November 2d, and to vote for themselves, vote for their own interests, vote for the people's interest. And when you do that, you can't do but one thing, and that is to vote the Democratic ticket straight."", ""A Democratic administration is what this country needs--what we all need. And it's very easy to get."", 'All we have to do is to go to the polls and get it--if you do your duty.', ""I am urging you with everything I have now--don't shirk your duty this time, as you did in 1946. You will get something worse than the 80th Congress, if you do!""]"

I appreciate that reception more than I can tell you, and I would, of course, like to have it continued, but you know this radio time is paid for--we want the full benefit from our investment.', 'I cannot come anywhere near expressing my appreciation for the cordiality of the welcome I have received in Cincinnati this morning. I have had that sort of welcome all over the United States. I was most agreeably surprised, last Friday, when we landed in Albany, N.Y., and it was raining just as it is here this morning. It rained from one end of New York to the other all the way to Buffalo, yet people turned out in immense numbers and stood in the rain. That makes me believe that people are really interested in this campaign with which we are faced. I think people are interested in knowing what the facts are.', 'In staid, old Philadelphia, that town turned out to see us and there were 800,000 people on the streets. There were 16,000 came to the Convention Hall where I was nominated for President, to hear the issues, and there were radio stations and television setups. So you know people must be interested in the issues when they will do that.', ""You have a great city here on the banks of this Ohio River, and one of the reasons why I think so is that you now have a Democratic Mayor. He tells me he is the first Democrat that has been Mayor of Cincinnati for 35 years. That is certainly something to be proud of, and I think it shows what the people are thinking and the way the trends are going. I think the whole country knows how you organized the city charter movement here in Cincinnati in the early 1920's, when local Republican leaders had just about wrecked the city. A short time after that, I think it was in 1930, I paid a visit to Hamilton County, Ohio, because you had an assessment system here that seemed to me to be a just one. I tried to get that system implemented in Jackson County, Mo., when I was head of the government there in Jackson, but I didn't have any luck; but I still think you have a great assessment system. I didn't know whether it is still in effect or not, but it seemed to be the most just one in the country."", 'Now, some Republican leaders in the 80th Congress, which I call the notorious, ""donothing"" Republican Congress, almost wrecked our chances for keeping prosperity. They did wreck the hopes of the American people for fair labor laws, good housing legislation, and all the other progressive measures which we need so badly now.', ""We are in the middle of an election campaign right now. The Republican candidate for President has made a good many headlines with clever talk about unity. He claims that if he is elected there will be unity. I don't know what he means by that. I am going to try to analyze it the best I can. Of course, we don't know what he means by unity because he won't tell the country where he stands on any of the issues in which the American people are so deeply interested."", ""Since he won't tell us, we will have to look at the record of the men who run the party-the men who would be in power if the Republicans are elected."", 'I think you here in Cincinnati are in a good position to know just what Republican unity would mean. I think, in fact, you know better than people anywhere else in the country.', ""Now, let's take a look at that record. It shows just what the preachers of unity believe in."", 'Republicans led the fight to destroy price control in 1946. They have led the fight ever since to prevent the restoration of controls which are so badly needed by the American people to prevent runaway inflation. They took the lead in putting handcuffs on labor. The Taft-Hartley Act in 1947 was a deliberate effort to weaken labor unions for the benefit of employers.', 'In that Taft-Hartley bill, Senator Taft said about that bill, and I quote him: ""This bill is not a milk-toast bill. It covers about three-fourths of the things pressed on us very strenuously by the employers."" I don\'t think labor was very carefully listened to when that bill was passed. I wish everyone of you could read the veto message which I sent to Congress on that bill.', 'Under Republican leadership, Senators consistently refused to provide Federal funds to help States meet the crisis in education. You know, we have an educational crisis right in this country. There are thousands and thousands of young men and young women who are thirsting for an education, and there are thousands and thousands of children in the grade schools who are not getting the proper education because one teacher cannot do very well when she has 50 or 60 or 70 pupils, as some of them have to do.', 'We urged a Federal program under the direction of the States which would help meet that situation. The Republicans killed that bill in the House. They are not interested in that phase of the educational situation.', 'The Republicans supported a measure that took social security away from at least a million people in this country, yet their platform of 1944 made it very plain that they were for an increased base for social security. But their acts in the 80th Congress did not prove that they meant what they said in that platform.', 'You remember, I called a special session, on the basis of the Republican platform at Philadelphia, which said they were for a lot of things, which they had turned down in the regular session of Congress, and they could turn them down even in the special session.', 'They have consistently opposed a sound national health program. This is only a part of the recent record of the Republican Party, but it is enough to show us what Republican unity would mean in terms of backward-looking laws, and narrow-minded class legislation.', 'There are, of course, some rank and file members of the Republican Party who hold liberal views. I am sure that they would like to take some of the Republican campaign oratory at its face value. But the frank statements of my friend Bob Taft ought to dispel any hope they may have that the Republican Party may follow a liberal course if its candidates are elected.', 'Now, I served in the Senate with Bob, and I like him personally. There is one thing I do like about him: You know where he stands; that is more than you can say of some of the Republican candidates. Bob is frankly--he is frankly conservative. He believes in the welfare of the top ahead of the welfare of the bottom. But he is frank about it, and I can understand that. While he and I are personally on the friendliest of terms, we are as far apart as the poles on what we think is best for the welfare of the people of this country.', 'When the Republican candidate for Vice President made a campaign speech that contained a few liberal phrases, Bob had this to say, and I quote him, ""You know that is contrary to everything I stand for."" He was talking about Governor Warren when he said that. Well, there you have it. The Republicans don\'t even have unity in their campaign oratory. The only kind of unity they would have in office would be the kind we don\'t want: that oppressive unity forced on us by the big bosses of the Republican Party.', ""Don't let anybody fool you, if they send a Republican Congress back there it won't be a bit different from the 80th Congress, it will be run by exactly the same men, it will put through exactly the same program--and I don't care what the man in the White House will do about it, he will be just as helpless to do anything about it as I have been in the last 2 years. All I could do was exercise my veto power, but vetoing pays, to a very great extent, against that kind of thing."", 'All of you probably know that I made a good many critical remarks about this 80th Congress. I think that is putting it rather mildly, but I admit that in one way we are very lucky to have had the 80th Congress. It taught us a lesson. It taught us a lesson before it was too late. The 80th Congress taught us what to expect from the Republican Party. We found out what Republican campaign promises really mean. We find out that they do not mean a thing. They are not worth the paper they are written on.', ""If you will examine the Republican Party's platform of 1944, and then see the hypocritical document they wrote in Philadelphia this year, you can understand what I mean when I say Republican campaign promises are not worth the paper they are written on."", 'Now, I stand on the record. You know where I stand. I have taken a stand on every one of the issues that are before the country today. You know what I stand for.', 'But, just try to find out where the other fellow stands ! We would be hopelessly committed to an old-fashioned Republican boom-and-bust cycle if we turn the whole Government over to the Republicans.', 'This is not the kind of unity I want to see. The kind of unity we need is unity for lower prices, unity for good housing at prices our people can afford, unity for better labor management laws, unity for strengthened and extended social security, unity for a national health program--unity, in other words, for a prosperous and progressive United States.', ""I don't know whether you have analyzed the situation or not, but there are more than 61 million people at work in this country today; and everybody is prosperous, to some extent--that is, there is a distribution of the national income which was $217 billion last year and it will be greater this year--there has been an evenly fair distribution of that income. The farmer has his fair share, labor has received good wages--three times what it was back in 1932. At that time there were less than 31 million people at work, and there were 12 or 15 million people walking the streets who couldn't find jobs."", 'Now, I think it is much better to have a government whose interest is the whole people than to have a government whose interest is only for the people at the top of the heap. That is why I am convinced that the 81st Congress will be a Democratic Congress. I am convinced that you are going to elect Edward J. Breen from the First District, and Edward J. Gardner from the Second District. I am convinced that you are going to elect one of the most progressive Governors Ohio ever had--Frank Lausche.', 'I am going up and down this country, and I think I am on a crusade for the welfare of the people; and I think the people are beginning to find out that their interests are the interests that I am fighting for.', 'I think that these fellows are going to have the greatest surprise they ever had in their lives on the 3d day of November when the vote is in.', 'Now, I usually take my greatest assets around the country with me.

I had a fine reception there, and I certainly appreciate this wonderful reception here. It shows that you are interested in the issues before the country and that you want to find out just exactly what they are."", 'I want to congratulate the people of Hamilton on their fine wartime record. You made a wonderful production record. I believe that fewer man-hours were lost here due to work stoppages than in any other similar area in the country; and I visited Hamilton during the wartime to investigate that very situation and to find out how you did it. I was at that time chairman of the committee in the Senate that was investigating the war effort.', ""I want to talk to you about the crusade I am making around this country to get people to realize what this election means to them--and it is a crusade. I have to come out and face the people personally and individually and tell them just what the issues are, or they won't find out--and that's what I am doing. My Republican opponents talk about sweet nothings. They don't discuss the issues, and if I didn't come out and face you people and tell you what those issues are, and bring them to your minds, you would never know anything about them. It means a lot to me but it means more to you."", 'I am going to repeat that: this election means a great deal to me but it means much more to you.', ""I am speaking to you plainly and honestly. I think you know that my opponents in this campaign are not speaking plainly or honestly. They haven't got it in them. They are afraid to face these issues because they know there can be but one result. The candidates who do not speak honestly and clearly are trying to make you believe that there aren't any real issues in this campaign. My friends, nothing could be further from the truth. There are great problems facing this country today, and this is no time for soothing syrup. This is no time for candidates who are afraid to tell the people where they stand."", 'In my crusade I have found that most of us have three big things in our minds: peace, prices, and places to live.', 'Now, those things are all tied together. To keep the peace in the world, the United States must remain prosperous and strong. To be prosperous and strong, we must keep our country from going through another boom and bust. To be prosperous and strong and to win the peace, we must have decent places for our people to live.', ""I am proud of the record of my administration on peace, the record on prices, the record on trying to get places for people to live at costs they can afford to pay. My administration has fought communism at home and abroad so vigorously that the Russian radio hurls slanders at me everyday in the week. We have been building up the United Nations, helping small countries like Greece and Turkey keep their independence, and helping wartime European nations get back on their feet and become self-supporting again. That's why and that's the way I have been working for peace."", 'I would much rather have peace in this country than to be President of the United States. I would much rather have peace in the world than to be President of the United States--and I have said that time and again all over the country, and I mean every word of it.', ""I have been working just as hard to bring down the cost of living. I have fought for a strong price control law. In 1946 and in 1947, and in 1948 1 called the 80th Republican Congress back into special session twice, in an effort to get these backward-looking men to pass a price control bill. They wouldn't do it. So prices keep going up and up and up. I have done all our present laws permit, but that's not nearly enough to stop inflation. We need the kind of laws that the 80th Congress refused to pass, or we are headed straight for another bust."", ""As soon as the war ended, we began converting war construction into temporary homes for veterans and others, but that was not enough. I have urged the Congress over and over again to pass a comprehensive housing law that would clear slums, build rural housing, and provide low-rent public housing.

I have known him a long time--I knew him when he was Governor of Ohio before. Ohio never had a better Governor--except Governor Cox--than this one right here.', 'I am acquainted with this great city of yours. Years and years ago, long before we had paved roads in the United States, Dayton was a center of road boosters. Since I was a road booster, and still am, I used to come to Dayton and discuss with the people here in this city the necessity for a transcontinental paved highway from Baltimore to Los Angeles. We have this highway now, and we are going to get a lot of other things too.', 'It was my duty, as chairman of the committee in the Senate to investigate the national defense program, to come to Dayton and visit your great airfield here on many an occasion. I have been here during that war effort in an endeavor to make a contribution toward the winning of the war. President Roosevelt said I made such a contribution.', ""The history of the United States would have been very different--and very much better--if the American people in 1920 had elected James M. Cox and Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Presidency and Vice Presidency of this country. We would not have had those horrible scandals of the 1920's and that boom and bust program that followed the election of a Republican candidate."", 'I know you do not want to stand still with the Republican Party in this election. I believe you are going to live up to your forward-looking traditions and step ahead with the Democrats.', 'In my crusade across the country to make the people realize what this election means to them, I have found that most of us have three big things on our minds: peace, prices, and places to live.', ""Since I have been President of the United States, I have been working for 3 1/2 years to bring about a lasting peace. We have built up the United Nations. We have helped small nations stay free from communism, and we are now getting Western Europe back on its feet. This administration has been building a sound and prosperous United States. This administration's postwar economic policies have been so successful that 61 million people now have jobs, and the national income is $217 billion, the highest ever in the history of the world--and equitably distributed as the Governor stated to you."", 'Now, the one thing absolutely essential is peace in the world. You know, back in 1920 we shirked our duty. We turned our backs on what God Almighty intended us to do. We tried to live by ourselves, and for ourselves, in a perfectly selfish manner when the world needed us. We paid the penalty. We had to come along and meet that situation once more, which we thought we had met in 1920.', ""Now, this great Republic--the greatest in history, the greatest that the sun has ever shone upon--is charged with leadership in the world for the welfare of the whole world as well as our own welfare. We can't do that unless our own welfare is at top notch in this country. And that is what I am fighting for, ladies and gentlemen!"", 'We must ourselves be prosperous and lead the way if we expect the world to follow.', 'But, at the same time, we have some very serious problems which threaten our long-run prosperity. I have been concerned about them for a long time.', 'One of these problems is runaway prices-high prices. Another is housing.', ""Runaway high prices can wreck our prosperity. If inflation is allowed to continue, we shall certainly have another boom and bust, another crash--another 1929â¢ I have done everything possible under existing law to slow down inflation, but our present laws don't begin to do the job."", 'I called that Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress back into special session twice, and urged them time and again to pass price control laws that would give a break to the little people in the country. But thepublicans are only interested in those few at the top that don\'t need help--they would like to help them all the time. But the everyday fellow can get it as best he can from any Republican organization, what he can get and when he can get it; and that isn\'t very much under a Republican administration.', 'The Republican Congress flatly refused to take any step that would cut into the fantastically high profits that corporations are now making. They refused to give us the protection we need against another crash. As a result, prices keep on going up and up and up.', 'You know, the Republicans said if we got rid of price control that prices would adjust themselves. Well, they have--they have gone clear off the chart.', 'So far as our national housing problem is concerned, it is hardly necessary for me to tell the people of Dayton how badly we need a comprehensive housing law, to provide for slum clearance, rural housing, low-rent public housing, and the like.', 'The real estate lobbies have tried to convince the people that they can do the job of meeting our housing needs without the help of the Federal Government. The plain facts--here in Dayton, and in every other big city in the country--show how wrong they are.', ""The truth is that Dayton has been growing so fast that the builders cannot keep up with the city's expansion. That is true of every other great city in this country. Your population has nearly doubled in the last 10 years. You need a Federal housing program in the city to aid your builders to clear away your slums, and produce houses for working people at prices they can pay. That is the key note--at prices they can pay!"", ""They are selling shoddily-built houses to veterans all over this country that aren't worth a third of what the veterans have to pay for these houses."", 'Now, here is a statement the head of your own Municipal Housing Bureau made 1 year ago. He said--this is a quote--""In spite of new construction, Dayton\'s housing shortage is the worst it has ever been. A sharp rise in evictions and the condemning of insanitary dwelling units by city health inspectors have combined to increase the pressure of the housing pinch.""', ""That situation hasn't improved one bit anywhere in the United States. That statement was made in October of 1947. Now, 1 year later, your city Plan Board Director said that there are between 12,000 and 15,000 substandard dwelling units in Dayton alone. Now if that is the case here, what is it in New York and Philadelphia and Baltimore and Cincinnati and St. Louis and Kansas city and San Francisco and Los Angeles? It is just a duplicate of that, and proportionate to the size of the population."", 'Yet, the real estate lobby prevented the 80th Congress from doing anything about that situation, for their own selfish interests and nothing else.', ""I have been trying for over 3 years to get the Congress to pass the kind of housing law that we need. But the Republican leaders in Congress are now more interested in what the real estate lobby says than what the people of this country need. That is just as true as it can be, and that is true of a lot of other things. I hope you will listen to my broadcast tonight in Akron, I am going to take the hide off 'em from top to bottom. I hate to have to do that, but they have it coming. Just listen to the speech. When I get through that speech, they won't have any hide left."", 'When I called the 80th Congress back into special session last July and placed the facts before them, the Republican leaders still refused to pass a real housing bill. All the people got was a ""phony"" that won\'t result in one single additional low-cost house anywhere in the United States. That is typical of that Republican 80th Congress. That is typical of the Republican Party, which is represented by the leaders of this 80th Congress. They can\'t get away from that no matter how many ""sweet nothings"" they put out about unity and all that kind of speech, which means nothing--absolutely nothing.', ""I am sorry to say that is typical of the Republican candidate for President in this election. The Republican 80th Congress failed miserably in meeting its responsibilities to the American people in dealing with high prices and housing. Those weren't the only things they neglected to do. I have a long list that would keep me here from now until midnight. I wish I could explain every one of them."", 'Yet, the Republican Party candidate said, and I quote him--now listen to this: ""I am proud of the record of my party and of the 80th Congress."" I just wonder what he has got to be proud of.', 'And he said this, too--and I quote him again: ""The 80th Congress delivered as no other Congress ever did for the future of our country.""', ""I'll say they did l They delivered you into the hands of special interests, lock, stock, and barrel."", 'I say you ought to be able to decide how you are going to vote on the basis of these two statements alone.', 'The Republican candidate is standing squarely on the record of the Congress that refused to do anything about high prices. The Republican candidate praised a Congress that refused to do anything that would help you meet your housing problems.', 'Just what do you suppose the Republican candidate had in mind when he said the 80th Congress ""delivered"" for the future of the country? Well, it ""delivered"" the Taft-Hartley Act, a body blow at labor. That is one of the main ""deliveries""--don\'t forget that. It ""delivered"" a body blow at more than three-quarters of a million workers by taking away their social security rights that the Republican Party said they wanted to spread the base on social security rights. That Republican Party platform is not worth the paper it is written on.', 'It ""delivered"" for the rich by passing a rich man\'s tax bill. The man who is getting $100,000 a year income would save $16,000 a year by that rich man\'s tax bill. The man who is getting $60 a week would save $1.50 a week on that tax bill. Of course, prices have now taken care of that $1.50 a week, so he is way behind.', 'The Republican Congress ""delivered"" for the railroad lobby, the oil lobby, the grain speculators, and for the private power lobby--and I can give you a longer list than that. I wish I had time to tell you about all the laws that Republican 80th Congress ""delivered"" for the benefit of special interests, and all these they had to make law by passing over nay veto. I vetoed more bills than any President except Grover Cleveland, and I did it in the public interest. If I hadn\'t been there to protect you, you would be in a very great fix by this time.', 'I wonder if that is the kind of Congress you want for the 81st? You had better send such fellows as these to the new Congress.', ""I am equally sure you don't want as President a man who won't tell you where he stands on any major issues that you are interested in.

You want to go forward to the 1950's."", 'Prices can be checked. I know, because we kept prices in line during the war when inflationary pressures were even greater than they are now. But the Republican leaders are more interested in big profits for big business right now than they are in helping you meet the rising cost of living. Time and again I asked the Republican Congress to pass laws to take care of that situation. They refused to take any action. Their only excuse to you people has been a lot of false propaganda.', ""They won't discuss the issues in this campaign. they are afraid to discuss the issues in this campaign because they are on the wrong side of those issues. They tell the farmer that prices are going up because people in the cities are getting too much money in wages; and they tell the people in the cities that prices are going up because the farmers are getting too much for their crops. Both of these statements are false, and you know it. The prosperity of farmers and workers goes hand-in-hand. One is prosperous only when the other is prosperous. And that has been the policy of this administration--to make a fair distribution of the income of the country so that the farmers get their share, the workers get their share, and the small businessman gets his share. That's not what the Republicans want."", ""I'm going into some detail tonight in Adron on just what the conditions are with which we are faced and why these Republicans are afraid to discuss the issues.

In 1947, the gross income of the farmer was $31 billion; his net income was $18 billion.', 'Now, I wonder if the farmers have studied this situation carefully and understand just why that came about? You see, there was not a fair distribution of income in 1932. There were special privilege classes that claimed the income of the country, and then they hoped that a distribution would be made from the top down.', 'After the great crash of 1929, a different policy was inaugurated when we elected Franklin Roosevelt to be President of the United States in 1932. He took office in 1933, and immediately policies were established for a fair distribution of the national income, so that the farmer would get his fair share, the man who works with his hands would get his fair share, and the small businessman and white-collar worker would get his fair share. That is true of this $217 billion income we had last year--there was a fair distribution. Everybody had his fair share of that income.', 'Now, we inaugurated a policy--a labor policy, a farm policy, and a policy for the welfare of the United States as a whole--a forward-looking policy which goes along when the clock goes forward.', 'Now, these Republicans would like to turn the clock back. They had control of the Congress in 1946, because two-thirds of the people in the United States stayed at home and did not vote in 1946. They did not vote. One-third of the population in this country that was entitled to vote elected the 80th Congress.', 'Well, look what you got out of this 80th Congress. They immediately began to turn the clock back.

He is no longer exploited as a man outside the circle in this great Republic.', 'In 1932, 123,000 farmers were foreclosed in this country. Last year, less than 800 farms were foreclosed. As I said before, the farmers income was nearly 4 times as great in 1947 as it was in 1932. The general situation is entirely different now from what it was in 1932.

Now, for 3 years, in this great country of ours, there hasn't been a bank failure, due to the Federal deposit law which guarantees the deposits of those depositors who have $5,000 or less in any bank. That means that small depositors are protected, and the big depositor can take care of himself, because the bank does not fail under the conditions under which we work now."", ""Don't forget all those things I am telling you on election day.

One of the most important differences is in farm policies. Under the Republicans, the farmers don't count. The farmers are left to shift for themselves. The Republicans are interested in looking after the interests of the big manufacturers of the East. They are not very much interested in the welfare of the farmer. The Democratic leaders know that the farmers of this country are the foundation on which the welfare of the country is built, and that they must have fair prices for their products. That is the reason for the farm price support program which was carried forward by this administration."", ""Let me give you some facts and figures to show you the difference between the condition of the Ohio farmers under the Republicans and the prosperity in the Democratic years. In the Republican year of 1932, Ohio farmers got $180 million for their 'products, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Now, last year the farmers in Ohio received $1,052 million for their products in the State of Ohio. And this year the Ohio farmer's income will be well above a billion dollars."", ""Those figures prove that the Democratic farm policies bring benefits to farmers all over the country--and especially to Ohio farmers--benefits that mean better clothing for Ohio families, more money in the bank-and you know, that bank is safe because we haven't had a bank failure in 3 years under the policies pursued by the Democratic administration-more schooling for the children, more tractors in the fields, and more cars on the roads."", ""If you don't want to go backward, if you don't want to slide downhill into bankruptcy and poverty the way you did under the Republican 12 years of rule back there in the 20's, you better get out early on election day and look after your own interests. I want you to remember that Republican leaders are attacking the farm price support program in the cities. They say that is what caused the high cost of living. And they tell the farmers that the good wages that the laboringman is getting causes the high cost of living. Neither one of these statements is true. When labor is prosperous, the farmers are prosperous. They go along together. Good prices for farmers and good wages for labor means that the general prosperity of the country goes to everybody and that a fair distribution of the wealth of the country is being made."", ""These Republicans keep on blaming the farmers for high prices, and then they keep on blaming labor--to the farmers--for high prices. You know, the working people can't be prosperous unless the farmers can sell their products for enough money to buy the products of the factories."", 'The Democrats are not trying to fool the farmers or the workers. We are telling you the truth and the facts, and I am going into some detail tonight in Akron on the facts and figures that affect this program that we are faced with now.', ""We are in a campaign which will go down in history as one of the most important in the history of the country. And it's your campaign. It's your welfare that is at stake. I'm asking you to exercise good judgment. Go to the polls on election day and vote for yourself. If you do that, you'll vote a straight Democratic ticket and you'll elect Dann Batt to the Congress from this district, and you'll elect Frank Lausche for Governor of Ohio--and that will be in your own interests. Don't forget that, now, because the welfare of this country is at stake. It's in your hands. You are the government. If you exercise the privileges that are yours, I'll be perfectly happy and satisfied--and I'll stay in the White House another 4 years."", '[7.] DESHLER, OHIO (Rear platform, 3:10 p.m.)', 'Thank you very much for that welcome, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that introduction highly. I want to thank you good people of Deshler for the warm and cordial reception which I have received. This is the sort of reception I have been receiving all the way across the great State of Ohio, and all over the United States for that matter. People are interested.', ""You know, I have been going all over the country on a crusade to make people realize how much they have at stake in this election. The Republican leaders hope that the voters will not wake up until it is too late. They are giving you soothing syrup, talking about unity and all that kind of business, which has nothing whatever to do with the issues in this campaign. I am waking them up, however. The Republican bosses hope that the voters will swallow the empty platitudes of the Republican candidates. I think that the Republican bosses are wrong. I don't think the people are going to do anything of the kind. I don't believe the American people want to turn their backs on the prosperity gained under a Democratic administration."", 'Over in Ottawa, I talked to the people about the progress Ohio farmers have made since the bad days of the Republican depression. I reminded them that the income of Ohio farmers has gone up to more than a billion dollars a year. At the height of the so-called boom in 1929, when the Republicans were bragging about prosperity in the Nation, the income of Ohio farmers was around $377 million just about a third of what it was here last year, a third of what it is going to be this year.', 'In 1932 the income of Ohio farmers was only $180 million. The farmers here in Ohio have done very well because the Democrats had the foresight to establish a farm price support program. The Republicans in the 80th Congress tried to pull the props from under that program.', 'The Ohio farmers are doing well, because the Democrats found markets for their products through reciprocal trade treaties with other nations and through the school lunch program. And we are trying to see to it that farm prosperity in Ohio, and all over the United States, will continue.', ""We are helping Ohio farmers to take care of their soil and to make sure that it stays rich and productive. Under the Department of Agriculture's soil conservation program, in 1 year alone, conservation work was carried out on more than 137,000 farms in Ohio. That work covered over 9Â½ million acres of land--more than 70 percent of Ohio's cropland. That is the kind of practical help Ohio is getting from a Democratic administration headed by men who know the farmers' problems."", 'Now, what would happen to these farm programs if the Republicans win the election? The record of the 80th Congress gives us the answer to that. The Republican Congress cut down funds for the soil conservation program, and the school lunch program, and they tied our reciprocal trade treaties with other countries up into knots-tried their best to beat it. They refused to ratify the International Wheat Agreements which would have guaranteed a steady market for wheat for American farms for at least 5 years to come.', 'The farm price support program was attacked on the steps of the State Capitol in Albany, N.Y., by Governor Stassen just after he had had a conference with the Republican candidate for President. That candidate has expressed complete approval of what the 80th Congress did to the farmers of this country, and I quote him: ""I am proud of the record of my party and of the 80th Congress.""', 'I am going to discuss the record of that Both Congress, to some extent, tonight in Akron.

They have got the people who produce the Nation\'s goods and the Nation\'s food--and they have got the people who are going to keep the Democratic administration in the White House and elect a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate in the coming election. The kind of unity that built Fostoria is something that I can go for. It is the kind of unity that helped build this Nation. It\'s the kind of unity that helped win the war. I can understand that and I like it. That\'s why I had that kind of unity in this administration. But I\'ll tell you frankly, I don\'t understand the phony unity that the Republican candidates are talking about. I expect that\'s just a phrase he picked up because he doesn\'t dare talk about anything else. He doesn\'t dare tell you what the real plans of the Republican Party are. He\'s afraid that if he says anything, he will give the whole show away. The Republican Party still is wrestling with its old problem: it has to figure out how to fool the many into voting for the interests of the few. That is why the Republican candidate is talking in generalities. That is why the leaders of this Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress have been sent off into the bushes to hide until the campaign is over.

He liked and respected the people who worked for him, and he recognized their right to join a union and bargain collectively.', 'Now, Dan Willard did not sneer at the ""whistlestops"" of our country.

This has been true in large cities and industrial areas and also in what Senator Taft calls ""the whistlestops.""', 'Now, as I have said time and again, there is one basic issue in this campaign. This is it: The Democratic Party and the people against special privilege and the privileged few. That is the issue in this campaign.', 'The Republicans have the propaganda and the money, but we have the people, and the people have the votes.', ""That's why we're going to win."", 'The Republicans have the money because the big corporations have found out they can get what they want from the Republican Party.', 'We have the people because the people have found out that they can get what they want from the Democratic Party.', ""The Democratic Party thinks in terms of doing things for the people--higher minimum wages, broader social security, protection in old age, better medical care, better schools and better homes, and a better life for the men and women who do the world's work."", 'That is our basic philosophy, the philosophy of the Democratic Party--service for the people--the greatest good for the greatest number. And upon that philosophy, we have erected during the past 16 years a great progressive body of laws. We call those laws--and I say it with pride--we call them the ""New Deal.""', ""The Republican politicians don't like the New Deal. They never have liked the New Deal, and they would like to get rid of it-repeal it--put it out of existence."", 'This is shown by their words and deeds. They have been talking for years about ""cleaning up"" the New Deal. Then, in 1946, the Republicans gained control of the Congress, and they began to whittle away at the New Deal laws. Now, they have tasted blood, and they are waiting eagerly for the time when they can go ahead with a Republican Congress and a Republican President and do a real hatchet job on the New Deal without any interference.', 'Let me remind you of some of the things the Republicans have been saying about this New Deal.', 'Their candidate for President has been the chief prosecutor against the New Deal. He spoke against it, he campaigned against it. He wrote a book called ""The Case Against the New Deal."" And now he wants to go to Washington and destroy it. Are you going to let him do it ?', 'One of their chief spokesmen, Senator Taft, has said, and I quote: ""The Republican program must be designed primarily to cleaning away the rubble of the . . . New Deal .""', 'The Republican leader in the House of Representatives talks of how the years of so-called Democratic misrule have conspired to strangle industry and farming.', 'I want you just to look at the figures with me for a moment.', 'The New Deal strangled industry so much that corporate profits changed from a loss-loss!--of $400 million in 1933 to a profit of $17 billion in 1947.', 'The New Deal strangled farming so much that farm income increased from $2 1/2 billion in 1933 to $18 billion in 1947.', 'That is some job of strangulation, I would say.', ""Now, let's take a look at the way the Republicans launched their attack on the New Deal as soon as they gained control of the Congress."", 'You know, two-thirds of you stayed at home in 1946, and let the Republicans get control of the Congress. This is what they did.', 'First, they started out after labor. One of the cornerstones of the New Deal was the Wagner Labor Relations Act, which gave national protection to the right of collective bargaining. Under its provisions, the labor movement had grown strong and healthy. The working people of the country were beginning to have something to say about what went on in the United States.', ""Well, our old mossback reactionary friends didn't like that. They had always thought that the people who had the money ought to run everything and they still think so. They continue to think so to this day."", ""They didn't have the courage or they didn't have the votes to repeal the Wagner Act outright. The fact was they knew they didn't have the votes to pass a straight-out repeal bill over my veto."", ""At any rate, they decided that under the pretense of revising the Wagner Act, they would load it with provisions that would undermine the strength of the labor unions, and that's what they did. They passed, over my veto, one of the most complicated laws that anybody ever saw. That was the Taft-Hartley law."", 'The Taft-Hartley law converts the Wagner Act from a charter protecting the basic rights of the workers into an instrument for union busting by antilabor employers.', 'It outlaws union security provisions which have been the basis for stability and mutually satisfactory relationships for many industries for many years.', 'It compels strike-breaking by union members-sometimes against fellow members of their own local unions.', 'It extends the use of injunctions against labor unions, and provides preferential treatment for management in connection with such injunctions.', 'It burdens unions with interminable red tape.', 'It took the Conciliation Service away from the Labor Department. This was but another blow in the vicious attack by which the Republicans have virtually wrecked the Labor Department. They said in their platforms of 1940 and 1944 and 1948 that they wanted a strong Labor Department, but they have done everything they possibly can in this 80th Congress to tear up the Labor Department.', ""Having done all these things and many more--to labor and not for labor--the Taft-Hartley law clearly demonstrates its real purpose by restricting labor's right to engage in political activities. They are afraid of your votes. Having tightened the screws on the workingman, the proponents of this scheme undertook to protect themselves from reprisal at the place where the workers of America can still make their voices count-at the ballot box."", 'In approaching the problems of labor and management, we should move forward, and not backward. I believe that the collective bargaining process should be used for achieving full employment and full production.', 'One of the great accomplishments of the Democratic administration is the Full Employment Act of 1946, which was passed by a Democratic Congress. This act provides a plan for continuing prosperity. Those old Republican mossbacks fought this bill; they called it socialistic and impracticable. But we passed it, and we now have 61 million people employed in this country.', 'The point I want to make is that, if we are to have full employment and full production, labor and management must work together.', 'That is the kind of unity the Democratic Party believes in. The unity that we have sought is a unity based upon a partnership of equals--farmer, labor and industry. This is a democracy as we understand it. This is the only way in which we believe our democratic institutions can be maintained and preserved. Any plan which seeks to weaken one group in order to establish the superior power of another is not democratic unity and threatens the basis on which our free institutions rest.', 'But the Taft-Hartley law is not the only attack the Republicans have made against the New Deal. And it is not the only attack in which they have been successful.', 'They have been hacking away at social security benefits. They passed a law-again over my veto--taking social security insurance benefits away from almost a million people.', 'Then in the face of that action, they went to Philadelphia and put a plank in their platform which says--and I quote it: ""Consistent with the vigorous existence of our competitive economy, we urge extension of the Federal old-age and survivors insurance program and increase of benefits to a more realistic level."" Now they went to Philadelphia and wrote that after they had passed a law taking a million people out from under social security.', 'Extension, indeed! Extension of the very thing they had just finished cutting down!', ""They talk about increasing benefits, too; so I promptly gave them a chance to do something about that, by calling them back into special session. And we quickly found out that we couldn't take that part of their platform seriously, either. I have never yet seen a Republican platform that you could take seriously. They talk--and the Democrats act!"", 'Now, let me say something about what they are proposing to do to the New Deal when and if they get a Republican President to go along with a Republican Congress. Their attitude has been made clear by the record, and their plans are made clear by their spokesmen.', ""One of them, a Republican Congressman--Dondero by name--from Michigan, wrote an article telling about how they plan to wreck our policy concerning public power. I told the people about that in El Paso, Tex., a couple of weeks ago. And, Dondero has been squealing since that he did not mean what he said. He says that his article in the power trust magazine was not what it said, but he meant something else. That's what they always say when you catch up with them."", 'Now, another one of their Congressmen has been doing some writing, and I want to tell you about that. This time it is your old friend Congressman Hartley, of the Taft-Hartley team. Congressman Hartley is one of the main architects of the Republican labor policy.', 'Now, Mr. Hartley has written a book.', 'And just to show you that the team is still working together in unity, Senator Taft wrote the foreword for it. There\'s the book! [Holding it up] In the foreword, Senator Taft said, and I quote: ""This book of Mr. Hartley\'s and the great work which he did during his years in Congress will always be of the greatest assistance and furnish sound guidance."" That is the windup sentence of Mr. Taft\'s foreword in Mr. Hartley\'s book on ""Our National Labor Policy""--a most interesting book. I am going to analyze it for you just a little bit because it shows just exactly where the Republicans stand.', 'The title of this book is, ""Our New National Labor Policy, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Next Steps.""', 'They are really going to do something to you if they get a chance.', ""Get that: next steps--the next steps. They aren't satisfied to stop with the Taft-Hartley Act. They are going even further."", 'Let me read to you some of the things this book says. On page 190 appears the following, and I quote:', '""The Wagner Act weakened the productive potential of this Nation. I am hopeful the Taft-Hartley Act will begin to restore the productive system on a sounder basis.""', 'Imagine that! The act under which labor produced so magnificently during the war is described as ""weakening our productive potential.""', 'Nobody knows more about that productive industry than I do because I spent my time during the war years investigating what labor was doing for the war effort--and they did a magnificent job! And so did the farmer, so did industry, so did every other segment of the population of our great Nation. There never was an effort like it, and there never was an effort more successful. I think maybe I had better read that to you out of the book--it is so good.', 'Here is another statement on page 194, and I quote--listen to this now:', '""To my mind, the Taft-Hartley Act represents the greatest single contribution made by any political party for the past two decades. It corrects in a single piece of legislation the outstanding mistakes of the New Deal. At the same time, it points the way toward a method to be utilized in correcting other errors of government initiated during the 1930\'s."" I don\'t know what those errors were, but maybe we can find out from Mr. Hartley.', 'Do you get that? The Republicans pass a law to break the bargaining power of the workingman, and they call it correcting the mistakes of the New Deal.', '""I am well aware,"" says Mr. Hartley on page 193, ""of the political difficulties of eliminating the New Deal social legislation. It cannot be repealed at a single stroke.""', ""You know, the reason he said that was because I was standing there with a veto-and he couldn't get it by."", ""Well, I certainly hope they can't repeal the New Deal legislation. I hope and pray that it can't be repealed at all."", 'Now, listen to this, and I quote again:', '""All legislation of this type requires interim treatment.""

I quote from page 192 in this great book of Mr. Hartley's--it is very, very interesting:"", '""The Fair Labor Standards Act is typical of the New Deal legislation enacted to combat the depression. Such legislation failed to affect the depression one way or another and it has definitely outlived the usefulness it was supposed ever to have had.""', ""Isn't that a revelation?"", 'I asked this Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress to increase the minimum wage from 40 cents to 75 cents an hour. They refused. There\'s the reason.', ""Now we find that they not only refuse to increase it, but they don't even want to keep the present pitiful 40-cent minimum."", ""But, on page 171 in Mr. Hartley's book appears the frankest confession in the book. I want you to listen to this carefully. This is what he says:"", '""No sooner had the Taft-Hartley law been enacted over the Truman veto than the Republican leaders of both House and Senate-listen to this now--decided that no more legislation to which organized labor could object would be passed until after the presidential election of 1948.""', 'I am giving this book a terrific plug because I want every man in the United States to read that book and find out just where the Republicans stand on a labor policy for the United States.', 'Probably make Mr. Hartley rich by making this speech--he was afraid to stand for reelection to the Congress.', 'What could be clearer than that?

You will have to act-and act quickly--if you want to save the benefits of the New Deal.', 'For myself, and for the Democratic Party, I completely reject the idea that we should ""eliminate"" the New Deal. Instead, we should build upon it a better way of life. Let me be specific.', ""I believe that we should repeal the Taft-Hartley Act. That is what the Democratic platform says.

I came here once as President of the National Old Trails Road Association and helped the Daughters of the American Revolution set up a monument in one of your parks to the pioneer mother.', ""I understand that the first setters were attracted to this wonderful place because of the rich farmlands in this area, and since then Richmond has branched out and become one of the leading industrial towns of Indiana. It's known far and wide for the great college which the Governor mentioned awhile ago, Earlham College, which pioneered in higher education in this area."", 'Richmond is a fine example of the balance that we want to see between the farms and the cities. It is a good example of the way that farm prosperity makes for industrial prosperity, and the way industrial prosperity helps the farmers.', ""The prosperity we are enjoying now did not just happen. It was the result of policies started by the Democratic administration in 1933 under Franklin Roosevelt and continued through the following years. These policies have improved the farmer's position economically, improved the worker's position in the very same way, and have caused a fair distribution of the national income to all the people. But this prosperous condition of all the people of ours has been put in grave danger by the Republican 80th Congress. I can prove to you by the record of the 80th Congress and what it did to the people of the country and not for them."", ""That Congress did its best to weaken the position of all workingmen in the United States by passing the Taft-Hartley Act. I gave that a good going over last night, and a good analysis. I hope you'll read what I had to say on that subject. The Republican leaders wanted to repeal the Wagner Act but they knew they couldn't get away with it. They refused to raise the pitifully inadequate minimum wage of 40 cents an hour. They took social security away from nearly a million workers."", ""Now, that's action. They are talking about something else this morning."", ""The Republican Congress hit at the prosperity, of every farmer of the country. It slashed funds for rural electrification and soil conservation. That Congress nearly wrecked the Reciprocal Trade Agreements program, which provides a foreign market for our crops. It refused to ratify the International Wheat Agreement which would have given us a 5-year guaranteed foreign wheat market. And the 80th Congress refused to put the farm price supports on a permanent basis, leaving every farmer in the country in doubt as to his future income. And what a boon that situation has been to the speculators l Those exploiters of the farmer are now making a killing on the fact that the 80th Congress did not do the right thing by the farmer, when it rechartered the Commodity Credit Corporation. They fixed it so the speculators can control the farm prices, and that's what they have been trying to get for the last 2 years. We have kept them from it so far, and if you do the right thing in November we'll still keep them from it."", ""It wasn't only the farmers and the workers that the Republican Both Congress hurt. Every housewife suffers every time she goes to the store for the Republican refusal to pass laws to hold down prices. And every family in the United States that lives doubled up with other families or in city slums or in country shacks suffers because the Republicans refused to pass the kind of housing laws we need."", ""Now, the record of the Republican 80th Congress is a true indication of what we can expect if the Republican Party is elected in November. That's because the same backward-looking men would control in the 81st Congress. Don't fool yourselves. You would have the same old mossbacks running the next Congress if you don't turn them out."", 'Now, the Republican candidate for President has put his stamp of approval on the record of that 80th Congress. After that Congress had failed completely to give you the laws you need, this is what the Republican candidate said about that good-for-nothing 80th Congress: ""I am proud of the record of my party and of the 80th Congress."" That\'s a direct quote from a statement of his; and this also is what he said: ""The 80th Congress delivered as no other Congress did for the future of the country."" I\'ll say it delivered. It delivered for the special interests 100 percent.', ""There isn't much reason to hope for continued prosperity, or for good housing, or for better education for our children, or a genuine national health program, or for lower prices, as long as these backward men lead the Republican Party."", ""You know what to do to get the laws you need. The way to get them is very, very simple. Go to the polls on November 2d and vote for Robert C. Oliver for Congress from this 10th District. That gentleman will work with me during the next 4 years, during the next Congress, for a peaceful and prosperous United States. Vote the Democratic ticket from top to bottom and you'll have Schricker for Governor of Indiana, and a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President. And I won't be troubled with the housing shortage--I'll live in the White House for another 4 years."", ""And then you'll know the country is in safe hands because the Democratic Party always works for you, the people, and not against you."", ""Vote for yourselves on election day. Vote for your own best interests.

And I am particularly happy to have the book from the young lady on the rooster. In 1892, when Grover Cleveland was reelected President of the United States, my father decorated a rooster weather vane with all the colors of the American flag, and that flag flew from that rooster as a sign of victory in 1892 and nearly all through Cleveland's administration. I can remember that because I was 6 years old then--I don't mind admit-ting it."", ""It's a particular pleasure for me to be here in Greenfield today. Middle Westerners like myself all look upon your town as a sort of shrine because we feel that your own great poet, James Whitcomb Riley, belongs to all of us. I understand his birthday was just a week ago and that October 7th was made an official holiday in Indiana in 1915."", 'There was a lot of down-to-earth commonsense in Whitcomb Riley\'s poems, and we could use more of that in the world today. I don\'t think there is a kid in the country that doesn\'t know Orphan Annie, and I don\'t think there is a boy in the country who doesn\'t long for the ""old swimmin\' hole."" And when you read Whitcomb Riley you read just what we people in the Middle West think and act and do. He gives us a turn that no other poet in the country has ever given.', ""The natural tendency on the part of all of us is to think of the old times as the best. We tend to forget the hard times, and remember the good times. We always remember the good things and hardly ever do we remember the things that caused us trouble-and some of us want to live in the past. You can't do that. You've got to go forward with civilization. You've got to follow the clock around. The clock never runs backward. You can't turn the world around the other way and bring it back. You've got to go forward with it."", 'You and I can remember that there were long periods of time in the so-called ""good old days"" when the times were bad for Indiana farmers and Indiana townspeople. All of you remember the great depression and what that meant to the American farmer. In order to pull the farmer out of the hole he was in after 12 years of Republican rule President Roosevelt started a number of programs designed to help the farmer and make a better living for him--rural electrification, soil conservation, the farm tenant purchase program, the farm price support program, the school lunch program, and many others. All these Democratic programs played their part in raising our farms to the tremendous prosperity they enjoy today.', ""You know, the farmers, like everybody else when things are easy for him, he tends to neglect his political duties. He becomes fat and lazy and won't go to the polls on election day. He did that in 1946--and look what he got. The Republican Congress began immediately to try to turn the clock back, and the first one they took a whack at was the farmer."", ""Prosperity is a good thing. It makes a better life possible for all farm families, and as a result, the whole country is better off. Farmers and laborers and businessmen can all be prosperous together--and that's the Democratic principle. We want to make everybody have a fair share of the national income."", 'It was a hard uphill fight to secure these great farm programs and to achieve prosperity for American farmers. There was determined Republican opposition to the Democratic efforts to get the necessary laws on the books.', ""When the Republicans finally got control of the 80th Congress a new fight began, a fight to save these Democratic programs. I had to fight throughout the Republican 80th Congress to keep the rural electrification program from being stopped altogether. They wanted to repeal it. They didn't want to give it any money at all. I had to fight for farm price supports and the school lunch program. It was all the administration of which I was the head could do to prevent the Congress from slashing funds for soil conservation right out of the budget. They did take it out in the House but we had enough good, sensible Democrats in the Senate and a few forward-looking Republicans, and we put that appropriation back. The Republican leaders seemed determined to knock the props from under farm prosperity, despite the fact that everyone knows that farm prosperity is essential to national prosperity."", ""I don't think American farmers intend to lose the ground they have won. That's why I am confident they will vote to send Mr. Oliver to the Congress, they will vote to send Mr. Schricker to the capital of Indiana, and they will vote to send me back to the White House, because that is to their best interests to do--to do all three of those things."", ""Now, the best thing you can do is to vote in your own selfish interest on election day, and when you do that you'll vote the Democratic ticket straight--and then you won't have to worry about the dock being turned back. If you vote that Republican Congress back you'll have the same old backward-looking leaders. You can't afford to do that."", 'Get up early, now, and go to the polls on election day and vote a straight Democratic ticket and vote in your own interest.', ""I do thank you a lot for this wonderful turnout, this wonderful welcome I have had in Indiana--in Richmond and at this place, just like it was everywhere else in the United States. Everybody is interested in these issues, and they are coming out to find out what I am thinking about them. And you don't have any trouble finding out where I stand.

You have some very famous people with whom we are all familiar who came from this lovely town--Lew Wallace, Meredith Nicholson. ""Alice of Old Vincennes""--Thompson, I think, wrote that book. He lived here till he died. It has been my privilege to read most of the books that these famous men have written, and especially have I been interested in James Whitcomb Riley\'s poetry. I was in his town of Greenfield this morning, and I had a grand time there. The people turned out in immense numbers, but nothing like this. This tops them all.', 'I have been making trips all over this country. I have been from the west coast and back again. I have been across the Middle Atlantic States.

I feel that they are basic to the prosperity and welfare of the American people. I believe that the continuing welfare of our Nation depends on every voter's understanding these issues when he goes to the polls."", ""I have told the people what the Democratic Party stands for and what it has done for the people. Because the Republican candidates won't be frank and tell what the Republican Party intends to do to the people, I have also talked about the Republican Party and what it stands for and what it will do to you if it gets a chance. I don't think there is any Republican who could accuse me of 'pulling punches. I am telling facts, and they can't stand facts. They like to talk about unity and give you a little soothing syrup and make you believe that they are all right, but if you will study the record you will find that they are anything but right."", 'Today we are in the midst of the greatest prosperity this country has ever seen. That prosperity is threatened by runaway high prices which began when the Republicans, under the leadership of men like Senator Taft and Senator Wherry, destroyed price controls back in 1946. I want to see our prosperity continue. I want to see these high prices brought under control so that wages and salaries and farm income will maintain their purchasing power.', 'The prosperity that we have today has not come by accident. It was carefully planned. It is the result of Democratic policies for the last 16 years.', 'I would like to tell you all the things that the Democrats have done to bring about this situation--what the programs mean to the farmers and the workers and the small businessmen. They have all gotten their fair share of the national income. Never before in the history of the country--or the world, for that matter--has the national income of a great country like ours been more fairly distributed than it has been under Democratic administrations.', ""There isn't time to tell you all about these things, but I will describe just one Democratic program which has meant a lot to you people here in Indiana. That is rural electrification."", ""In 1933 only one farm in seven in the United States had electric power. Under President Roosevelt's leadership the Democratic Congress enacted the rural electrification program. The benefits from that program are apparent all over Indiana, and the rest of the country too. Now more than 60 percent of the Nation's farms have electric power."", 'Before REA began only one farm in ten in Indiana had electricity. Now nine of every ten Indiana farmers have electricity on the farms. One hundred and three thousand Indiana farm homes have REA electricity. Imagine what that means to a hungry world. It means food for people who would otherwise starve to death. And yet, the Republican Party is still fighting REA at every turn of the road. They are fighting it because the big power companies are opposed to it. The Republican Party is tied hand and foot to the big power companies-and they always have been.', 'I was on the Senate committee that wrote what they call the death sentence to the utility holding companies, and that utility holding company bill was fought tooth and toe-nail by every Republican in the Senate. But we passed it anyway and we gave the people back the things that the people are entitled to.', ""That's what the Democrats all stand for. That's why 73 percent of the Republicans voted against REA in 1943, and why almost 90 percent voted against it in 1947, and why three-fourths of them voted against electrification in 1948. It's just a continuing program of the Republicans to be against the people and for the special interests. Fortunately, REA won out every time because overwhelming majorities of the Democrats in Congress had your interest at heart, and supported it with everything they had."", ""There you have one specific issue you have to decide on November 2d. Do you want to have a Republican Congress and a Republican president in Washington who are working for the big power companies ? Do you? All right, then--all you've got to do is to do your duty on election day and vote a straight Democratic ticket, and then you'll be all right."", 'Exactly the same principle is involved in every issue that the farmer is interested in, not just REA. Exactly the same principle is involved in every issue that the workingman is interested in--fair labor laws, minimum wages, social security laws, and so forth. That principle is simply this: The Democratic Party believes that the Government should be run for the benefit of all groups of people. The Republican Party is interested only in doing what special privilege and special interest wants--just like they are trying to do with the power companies now in the West.', ""I don't think you're going to let them get away with it. I am confident that you're going to send lack O'Grady to the Congress from this district, and I am confident that you are going to elect Schricker Governor of Indiana--and if you do that you'll certainly send me back to the White House, and I won't be troubled with the housing problem."", ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this cordiality, this wonderful turnout, and the interest which the people are showing in the issues in this campaign."", ""I appreciate very much these young men and young women, these college students who are here this morning, because they are interested in the welfare of the country or they wouldn't be here.

Lincoln lost the case and was fined a jug of whiskey."", 'I want you to think just how out of place Lincoln would be with present day Republicans. Republicans don\'t charge low fees any longer. The higher the better is their motto. They don\'t think any longer about ""of the people, by the people, and for the people.""', 'The record of the Republican 80th Congress is proof of that. And the Republican candidate for President is standing squarely on the record of that Congress in his campaign. Can you imagine that!', 'That Congress tore into the rights of the workingman.

It hurt every family in the country by refusing to do anything about high prices, or the housing shortage, or relieving the terribly crowded conditions of schools and hospitals all over the country.', 'All that the Republican Congress did was to pass laws that the lobbies of the railroads and the private power companies, and big business asked for. They even passed laws to benefit the grain speculators.', 'And the Republican candidate for President says that he is proud of the record of the Both Congress.', ""We don't have time now to go into all these issues. Let's look at just one of the things the Republican 80th Congress did that affects the prosperity of every man, woman, and child in this State."", ""The Commodity Credit Corporation, under the Democratic administrations, developed a program to store grain when there were bumper crops, so that grain could be marketed over a longer period of time. This helped the farmer to get good, steady prices for his crops, and gave him encouragement to reap big crops. If it hadn't been for that encouragement, millions of people in the world would have starved to death."", ""Well, the grain speculators don't like this because they make their killings when the farm prices go up and down in a hurry. They don't care what happens to the farmers. The speculators have always exploited the farmer until the New Deal put an end to that speculating and exploitation."", 'So, the grain lobbies got Republican Jesse Wolcott of Michigan, and Republican Leo Allen right up here in Chicago, Ill., to lead the fight in the 80th Congress to change the charter of the Commodity Credit Corporation so that it could no longer secure storage space for bumper crops.', 'That was a plain sellout to the lobbies by the Republican 80th Congress.', 'Well now, what happened? This year we had a bumper crop, and we have no place to put it. I was down in southern Illinois the other day, and corn down there in southern Illinois was selling for $1 a bushel, and the support price of corn is 47 cents a bushel. Now, who is getting that 47 cents? Not the farmer--not the farmer. The speculators are getting it because they prevented the ability to store that grain and give the farmers the benefit of the support price.', 'Farmers all over the country are being forced to dump their grain as ""distress grain,"" or let it rot on the ground, because the Commodity Credit Corporation no longer has the power to provide emergency storage space for bumper crops. That is the Republican program, pure and simple. The farmers cannot get the Government support price, because their crops are not in storage. That is typical of the Republican attitude toward the farmer, and when the farmer suffers, every one of you in cities like Danville, feels the effects.', ""Don't let the Republicans fool you with their smooth talk about what they are going to do for the farmers, and the workers, and the small businessmen in this country."", 'Their actions speak louder than words.

I know the difficult times the farmers had because I was living on a Missouri farm then, and I could see the troubles the farmers were having. I was trying my best to make a 600-acre farm in Jackson County pay its way, and in those days it was a most difficult job, as you all remember."", ""The Democratic administrations of the last 16 years have been building a firm foundation for farm prosperity. We conceived and wrote the farm price support bill into a program of law. We placed a floor under the farmers' income so they wouldn't be wiped out in drought years or low-priced out of existence when a bumper crop hit the market. The prosperity and well-being of the American farmers showed that the Democratic programs have worked."", 'Farmers tell me they want them continued. Even the Republicans talk out of one side of their mouth about continuing them. But what do the Republicans do about the farm program when they are back in Washington ? Well, they cut the farm price support program to pieces. They cut funds from the rural electrification program, the soil conservation program, and the school lunch program. They refused to provide funds for rural housing or better schools.', ""Tonight in Springfield I am going to explain in full detail just exactly what the Democratic and the Republican Parties stand for.

I say that minority should not rule the country, especially when the Congress they elect serves only special interests. This year everyone must vote so that the elected representatives of us all will be in control of the Congress, and then you\'ll get what you are entitled to.', ""You see, the policy of the Democratic Party has always been to support the welfare of the people as a whole.

I vetoed more bills than any President since Grover Cleveland, and every bill I vetoed was vetoed in the public interest and not for some special interest.

You know, when I first started out on these tours, I made an effort to estimate the crowds, and I found that I just couldn't estimate them at all--and found I had to measure them by the acre. I did some figuring, and I figured out that in an acre, there are 4,850 square yards and that there ought to be at least two people to the square yard, and when you have an acre of people, you have 9,600 people, and when you have ten acres of people, you have 96,000. Now, I would say that we might have about five acres of people here this afternoon--and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. It shows that you are interested in this campaign. It shows that you are interested in the welfare of the country, and I appreciate it.

I am explaining just exactly what this election means to them. The Republicans are trying to pretend that there aren't any issues. Well, they couldn't be further from the truth if they tried, and they don't stick very closely to the truth very often."", 'This election will decide who runs the Government of the United States for the next 4 years. It will decide whether you, the people, are in control or whether a little group of reactionary Republicans, completely under the thumb of the lobbies of the special interests, will be in office and run the country.', 'I want to say to you that this 80th Congress was beset with more lobbyists than any other Congress in the history of the country, and they spent more money than ever has been spent in Washington in lobbies in the history of the country--and that Congress did nothing about it. They liked it. They sat and took it.', 'I have been going around the country, explaining how the actions of the Republican 80th Congress, which the Republican candidate for President has warmly endorsed, undermined the very foundation of the prosperity of the American people as they are enjoying it now.', 'In 1933, after 12 years of Republican misrule, Decatur was in very serious trouble. I am sure you remember what it was like in the railroad shops and the mills and plants and all the stores and shops that supply the farmers in this part of Illinois. Well, you got sort of tired of that, and in 1932 you elected Franklin D. Roosevelt President of the United States.', ""There was a steady improvement from that time on. And the postwar years have brought the greatest prosperity this area has ever known. That wasn't by accident. That came about because the Democratic Party believes in seeing that labor gets its fair share of the national income and that the farmer is on a parity basis with the rest of the economy, and that the small businessmen get a square deal. The Democrats passed the Wagner Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Social Security Act and a great many other measures that give workers better incomes and greater security than they ever had before in the history of the country. We provided for soil conservation and rural electrification and the farm price support program and a number of other laws--all to help the farmer, the workingman, and the small businessman. When the farmers and the workers are well off, then the businessmen are able to do well."", ""Since we are enjoying our present great prosperity, why can't it just continue on like this? We can't count on continued prosperity going on just like this because we have so many serious problems that need action, and they need action now. I tried all through the 80th Congress to get the Republican leaders to act on the worst problem of all--high prices. If this runaway inflation is not stopped, we are surely headed straight for another bust. But the Republican leaders absolutely refused to take one step that would bring down the cost of living. They refused to 'pass any housing bill which would clear away the city slums, provide public low-rental housing, or help meet the acute housing shortage in the rural areas. They refused to do anything about the crisis in education, or to help meet the acute shortage of doctors and hospitals, or to build the waterways and dams and powerplants we need if we are to continue to grow. The Republican 80th Congress not only refused to meet our pressing national problems-they actually tried to tear down the Democratic programs which are responsible for the growth and prosperity of this great country for the past 16 years."", 'Last night in Akron, Ohio, I told how the Republicans tried to crush the strength of the labor movement, how they took away social security from nearly a million people, how they have plans to take away even more of the rights of the workingman if they ever get a chance.', ""Tonight in Springfield, Ill., I am going to tell just exactly what the Republicans have done to the farmers--how they have already deprived many farmers of price supports, how they have cut rural electrification and soil conservation funds, how they have tried to put the farmer back where he was in the 1920's."", 'Remember, all these actions of the Republican 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress were approved by the Republican candidate for President when he said, ""the 80th Congress delivered as no other Congress has done for the future of the country.""', ""By your vote on November 2d you can get a government that's not going to forget about you in Washington.

Then get your friends and neighbors to get to the polls on election day, November the 2d. And just keep this in mind: When you go there, vote for yourselves; vote in your own interest.

Here in Illinois you have a lot of farmers, and a great many others who are dependent on farm prosperity. This story is of interest to everybody, too, because it is a fair sample of the kind of treatment the people have been getting from the Republicans."", 'There are a few big questions every farmer--and every one of the rest of us-ought to ask himself before he decides how to vote on November 2d. One of the questions each of us ought to ask is this:', 'How well off was I in 1932, after the Republicans had been in office 12 years, how well off am I now after having had Democratic Presidents for the last 16 years ?', 'For nearly all of us, the answer to that question is perfectly plain.', 'Some people would like you to think that the Government had nothing to do with this--that the country just drifted into the depression without any help from the Republicans and drifted out into prosperity without any help from the Democrats ?', 'As a matter of fact, the Government has a great deal to do with these things.', 'The increasing prosperity we have enjoyed since 1933 has been due in a large part to Government programs put into effect by the Democratic Party.', 'The Republicans fought these programs for years, but lately they have come around, saying: ""Me, too, but I can do it better.""', ""Well, two-thirds of you stayed at home in 1946. That third that went to the polls elected the Republican 80th Congress, and you gave them a chance to show what they could do. And what did they do? Let's get back to the farm program."", 'The first thing they did was to cut the soil conservation program. They have been telling you how strong they were for soil conservation.', ""I'll tell you how strong they were for it: The Republicans in the House of Representatives voted 12 to 1 to kill the agricultural conservation program entirely. That's how strong they were for it, although their platforms of 1940 and 1944, and even of 1948 said they were for soil conservation."", ""You ought to know this too: When they voted to kill that program, they automatically voted to kill the farmer-committee system. Those committees are made up of farmers and are elected by farmers to run the farm programs. As long as you have the farmer-committee system, you can laugh at the lies about bureaucrats coming out and running the farms. But if they kill the committees, one of two things will happen: Either you won't have any farm program, or the bureaucrats will run whatever there is to run. There won't be much to run, I can tell you that."", 'They will have to be Republican bureaucrats, too, because the Democrats will never allow that to happen, while we have the power to stop it.', 'The Republican attack on soil conservation and the committee system did not succeed in full. Democrats had voices and we still had some votes in Congress. But remember this: The Republicans cut the agricultural conservation program exactly in half.

But while you sat out here on a powder keg waiting for prices to blow up, that Republican Congress lit a fuse.', 'They knew for a long time that price support legislation would expire at the end of this year. But for a year and a half after they took control of the Congress, they did absolutely nothing.', 'The gentleman over there who said ""nothing"" to that question awhile ago told the truth, if it ever was told. They did nothing for the people.', 'Then the first thing the Republicans did was to restrict the right of the Commodity Credit Corporation to provide storage bins for grain.', ""No longer can the Government provide enough storage in rural areas to carry the surplus from the fat years until the lean years come. Farmers can't afford to go into the storage business to that extent. And the grain trade has either been unable or unwilling to do it."", ""This action by the Republicans will cost both farmers and consumers. It will benefit the speculative grain trade and the shipping interests. And that's all it will benefit. It will turn the farmers back to the speculators."", ""If the farmers can't find storage facilities, they can't get support prices."", 'And if you have to sell your corn for less than the support price for lack of storage, you will know that the blame lies squarely on the Republican Party, and nowhere else.', 'While they are doing this to cripple price supports, the time was fast approaching when our major price support legislation would expire. Remember, they had had a year and a half to deal with this problem.', ""But it was not until 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, in the last minutes of the congressional session, that they finally worked out a compromise price support bill. The Republicans were forced to pass something that would look good on the record for the election campaign. But at the very time they passed it, they were explaining that next year it could be amended or repealed. I had been begging them ever since the Congress met, to meet that situation, but they couldn't do it until the last minute. They were afraid to go to the Republican convention in Philadelphia without doing some little thing, and that is what they did."", 'Just last month Republican Senator Capper of Kansas, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture in the 80th Congress, made a very significant statement in his weekly broadcast to Kansas. He openly predicted that there would be a drive in the next Congress to reduce the support price levels in 1949.', 'This uncertainty is unfair to all farmers, and especially unfair to those of you who are livestock producers, because you have to plan your operations a long time in advance.

He is bound hand and foot by the record of the 80th Congress, and he is running on that record, and nothing else.', 'In order to get the nomination, he indorsed the record of that Congress. The platform on which he is running gives it the warmest endorsement. He is trying to get the people to reelect every reactionary member of the 80th Congress, as you noticed when he came here to Illinois.', 'Recently the Republican candidate stated that he was proud of the record of the 80th Congress.', 'Now, when I speak of the 80th Congress, I am speaking of the leadership of that Congress, the people who run it. I am not speaking of such men as Scott Lucas and other Democrats who served in that Congress. I am here to tell you that the leadership of that Congress--if you elect it this time--they will control it again, and we will have worse than an 80th Congress, if that is possible.', 'But we Democrats cannot be content merely to run against the Republican record, however black it may be. And although we are proud of the Democratic record, we are not content merely to run on our record.', 'We have a positive program for the future, and I want to be sure you know about it. This program has been spelled out in detail in messages I have sent to the Congress.', 'Tonight I want to give you a brief and concrete statement of what the program is. But first, I want to remind you again of how much farmers and city people depend upon each other.', ""What I would like to tell you is very simple. I have said it again and again in this campaign. If you are a farmer, your customers are in the cities, and most of them are men and women who work for a living. Unless they get good wages, they can't pay good farm prices. And, as for labor, the best market for the products of industry is the farmer. Unless the farmer gets a fair price--a parity price for his crops, he can't buy the clothes and the tools, and the automobiles and the radios, and the other things which labor helps to manufacture."", 'When the farmer votes for a Republican Party that proposes to smash the strength of labor, the farmer is not voting just for a cut in the wages of the city workers.', 'He is voting to cut his own income.', 'He is voting to reduce his own prices.', ""He is voting to have the Republican Party do a repeat-performance of the agricultural depression of the 1920's."", 'This is now the most prosperous nation the world ever saw. And we can keep it that way.', 'I propose to tell you how we can keep it that way, particularly as to how agriculture is concerned.', 'There is only one sane national policy for agriculture, and that is a policy of organized, sustained, and realistic abundance.', 'We must not only produce abundantly, but we must market, distribute, and consume the abundance we produce.', 'Our farmers are producing far more than before the war, and, with continuing prosperity, they can produce even more. The people are eating more and better food, and generally living better. Many people, however, are not yet able to supply their needs. When all our people can get as much as they should have, then we will have no danger of farm surpluses.', 'In order for our people to get all they need, we must maintain high levels of employment. If unemployment should occur, we must be ready immediately to take up the slack. We must also maintain good export outlets.', 'Now, this is what I believe in. Here are the main outlines of the agricultural program we must have:', '1. We must have on a permanent basis a system of flexible price supports for agricultural commodities. Price supports and related measures help us keep our farm production adjusted to shifting market requirements. They are also required by the very nature of our economy. Farm prices are unstable in relation to other prices. And farm price trouble can lead to depression, which cuts the markets and further depresses agriculture. Parity must be our continuing goal.', '2. We must expand our soil conservation program and put a stop to the waste of our agricultural resources. By using our land wisely, we can produce abundantly and permanently. But wasteful use of the soil is national suicide.', '3. We must continue and strengthen our programs to assure adequate consumption of agricultural products. In this I include scientific research, efforts to encourage world trade through agreements and other means, the school lunch program, and further efforts to improve the diets of low-income families. We must never again allow our people to go hungry while surpluses are going to waste.', '4. We must continue to develop means of meeting special agricultural problems. For example, we must protect the right of farmers to do business through cooperatives. We must extend rural electrification. We must have better housing, better roads, and better educational facilities for our farmers.', 'The policy and the programs I have mentioned are essential to the future welfare of agriculture.', 'They are essential to the welfare and prosperity of this whole Nation, and of the world.', 'A policy of democratic abundance is the best answer in the world to the threat of communism. It is a policy that contributes toward world peace.', 'Thanks to the Democratic administrations of the past we have much of the legislation we need to follow a policy of organized, sustained, and realistic abundance. I asked that Both Congress to add the missing pieces and to provide adequate support for the programs we have. The Republican leadership refused.', 'I wish the Wall Street crowd would let their candidate stamp his ""me, too"" on the agricultural policy that my party and my administration stand for.', 'I wish we had at least as much bipartisan support for our agricultural policy as we have for our foreign policy.', 'But unfortunately agricultural policy is very much a partisan matter at this time.', ""The enemies of the farmer feel pretty cocky. They tell us the farmer is fat and happy and not worried about anything. They picture the farmer in a private airplane or a fine new car, and they laugh and say the farmer won't pay any attention to Truman."", 'They say the same thing about labor. Labor has been put in its place, they say, and is going to get more of the same.', ""I wish they were right in saying you don't have a thing to worry about. You are more prosperous than you ever were under the Republicans. But I want you to be as prosperous as the people who are saying you are already too prosperous."", 'As a Democrat, I believe in prosperity for the many, and not for just a few.', 'I believe that the farmer and the industrial worker, and the miner and the businessman, will prosper together or they will fail together.', 'I reject the reactionary idea that there are second class citizens who were meant to be nothing but hewers of wood and drawers of water.', 'I maintain that every man, woman, and child in the United States is entitled to a decent living and to equal justice in a free land.', 'To that end we of the Democratic Party pledge our strength and our courage.', ""We shall never rest until, by God's grace, we have attained that goal.""]"

I want you to send Mayor Humphrey to Washington as your United States Senator--and then your President will have some real cooperation.', 'I am very much interested and I want to congratulate you on the nearly unbelievable job that you did here during World War II. It was my privilege to make some investigations up in this part of the world while that war was on, in my capacity as Chairman of the Investigating Committee of the Senate which was looking after those things. And I want to say that everyone went into the mines up north and sent out unheard-of amounts of ore. The whole world is grateful for the fine efforts--not only of the miners, the railroadmen, and the Great Lakes seamen who moved that ore--but also to the lumbermen, the papermill workers, and to the farmers.', ""Here in northern Minnesota are some of our country's richest untapped resources.

Three of the men who fought for this came up with me on the train today--John Blatnik, Senator Vukelich, and State Representative Fred Cina. That bill has made possible the $2 million taconite plant near Aurora. Now, I understand, there is being proposed a $77 million development at Pever Bay up here at your famous North Shore, and at Babbitt.', 'Almost half the peat deposits of the whole United States lies to the north of here, in Minnesota.

That's the St. Lawrence Seaway. Building the Seaway would give you a deep-water channel to the Atlantic. The twin cities of Duluth and Superior would become one of the greatest ports of the entire world. Throughout my administration I have urged the Congress to provide for the full development of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project. But the railroad lobby and the power lobby control too many Congressmen, and the Congress refused to approve the measures I requested. Apparently there are some people who don't want to see this great center of industrial and agricultural production turn into a tremendous center of worldwide trade. I can assure you that I do want to see you grow into just exactly that sort of a port."", 'I pledge to you that as President I shall continue to fight for the development of the resources of this great area and for the full development of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Power Project. I will not compromise with special interests, as some candidates for office are doing by supporting just the electric power development of the St. Lawrence at the expense of the Seaway.

That is atomic energy.', 'This is a force which holds great danger of catastrophe in the wrong hands. At the same time, it holds great promise of a better life in the right hands. Everyone must understand clearly what is involved.', 'Atomic power is so overwhelming that most people have difficulty in seeing how it affects their daily lives. But the fact is, the future of every one of us depends in large measure on whether atomic energy is used for good or for evil.', 'There are three fundamental facts about atomic energy that each of us should understand.', 'First of all, the atomic bomb is the most terrible and devastating weapon that man has ever contrived.', 'Second, because atomic energy is capable of destroying civilization, it must be controlled by international authority.', 'And third, if properly controlled, atomic energy can enrich human life for all the generations to come.', 'You remember how the atom bomb project began.', ""We were fighting a great war. We knew that the Nazis were trying to construct atomic bombs. We drew on the world's scientists and our whole heritage of organized knowledge to win this race with death. This called for foresight. And it called for courage."", 'It took foresight in 1940 to order the first research on atomic energy for military purposes. It took courage in 1942 to launch the atomic bomb project on a full scale.', 'Fortunately, we had a President who possessed both courage and foresight-Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'Franklin Roosevelt did not live to see the outcome of that great venture.', 'It was after I became President that the first atomic explosion was set off in the New Mexico desert. That was while I was in Potsdam, Germany, in July 1945. Until that time, we did not know whether the bomb would work or not. Secretary of War Stimson came to Potsdam and informed personally of the awe-inspiring result of first explosion. Nothing like it had ever before been known.', ""That first explosion in the desert left a crater 1200 feet across. The sand in and around the crater was melted into glass. The steel tower--90 feet high--from which the bomb was exploded had completely vaporized. There wasn't a vestige of it left."", 'What this meant for the future was staggering to think about.', 'As President of the United States, I had the fateful responsibility of deciding whether or not to use this weapon for the first time. It was the hardest decision I ever had to make. But the President cannot duck hard problems--he cannot pass the buck.', 'I made the decision after discussions with the ablest men in our Government, and after long and prayerful consideration.', 'I decided that the bomb should be used in order to end the war quickly and save countless lives--Japanese as well as American.', 'But I resolved then and there to do everything I could to see that this awesome discovery was turned into a force for peace and the advancement of mankind.', 'Since then, it has been my constant aim to prevent its use for war and to hasten its use for peace.', 'Three months after the bomb was used, I met in Washington, D.C., with Prime Minister Attlee of Great Britain and Prime Minister Mackenzie King of Canada. These two great countries were Our partners in developing the atomic bomb.', 'After this conference, our three governments proposed that a United Nations Commission be established to work out a plan for the international control of atomic energy--a plan which would further the welfare rather than the destruction of mankind. We were joined by France, China, and the Soviet Union in sponsoring the establishment of such a commission.', 'The commission first met in June 1946. The United States offered to stop making atomic bombs when an effective system of international control had been set up. We offered to dispose of our existing bombs, and to turn over to an international agency full information on the production of atomic energy.', 'Now, my friends, that is the first time in the history of the world that the greatest nation on earth has been willing to turn over its greatest asset for the welfare of the whole world.', ""I believe that these proposals by the United States Government will be regarded by history as one of the world's greatest examples of political responsibility and moral leadership. In these proposals lies the best assurance for world peace and for the security of this great Nation."", 'There has been no change in the American position. We still want atomic energy to be placed under international control-on a practical, realistic basis that means control that will work. Only on this basis can atomic energy be removed as an ominous threat to mankind and turned to the purpose which has been in my heart from the beginning: peace, prosperity, and progress for all nations and all people everywhere.', 'Until the right kind of international control is assured, we have no choice but to proceed with the development of atomic weapons. We Americans are not a warlike people. We want peace worse than anything else in this world. The world knows that the United States will never use the atomic bomb to wage aggressive war.', 'But in the hands of a nation bent on aggression, the atomic bomb could spell the end of civilization on this planet.', 'My friends, that must not happen.', 'The fearful power of atomic weapons must be placed beyond the reach of any irresponsible government or any power-mad dictator.', 'Now, all of you know the difficulties we have encountered in trying to achieve international control.', 'The great majority of the countries on the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission agreed upon a plan for an international agency with powers of ownership, operation, management, and inspection which would make effective control possible. But the Soviet Union rejected such a plan as an intrusion upon its national sovereignty.', 'The majority of the nations felt that the control agency ought not to be subject to a veto by any nation. The Soviet Union insisted upon its right to veto.', 'The issues which have thus far blocked agreement are serious. But I do not regard the situation as hopeless. Even now, in Paris, discussions are under way in the United Nations on this very subject. It is our hope that the Soviet Union and all members of the United Nations will see the wisdom, logic, and the necessity for adopting the plan of control so overwhelmingly supported by the United Nations Commission.', 'The conscience of humanity will not permit the awful force of atomic energy to be used for the self-destruction of the human race.', 'Now, my friends, of course, there is a price to be paid for mutual security of nations against the horrors of an atomic war. All nations must reckon with that price. The plain fact is that the international control of atomic energy does demand some sacrifice of national sovereignty.', 'The atom is no respecter of sovereignty of nations.', 'From the moment the atomic bomb came a reality, the United States has stood ready to do its share--to make its sacrifice-so that a lasting peace can be achieved.', 'But we will not make a one-sided sacrifice. The United States will not be satisfied with anything less than a plan of international control which is clearly meant to work, and which will work. A ""make-believe"" control would be worse than none at all.', 'Now, while we are making these efforts toward international control of atomic energy, we have also been working to strengthen our atomic security and to hasten the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.', 'When the war ended, we faced a critical decision as to the means by which our work should be carried forward. Some people honestly believed that the development of atomic energy should be left in the hands of the armed services.', 'I could not agree to that.', 'A free society requires the supremacy of the civil rather than the military authority. This is in no sense a reflection upon our Armed Forces. It is part of the spirit of our free institutions that military specialists must always be under the direction of civilians.', 'Because of the power and world significance of atomic energy, I was convinced that it had to be placed under civilian control. The Democratic 79th Congress enacted a law which made civilian control possible. The wisdom of that decision has been proved again and again during the past 2 years.', 'We are steadily making advances in the field of atomic science.', 'I can assure you that the civilian Atomic Energy Commission has maintained the leadership and readiness of the United States in atomic weapons--despite the presence of what the Republican candidate for President is pleased to call the ""dead hand"" of government !', 'The progress we are making in developing atomic energy for peaceful uses may at first seem less dramatic than the creation of the atomic bomb. But, in fact, it promises the world a whole new age of creative abundance.', 'The Atomic Energy Commission has begun work on the first experimental plant intended to supply atomic power for industrial purposes.', 'Great progress is being made in the use of atomic materials for research in biology and medicine. Here, we are warring against cancer and other diseases which will take their terrible tolls of human lives.', 'Atomic materials are also opening up tremendous new possibilities in agriculture and industrial research. And these same radioactive materials are among our most important research tools in the field of fundamental physical science.', 'Fifty years from now, the world will be a vastly different place because the power of the atom is being harnessed. It is our job to see that atomic energy makes the world not a wasteland of destruction but a vastly better place in which to live.', 'Atomic energy is not just a new form of power--like coal and oil. It is a force which can be compared only with the cosmic energies of the sun itself.', 'The fission of--now, listen to this--the fission of a single pound of uranium releases as much energy as the burning of 3 million pounds of coal.', 'A force like this cannot be handled on a ""business as usual"" basis.', 'The Republican candidate for president made a speech on atomic energy at phoenix, Ariz., on September 23d.', 'The obvious implication in that speech is that the Republican candidate feels that the peacetime uses of atomic energy should be taken from the Government and turned over to private corporations.', 'Here again is the basic conflict between the Democratic and the Republican parties.', 'Here again is the vital issue between the people and the selfish interests.', 'I believe that atomic energy should not be used to fatten the profits of big business.', 'I believe that atomic energy should be used for the benefit of all the people.', 'Now, my friends, the largest private corporation in the world is far too small to be entrusted with such power, least of all for its own profit.', 'Most responsible businessmen know this. Most men who know what atomic energy means do not talk about the ""dead hand of government.""', 'For our own protection and to insure our national security, we must continue to develop atomic energy as a public trust.', 'Our atomic materials are very precious, and must be guarded closely.', ""Atomic energy cannot and must not be another Teapot Dome for private exploitation-any more than it can be allowed to enter into competitive armaments. That is one of the most important things we are faced with. We don't want to make atomic energy the private interest of any corporations, no matter how big."", 'Our atomic plants cost billions of dollars of public money to build, and millions more to operate each year. They belong to all the people. They belong to us.', 'The use of atomic materials presents technical hazards which require very careful safety measures.', 'And here is the most important point of all. You cannot separate peacetime use of atomic materials from their potential military use.', 'Atomic material in a power station is not far from being an atomic arsenal. This is the blunt fact that requires an international control that will really work. The same fact makes it absolutely necessary to insist upon public ownership and control in the United States.', 'At the same time, we must make full use of the skill and initiative of private business. Business concerns have had and will continue to have an indispensable part in this great venture. This is a basic principle of the McMahon Atomic Energy Act of 1946-one of the wisest laws ever put on our statute books.', 'And, the success of our whole atomic energy program, military as well as peaceful, has been based on constant and effective teamwork between Government and private enterprise.', 'Today, over three thousand private contractors and suppliers are participating in our atomic energy program.', 'Today, the great atomic plants at Oak Ridge, and Hanford, and elsewhere are operated by private industrial organizations under Government supervision.', 'Today, scores of college and university laboratories are carrying out important atomic research.', 'Everything possible is being done to find legitimate opportunities for even greater participation by private enterprise, consistent always with public interest. But we must not put profit-making above the national welfare, my friends.', 'The platform of the Republican Party upon which my opponent is running for election fails to mention atomic energy.', 'I assumed at first that this was merely an oversight.', 'It is clear now, however, that this omission was deliberate.', 'It is clear from the comments of the Republican candidate that powerful, selfish groups within the Republican Party are determined to exploit the atom for private profit.', 'I shall fight this effort with all the strength I have.', ""The Government is the indispensable trustee of the people for the development of atomic energy. Someday it may be 'possible to fit atomic energy more closely into the normal pattern of American business. But I cannot tell you that this is just around the corner. I will make no light promises of this sort."", ""Our national policy has been that atomic energy is such a vast new force in our lives that it must be kept under public control as long as the safety of the people's interest require. We must continue to follow that policy."", 'That is the only way we can assure the development of atomic energy for the benefit of humanity.', 'That is the only way we can assure that it will be used not for death but for a better life.', 'This great discovery belongs to the people and it must be used for the people.', 'There has been no more vital issue before the American people in this century.', 'The existence of civilization itself depends upon the wisdom and prudence of the American people in choosing the course we are to follow.', 'I pray that your decision will be the right one.']"

My Secretary of the Interior, Julius Krug, is a native of this great city, and he is a magnificent public official.', 'I am especially glad to be in Madison which I remember was named by a national magazine as the perfect city to live in. Wisconsin is a State which gave us fighting Bob LaFollette; a State which has led all others in sound, progressive legislation; a State which has served as the model and the inspiration for all the other States in the country in the way in which its university has worked with the leaders of the State in pioneering a better way of life for all the people.', 'Wisconsin needs to regain her position in leadership in the cause of liberalism in the United States. Wisconsin about-faced a short time ago, and they ought to come back and get in step with the people that are going forward. You can do that by rallying all your liberal forces behind the common banner--the banner of the Democratic Party.', 'I am pleased that the followers of old Fighting Bob have recognized that the Democratic Party is the party which has their interests at heart. I am very pleased that a leader of the old Progressive Party of Wisconsin, Carl Thompson, is the Democratic candidate for Governor in this election. And I think you will do yourselves a favor, in this congressional district, if you send Horace Wilkie to the Congress. These men have joined the Democratic ranks because they know it is the only truly liberal party today.', 'What happened to the Republican Party in Wisconsin has been repeated on a national level. The 80th Congress was the tragic answer to all those who hoped that the elephant had acquired a ""new look."" That 80th Congress was controlled--a controlled Congress, where lobbyists pulled the strings and the people got stung.', 'An excellent example of how we got legislation by lobby, instead of laws to meet our needs is found in the story of the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill. I would like to tell you a little about that bill.', ""It was sponsored by two Democrats and one Republican. It has been developed through 3 years of study. During this time, hundreds of thousands of words of testimony from every corner of the United States was collected. This study showed that the United States, the most powerful Nation on earth, had failed to provide decent housing for its citizens. Three million American families are living doubled up with other families. Five million families are living in housing that isn't fit for an American. citizen to live in. Five million are living in slums that are rotting out the cores of our great cities. We are falling further behind every year as construction fails to keep up with our needs."", 'There is nothing more un-American than a city slum. Slums are the breeding spots of crime, sickness, and chaos in every large city in America.', ""Our farm housing is something that Americans don't like to talk about, either. More than half our farm homes do not meet modern American standards."", 'The Democratic Party has placed at the top of its program an answer to the housing problem. But what do the Republicans say? They say that private builders can do the job. They say this in spite of the fact that private builders are not doing the job.', 'This year the real estate is crowing that more homes are being built than were built in the former peak year of 1926.', 'I ask you, what kind of hope is there when we brag about passing a mark set 22 years ago, when the needs, the job, and the problems were very much smaller?', ""But, the real estate lobby killed the Americans' hopes for a Federal housing law to help meet our needs. Its instrument was the leadership of the Republican Party. When the lobby-controlled Republican Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee stated at the end of the second session of the 80th Congress that he would not even allow the House of Representatives to vote on the bill, every single Democratic member of that committee turned against him and voted for the bill."", 'There is a powerful committee in the House of Representatives called the Rules Committee. That committee decides what bills the House may be allowed to consider. In the second session of the 80th Congress, every Democrat in the Rules Committee voted to let the House of Representatives act on the housing bill. Every Republican on the Rules Committee voted against allowing the House to consider it. That is typical of the difference between the Democratic and the Republican attitudes towards the housing bill that we so badly need.', 'In the Senate, 70 percent of the Democrats voted for that housing bill; 70 percent of the Republicans in the Senate voted against the bill, and for a substitute phony housing bill sponsored by this same real estate lobby. They kept the housing bill from passing.', ""That is what happened to housing legislation in the 80th Congress. That is why we do not now have a Federal program for slum clearance, low-rent public housing, and for low-rent rural housing. I have been told that the real estate lobby is bragging that they licked the President of the United States. Well, let me tell you something-I'm not licked yet by any means."", 'I think I know what the American people want, and I promise you that I am trying to see that they get it.', ""I know that every veterans organization, the American Conference of Mayors, farm groups, women's groups, church groups, and most of the American citizens endorse that housing bill that I tried to put through last session, and I am going to carry this message to every town and village in America."", 'If you want housing, you had better vote the Democratic ticket.', 'I remember about 20 years ago that a popular Republican slogan was, ""Two cars in every garage."" This year their slogan is, ""Two families in every garage.""', 'I wish I had time to tell you all about the other ways that 80th Congress failed the American people, how they failed to enact a health bill, or provide Federal aid for States to meet their acute problems in education, how they knocked the props out from under farm prosperity, and how they so greatly weakened the strength of organized labor.', ""When you learn the truth about all those issues, you will be as amazed as I was when the Republican candidate for President said that he was proud of the record of that 80th Congress. I just don't know what he is proud of."", 'You people in Wisconsin are fortunate in having real progressives running for office this year on the Democratic ticket. You have men like Horace Wilkie, a World War II veteran, who has studied the housing problem carefully and was one of the leaders of the National Veterans Conference. Horace Wilkie can truly represent the liberals of Madison, and of course, you have men like Carl Thompson who will make one of the best Governors Wisconsin ever had.', 'These men believe, as I do, and as the whole Democratic Party does, that we must have firm and fair laws to bring down the cost of living, that we must have a housing bill, and a national health program, that we must insure a fair deal to farmers, to labor, to the small businessman, and to the white-collar worker.', 'They believe, as I believe, in government for the benefit of all the people, not in government for the benefit of special privilege.', 'Now, we are faced with a real problem-your problem. For the first time in history you are going to have a chance to decide whether you want a government run by the people or whether you want a government run by special interest. This country, in 1947, had the greatest national income in the history of the world--$217 billion. That income was reasonably fairly distributed, between the farmer, the laboringman, and the businessman--particularly the small businessman.', ""Now, the acts, and the effects of the acts of this 80th Congress are trying to upset that balanced program. They want special privilege, because the first thing they did was to pass the rich man's tax bill, and now they are soliciting all those rich men for campaign funds to put out a propaganda campaign against me and my administration."", 'That income tax bill would let a fellow who made $60 a week save about $1.50 a week--or $1.60 maybe--but a fellow who got $100,000 a year saves $16,000, and they are inviting him to turn half of that over to the Republican campaign committee. A lot of them will do it, too.', ""Now you people can vote for your own best interests by voting for yourselves on election day, or you can vote for this crowd that has made the policy of the Republican Party in the 80th Congress. I don't believe you are going to do that. I think you are going to go to the polls and vote for the American way of life.""]"
45,Harry S Truman ,"October 14, 1948","['Key Terms: Truman whistle stop speech and speeches, Truman 1948 campaign speech', '[1.] MANKATO, MINNESOTA (8:08 a.m.)', ""Good morning! I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this wonderful reception this early in the morning. It shows very conclusively that you are interested in the welfare of this great Republic of ours or you wouldn't come out to hear the facts. It proves to me that you people here in southern Minnesota are just as much concerned about the problems that the country has to face today as are the people everywhere else I visited."", 'You know, I warned the people of this country not to risk entrusting their destiny to recent converts to the principles of our foreign policy--I did that last night in St. Paul--converts who would seek to curry favor by putting on the mantle of such principles in order to further their own political ambitions. You want to watch that closely. They are coming across now with a ""me too,"" because I smoked them out. I am telling the facts and the facts are things they can\'t stand. They don\'t want you to know the facts.', 'Mankato is a good example of the close dependence of farms on cities and cities on farms in this country. Farm prosperity makes for more business in the cities, just like that great city here, and more jobs in the great factories in your town. By the same token, when production and employment are high and workers are receiving good pay, the farmer is able to find a ready market for his products. Whatever helps the worker naturally helps the farmer, and whatever helps the farmer, in reverse, helps the worker.', ""Look at the farm prosperity here in Minnesota today. I am going to give you some figures that will startle you. Back in the last Republican depression year of 1932, the farmers' income in the whole State of Minnesota was less than $250 million. Last year the farmers of Minnesota made $1Â½ billion, six times what they made in 1932. Now, that was not by accident. The prosperity didn't just happen. It was carefully planned and carefully administered by the Democratic administrations of the last 16 years. And this Republican 80th Congress tried its best to tear up that program."", ""Study the situation--the Democratic plan which helped to develop the cooperatives through the Rural Electrification Act. We made loans to farmers cooperatives to bring electric power to the farms. Back in the Republican days only 1 Minnesota farm in 14 had electricity. Now, thanks to REA and the great work done by the farmers cooperatives since then, 6 out of every 10 Minnesota farms has electricity--and we're going to get those other 4 before we get through."", ""But in order to do that you've got to vote for yourselves. You've got to put somebody in the White House and somebody in the Congress that will look after your interests. You have got a good man running for Congress, running here in this district, and I hope you'll send Mr. Manwell back to the Congress to help to do these things I am talking about; and you must, by all means, send the man from Minneapolis, Mr. Humphrey, to the Senate in place of that liberal Mr. Ball who has been converted to reactionaryism since he has been in the Senate--and I'm sorry to have to say that."", ""No one here doubts that cooperatives are a good thing. They have been a tremendous boon to the farmer. They have improved the farmer's bargaining position in dealing with the huge corporations that farmers must sell to and buy from. Despite the immense benefits cooperatives have brought to the people of Minnesota and to the Midwestern States, the Republican Party in the last Congress, and every time they have had a chance, has fought them bitterly. For example, 9 out of every 10 Republicans voted against rural electrification last year. Three out of four Republicans in Congress voted against REA this year. Not quite so many of them voted against it this year because they had to go out and ask you for votes. The reason for Republican opposition is plain. Big business is opposed to cooperatives, and the big power companies are particularly opposed to rural electrification. You see, they don't get the rake-off when the farmers cooperatives run the electric power for the farmers, and that's true of all municipal plants."", 'You will find the big electric trusts, electric power trusts, fighting every municipal plant in the country. They try to surround them and choke them off.', 'Of course, the Democrats supported REA. The Democratic Party is always on the side of the people, just as you\'ll find the Republican Party always on the side of special interests. That has been the case ever since the Republican Party got power in Washington. The Republican Party will not admit in an election year that it is opposed to cooperatives. They put a weasel-word into the cooperatives plank of their platform when they said they would support--now listen; this is a direct quote from the Republican platform--""The principle of bona fide farmer-owned, farmer-operated cooperatives.""', 'Now, the Democratic Party indulges in no such double-talk. We say flatly that we will encourage farm cooperatives, period.', ""Yet, only a third of the registered voters turned out to vote in 1946. The Republicans took over Congress as a result. The Republicans began their attack on cooperatives. They started an investigation of cooperatives in an effort to smear them. I know something about congressional investigations. I was chairman of that special committee that was formed to investigate the national defense program during the war, and I think I carried on more investigations than any other Senator in the history of the Senate over that 3-year period. And we didn't carry on smear investigations. We carried on investigations for the purpose of introducing legislation to cure ills of the country. You won't find that the case with these present-day investigating committees. They are trying to investigate us out of office. They are after Democrats--they are not after the welfare of the country."", ""Do you know how you can stop this attack on cooperatives? It's very easy. There's only one way. That is to come out and vote on November the 2d, and get your friends to come out and vote; and as I said all over the country, vote in your own interests, vote for yourselves. When you vote the Democratic ticket, you are not only voting for me and this good man who is running for the Senate in Minnesota, and the Congressman--you are voting for yourselves and your own interests."", ""You, the people, are the Government; and when you exercise your right to vote, you run the Government, and when you don't exercise your vote--as you didn't exercise it in 1946--you get such things as that 80th Congress, and you get just what you deserve when you do that because you shirked your duty."", ""Now, get up early on election day, go down to the polls, and vote for yourselves.

They had more lobbies in Washington around this Congress than it has ever had before in the history of the country, and they spent more money than ever before in the history of the country. It is one of the most shameful sessions that this country has ever had. I name it the second worst Congress in the history of the United States. Of course, they don't like that. And that means not that all the men in that Congress were not the right sort of people. It means that the leadership, the Republicans who controlled that Congress, are the ones who stand for that Congress.

Mr. Ewing has just finished his study, and has submitted a long report entitled ""The Nation\'s Health--A Ten Year Plan."" That report I have a summary of it right here--is an impressive document. It tells about the progress we have been making, but at the same time it reveals some shocking facts.', 'Every year--now listen to this--every year, more than 325,000 Americans die who could have been saved if they had had the right kind of medical attention and care that we know how to provide.', ""Only 20 percent--one-fifth of our population is able to afford the medical care they need.

And believe me, I have been telling them what the issues are! I have been traveling through Minnesota since yesterday at noon, when I crossed the St. Louis River and arrived in Duluth. It has been a thrilling experience. It has not only been fine to see your rich farmland, and the great grain elevators, and your cities enjoying greater prosperity than ever before in history, but it has been especially rewarding to travel through Minnesota and meet your fellow Minnesotans, and your great candidate for the Senate, Mayor Hubert Humphrey, and your fine candidates for Congress, and Karl Rolvaag, whom I am sure you are going to send to the Congress. You are also going to send Mayor Humphrey of Minneapolis to the Senate, and then we will have people in the 81st Congress with whom the President can work."", 'The crowds that have come down to the stations prove beyond any doubt that you people are determined to elect a liberal, Democratic President and a liberal, Democratic congressional delegation when you go to the polls on November 2.', ""You know that this prosperity that I have seen all through Minnesota did not just happen. It was brought about by 16 years of control of the Government by Democratic administrations. Back in the Republican depression year of 1932, Minnesota farmers made less than a quarter of a billion dollars. Last year, the income of Minnesota's farmers was a billion and a half dollars. That is the difference between the right side of a proposition so that everybody gets his fair share of the national income, and that approach which gives only the special privileged few the national income."", 'One key in the Democratic prosperity program was the Commodity Credit Corporation. One job of the Commodity Credit Corporation was to increase grain storage facilities, so that bumper crops could be marketed over a longer period of time, thus making it unnecessary for the farmer to sell all his wheat or his corn to big speculators, at very cheap prices.', 'The Commodity Credit Corporation did a wonderful job for years, and then something happened to it. Two-thirds of you stayed at home from the polls in 1946, and the Republicans got control of the Congress. That Both ""do-nothing"" Congress came about because you didn\'t do your duty as voters.', 'The farmers are just now beginning to realize what that means to them. Big business is against any aid to the farmers, and the Republican leaders in Congress are the errand boys of big business and special privilege.', 'That is why the Republican 80th ""donothing"" Congress--I mean do nothing for the people, they did something for the special interests all right--that is why that Congress cut the Commodity Credit Corporation grain storage program down to almost nothing. Now there is a bumper crop, and the Commodity Credit Corporation no longer has the authority to provide storage space, and the farmers are being forced to sell their grain to speculators way below support prices. And that situation will get worse. It has just now started. Right now, speculators are buying corn below the support price. That is just plain robbery of the farmers, and the farmers owe that to the 80th Congress. Now, if you send an 81st Congress back like that one, you will get treated worse than that.', 'This Republican sabotage of the Commodity Credit Corporation has not only hurt the farmer. It has also hurt every industry and every business in the State of Minnesota, because as you all know, your prosperity depends upon farm prosperity.', ""It is up to you whether or not this Republican special interest domination of Congress is going to continue. If you don't vote on November 2d, the chances are that the special interests will proceed to control the country and the Congress and the Government."", ""Now, two-thirds of you didn't vote in 1946--and look what you got! Don't do that again. Go out and do your duty on election day. This election will decide the future of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and the farm program. It will decide much more than that for the whole country. It will decide whether soil conservation and reforestation go forward with the Democrats, or go backwards with the Republicans. It will decide whether we will be able to bring down the cost of living with the Democrats, or keep on with skyrocketing prices under a Republican program."", 'It will decide whether we have slum clearance, and low-rent housing, and good rural housing with the Democrats, or whether we shall have a housing shortage under a Republican administration. It will decide whether we will have full development of our great river system, so that cities like Winona can develop into great river ports, or whether eastern power and railroad lobbies get control under the Republicans and stop the development of our great waterways.', 'Every one of these issues is at stake in this election. When you realize how much this election means to you, and to your own prosperity, I am confident you will turn out on election day and vote for your own interest. You are voting for yourselves. When you vote for yourselves, you will vote for the interests of all the people, and that is you, and me, and everybody else.', ""When you do that, you can't help but send a Democratic Congress back to Washington, and you can't help but have a Democratic President in the White House; and then your President won't be troubled with the housing shortage, he will have a house to live in for the next 4 years."", 'This is one of the most important elections this country has faced in 40 years, and it will have its effects for generations to come.

We can keep this country prosperous if we continue and extend the Democratic programs started under the administration of President Roosevelt.', 'One of these programs that the people of Wisconsin know a great deal about is soil conservation. I am very proud of the Democratic record for the past 16 years with regard to the conservation of natural resources.', 'You all know what conservation has meant to the American farmer. By 1932, America had lost one-third of her rich topsoil, and there was real danger that our farms would lose their productivity. You know, Wisconsin and Minnesota and Iowa and Missouri and Illinois were letting the farms wash away and were making counties in Louisiana. Well, we have stopped that. Now, that danger is nearly passed. The Democratic soil conservation program has been extended to nearly three million farms in this country. But we ought not to rest until every acre in the country is properly managed so that it will retain its fertility permanently.', 'Now, you would think every sensible person would favor soil conservation. But, believe it or not, some men have been attacking this work for years. They have been the Republican politicians. The majority of the Republicans in Congress opposed the original Soil Conservation Act of 1936 and did not want to see it passed. I was in the Senate at that time and the Republicans fought that bill tooth-and-toenail. The Democratic majorities in the House and Senate voted almost solidly for soil conservation, and pushed that law through the Congress at that time.', ""But in the Republican 80th Congress, the soil conservation program has received a serious setback. The Republicans cut out the funds which are used for payments to farmers who follow sound conservation policies. The Democrats tried to restore those funds, and I am proud to say that every Democrat in the House and every Democratic Senator voted for that restoration. But, 9 out of 10 Republicans voted against soil conservation, and the funds were seriously cut. They weren't content with the cut. The Republican leaders in the Senate wanted to abandon the present system of soil conservation payments; and I am proud again that every Democrat in the Senate voted against this Republican attack. Thirty-eight of the Republicans voted to abandon the system, but three Republicans came over to the Democratic side and saved the soil conservation program from destruction. The American farmer was lucky that the Republicans didn't have a larger majority in the 80th Congress than they did. The farmer would certainly have been in a bad fix if that had been the case."", 'But, although the Democrats in Congress have saved the program by their solid support, the Republicans still have prevented the program from being carried forward by cutting down appropriations.', ""I understand you have a Republican running for Governor in this State who is running on a program of soil conservation. Can you imagine that! And yet, they tell me this man doesn't even belong to the group of soil conservation farmers in his own district. Yet he is running on a conservation program. You better elect Thompson and save yourselves. Don't be fooled by Republican promises. Look at the record."", ""You know, the Republicans write a platform to get votes. They don't write a platform to be carried out in a policy after the election is over. That is the sort of platform they have got right now--the most hypocritical, deceitful document that has ever been written, and trying to be foisted off on the American public by the Republican candidate for President. Remember 1932 and what the Democratic program has meant to the United States since that time. Think, for example, what the Department of Agriculture is doing this year to help some of your local people here, north of Sparta, your cranberry growers. There is a great surplus, and the Department is doing a terrific job of promotion to help sell that surplus. Cranberry growers never received that kind of help from a single Republican administration that I know of."", 'The story I have told you about soil conservation is just one of many stories like it. Take rural electrification. They have tried their best to strangle rural electrification; and I am told by the head of your rural electrification setup here in Wisconsin that if it were not for rural electrification, some of your private power companies would be on a brownout right now--and yet, they would like to strangle it to death.', ""They have tried also to choke farm housing, rural education, farm-to-market roads, and cooperatives. On all those issues the story is just the same, and that is the reason I have to go around over the country and tell you about it. They are not going to tell you about it because they couldn't get a single vote if they did tell the truth about how they stand on these issues."", ""The Democratic Party has been fighting to carry these measures forward, but Republican leaders have done their best to slow down or stop completely the progress we have been making. That 80th Congress-oh, that awful 80th Congress--proved that. That Congress shows what Republican policy will be under a Republican administration. And the Republican candidate for President says he's proud of the 80th Congress. Can you imagine that!"", ""Now, the best way for you to take care of the situation is to vote in your own interests. Vote for yourselves, and when you vote for yourselves, you can't help but go to the polls on the second of November, and vote a straight Democratic ticket. You will be voting in your own interests, and you'll have a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President that will look after the interests of the people, and not the special interests. That's the issue in this campaign."", 'Remember that and study it because it means everything in the world to the people who live in this country.', 'Thank you very much.', '[6.] ELROY, WISCONSIN (1:55 p.m.)', ""I certainly do appreciate your coming out here.

I am glad, too, to hear that you are lining up solidly behind Horace Wilkie for Congress, and Carl Thompson for Governor. I know Horace Wilkie's record. He is an outstanding liberal and a leader of the veterans of World War II, and I am highly pleased that a leader of the old Progressive Party of Wisconsin, Carl Thompson, is the Democratic candidate for Governor. He certainly will be elected. I'm just as sure of that as I stand here."", ""In this crusade I'm on I like to think that the Democrats are following in the pattern of the vital progressive crusades that have come out of Wisconsin throughout the history of the State. You have always been on the side of the people and not on the side of special interests."", ""Waukesha is an industrial city in the center of a rich agricultural area. You know what I mean when I say you're for the people. Industry, the farm, the small merchant, are all in the same boat. Their interests are all with the Democratic Party, which looks after the welfare of the people as a whole. You know that the people don't want any more negative legislation like the Republican Congress has given you. You want progressive legislation and leadership, leadership that's exemplified by the Democratic Party."", 'I often refer to that Both Congress as the ""do-nothing"" Congress. When I say ""donothing"" I mean they have done nothing for the people. They\'ve not listened to the people\'s demands for decent, low-cost housing. They haven\'t listened to the people\'s demands for bringing down the high cost of living. They have not listened to the people\'s demands for continuing the fair and equitable farm price support program. They have not listened to the people\'s demands for a fair break for labor. That\'s what I mean by ""do nothing.""', ""On the other side, that Congress did plenty. They've started a move to set labor back to the pre-Wagner Act days. They want to turn the clock back. They have worked all the time, this 80th Congress has, for 2 years, to turn the clock back, and the clock won't run backwards. You know that. They put our farmers behind the 8-ball again by making it impossible for the Commodity Credit Corporation to get the storage facilities necessary to handle this year's bumper crops, and they did that with malice aforethought, and they did it for the speculator's lobby."", 'The real progressive movement in the Nation today is in the Democratic Party. Horace Wilkie, Carl Thompson, Andy Biemiller, and all the rest--these are the progressive Americans of today. We stand for laws to bring down the cost of living, laws to insure that the farmer receives a parity income, comprehensive housing laws to clear away slums and provide decent low-rental housing, and better rural housing, a genuine national health program, better schools in both cities and rural areas, and a fair labor-management law to replace that shameful Taft-Hartley Act.', ""Now, in 1946, two-thirds of the qualified voters of the United States stayed at home, and one-third of the voters gave us that terrible 80th Congress. Now, I hope sincerely that two-thirds of you won't stay at home this time. I want 100 percent of the voters in this county to go out and express their opinions at the polls. And if you do that, the country will be in safe hands cause when the people express their opinions and their will at the ballot box, you'll get the right sort of results. It's when you do not exercise your privileges that things such as the 80th Congress come along. Let's have everyone get out to the polls on election day. If we are going to elect Democratic candidates who will work for the people and for prosperity, every one of you must go to the polls."", ""All I ask is that you look at the record. And then get your friends and your neighbors and be sure that everybody votes on the 2d of November and if you do that, your President won't be troubled with the housing shortage--I'll be in the White House for another 4 years.

46,Harry S Truman ,"October 15, 1948","['[1.] HAMMOND, INDIANA (Rear platform, 9:10 a.m.)', ""Good morning! Thank you, Frank, for that most cordial introduction. You know, there are certain Members of the Congress who are all right, and Ray Madden is one of them. He is for the people every time he has had the opportunity. His record is straight and clean, in your interest. I can't say that for the Republican leadership of that Congress. I think Indiana is going to come back where it belongs. I think you are going to send a Democratic congressional delegation to the Congress, and you are going to elect Schricker for Governor, and the whole ticket right down the line."", 'I certainly appreciate this fine reception from the people of Hammond. Before I say anything else, I would like to congratulate you on the wonderful war production record you set here. Hammond was one of the main centers of tank production, and our armies all over the world were grateful for the high quality of the work you turned out. You were efficient, you were helpful, you made one of the great contributions toward winning the war.', 'I wish I had time to tell you all about the issues in this campaign--labor laws, and high prices, and housing. That is not possible, but let me give you an example--an example which shows the difference in labor policies of the Democratic and the Republican Parties.', 'The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 was passed by a Democratic Congress on the recommendation of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act was bitterly opposed by the Republicans in both Houses of Congress. Nearly twothirds of the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against it. About nine-tenths of the Republicans in the Senate voted against it.', 'That act established a minimum straight-time hourly wage for all workers. It required payment of time and a half for all hours over 40 hours a week. It outlawed all oppressive child labor.', 'The Fair Labor Standards Act now covers an estimated 20 million American workers.', 'I asked the Both Congress to increase the minimum wage under that act to at least 75 cents an hour, and I asked that the protection of the act be extended to many additional millions of workers.', 'The Republican Both Congress refused the minimum wage. The Republicans refused to extend the Fair Labor Standards provisions.', ""Now the Republican candidate for President is campaigning on the record of the Both Congress. Can you imagine that? And he won't come out and say what he believes the minimum wage ought to be. He is ducking the issue. He says he believes in the minimum wage, but as I said at St. Paul the other evening, I think the smaller the minimum the better the Republicans like it."", ""Now just a little bit about high prices. Prices are so high now that they are cutting into people's savings. I think it is a terrible thing when a family has to dip into its savings--savings which it set aside for old age, or to educate their children--in order to buy bread and butter. I have done my best to get the Republican 80th Congress to do something about it. I called them back into special session twice, and I asked them to give relief to the American people from high prices. But the Republican Congress refused to take effective action against high prices. And if a Republican Congress and a Republican candidate are elected this year, you can be sure they still won't do anything."", 'We know that, because the Republican candidate says the 80th Congress delivered for the future of the country as no other Congress ever did. Apparently he believes that failure to help you meet the rising cost of living was a good thing for the country.', 'I am asking the people here to get out and vote this year. If we have a Democratic Congress, then I can prevent this inflation from blighting the future of the American family. I can have the minimum wage raised to at least 75 cents an hour, and we can look forward to fair labor laws, decent housing, and all the other progressive measures that the Democratic Party believes in and stands for. The Republican Party opposes every one of these things.', 'In 1944, 75,000 Democrats voted in the First Congressional District of Indiana, only 46,000 Republicans voted.', 'In 1946, one-third of the Democrats were lazy and stayed at home. But all 46,000 Republicans, and a few hundred more, went to the polls.', ""You can't afford to let that happen this year."", ""This is your election. You have got to decide whether you want to run this Government, or whether you want special privilege to run this Government; and if you don't want special privilege to run the Government, you had better get out early on election day and vote the Democratic ticket straight, and vote in your own interests."", '[2.] NORTH JUDSON, INDIANA (Rear platform, 10:45 a.m.)', ""Thank you, Governor. I certainly appreciate very highly that wonderful introduction. I am most happy to be in the Governor's hometown. I know you must be exceedingly proud that you are the native city of one of Indiana's greatest Governors, and the next Governor of Indiana."", ""I am also glad to be in the district of Judge Smith. You see, Judge Smith is running against Charlie Halleck. As you all know, Charlie is the Floor Leader of the Republican Party in the Congress, and Charlie-while I like him personally, and I wouldn't want to injure him personally--politically I would like to put him out of business."", 'He faces backwards instead of forwards. He has tried his best to turn the clock back ever since he has been in the Congress. He almost succeeded this time and I think the best way to keep him from ruining that clock would be just leaving it home the next time.', 'I am very glad to be able to stop here in this town. Judging by the condition of the Indiana countryside I rode through on the way here, the farmers around here must be doing pretty well. The fact is the whole country is prosperous after 16 years of the Democrats. I want to keep it that way. I am very anxious to keep it that way.', 'In the past few days, I have been reminding the people of the laws passed by the Democratic Congresses under Democratic Presidents which are responsible for this prosperity. Today I want to tell you the other side of the story. I am going to talk about how the Republicans have been attacking those laws.', 'One example is the Republican attack on the soil conservation program, which means so much to the farmers. You people here in Starke County know what the Democratic soil conservation program has meant to your community; 1847 farms representing 71 percent of the cropland in Starke County participated in the agricultural conservation program this year. That means that the farms around here will have an abundant and a sustained yield.', 'But the Republicans are trying to kill or cripple the conservation program. More than three out of every four House Republicans, and more than two out of every three Senate Republicans voted against the Soil Conservation Act when the Democrats passed it.', 'In 1948, the Republicans cut the funds for payments to farmers who follow sound conservation programs. Every Democratic member of the Senate voted to restore these cuts, but nine out of ten Republicans voted against the restoration so the funds were slashed way down.', 'When a Republican introduced the motion that would abandon the present system of soil conservation payments, every Democrat in the Senate voted against that resolution. Nine out of ten Republicans voted to abandon the system.', 'When the final appropriations for farm funds, which had been cut by the Republicans, were being considered in the House, every Democratic member of the House voted to restore those funds. Nine out of ten Republicans voted against the restoration. They were led by Mr. Halleck.', 'This is the record of the two parties which you are to choose between in November. The Republican Party has consistently tried to kill, cripple, or delay the Democratic farm program. But on the three key farm votes this year, every Democrat in both Houses backed the program.', ""That proves to you that you can't go wrong by voting the straight Democratic ticket. That shows you which party has the interests of the farmer at heart. Exactly the same differences exist between the two parties on the other issues you are interested in--housing, education, health, control of high prices, fair labor laws, and all the rest of the forward-looking things for which the Democrats have stood ever since 1932."", 'Now, if you are interested in your own personal welfare, and this is your fight-this is your fight--you must exercise the privilege that gives you control of the Government, and that is the privilege to vote.', 'You know, in 1946 two-thirds of the people of the United States did not vote, and that is the reason we got this backward-looking 80th Congress.', ""Now, on November the 2d this time, exercise your rights and let the country remain in control of the people. If you do that, you will get up early on election day and go to the polls and vote the straight Democratic ticket. Then you will have a Democratic Governor, a Democratic Congressman from this district, you will have a President in the White House--and I won't have to go house hunting on the 20th of January."", '[3.] LOGANSPORT, INDIANA (Rear platform, 11:43 a.m.)', ""Thank you, thank you very much. I certainly appreciate that introduction by National Committeeman McHale in his hometown. He has been worrying all the way down here as to whether we were going to have a turnout or not, and we have the best turnout we've had in Indiana anywhere. I don't believe Indianapolis is going to be able to equal this."", ""I was highly pleased when I found out, by accident, that the train crew on this train are all Democrats. You know the reason I know they are all Democrats? They took us over here at Junction Point 15 minutes late, and they got in here 5 minutes ahead of time. Now, it takes a Democrat to do that. We have had wonderful train crews all around the country and they've been just as kind to us as they could possibly be. I understand we have got a politician on this train crew--that the Conductor, Berkshire, is running for Sheriff. That is the reason the train got here on time."", 'I am most happy to be able to spend a few minutes here in Logansport this morning, on the banks of the Wabash River. I have heard of the Wabash River all my life and I have crossed it a dozen times, but I have never been at this point on the Wabash River. I wish I could stay longer.', 'I have been traveling all over the country, telling the people of this great Nation what the issues are in this campaign. I have talked to farmers and to people in the big cities. I have talked to small businessmen, white-collar workers, and I have been reminding them of what the Democratic Party stands for, and how all of them would pay through the nose if the Republican Party wins this election.', 'Now, you have got representation in Congress from this district that looks backward. I am certainly hoping that you will send Judge Ted Smith to Congress from this district. This Congress needs representation for the people and not for the special interests.', 'Here in this great railroad town I would like to talk about the Republican attitude toward workers. The Republican 80th Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in a determined effort to weaken organized labor so that the workers of this Nation would not be in such a good position to bargain for better wages and working conditions. The other night in Akron, Ohio, I showed conclusively that the Republicans plan even more drastic antilabor legislation if they are elected next month. Republican leaders regard the Taft-Hartley Act merely as the first step.', ""Now, you people here in Logansport know what great benefits the railroad brotherhoods have brought to all of you. The brotherhoods have been responsible for bringing very much better incomes to all railroad workers. I think there are about 4,000 railroadmen in this good town. And higher pay means better living standards for themselves and their families, more business for the merchants here in town, and better markets for the farmers in the surrounding community. Now, I wonder if there is anybody in this town that wants to see the rug pulled out from under the brotherhoods and wants to see them weakened. That is what the Republicans are asking for. They are trying to take the rights away from labor which were given to them under the Wagner Act which the Democrats passed. I am sure that you don't want that to happen."", ""The Democratic Party has always fought for the welfare of labor, and particularly for the railroadmen. The first great law passed for the benefit of the railroad workers was the Adamson Act, passed in Woodrow Wilson's administration in 1916. We have been working for your benefit ever since, and we will continue to do that."", ""You know, the train crews in those days were getting from $50 to $125 a month. The Republicans had been in power all that time and they had never done a thing for them--and they have never done a thing, consciously, for labor in their lives. What I am saying to you is that the pay of the railroadmen is from 3 to 5 times what it was in those days, and the towns in which they live have better times--the farmers have better times. They are all hooked together. You can't be good to one and not to the other. And that's what the Democratic Party stands for--all the people, and not for just a few at the top."", 'Of course, I know Logansport is interested in a great many things other than railroading. You are vitally interested in the prosperity of the farmers here in this county, Cass County. I live next door to Cass County down in Missouri. Jackson County adjoins Cass County on the north, and that is where I live. Our Democratic programs have helped the farmer just as much as they have helped the worker. When the Democrats took over in 1933, after 12 years of Republican misrule, three out of four farms in Cass County, Ind., were mortgaged. Many were being foreclosed, and the banks were going broke everyday. Today, Indiana farmers are enjoying the greatest prosperity in their history. Only one Cass County farm in 15 is mortgaged now. What brought that about? The policy of the Democratic Party is to see that the distribution of the national income gets into the hands of all the people and not just a few at the top, as I said before.', ""Now, if you want to keep this prosperity, the best way for you to keep it is to go to the polls on the 2d day of November and vote a straight Democratic ticket. Then you will have Henry Schricker for Governor of this great State of Indiana, and you will have Ted Smith as a Representative from this district-and you certainly need representatives in this district, as I said before. Don't fail, now. Do your duty as citizens."", ""You know, in 1946 two-thirds of the people stayed at home and didn't vote--and we got the Both Congress, and we got just what we deserved. People who don't exercise their rights have no right to complain if those rights are not looked after. Every man and woman in this country who is entitled to vote should exercise that privilege--and then the Government will be in the hands of the people, where the Constitution intended it to be."", ""Don't fail, now. Turn out on election day. Vote the Democratic ticket straight, and I'll still stay in the White House and I won't be troubled with the housing shortage on the 20th of January."", '[4.] KOKOMO, INDIANA (Rear platform, 1:02 p.m.)', ""Madam Chairman:I appreciate very much that introduction. I thought I had seen all the people in Indiana at the first two stops today, but I evidently hadn't seen a third of them. you're all here; and it shows conclusively that you are interested in the welfare of this country or you wouldn't come out like this to hear what your President has to say."", ""Indiana is one of the great States in the Union, and I want to see Indiana go right this time by electing a Democratic Governor and sending a Democratic delegation to the Congress. I am sure you'll elect John Walsh, here, to take the place of our backward-looking Congressman who represents this district. We need somebody to go along with the clock, not try to turn it back. And I know if you do that, you will elect a whole State ticket, with Governor Schricker at the head of it."", ""I have been traveling through the country, telling people the facts about the election this November, facts about high prices and housing and labor laws and the farmer's condition. The Republican candidate for President won't tell you the facts. He is just talking high-level platitudes, which mean nothing in a political campaign--and sometimes the Republican campaign oratory doesn't even tell the truth."", ""Kokorno is a manufacturing town famous for its farm machinery, stoves, and furnaces, and many other products. A great deal of your prosperity comes from your factories. At the same time, you are in the middle of one of the richest agricultural areas in the whole world. Business here is good when farmers are prosperous, as they are now. But when the farmers are broke, as they were in the early 1930's after 12 years of Republican misrule, then the cities like Kokomo have a very hard time getting along--and you have people out of work and people walking the streets hunting for jobs. You know that prosperity for the farmer and prosperity for the townspeople go hand in hand. Good farm incomes help the people in the towns, and high wages in the towns means that there are good markets for farm crops. We can enjoy genuine prosperity only when all groups of the American people are well off."", 'But this simple fact seems to escape the Republicans. They think the farmer is getting too much for his crops, and they tell the people in the towns that that is the reason for high prices. Then they go out and tell the farmer that prices are high because wages in the city are too high. Neither of those statements is correct. The Republican remedy for high prices seems to be to pull everybody down in a crash all together, like they did in 1929.', ""The 80th Congress has knocked the props out from under the long-range prosperity of the farmer, and the farmer hasn't yet begun to feel it. And whenever that happens, whenever that begins to come home to the farmer, cities like Kokomo are going to feel it. They have done their best to see that the workers' income has come down by passing the Taft-Hartley Act to weaken labor, and they haven't helped any of us because of the fact that they refused to pass price control laws which I asked for time and again."", 'To keep the kind of prosperity we now have, and to bring prices down, and to get decent housing at prices you can afford, and to make sure of a peaceful, prosperous, and advancing Nation--the best way you can get those things is to go to the polls on November the 2d and vote a Democratic ticket.', 'Now, in 1946 two out of every three people in this country said, ""What difference does one vote make? Mine won\'t do any good."" And so only one out of every three voters went to the polls--and look what you got. You got the 80th Congress, and you got just what you deserved. You\'ll get something like that again if you don\'t exercise your privilege to vote this time.', ""I'm urging you with all I have: this time we've got to have an election that really represents a majority of the people. Be sure that you are one of those who gets up early and gets to the polls. Do that in your own interests. You'll be voting for yourselves. The farmers will be voting for themselves if they vote a Democratic ticket. The workers will be voting for themselves if they vote the Democratic ticket. That's true of the workers in the city; that's true of the farmers; that's true of the white-collar workers."", ""More is at stake in this campaign than ever before in the history of the country, in my recollection, and you must exercise your privilege as a part of the Government. When you refuse to vote, you can't blame what happens in the capital cities on anybody but yourselves, because you have control of this Government when you want to exercise it."", ""Now, I'm urging you with everything I have; get up early on election day, go to the polls, and vote for yourselves and your interests by voting a straight Democratic ticket."", '[5.] TIPTON, INDIANA (Rear platform, 2:45 p.m.)', 'Thanks, Governor, for that prophecy and that introduction. I appreciate it most highly.', 'I am very glad to be able to stop here in Tipton this afternoon. I wish I could stay longer. I have been doing a great deal of traveling in the past month, telling the people of the country what the issues in this campaign are. Everywhere I have gone, I have found the country is doing pretty after 16 years of Democratic administration. I want to keep it that way. In order to keep it that way, we must elect a Democratic Congress to go along with the Democratic President. Therefore, you should send John Walsh to the Congress.', 'We can keep America prosperous only if we stick to the policies and the programs of the past 16 years which have brought this prosperity.', 'Here, in the middle of some of the best farming country in the world, I am going to talk to you about the attack by the Republicans on the Democratic farm program. I am going to explain just how the Republicans are trying to turn the clock back by tearing down the Democratic programs which have brought prosperity to all of you.', ""President Roosevelt's administration established the Commodity Credit Corporation. The Commodity Credit served as a reservoir for farm products, to see that farm prices don't fall during the fat years, and to see that the Nation is well-fed during the lean years. Another measure to provide a floor under farm markets was the school lunch program. This program sees that farm surpluses are used to provide good, nourishing lunches to schoolchildren all over the country."", 'The latest measure of the administration designed to provide stable markets for the farmer was the International Wheat Agreement. Each of these measures has been opposed bitterly by the Republican Party. In 1948, the Republican 80th Congress refused to grant funds for the Commodity Credit Corporation, to provide storage space for grains. This means that farmers will have to sell their grain at dump prices, or let it rot in improper storage. It has already forced many farmers to sell their grain at prices lower than the support price. It will mean smaller supplies of grain in the future.', ""I want you to remember very carefully that this same Republican leadership will be in control of the 81st Congress if you people don't go out to the polls on election day and vote the Democratic ticket."", 'The Republicans crippled this program at the request of the grain speculators who wanted to force farmers to sell their grain at low prices so they could make a killing. They are starting to do that just now.', 'In 1948, the Republican 80th Congress cut funds for the school lunch program. This follows the Republican line established when they voted against the School Lunch Program Act of 1946. At that time, the law was passed by a Democratic Congress over bitter Republican opposition.', 'In 1948, the Republicans killed the International Wheat Agreement. This agreement would have provided world markets for wheat surpluses for the next 5 years. It would have promised American farmers a stable price for 185 million bushels of wheat a year for 5 years. It would have guaranteed the hungry European peoples a supply of grain. The Wheat Agreement was supported by every farm organization in the country. The Republicans killed it to please the large grain millers. The Republican leadership refused even to bring it to the floor of the Congress for a vote. The Republican leaders were afraid to let their own Party members vote. Now think of that.', 'That is part of the record you people are to vote on the 2d of November. The Republican Party has consistently opposed the Democratic farm program and the three cases I have cited are already being felt by the farmers.', 'The Democratic Party has always sought new ways to provide stable farm products. The CCC storage bins, the school lunch program, and the International Wheat Agreements are just three of many cases which demonstrate to the American people where their votes should go. The same differences exist between the Democratic and the Republican Parties on all the big issues, just like the farm issues.', ""The Republican Party doesn't want to raise minimum wages, or pass fair labor laws, or provide decent housing, or hold down the cost of living. The 80thCongress refused to do any of these things for the people. And there is no hope from the Republican candidate for President--he is running on the record of the 80thCongress, and every speech he makes in this campaign proves it conclusively."", ""If you people vote the Democratic ticket in November, you will be voting for yourselves. You know, you are really the Government when you exercise the privilege which the Constitution of the United States gives you. When you go out and vote, you then decide on what sort of government you will have. When you don't vote, you are shirking your duty as a citizen."", ""Two-thirds of the citizens of the United States failed to vote in 1946, and we got the 80th Congress. I sincerely hope that everybody who is entitled to vote will go to the polls and exercise that privilege on November 2d. If you do that, I am not the least bit worried about the results, for the simple reason that when you vote in your own interests you can't help but vote the Democratic ticket straight. That will mean you will have a Democratic Governor, a Democratic Congressman from this district, and you will have me back in the White House--and I won't be troubled with a housing shortage. on the 20th of January."", '[6.] NOBLESVILLE, INDIANA (Rear platform, 3:29 p.m .)', ""Thanks, Governor, for that prophecy. I think you're right, from the looks of things in Indiana. I think you're going to be the next Governor, and I think I am going to be the next President of the United States."", ""I've been going up and down this country, ladies and gentlemen, discussing the issues in this campaign, telling the people just exactly what we are faced with. I know here you are in the midst of one of the greatest farming areas in the world. Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa constitute the farm belt of the United States, the breadbasket of the Nation. And I think that the farmers in this neighborhood ought to be highly interested in the situation with which they are faced."", ""The Democratic Party, the Democratic administration inaugurated a farm program way back in 1934 and 1935, when the farmers were completely broke. At that time, in 1932, the net income of the farmers in the country was $2,600 million. Now, this program which the Democrats inaugurated for the farmer has been a working program because the farmer's income in 1947 was $18 billion--that's his net income. His gross income was 30 billions, but his net income was $18 billion."", ""Now then, after we elected this Republican 80th Congress in 1946--because twothirds of you stayed at home and didn't do your duty on election day--the Republicans in that Congress, the leadership, began to tear down the farm program. One of the first things they did when they rechartered the Commodity Credit Corporation was to take away from the Commodity Credit Corporation the right to furnish storage to farmers for the support price grain which stays on the farms. And now, because the Commodity Credit Corporation cannot furnish that storage, which the Republicans did by joker in the charter of the Commodity Credit Corporation, farmers are receiving prices below the support price right now for corn on the farm and for wheat on the farm. And that situation is going to get worse because we have the greatest corn crop in the history of the world in this country this year; and our program, the Democratic program, is to store the corn and the wheat in surplus years and hold it so that the market can be held stable so the farmer will get his fair share of the income of the country. And that is the reason the farmers are prosperous."", ""Now, these Republicans tell the farmers that high wages in the town causes the situation of high prices and causes inflation. They tell the workers in the towns that the farmer is getting too much for his produce-his wheat and his corn and his other produce, his cattle and his hogs--and that's the reason that we are on the road to inflation. Neither one of those things is true. They balance each other. When the workers get good wages and when the farmers get good prices the country is prosperous and the wealth of the country is distributed the way it ought to be--the farmer gets his fair share, the workingman gets his fair share, and the small businessman gets his fair share. That's Democratic principle. That's government for all the people."", ""Now, these Republicans are trying to tear down that principle. They are for special privilege. The first thing they did when they got in there was to pass a rich man's tax bill. I vetoed it three times, but they finally passed it over my final veto. And that is conclusively a rich man's tax bill. A man who gets $60 a week saves about $1.50 or $1.60 a week under that tax bill, and the prices have gone out of sight, so he has lost that $1.60 a week. But a man who gets $100,000 a year saves $16,000 on that tax bill. That bill was made for special privilege. That's been the legislative program of this 80th Congress, and that is the reason I call it the worst Congress except one that this country has ever seen."", ""Now then, you are faced with this situation: You are the Government when you want to be. You can control the Government because when you cast your vote that decides what sort of a government you will have. In 1946 just one-third of the people of this country voted; two-thirds of them stayed at home. And you got the 80th Congress. You got just what you deserved because you didn't do your duty. Don't do that again. Turn out on the 2d of November and send John O'Grady to the Congress and reelect Mr. Schricker Governor of this great State of Indiana; and if you do that I'll stay in the White House another 4 years and won't be troubled with the housing shortage on the 20th of January."", '[7.] INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA (Indiana Theater Ballroom, 4:55 p.m.)', 'Thank you, Governor. I think you are a good prophet, and I know you are a good prophet because I have been informed that this is a gathering of the Democratic workers of Indiana. The Democratic Party is based from the precinct and to the township and to the county and to the district and to the State. That kind of organization is really necessary to make a great party function.', 'I have had a most cordial welcome in Indiana today. I think a great deal of it was due to the fact that I was in the right sort of company--I had the company of that great committeeman, Mr. McHale; and I just feel that Indiana knows which side its bread is buttered on.', 'Back in 1946, if you remember, the Republicans were preaching that it was time for a change, and they wanted to know why, in electric signs all over the country, if people had had enough.', 'Well, two-thirds of the people decided that the issue was not worth taking a hand in, and they stayed at home, and we elected a Congress along the lines that the ""had enough"" people wanted, and I think we have had enough of that Congress and its principles.', 'Now it is time to change back to the party that has always been for the people. You had a dose of Republican rule for 12 years, from 1920 to 1932, when in March of 1933 Franklin Roosevelt took over. You have had now 2 years of an attempt to turn the clock back to 1922.', ""You can't do that."", 'We have got to go forward, and I know that when the Democratic workers in Indiana are willing to turn out as you have turned out this evening, just to see the President, and the next Governor, and your able and distinguished Democratic Mayor of Indianapolis, I know, after meeting all these wonderful people today, that Indiana is going along with the President and try to keep the clock running forward and not backward.']"
47,Harry S Truman ,"October 15, 1948","['Mr. Mayor, fellow Democrats of Indiana:', ""I am happy to be in Indianapolis again tonight--I almost said Independence. You know, I had a very funny experience here in Indianapolis once. I had a Republican friend in Washington and he wanted to get to St. Louis the shortest way, and he wanted to drive his car. So I told him how to leave Washington on 240 and take 40 to Indianapolis and that he had better stay overnight in Indianapolis, and then drive to St. Louis the next morning. Well, he stayed here--being a Republican, of course, he stopped at the Lincoln Hotel. He got up about 5:30 the next morning and they gave him his car out on that diagonal street that's on the east side of the Lincoln Hotel; and he inquired the way to 40, and they pointed out Washington Street to him, and he drove down the diagonal street and started on 40 toward what he thought was St. Louis--and about 2 hours after that he found out he was in Richmond, Ind. Now, I think that's rather typical of the way the Republicans go most of the time."", 'The people of Indiana all during this day have given me a wonderful reception. I never saw anything like it anywhere. From the bottom of my heart I thank you for your real Hoosier hospitality.', 'Now, I would like very much to talk to you this evening about the people of our country--the everyday citizens who have made this country great.', ""But first, I have a confession to make. Apparently I have offended the Republican gentleman who wants to be President. I'm afraid I have startled him by talking about issues and about depressions. Republicans don't like people to talk about depressions. You can hardly blame them for that."", ""You remember the old saying: Don't talk about rope in the house where somebody has been hanged."", ""Certain Republicans say we shouldn't talk about the possibility of a depression, because that will give aid and comfort to the Communists. The Communists, as we all know, have been predicting that our capitalistic system would break down."", 'I have repeatedly told the Congress and the American people that the Communists were hoping for a depression in the United States, and I have said time and again, something ought to be done to prevent it.', 'But now the lesson seems to have become mixed up a bit, and I think we had better straighten it out. The thing that helps communism is not talking about a depression. The thing that would help the Communists is having a depression, and that is what I have been trying to prevent.', 'That is why I have been urging that we do something about inflation--to halt inflation.', 'And that is why I have been saying that we must protect the purchasing power of the wage earner, the farmer, the small businessman, and the people with fixed incomes.', 'That is why I have been saying that we must never return to the policies of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, and isn\'t it a peculiar circumstance that the Republican candidate for President never points with pride to any Republican administration ? He only wants to say ""me, too"" on those successful Democratic policies that we put into effect.', ""Now, the Communists don't think I'm helping them. They don't want me to be the President of the United States. They are doing all they can in this election to bring about a Republican victory."", ""And I have often said, if you elect a Republican President to go along with a Republican Congress like the 80th, you can expect them to take you headlong back down the road that led to the great depression in the 1930's."", ""And you don't have to travel that road. I want to be sure we don't go that way. That is one of the reasons I have been speaking to our people all over the country."", 'The basic difference between the two parties in economic matters is simply this: The Republican Party, as it operates in Washington, favors the interests of a few small ,powerful groups at the expense of the rest of the people.', 'This is the course that leads to depression.', 'The Democratic Party, on the other hand, consistently works for measures which increase and protect the purchasing power of the great majority of our people.', 'I used to think that the dangers of depression would not be as great in the future as they have been in the past. I had been counting on laws enacted under Democratic leadership since 1933 to help maintain the purchasing power during the downturn in a business cycle.', 'I had been counting on these laws to afford enough protection to millions of our people so that never again would they face such days of black despair as they did in 1932â¢', 'Social security benefits, unemployment compensation, bank deposit insurance, farm price supports, a legal floor under wages, healthy collective bargaining--all these things I was counting on.', 'I thought they had so clearly proved their worth that they would never be subject to serious attack. I was just too optimistic. I gave the elephant too much credit. No matter what the Republicans say, the elephant hasn\'t taken on the ""New Look.""', 'The Republicans in the 80th Congress certainly disillusioned me on that score.', 'Don\'t be misled by Republican promises in this campaign. Actions speak louder than words. The record of the Republican Party that really counts is the record of that good-for-nothing, ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress.', 'And the Republican candidate, who has embraced that record so warmly, gives you no reason to hope for anything better from him. He says he is proud of the record of the 80th Congress.', ""The American people can no longer assume that the laws which safeguard them from disaster are secure from attack. The thing that couldn't happen here, has happened here. The Republican Party has actually started us backward. Now it promises more of the same--to take us all the way back."", ""That's why I have talked about the danger of depression. That's why I have talked about it in plain terms so that the people will know just what I mean and just where I stand. I regard it as a proper function of the Government to fight depressions."", 'The prosperity of this great Nation depends upon justice. We boast about our initiative, our inventiveness, our enterprise. All these things are important, but unless each group of our people gets a fair share of our national income, our prosperity will crash.', ""This is a lesson we learned the hard way. We learned it under Republican administrations in the 1920's. In those days, wages were held down. In those years, farmers were left to contend with the rise and fall of farm prices. The farmers were in the hands of the speculators, and the 80th Congress has 'put them in those same hands again--or at least it has tried to."", 'In those years--those Republican years-the aged and infirm were left to take care of themselves. As a result, the purchasing power of the Nation declined. There was no place to sell the products of our farms or our industries--and the result was unemployment and collapse.', 'We know now that we cannot have prosperity automatically. The only thing we can get automatically is boom and bust. To secure continuing prosperity takes foresight and intelligent planning. This is the purpose of a law which I regard as one of the most important laws passed during my administration, after I became President. This is the Employment Act of 1946.', 'This act was passed by a Democratic Congress and it embodies the Democratic principles of which I am speaking. It sets up a kind of economic signal room--the Council of Economic Advisers--in which the danger signals flash when things start to go wrong.', ""Now, for 2 long years, the red lights have been blinking in the signal room. They have been telling us that if we didn't do something about inflation, we would be asking for collapse and depression."", 'For 2 long years, we have been turning in fire alarms, alarms against the fire of inflation. And after 2 long years, the Republican firemen have been too busy playing a game of political checkers to put out the blaze.', 'They figured that maybe the fire of inflation would burn itself out, or that it was un-American to put an extinguisher on the flames.', ""Now, that is a terrible way to run a fire department. But that's the way the Republican 80th Congress met the problem of inflation."", ""Now another alarm bell rang on social security. But that is not enough. Millions of workers are not yet covered by its benefits, and those benefits are not nearly high enough to meet today's excessive prices."", 'I recommended--in plain and simple terms--to the Both Congress that we extend social security to the workers not now covered.', 'Did the Republican leaders extend it? They did not. Instead, they took the social security protection away from nearly a million workers who already had it.', 'I recommended--in plain and simple terms--that the 80th Congress increase oldage insurance benefits by at least 50 percent. Did the Republican leaders do that? No, they did not!', 'The Republican firemen not only failed to turn out the hook-and-ladder. They actually set fire to a couple of buildings, just for fun. They struck nearly a million Americans off the social security rolls; and their fire chief now says he is proud of that Congress.', ""Now, let's look at health and medical care. We need more doctors, more nurses, more hospitals. We need a system which will enable the average American family to pay for proper medical care."", 'Each year, because of lack of proper medical care, we lose more people than we lost in all the fighting of World War Two. Listen to that!--each year, because of a lack of proper medical care, we lost more of our people than we lost in all the fighting in World War Two.', 'Each year, we lost over four million man-years of work because of bad health--more working time than we have ever lost in the worst strike year on record. The Republican Congress passed the Taft-Hartley bill, because it claimed it was worried about strikes. The Congress would have done better to spend its time worrying about the loss of production due to sickness.', 'Each year, we lose $27 billion in national wealth through sickness and disability. These are dreadful figures. If we can stop that loss, we can pay off the national debt in 9 years by the saving.', 'We can do something about it, and we must do something about it.', 'Here is what we need. For every four doctors in practice today, we need at least one more--and we need to have them located more evenly throughout the country.', 'We need twice as many hospitals as we have. And we need to distribute them better. There ought to be a good hospital within easy reach of every person in the country.', 'Most of all, we need to make it possible for every American to afford medical care. At present, only one out of five Americans can afford the medical care he needs.', ""This is the crux of the problem and I am not going to mince words about it. The best health facilities and the finest doctors in the world are not much help to people who can't afford to use them."", 'I proposed a national system of health insurance in 1946, and I have urged it repeatedly since that time. There is no other way to assure that the average American family has a decent chance for adequate medical care.', 'There is no other way to assure a strong and healthy Nation.', 'Prepaid health insurance will be one more keystone in the great structure of social insurance which has been erected by the Democratic Party.', 'There has been a lot of nonsense talk about health insurance. There has been a well-organized campaign to discredit it and to confuse the issues involved.', 'The plan I have proposed does not disturb the traditional relationship between doctor and patient--except that the doctor will be paid more regularly for his services. Nor is this any more revolutionary than any other form of insurance.', 'It is 100 percent American.', 'It is just a way to collect the cost of medical care on a pay-as-you-go basis.', 'What did the Republicans do with my proposal for health insurance? You can guess that one. They did nothing!', 'All they said was--""Sorry. We can\'t do that. The medical lobby says it\'s un-American."" And they listened to the lobbies in the Congress.', 'I put it up to you. Is it un-American to visit the sick, aid the afflicted, or comfort the dying? I thought that was simple Christianity.', ""Does cancer care about political parties? Does infantile paralysis concern itself with income? Of course it doesn't."", 'The Democratic Party holds that the people are entitled to the best available medical care. We held that they have a right to ask their Government to help them get it.', ""Now, let's take a look at another very important thing--education. It's the same disgraceful story with education that it is with health."", ""There is no reason on earth why a great Nation like ours should not educate all its children. But every American mother and father knows that the schools in the United States face a crisis today. Elementary schools, high schools, and colleges are bursting at the seams. We don't have nearly enough schoolteachers and we don't pay them nearly enough."", 'And if the schoolteachers want to campaign and organize for better pay--I am all for them doing it.', 'The school situation is getting worse--not better. At least 6 million more children than are now enrolled in elementary schools and high schools will be seeking admittance by 1955. Think how that will crowd our schools! We shall need at least 200,000 more classrooms by that time. And we shall need tens of thousands of new teachers.', 'Without a strong educational system-free of government control--democracy is crippled.', 'Knowledge is not only the key to power. It is the citadel of human freedom.', 'We must maintain and expand our schools or we shall surrender our liberties without even fighting for them.', 'Now, I asked the Republican Both Congress, again and again, to pass legislation which would help us meet the educational crisis. It flatly refused.', 'Here again the issue is plain and clear.', 'This Nation is no wiser than the education of its citizens.', 'This Nation is no stronger than the health of its citizens.', ""This Nation's security begins with the welfare of its citizens."", 'The Democratic Party believes in the people.', 'We believe that the people are entitled to prosperity, to health, to education, to social security.', 'We believe that it is the function of the Government to see to it that these people have these advantages.', 'This great Nation must not stand still, it must not go backward; it must go forward--go forward to even greater heights of leadership in the world.', 'To accomplish this, our people must grow in strength, in wisdom, and in security.', 'It is my daily prayer that with a strong, healthy, united, and well-educated people, and with the aid of Almighty God, we will lead the world to lasting peace.']"
48,Harry S Truman ,"October 16, 1948","['[1.] CLARKSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA (9 a.m.)', 'Thank you very much for this wonderful reception. I am very glad to be here this morning, and I appreciate your cordial welcome.', 'You know, I have always had a warm spot in my heart for Clarksburg. I have been a student of the War between the States. I remember that Stonewall Jackson was born here in Clarksburg. When he was about 17 years old he hitchhiked or walked all the way to Washington. I guess he went by wagon, because those were horse-and-buggy days--except they didn\'t have any buggies. He went to see the Secretary of War and sat in his outer office. In those days the Secretary of War made all the appointments to West Point. He went to the Secretary of War, and finally the Secretary sent Stonewall Jackson to West Point just to get rid of him. In the first year he was about 74th in a class of 76; the second year he rated about 45th in that same class; in the third year he was about 15th from the top; in the fourth year, 7th from the top. And Robert E. Lee said, ""If you just had another year you\'d be at the top of the class.""', ""I'm telling you that story because a man with persistence and hard work can accomplish wonders; and I think that the Democrats in this campaign, starting from the bottom before the Democratic convention, are now a winning team because the people are with them."", ""We're on a crusade, a crusade of right against Republican money might. I've carried on this campaign because I believe that if the American people are told facts and the truth they will do the right thing. I have not tried to fool the people. You know where I stand on every issue before the country; and whether you like it or not, you know what I am for and what I am against. The Democrats never did believe in fooling the people. Nor will we ever exploit the people. I wish that were true of all political parties."", 'I was shocked to be shown this morning a picture which I hold here in my hand. It is a picture of a leaflet signed by the Secretary of the Republican Finance Committee. They were sent to Republicans throughout West Virginia. These leaflets admit that the Republican 80th Congress passed a tax law this spring not to help the people, but to make it possible for wealthy Republicans to be able to make big contributions to the Republican Party.', 'Let me read you what it says: ""Do you want more of this sort of constructive action?"" Then, ""Use your tax savings to make a substantial investment in a Republican victory."" It was signed by the West Virginia Republican Finance Committee, and that is a photostatic copy of the thing; and I am going to explain to you what that means.', ""I ask you, what kind of a Congress do we have when the Republicans pass laws so they can get big campaign contributions? I thought Congress was supposed to pass laws to serve the people and not the Republican Party or the Democratic Party or any other party. We run on principles--and there is a very decided dividing line between the Democratic and the Republican principles. The Democrats believe in the people. They have always been for the people, ever since Thomas Jefferson organized the Democratic Party, and Andrew Jackson ran the monied interests out of the Government in the 1830's, and when Woodrow Wilson made the necessary reforms in the interests of the everyday people. The Democratic Party has always been for the people. The Republicans have always been for special interests, and this conclusively proves it."", ""Look at what this law did to you, the people who work for a living--who don't have any big fortunes to fall back on. A married man with two children and an income of $2500 a year got a reduction of $78.40 a year--about $1.60 a week. And that's fine, but the Republicans didn't do anything to stop prices from going out of sight--and the rapid rise of the cost of living has already eaten up what savings that man got. The $1.60 didn't mean a thing to him."", 'But what happens to the big wage-earner? The man with ten times the earning of the small wage-earner, he gets 40--and I repeat, 40--times the income tax reduction that the little fellow gets. A fellow, here, gets $100,000 a year; and if he has no children his saving under this tax bill is $16,724.62. That is in this Republican leaflet that is sent out because they want to get about $16,000 out of that $16,724 so they can .purchase the election. That\'s what they want. Now, if that same man has two children he saves $16,658.44, and the Republicans want to get that $16,000 so they can continue to purchase the election. The Republican Party says: ""We put that money in your pocket. Give some of it to us.""', ""Now, my friends, I vetoed that Republican tax bill three times. They had to take three shots at it before they could get that bill passed over my veto, because that bill was wrong. And I'm just as sure as I stand here that I was right and that you're going to say I was right on election day."", 'Now, look what they are doing. They are telling the wealthy, who saved tremendous sums of money by the Republican tax bill, to contribute to their party treasury. It is a substantial part of the fund that otherwise would have gone into the Federal Treasury for your welfare and benefit.', 'I say the American people are going to rise up as one man against this kind of dirty deal and elect a Democratic Congress in place of the 80th good-for-nothing Congress.', 'The people want laws to help them live a better, healthier, more secure life--not laws to line the pockets of the rich. And that\'s what they mean: ""We\'ve lined your pockets. Now see that we get some of that so we can debauch the country by buying the election.""', 'In 1946 two-thirds of the people stayed at home on election day and forgot to vote-and they got this good-for-nothing 80th Congress, which is just what they deserved. Whenever you exercise your right--the right to vote--you are the Government; and when you fail to exercise it you get something like that 80th Congress.', ""Now, this Republican candidate has endorsed the 80th Congress. He said it has done great things for the country and great things for the people. I have made 200 statements all over the United States to show that they did things to the people but didn't do a single thing for them."", ""I want to urge you in your own interests to go to the polls on election day and vote for yourselves, vote for your own interests. And if you do that, if all the people vote who are entitled to vote, I am not worried in the slightest degree about what will happen. We will have a Democratic Senator from West Virginia; we'll have a Democratic Congressman from this district; and I will be in the White House another 4 years and won't be troubled by any housing problem."", ""I can't tell you how very much I appreciate this most cordial reception in West Virginia; and I'm just as sure as I stand here that West Virginia is going to be in the right column."", '[2.] GRAFTON, WEST VIRGINIA (10 a.m.)', 'Matt, I will remember that introduction as long as I live. You and I were always friends. I know your record in the Senate of the United States, and I endorsed that record always. I am here in West Virginia, now, hoping to help Matt Neely, and Bob Ramsay, and Okey Patteson become members of that great Congress of the United States--when it works right. It can be great when the Democrats control it.', 'I have always liked the story I read once about how Grafton got its name. As I remember it, it seems that the railroad construction crews that came in here about 100 years ago called this place on the railroad the ""grafting on"" point because so many branch lines were hooked onto the main line here. It wasn\'t long before the city became Grafton.', 'I certainly appreciate the reception you have given me on my trip into West Virginia in this campaign. I think the folks in West Virginia are really friendly. From what I hear, most of your visitors are as friendly towards you. I read in the paper last week about how the candidate for Vice President on the Republican ticket came here to make some speeches in his campaign for the Vice Presidency. And I heard that the Republican Senator from West Virginia stood around waiting for this California Governor to say what a good Senator he is.', ""That is a clipping I got out of the Washington Star, which I can't say is overly friendly to the Democrats. But the Senator waited in vain, at least this news story here says. All the Governor would say is that he liked the 80th Congress. He wouldn't endorse the present Republican Senator from West Virginia, and I don't blame him for that."", ""Now, what kind of a party is it that can't or won't endorse its candidates ?"", 'The Democratic Party is not made out that way. I am proud to stand here and endorse Matt Neely, Mr. Ramsay, and Okey Patteson, and all the other Democrats on the ticket in West Virginia.', 'I am proud to be running on the record of the Democratic Party and the platform of the Democratic Party. I am proud to stand up for all the people in this country and say that we didn\'t want the Taft-Hartley Act and all the other destructive legislation that the 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress passed.', 'The reason I call it ""do-nothing"" is because it did not do anything for the people. Now, there are a lot of people that wouldn\'t agree with that, because it did a lot for special privilege, and special privilege has been in the saddle ever since the 80th Congress came to Washington.', 'I am proud that the Democratic Party fought hard to get laws to provide Federal aid to education, better health, better housing, broader social security coverage, and all the other important things that the Democratic Party stands and fights for.', 'In 1946, two-thirds of you stayed at home and forgot to vote, and we got that Republican 80th Congress. That Congress blocked the steady progress we had been making towards a better life for all the people in the United States.', 'This year everyone is going to get out and vote, on account of the fact that you understand that you are the Government. The people are the Government in these United States, but they cannot be the Government if they are too lazy to get out and vote on election day. The Government is in your hands when you want to use the power that you have.', 'Now, you owe it to the country and you owe it to yourselves to get out and vote on election day. It is the way we can get a peaceful, prosperous nation. All I ask is that you examine the record carefully. You know where I stand on all the great issues before the country.', ""If you can find out where the other fellow stands, you will be good, because I can't find out."", ""So, just study these issues and make up your minds in your own interests. Then get up early in the morning on the second day of November, and go to the polls and vote the straight Democratic ticket in your own interest, and then your President won't be troubled with a housing shortage on the 20th of January, I will stay in the White House."", 'I have got another very good friend on this train. He is the able and distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Harley Kilgore. What a team Kilgore and Neely will make in the Senate. You will really have something if you elect them.', 'I have been told that Grafton has the best band in West Virginia. I would like to hear from that band and make a judgment for myself. I like band music.', '[3.] KEYER, WEST VIRGINIA (12:34 p.m.)', ""Thank you. Thank you very much. Harley Kilgore and I have been friends a long, long time. We had quite an association together in the United States Senate during the war, and I want to say to you that Harley Kilgore ably represents West Virginia in the Senate--and I hope you'll send Matt Neely there this time so you'll have some real representation in the Senate."", ""When I see crowds like this, I know the Democrats are going to win. I appreciate very highly your turning out to see the President and hear what he has to say. I am very sorry I didn't have a chance to visit you the other night, but we were on a very tight schedule and it just wasn't possible. I do appreciate your being here this morning. It means that you people are aware of what is at stake in this election. It means that you want a Democratic administration and a Democratic Congress. I think you are going to send Matt Neely to the Senate and Okey Patteson to the State Capitol, and of course you're going to send Harley Staggers to the Congress as your Representative from this district--Harley the namesake of my good friend here, Harley Kilgore. And I think Harley Kilgore in the Senate and Harley Staggers in the House ought to make this part of the country well represented in those two great bodies."", ""You know, crowds have been greeting me all over the country just like this. I think they mean that the American people don't want--and aren't going to have--a government in Washington next year that will make the shameful record that the 80th Congress did."", 'For the last 2 years the Republicans in Congress have been trying to tear up the great laws which were passed during the Democratic administrations since 1933. There are a lot of farmers around Keyset, so I am told, and every one of them knows how much better off he is today than he was in 1933, after 12 years of Republican misrule. You know, a funny thing about this campaign is that you never hear any Republican candidate make any reference to any Republican administration. He is running on a ""me too"" policy. He wants to take over and do what the Democrats have done but he says he can do it better.', 'Soil conservation, rural electrification, farm price supports--these and many other forward-looking laws have brought West Virginia farmers to the most prosperous condition they have ever known.', 'But what did the 80th Congress try to do? It slashed the funds for soil conservation so much that the whole program was nearly wiped out. It refused to provide money for public power transmission lines. And it refused to pass a housing bill which would have provided better housing for farmers and city people alike. It refused to pass an education bill or a health bill. Those bills would have meant more and better schools and hospitals in farm areas. The Republican 80th Congress has hurt labor just as much as it has hurt farmers. The Republicans in Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act for just one reason: to weaken the power of the labor unions so that the workingman would not be able to fight for better wages and working conditions. They passed that law over my veto. And when they pass laws and put them on the books, the President of the United States is sworn to support the Constitution of the United States and the laws. And he has to enforce the law. So the best thing you can do is to elect a Democratic Congress and take some of these horrible laws this 80th Congress passed off the books.', ""The Republicans weren't content to hurt the farmers and the workers. Now they are going around telling the farmers that we have high prices because the workingmen are getting too much money; and they are telling the workers that high prices are due to the fact that the farmer is getting a fair price for his crops. That's just not so. Prices are going up, and up, and up, because the Republican leaders refused to pass a price control law that I asked for time and time again. They refused to do anything about prices because the big corporations want to continue making the greatest profits in all history, and they are making the greatest profits in all history--it's the first time in the history of the country."", ""When farmers have been prosperous, workingmen have been prosperous. Workingmen are getting three times what they did back under the Republicans, and farmers are getting four or five times what they got under the Republicans, and the corporations are making nearly ten times--well, they didn't make anything under the Republicans. The last time the Republicans were in office they had a $300 million deficit. And do you know what they had as profit last year after they paid all their taxes? Seventeen billions. You multiply that by minus 300 and see what you get!"", 'To add insult to injury, the Republicans are going around in this campaign telling the rich that they want big campaign contributions from them as a reward for having \'passed a rich man\'s tax bill. They are boldly and brazenly saying, ""You ought to pay part of that income savings to the Republican campaign fund."" Now, whenever a Congress legislates for the benefit of a class, that Congress is not fit to live with. So don\'t return the 81st Congress with the same leadership that the 80th Congress had. And when I talk about the Congress I talk about the leadership. I am not talking about such fellows as this in the Congress. They did the right thing, and if we had more of them we wouldn\'t have the situation with which we are faced now.', ""If you want good government and people who will work for you, in your interests and not for special interests, you'll go to the polls on election day and vote a straight Democratic ticket, and then the country will be in safe hands.""]"
49,Harry S Truman ,"October 19, 1948","['Mr. Chairman, Your Excellency the Governor of North Carolina, Your Excellency the Governor of Tennessee, and ladies and gentlemen:', 'This is an occasion to which I have looked forward for a long time.', 'I have been interested in this memorial since I was consulted about it by an old friend, who invited me here today. I cannot allow this occasion to pass without reference to that great North Carolinian who contributed so much to the creation of this monument. This project was very close to the heart of my old friend, who was the first chairman of the monument commission-Josephus Daniels.', 'There is no need for me to tell people in North Carolina what kind of a man Josephus Daniels was. Three times he won eminence in the nation at large--once as Secretary of the Navy during the First World War, then as ambassador to Mexico, and finally as historian of his own times. Triple fame comes to few men. Yet I am inclined to think that you, among whom he lived, may have known him in a capacity greater than any of these. I congratulate you on having known, not just the official, not just the diplomat, not just the scholar, but also the honorable citizen, kindly neighbor, and great-hearted gentleman that he was.', 'Mr. Daniels understood these great North Carolinians to whom we dedicate this monument today. He told me about the sculptor, Charles Keck. I want to say to you here today that Charles Keck and I, back in 1933 and 1934, worked on the statue of Andrew Johnson to be placed in Jackson County, Mo. After that, he was named to make a statue of Andrew Jackson, which was nothing new to Charles Keck. I think Charles Keck is the greatest sculptor of his time. You have got the right man to make this statue.', ""Mr. Daniels knew all three of these great men had something in common--the rugged, self-reliant qualities of a free people. They were all men of the people, of deep religious faith, democratic sympathies, and dauntless courage. They never swerved from the people's cause. They deserve not only an enduring monument, but they deserve understanding and remembrance."", ""We are in the midst of a political campaign upon which depends much of the country's future. It is good at such a time to pause to take strength and guidance from our country's past."", 'This year, as in all years, the State of North Carolina has much to teach the country. Its great sons have important things to say to us still. And we have important things to learn from them. We deal here today not merely with the dedication of a monument. Our task is the rededication of ourselves.', 'Each of the three men whose fame this monument celebrates held the office of President in time of trouble.', 'Andrew Jackson had to face the nullification crisis, which was the first threat of secession.', 'James K. Polk was confronted by the Mexican War.', 'Andrew Johnson was caught in the mass hysteria following a war in which more American blood was spilled than in both the world wars of our time.', 'Because they lived through days when reason was overcome by emotion, their acts were misunderstood and misinterpreted. And because they were misunderstood they were libeled beyond the lot of most Presidents. Intense feeling obscures the truth. And so it is not surprising that the estimates of these men made by their contemporaries have been almost completely discarded by later generations.', 'In these new estimates, not one of the three has diminished in stature. On the contrary, each is now regarded as a stronger and wiser man.', 'What each of them meant to his time, you have been told by many learned men. So I shall not repeat what you already know-what Jackson meant to 1832, or Polk to 1845, or Johnson to 1865.', 'I prefer to offer some suggestions as to what they all mean in 1948--and what they should mean in the years that lie ahead.', 'Jackson, Polk, and Johnson are gone. Yet they are forever a part of North Carolina. They represent the glory of the past. But that is not all. If that were all, I venture to say that this monument would serve only half its purpose. To the young men and women, to the boys and girls of the State who pass this way, it would say, ""We have produced great men."" That is true and should be said, but it has no bearing on the future.', 'It should say more. And to anyone who has studied the careers of these three Presidents, it will say more. It has a message that is not only true as to the past, but it is also encouraging as to the future.', 'That message is this: ""Do your duty, and history will do you justice.""', 'Each of these men did his duty as President of the whole Nation against the forces of pressure and persuasion which sought to make him act as a representative of a part of the Nation only.', 'Each of them provoked the wrath of some sincere and honest men--which is a serious thing. A President may dismiss the abuse of scoundrels, but to be denounced by honest men honestly outraged is a test of greatness that none but the strongest men survive.', 'Consider, for example, the career of Andrew Jackson. He has always been held up as a symbol of courage, but too often for reasons that are not the best. It takes courage to face a duelist with a pistol and it takes courage to face a British general with an army. But it takes still greater and far higher courage to face friends with a grievance. The bravest thing Andrew Jackson ever did was to stand up and tell his own people to their faces that they were wrong.', 'It was all the braver because he knew in his heart that they had some cause for discontent. The Tariff of 1828, which provoked the nullification movement, was well named the Tariff of Abominations. It did inflict injustice upon South Carolina and the other Southern States. Andrew Jackson knew that as well as John C. Calhoun.', 'But Jackson also knew that the way to correct injustice in a democracy is by reason and debate, never by walking out in a huff.', 'To attempt to correct injustice by disunion is to apply a remedy that is worse than the disease.', 'It would not have been pleasant for Andrew Jackson to say this to any State. It was doubly unpleasant to say it to South Carolina, a State composed of people of his own blood, his own faith, of his own qualities of mind and heart, a State to which he was bound by ties of memory, pride and affection. The closing paragraph of the great Nullification Proclamation is eloquent of the pain it cost him to stand against the people so closely allied to him.', 'But it was his duty, and he did it.', 'We know now what they could not know then. We know what a pliant, supple man in the White House in that crisis might have cost us. A man more careful to preserve his own peace than to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"" might have drifted into ways that would have ended in the destruction of the Union. It is because Andrew Jackson did his duty in agony of mind as well as in agony of body that this monument is raised in his honor.', 'Let me say, too, how fine a thing it is that this monument was raised in the South by Southerners. Democracy is safe among a people who are too just to withhold respect from a man because his duty once forced him to oppose them.', ""Consider, then, the case of James K. Polk. Thomas Jefferson has been endlessly praised for adding 827,000 square miles to the United States by the Louisiana Purchase. And he can't be praised too much for that. But the average American is astonished when reminded that Polk added 814,000 square miles of territory to the United States."", ""This is not the place either to defend or attack Polk's policy in regard to the Mexican War. But there is one aspect of it that is worth serious attention by this generation. Even when the war was won, Polk's efforts to negotiate a generous peace were interfered with by the House of Representatives in such a way as to draw the lines for great internal conflict in later years."", 'That interference took the form of the Wilmot Proviso, which the House attached to the appropriation bill that supplied the first installment of our payment to Mexico. It was a condition that no area purchased with the money appropriated should be slave territory.', ""I am not questioning now the merits of the Wilmot Proviso. But it was, nevertheless, an attempt to use foreign policy as a lever in the settlement of domestic questions. Such an attempt is always fraught with peril. We should have learned that fact from the experience of Polk's day and its tragic consequences in the Civil War. Unfortunately, we did not. It took another great foreign war and another disastrous injection of domestic politics into foreign affairs--in the fight on the League of Nations--to drive the lesson home."", ""But now, I trust, we have learned it. In the midst of the Second World War, President Roosevelt and his great Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, proposed, and certain of our wiser congressional leaders of the opposition agreed, that, as far as they could bring it about, domestic politics should stop at the water's edge. It has been my duty to carry out that agreement and to urge all Americans to abide by it faithfully."", ""The wisdom of that bipartisan policy should be very clear indeed to North Carolinans. They have before them not only the case of Woodrow Wilson, but also that of Polk. You know that Polk's greatest achievement was clouded for many years, because, in his time, we had not learned to keep our domestic quarrels at home and present a united front to the rest of the world."", ""Andrew Johnson came to the Presidency by reason of a death that was tragic not merely for the United States, but for all mankind. Suddenly, without a moment's preparation, Johnson was called upon to take up and complete the work of one of the greatest men that ever occupied the White House."", ""Andrew Johnson needs no defense. But it is a simple statement of fact to point out that in 1865 no man alive could have succeeded Abraham Lincoln without being subject to unfavorable comparisons. And it was Johnson's misfortune to encounter more than that. It is one of the major tragedies of war that the passions it unleashes do not automatically subside with the fighting. They must be subdued gradually. And it usually takes long, patient, and courageous effort."", 'In 1865 passions were as furious as the war had been long and bloody. There were men in and out of Congress who lost their heads completely. In their madness they were determined that the blood-letting should not stop. They would have sent scores of brave and honorable men to the gallows and stripped thousands more of all they possessed. They wanted to keep a whole region in chains.', ""That no such disgrace has occurred in the United States is due largely to the bulldog courage of Andrew Johnson. I have no wish to prettily him. He doesn't need it. He was stubborn. He was tactless. Often he was ungracious to the point of being surly. The fact remains that he faced such a storm of hatred as never before had swept this country. And in facing it, he defended not so much certain individuals as the principle that the Constitution of the United States and not the desire of angry men is the supreme law of this land."", ""His courageous stand has made it easier for every President who has had to cope with postwar hysteria since his day. That task is still no child's play. We have among us today men who, blinded by their fury and their fears, are ready to condemn on suspicion and to punish without trial. To them no President dare yield an inch. If he yielded, he would be unworthy to stand before the monument of Andrew Johnson."", 'It is a happy circumstance that this is a monument not to one man but to three. Americanism is not embodied in any one man. It is a distillation of the spirits of all the heroes who have labored and fought and died for the common good.', 'The Constitution declares that there shall be no ""titles"" of nobility in this Republic. It does not say that there shall be no nobility. We do have what may be described with exact justice as a nobility. But it is not attained by birth. One may come to it from a camp, as Jackson did, or from a university, as Polk did, or from a tailor\'s bench, as Johnson did.', ""The test is long and brave and honest labor for the country's good."", ""And this is the thing that these three men, different as they were in origin and in temperament, held in common. But it is no exclusive 'possession. Most certainly, it is not confined to presidents or other officers of state. Our country would not last long if that were true. The strength of this Republic lies in the fact that so many millions of men and women, who held no office and aspire to none, recognize as clearly as Jackson, Polk, and Johnson did that they must serve their country before they serve themselves."", 'This truth becomes supremely important on the day that the people go to the polling places. It is not the hand that signs the laws that holds the destiny of America. It is the hand that casts the ballot.', 'We are now drawing close to the date fixed by law for the exercise of that right and the performance of that duty. It is the day when every qualified voter in the country shares the responsibility laid upon the officers of the government and first of all upon a President. Indeed, on that day the responsibility passes from the President and rests with you. The wisdom of your decision on election day is the only sure and enduring ""preservation, protection and defense of the Constitution of the United States.""', 'To assure the wisdom of your decision, you cannot do better than revive within your own hearts and minds the spirit that animated these three illustrious sons of North Carolina. Men and women who exercise their franchise in the spirit of these three great men will not be blinded by passion or prejudice. They will not be deceived by smooth flattery, or smoother propaganda. Indeed, to be influenced by nothing but what you know to be true and what you feel to be just as you cast your ballot is to attain a dignity to which title and office can add nothing--the dignity of a free American.', 'The man who votes in this spirit on election day is just as patriotic as was each of these three Presidents. He is the kind of man the great State of North Carolina delights to honor. The President of the United States honors himself by praising that kind of man. Such a man stands as the symbol of freedom and dignity on this earth. We dedicate here today not merely a monument to great men of the past, but also to the greatness of free men now and forever.']"

Your Governor has been exceedingly kind and cordial to me, and to my family, and we have spent a most pleasant morning. The Governor took us to the Governor's Mansion for luncheon, and I want to say to you that it was some luncheon. Outside of Missouri, I never saw another one like it."", ""I am happy to be on this platform today with all these good North Carolina Democrats who are serving the Nation. To hear the chairman call the roll, it sounded as if North Carolina is running the Nation. If they had the Presidency, they would be. I have had some very fine friends from North Carolina, and I would like to name all of them, if I could, but it would take the rest of the afternoon, and I wouldn't have a chance to make my speech schedule."", 'There is one in particular I would like to mention, however, and one I made Under Secretary of the Treasury, and I also appointed him to be Ambassador to Great Britain. He was a former Governor of North Carolina--Max Gardner--a wonderful man.', 'And I want to say to your next Governor, Kerr Scott, that I appreciate most highly what he had to say when he was here before this microphone, and I know that the next Senator, and the next Junior Senator from North Carolina--another friend of mine, Mel Broughton--will represent North Carolina, as North Carolina has always been represented in the United States, honorably and efficiently.', ""As I said before, if I took the time to mention and compliment the able and efficient public servants from North Carolina who are now serving the Government in Washington, I wouldn't have time to do anything else this afternoon."", ""For a long time now, some of my North Carolina friends have been telling me I ought to take a look at this great State Fair of yours. It wasn't necessary to urge me very much. I have always liked to go to fairs."", ""But I do have one complaint. Now, they make me one of the exhibits, and I don't get a chance to look at the others very much."", 'It\'s a wonderful thing, to be the President of the United States, the greatest honor that can come to any man in the world. But I have lived in Independence, Mo., since I was 6 years old, and for 58 years nobody paid much attention to me in Independence, except to be friendly with me and say ""Hello, Harry,"" when I went there. Now, when I go to my old home in Independence, it takes the whole Independence police force and half the Secret Service to get me in the front door. I don\'t know what happens to people.', ""I can remember back the first time I ever saw a President, and that was in 1904, and I ran three blocks to get to take a look at the then candidate for President, and he was running on the Republican ticket, too. So I know that it's the office they want to see, and not the man."", 'I have to remember that all the time. If you don\'t, you get a bad case of ""Potomac fever"" in Washington.', 'This fall I have visited several State fairs. I met thousands of prosperous farm folk there, and it made me proud of the grand old Democratic Party to see so many farmers who had been rescued from Republican depression and given the break they deserved. You know, the farmers never were as prosperous in this country, as they are now. The first time in the history of the country that the farmers have received a fair share of the national income.', ""Not long ago I had to roll into the fair at Oklahoma City at a speed of 50 miles an hour. That was because I stopped to talk to so many people along the way that my train was a little late. But the train crew, being good Democrats, saw to it that I got there. I'm surprised the Republican candidate didn't order them shot at sunrise."", 'Out in Dexter, Iowa, I met a great farm gathering for the National Plowing Contest. And we plowed under a lot of Republicans out there.', ""I want to say that I used to run a plow back on the farm 30 years ago, and I told them that I would like to try my hand at it, if they could get me a team of four mules; but they ran everything with a tractor. So I told them I didn't want to be like the Republicans, I didn't want to turn the clock back, so if they wanted to go ahead and run it with a tractor, it was all right with me."", 'I also got a chance to look over some of the fine new farm machines they were exhibiting. And I want to report to you that among all the exhibits I have seen there has been a great omission.', 'Nowhere in the United States this year have I seen a single exhibit of that famous North Carolina farm invention--that product of ingenuity and hard times, of personal despair and political mockery--the Hoover care.', ""You remember the Hoover cart--I didn't find that in Iowa, or anywhere else--the remains of the old tin lizzie being pulled by a mule, because you couldn't afford to buy a new car, you couldn't afford to buy gas for the old one."", 'You remember. First you had the Hoovercrats, and then you had the Hoover carts. One always follows the other. Bear that in mind now, carefully.', 'By the way, I asked the Department of Agriculture at Washington about this Hoover cart.', ""They said it is the only automobile in the world that eats oats. They don't recommend it, and neither do I."", ""I don't mind being an exhibit here myself. I think I belong right here. I'm a homegrown American farm product. That product is just about the same in Missouri as it is in North Carolina."", ""And I'm proud of the breed I represent-the completely unterrified form of American democracy. I stand for the simple, straightforward, straight-line Democratic Party. That party has always stood for government in the interest of the farmer and the workingman and for all the people of this great country. That party does not represent special privilege, it represents the whole people."", 'And any time you have any doubts about the Democratic Party, all you need to do is take a good look at the Republican Party.

That's why I'm here today talking to you good people of North Carolina."", ""This year the Republicans are putting on a terrific advertising campaign in order to sell you the same old brand of Hoover carts.

But there are some things that are not for sale in this country."", ""I don't believe that they're going to get away with it. Everybody--North and South--knows there's only one choice in this campaign. Either the standard Republicans will buy the election or the standard Democrats will win it."", ""Other parties simply don't stand a chance."", 'For a Southerner that ought not to be a hard choice. You know what Republicanism means in North Carolina and everywhere else in the South.', 'First, it means the rule of the carpetbaggers. Then it means rule by the moneybaggers. Either way, it means a rule that treats the South and the West as colonies to be exploited commercially and held down politically.', 'Republicanism means that the Federal Government is controlled by the powerful men and the greedy Wall Street interests that want cheap labor and the cheap farm products. Republicanism puts the almighty dollar first and is not above using a little tidelands oil money to grease the way to power.', ""Today big-money Republicanism is on the march, and to beat it we've all got to stand together. That's where we Democrats belong--together--shoulder to shoulder."", 'We are the great middle-of-the-road party--the party of the farmers and the workers and the small businessmen and the party of the young people. We all belong together. I believe in loyalty as the great force in politics--the loyalty of free men and women, freely given and honorably received.', 'But above all I treasure the basic principle of democracy itself--the right to disagree among ourselves, without letting differences of opinion lead us into temptation, or to betray our own best interests.', 'That is why I do not worry too much about the many violent arguments we Democrats have. I think that there will be plenty of Democrats on election day, as long as we retain respect for free speech, and get a fair and honest count at the .polls.', 'Just the same, I hope that somewhere in North Carolina you have a Hoover cart on display--lest you forget that the Republicans want you to take another ride in that same old wagon.', 'In the 1920\'s, the Republican Party could not fight the depression. It was incapable of bold action for the people. Big business owners of that dismal party said there was nothing to do but ""ride it out."" Ride it out! You did--in Hoover carts.', 'Today, the Republican Party stands convicted of being incapable of fighting inflation. Some of its present leaders have tried to put the blame for inflation on farm prices.', 'They want you to ride it out--ride it out!--in Hoover carts.', 'It was under a Democratic administration that Hoover carts gave way to real automobiles with plenty of gasoline in them.', ""Here at a great agricultural fair, let's take a look at your agricultural record in North Carolina in the Democratic years behind us. Your old-time money-crops are doing all right. Last year your tobacco brought you $380 million. In the Hoover year of 1932, your tobacco brought you $43 million. The price of tobacco got down to 8Â½ cents in the Republican depression. This year it is running close to 50 cents."", 'You don\'t depend on cotton as much as you used to.

You didn't make that trip in a Hoover cart."", 'This year your milk and eggs alone are worth almost as much as your total farm production was worth in 1932. Think of that!--milk and eggs in North Carolina worth as much as your farm production was in 1932!', 'What I say of North Carolina is true of the whole advancing South in the years since the Democrats came to office in Washington under Franklin Roosevelt.

We made credit available to farmers on fair terms for the first time in American history."", 'The Democratic Party inaugurated the nationwide soil program.', 'The Democratic farm program brought you rural electrification.

When our lives and our freedom depended on it, our agriculture was equal to the task.', 'Thanks to the Democratic Party, this is your story--the story of progress from the depths of despair to the heights of strength. You have a highly productive, efficient, and profitable agriculture, because you used the Democratic farm program and your own hard work to make it so.', 'But today the wreckers are at work.', 'The Republican Party for years fought the Democratic Party farm program. When they saw it couldn\'t be changed, then they changed tactics. Republican spokesmen are now saying: ""Me, too; only we can do it better.""', 'What they mean is, they can do you better!', 'Two years ago the Nation gave the Republicans their chance in Congress. The Republicans immediately slashed the soil conservation program. In fact, the Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to keep out the agricultural conservation program altogether. That was also a vote to kill the farmer-committee system that operates your program of price supports and tobacco quotas.', 'We beat this outrageous attack on self-rule in farming, but the Republicans did cut the agricultural conservation program in half.', 'They cut the rural electrification program. They undermined the Commodity Credit Corporation. They killed the International Wheat Agreement. They crippled the reciprocal trade agreements program on which the foreign markets for your tobacco and cotton depend.', 'They subjected farm cooperatives to a fear campaign under threat of a death tax. They cut the budget for the new research and marketing activities. They tried to kill the farm tenant purchase program.', 'And, now, despite the belated protestation of the Republican candidate, they are showing that they want to alter and destroy the whole structure of price supports for farm products. Even the Republican Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture has warned that an effort is being made to make the farmer the ""goat"" for high prices in the United States.', 'This attack on the price support system comes at a time when many farm prices are dropping and the price support program is of the greatest importance to the farmer and to the United States.', 'The Democratic Party originated the farm price support program. We built it out of hard experience. We built it for the benefit of the entire Nation--not only the farmer, but the consumer as well.', ""The purpose of price supports is to prevent farm prices from falling to ruinously low levels. But the Republicans don't tell the city consumers that these supports apply only when farm prices have dropped below parity. They don't tell the people in the cities that everybody is really better off when the farmer gets decent prices."", 'The support price for wheat is not responsible for the high cost of bread. When wheat prices were going up, the price of bread rose steadily. It went up from 10 cents a loaf to 11 cents--to 12 cents--to 13 cents--to 14 cents.', 'Now wheat prices have fallen a dollar a bushel. But the price of bread has not come down one single cent.', 'The same with cotton. Nobody can blame the cost of a shirt on the cotton that goes into it.', 'The cost of tobacco in a cigarette is very, very small--a fraction of a cent.', 'The truth of the matter is that by encouraging the record production of the last few years, the support program has actually kept consumer prices down. Those who are willfully trying to discredit the price support system do not want farmers to be prosperous. They believe in low prices for farmers, cheap wages for labor, and high profits for big corporations.', 'That is what they call ""efficiency.""', 'You cannot dodge the issue.

But we can all learn a lesson from them. They have given us a sharp warning of what the Republican Party stands for today. And their record shows that the Republican Party stands for the same thing today that it did under Herbert Hoover.', 'That is the record on which the Republican Presidential candidate wants to be elected--that is the one on which he wants to be unified.', 'He has endorsed the record of the 80th Congress, which began the scuttling of the Democratic farm program.

That philosophy is service for people--the greatest good for the greatest number. And upon that philosophy we have erected during the past 16 years a great progressive body of laws. We call those laws the New Deal.', 'The New Deal represents not merely our pride in what we have done, but the pattern for what we want to do.', 'It is a program for going forward. True liberalism looks to the future. True liberalism is more than a matter of words.

Also, as the Republicans presented him, he was the ""Great Engineer.""', 'We have been hearing about engineers again recently from the Republican candidate. He objects to having engineers back up. He doesn\'t mention, however, that under the ""Great Engineer"" we backed up into the worst depression in our history.', 'The Republican politicians never have liked the New Deal, and they would like to get rid of it--repeal it--put it out of existence.', 'When, in 1946, the Republicans gained control of the Congress, they began to whittle away at the New Deal laws. Now, they have tasted blood, and they are waiting eagerly for the time, when they can go ahead with a Republican Congress and a Republican President and do a real hatchet job on the New Deal.', 'Their candidate for President is the chief prosecutor against the New Deal. He has spoken against it, he has campaigned against it. He wrote a book called ""The Case Against the New Deal."" And now he wants to come to Washington and destroy it.', ""Now, let's take a look at the way the Republicans launched their attack on the New Deal as soon as they gained control of the Congress."", 'First, they started out after labor. One of the cornerstones of the New Deal was the Wagner Labor Relations Act, which gave national protection to the right of collective bargaining. Under its provisions, the labor movement had grown strong and healthy.', ""Well, our old reactionary friends didn't like that. They didn't have the courage or they didn't have the votes to repeal the Wagner Act outright. The fact was they knew that they didn't have the votes to pass a straight-out repeal bill over my veto. So they passed, over my veto, the Taft-Hartley law. It converts the Wagner Act from a charter protecting the basic rights of workers into an instrument for union busting by antilabor employers."", 'The Taft-Hartley law is not the only attack the Republicans have made against the New Deal. It is not the only attack in which they have been successful. It is only the beginning of the attacks they plan.', 'Mr. Hartley of the Taft-Hartley team has written a book about it. The title of this book is ""Our New National Labor Policy, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Next Steps.""', 'Get that: ""the next steps."" They aren\'t satisfied to stop with the Taft-Hartley Act. They are going even further.', ""On page 171 in Mr. Hartley's book appears a very frank confession. This is what Mr. Hartley says:"", '""No sooner had the Taft-Hartley law been enacted over the Truman veto than the Republican leaders of both House and Senate""--now get this!--listen to it very carefully!--""the Republican leaders of both House and Senate decided that no more legislation to which organized labor could object would be passed until after the Presidential election of 1948.""', 'Mr. Hartley goes on. On page 193, he says: ""I am well aware of the political difficulties of eliminating the New Deal social legislation. It cannot be repealed at a single stroke.""', 'That should give you an idea of what to expect, if the Republicans get control of the Presidency, also.', 'The time has come for the working people and all the progressive forces of this Nation to realize the grave danger that confronts them.', 'For myself, and for the Democratic Party, I completely reject the idea that we should ""eliminate"" the New Deal. Instead, we should build upon it a better way of life. Let me be specific.', 'We should repeal the Taft-Hartley Act.', 'Then we should increase the minimum wage from 40 cents an hour to at least 75 cents an hour.', 'Social security insurance should be extended to the large groups of people not now protected.', 'The insurance benefits should be increased by approximately 50 percent.', ""We should expand our facilities for looking after the Nation's health."", 'The Federal Government should provide aid to the States in meeting the educational needs of our children.', 'The Congress should provide aid for slum clearance and low-rent housing.', 'We should do something, at once, about high prices.', ""All these things are on the record, my friends.

Because of that, prices were held down-they stayed on an even keel right through the war.', 'When the war ended, big business decided to torpedo price controls. They wanted to take over the wartime savings of the American people. So the National Association of Manufacturers spent $3 million to fool the American people into believing that price control was a bad thing. The Republicans in Congress led the fight to end price control and, after they had ended it, they boasted about what they had done.', 'You know what has happened since. Prices have gone up 30 cents on the Food has increased in price almost 50 on the dollar. We have had to spend our""\' wartime savings to pay the grocery bill.', ""Wages have lagged way behind prices, increasing only 20 cents on every dollar. Yet they will tell you that the increases in wages have caused high prices, and they tell the farmers that the increase in prices is caused by prices to the consumer. Now, none of these things has a word of truth in it. The truth is that the profits of the fellow who skims the cream off the people are what is causing high prices. He doesn't want those prices to go down."", ""Now, since price increases haven't gone into wages, where has the money gone?"", 'It has gone just where big business and the Republican Party planned for it to go-into higher profits.', ""Corporation profits after taxes have increased 70 cents on the dollar since price control was killed. You know, when wheat was going up--when wheat was going up as high as $3 a bushel, bread was increased from 10 cents to 11 cents--12 cents--13 cents and 14 cents a loaf. Well, wheat has gone down more than a dollar a bushel. Are you getting any lower price for your bread now ? Of course you're not."", ""Don't think big business doesn't appreciate all that the Republican Party has done for it.

The following table shows your saving under the new tax law."" That is that rich man\'s tax bill which they passed over my veto, and they had to pass it three times before they could make a law out of it.

Now, miners are getting $14 a day-or more--and working a full week. That increase is a direct result of the great advances of the New Deal.', 'President Roosevelt believed that the rights of the workingman were more important than the profits of the corporations. He saw to it that the power of the Federal Government was used, not to destroy the unions, but to protect them against unfair and evil practices of the employers.', 'The New Deal established the right of labor to organize and bargain collectively as the keystone of our industrial system. Labor is no longer a commodity, under Democratic rule. The Wagner Act was the Magna Carta of labor.

I am sure I do not have to tell you about the terrible effects of this disease, or the suffering that it causes.

These selfish, backward-looking men slipped a provision into the Taft-Hartley law about welfare funds. They thought they fixed it so that an employer could refuse to bargain with a union about setting up a welfare fund.', 'But they were wrong. A Federal court only last month held they were wrong. That court said that employers have to bargain about welfare funds. Well, now these same people are planning to amend the law.

When you do like you did in 1946, when two-thirds of you stayed at home, you get just what you deserved--you got that good-for-nothing 80th Congress.', ""Now, you can elect a Democratic administration, pledged to the protection of labor's rights, the expansion of social security, the improvement of education and health, the building of adequate housing, and the control of the cost of living."", ""You can do that now, if you exercise your right as a free-born American citizen to go to the polls and vote the straight Democratic ticket, and then you can't make a mistake.""]"

It's just our usual routine checkup which we have every 4 years."", ""Now, we go into this doctor's office."", 'And, ""Doctor,"" we say, ""we\'re feeling fine.""', '""Is that so?"" says the doctor. ""You been bothered much by issues lately ?""', '""Not bothered, exactly,"" we say. ""Of course, we\'ve had a few. We\'ve had the issues of high prices, and housing, and education, and social security, and a few others.""', '""That\'s too bad,"" says the doctor. ""You shouldn\'t have so many issues.""', '""Is that right?"" we say. ""We thought that issues were a sign of political health.""', '""Not at all,"" says the doctor.

What you need is my brand of soothing syrup--I call it \'unity.\'""', 'Then the doctor edges up a little closer.', 'And he says, ""Say, you don\'t look so good.""', 'We say to him, ""Well, that seems strange to me, Doc. I never felt stronger, never had more money, and never had a brighter future. What is wrong with me?""', 'Well, the doctor looks blank and he says, ""I never discuss issues with a patient. But what you need is a major operation.""', '""Will it be serious, Doe?"" we say.', '""Not so very serious,"" he says. ""It will just mean taking out the complete works and putting in a Republican administration.""', ""Now, that's the kind of campaign you have been getting from the Republicans. They won't talk about the issues, but they insist that a major operation is necessary."", 'Take this vague talk of the Republican candidate about the ""failures"" of the present administration. That puzzled me for a little bit.', 'I thought of the fact that our national income is now running at the rate of over $220 billion a year--over five times as much as it was in 1932.', 'Is that what he calls a failure?', 'Or perhaps he was worried about the profits of the corporations. In 1932, corporations lost $3 billion--lost $3 billion. Now corporate profits are running at the rate of $19 billion a year, after taxes.', 'Is that what he calls a failure?', 'Perhaps he was thinking about our mighty undertakings to assist the free nations of the world to protect themselves against the inroads of communism. These efforts are proving successful.', 'Is that what he calls a failure?', ""In his speech here in Pittsburgh just a few days ago, the Republican candidate pretended to be upset about the way my administration has treated labor--about the terrible condition that labor was in in 1946.

And the days lost from strikes in 1946 were less than 1 1/2 percent of the total days worked that year.', ""Republicans don't like to talk about 1932--and I don't blame them. Do you? But it is a good year for you to remember when you start out to vote on election day."", 'When the Republican candidate finished telling you, here in Pittsburgh, how labor had suffered under my administration, he told you who had come to the rescue of labor.', 'Now, who do you think it was ?', 'It was the Republicans, according to the Republican candidate.', 'Now, how do you suppose they did it?', 'They did it with the Taft-Hartley Act. That is how they came to the rescue of labor.', 'Yes, sir. The Republican candidate marched up proudly and embraced the Taft-Hartley law--lock, stock, and barrel. No workingman can have any doubt about that any more.', 'And in praising the Taft-Hartley law, he displayed his characteristic tendency of claiming credit where no credit is due. He tried to tell you that it is the Taft-Hartley Act that is driving the Communists out of labor unions.', 'Now, if you want to know how much truth there is in this claim, ask Bill Green-ask Phil Murray. They will tell you who got the Communists out.', ""It's being done in the good American way--the unions are doing it themselves."", 'Now in this speech the Republican candidate made here in Pittsburgh, he admitted, with characteristic modesty, that he is going to lead the country--and, indeed, the whole world--out of all its troubles.

He said he was in favor of the National Labor Relations Act, the Wage and Hour Act, the Social Security Act, and ""all the other Federal statutes designed to promote and protect the welfare of the American workingmen and women""--but he could do it better.', 'For some reason or other the American people did not believe him in 1944.', 'This year the same candidate is back with us, and he is saying much the same thing; that he likes the Democratic laws, but that he can run them better than we can.', 'It sounds to me like the same old phonograph record; but this year the record has a crack, and the needle gets stuck in that crack every once in a while.', 'Now the crack in the soothing syrup of that record was provided by the Republican 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress.', 'Now, in 1948, every time the Republican candidate says, ""I can do it better,"" up comes an echo from the crack which says, ""We\'re against it.""', 'So the sounds coming out of the Republican Party this year are not very harmonious. And they are even less believable than they were in 1944.', 'The candidate said, and I quote: ""The present minimum wage set by law is far too low and it will be raised.""', ""Now, that's fine. I am glad he said that."", ""We're right with the candidate on that. In fact, we are 'way out ahead of him."", 'Time and time again in the last 2 years I urged the Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress to raise the minimum wage from the present 40 cents an hour to at least 75 cents an hour.', 'But that Republican Congress--that crack in the record--said, ""Nothing doing--we\'re against it.""', 'And the minimum wage stayed where it was. Now, the Republicans like to say they are for a minimum wage, but it is perfectly clear that the smaller the minimum the better.', ""Now, let's look at another song on the record the candidate played for you here in Pittsburgh."", 'That Republican candidate for President said, and I quote: ""We will overhaul the Social Security System for the unemployed and the aged, and go forward to extend its coverage and increase its benefits."" That is a direct quote from his speech, made right here in Pittsburgh.', ""Now, that sounds good, although it's a little vague. But that's the candidate speaking. Where do the Republicans actually stand on social security ?"", 'As your President, I made every effort to get the Republican 80th Congress to extend social security coverage and increase social security benefits. What did that Congress do?', 'They took social security benefits away from nearly a million people.', 'What do you believe--campaign promises, or plain facts of Republican action?', 'Now, again that cracked record gives them away. It says, ""We\'re against it.""', 'In my recommendations to the special ""do-nothing"" session of Congress in July, I pointed out the desperate need to increase old-age insurance benefits at least 50 percent. At the present time the average insurance benefit payment for an old couple is less than $40 a month.', 'The Republican Congress did nothing about it--and neither did the Republican candidate for President.', 'He was silent as the tomb while the Congress was in session. Now, while he\'s campaigning, he suddenly takes quite an interest in increasing social security benefits. And I ask you: ""Can you believe that kind of a campaign promise?""', ""That Republican outfit went to Philadelphia and wrote a platform, and that platform was the most hypocritical document that ever was written; and I called them back to Washington to see whether they meant what they said in their platform. And they didn't."", 'Take another promise in that Pittsburgh speech. The Republican candidate said, and I quote: ""We will make the Labor Department equal in actual Cabinet status to Commerce and Agriculture. It will make an important contribution to the national welfare."" Doesn\'t that sound nice?', 'That promise is ridiculous in the face of what the Republicans in the 80th Congress did.', 'The Republican 80th Congress stripped the Mediation and Conciliation Service from the Labor Department.', ""The Republican 80th Congress cut the appropriations for the Bureau of Labor Statistics almost in half--apparently to prevent the Bureau from showing what's happening to the cost of living."", ""That's the plain factual record of what the Republicans have done to the Labor Department in the last 2 years."", 'Remember, the Republican candidate has said he is proud of the record of the 80th Congress.', 'But that crack in the record gives them away.', 'Here\'s another one of his promises. Here in Pittsburgh, the Republican candidate said, and I quote again: ""We will bring a new and vigorous leadership to the Federal Conciliation and Mediation Service so that major disputes are settled before they become strikes.""', ""Now that's a very, very peculiar promise. The present director of the Mediation Service is a well-known industrial leader named Cyrus Ching. Mr. Ching has been widely praised for his work in mediation. I think the Republican candidate is a bit confused here. And that is not the only thing he is confused on, either."", 'Let me take another campaign promise, here in Pittsburgh. The Republican candidate said right here: ""We will encourage unions to grow in responsibility and strengthen the processes of collective bargaining.""', ""I know it's hard to believe, but that's exactly what he said."", 'And he said it in the very same speech in which he went all out for the Taft-Hartley law.', ""Now, in this case, the candidate has fallen in the crack with the Republican Congress. He makes a promise, but the record says they're both against it."", 'Here\'s another promise by the Republican candidate; and I quote again: ""We will vigorously and consistently enforce and strengthen our antitrust laws against business monopolies.""', ""Now that's really fantastic. The Republican Party is notoriously favorable toward big business monopolies. The record of the Republican 80th Congress furnishes plenty of proof. They passed over my veto a bill to exempt railroads from antitrust laws. And at the same time they refused to pass, as I recommended, the O'Mahoney-Kefauver bill to plug loopholes in the antitrust laws."", 'In the face of that record, the candidate now claims that the Republicans will strengthen the antitrust laws.', 'How can the Republican candidate say such things with a straight face?', 'But here\'s another--here\'s another!

And I gave them four chances to do it.', 'But now--now in the middle of the campaign--the Republican candidate has the gall to promise that the Republicans will take action on housing.', ""I certainly wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it in print."", 'Let me quote just one more campaign promise from that incredible Pittsburgh speech.', '""We will make sure,"" said the Republican candidate, I quote: ""we will make sure that soaring prices do not steal food and clothing and other necessities from American families.""', 'Now that one completely stops me.', 'Everybody in this country knows that the Republican 80th Congress refused, time and time again, to pass the laws we need to stop high prices. In November 1947, in January 1948, in July 1948, I asked that Republican Congress to act against inflation.', ""They didn't do a thing about it."", 'And neither did the Republican candidate. All through the time when the Congress was in session, stalling and blocking anti-inflation legislation, the Republican candidate was silent as the grave.', ""But now--now that he's trying to persuade the people to vote for him--the Republican candidate says the Republicans will do something about high prices. It looks to me as though it's a little late in the game for that promise, anyway."", 'Now, the candidate says--the Republican candidate says: ""Me, too."" But the Republican record still says, ""We\'re against it."" And if you return the Republicans to power, you will have that same clique in control of the Congress that is in control of it now.', 'These two phrases, ""me, too,"" and ""we\'re against it,"" sum up the whole Republican campaign.', ""My friends, it isn't funny at all. It's tragic, tragic for the everyday citizen."", 'This soft talk and double talk, this combination of crafty silence and resounding misrepresentation, is an insult to the intelligence of the American voter. It proceeds upon the assumption that you can fool all the people-or enough of them--all the time.', ""In this campaign you don't have to rely on promises. This time, you have the record."", ""You don't have to play just the Republican side of that record. Turn it over."", 'Our side--the Democratic side--doesn\'t say, ""We\'re against it.""

It has been a hard campaign. I have traveled from one end of the country to the other, telling millions of people about peace, prices, and places to live, and the other issues which face the Nation today. My opponent has talked a great deal too, but he said almost nothing about where he stands on the major issues facing the American people today. He just keeps on giving the people high-level platitudes. You know, that\'s what ""G.O.P."" means in this day and age--it means ""Grand Old Platitudes.""', 'The Republican candidate has gone from one doubtful State to another trying to bail out the campaigns of hopeless reactionaries who ran the Republican 80th Congress. He is trying to help those birds that ran that good-for-nothing 80th Congress. He is trying to get them all reelected. One of these salvage operations is being carried on right next door here in Illinois. The Republican candidate is hoping to save that hard-shelled isolationist reactionary, Curly Brooks, who has been the Senator from Illinois for quite some time. I think that should give you a pretty good idea of just how meaningless all these fine words are.', ""You know, one of the high-sounding lectures we have been hearing from the Republican candidate over and over again concerns communism. The Republicans are trying to pretend that my administration has been friendly to communism. That bit of campaign propaganda reminds me a lot of the stories we heard during the war and are now hearing from the Communists in Russia. They believe that if you tell a big enough lie, somebody is bound to believe it. If anybody in this country is friendly to the Communists, it is the Republicans who are trying so hard to be elected. It's not the Truman administration--I can tell you that."", 'The Communists are doing everything in their power to beat me. They have taken over the Third Party and are using it in a vain attempt to split the Democratic Party. The Republicans have joined up with this Communist-inspired Third Party to beat the Democrats. They finance the situation right here. The Republicans financed the Third Party to get on the ballot right here in Indiana in a number of counties. We have got straight-out evidence on that, and I can prove it. Right here in Indiana the Republican State Committee did its best to get that Third Party on the ballot.

It's a real pleasure to be here this evening in Illinois. One of the reasons for my special fondness for this great city, is the memory of a man who was the last great Governor, a distinguished Democrat and my friend. I refer, of course, to that great Governor, Henry Horner. I hope that the people of Illinois will do all they can to bring back the same high ideals of government that he so much represented, in electing as your Governor, my good friend, Adlai Stevenson. And, if Illinois is to be properly represented in Washington, you'll want to elect to the Senate that able and outstanding liberal, Paul Douglas. While you're doing that, you might just as well elect the whole Democratic ticket here in Illinois. I know you're going to pay tribute to Governor Horner's memory at the unveiling of a monument in Grant Park. I have always had the utmost admiration for Governor Horner, who was truly a great humanitarian. Racial and religious prejudice were unknown to him. He truly believed in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. I sincerely regret that my schedule does not permit me to be here longer in person. You can be sure, however, that I will be here in spirit."", 'It is certainly inspiring to recall that in this hall, 16 years ago, the Democratic Party gave the Nation our great leader, Franklin D. Roosevelt. And, when I think of Chicago, I can never forget that 4 years ago the Democratic Party honored me with the nomination for Vice President of the United States, right here in this hall. There were 30 policemen getting me from the back of the hall to the platform. Tonight it took about 330.', 'We have passed through many stormy and exciting days since the election of 1944. We were fighting a terrible war then. We won that war for freedom, and we are now engaged in an even greater struggle--the struggle to preserve freedom and peace all over the world.', 'Now, the principal objective of my administration as President has been to create worldwide conditions of a just and lasting peace. I have never turned from that objective.', ""And, my friends, I would much rather have peace in this world--a 'permanent peace in this world--than to be President of the United States, or to hold any other office in the world.

It is a real and living possibility.', 'In our generation, mankind has taken some long steps toward this goal.', 'Thirty years ago, a great Democratic President gave voice to the conscience of the world when he proposed the League of Nations. The President--that great President-was Woodrow Wilson. Vicious partisan attacks kept the United States from joining the League, but Woodrow Wilson opened up a great vision for all those who have come after him.', ""Because we did not live up to our Godgiven opportunity, after World War I, the League of Nations failed to 'prevent the most tragic war in history--World War II."", 'I sincerely hope that we have learned that lesson. Now we have another chance. We have a chance, this time, to build an enduring peace. We have that chance because of the vision of another great Democratic President.', ""Franklin Roosevelt's wisdom and foresight inspired the nations of the world to forge a new and stronger instrument to keep the peace--the Charter of the United Nations.

Who are the men behind them? They are the men who want to see inflation continue unchecked. They are the men who are striving to concentrate great economic power in their own hands. They are the men who are setting up and stirring up racial and religious prejudice against some of our fellow Americans.', 'I propose to state in simple, unmistakable language, just exactly how each of these three groups of men--working through the Republican Party, if you please--is a serious threat to the future welfare of this great Nation.', ""Let's take that first group--the men who want to see inflation continue unchecked. Believe it or not, there are such men.

But we cannot always count on being. led--in time of economic trouble--by a man, with genuine faith in the people.

In our own time, we have seen the tragedy of the Italian and German peoples, who lost their freedom to men who made promises of unity and efficiency and security.', 'I have had all this in mind in the long, hard fight I have been making on inflation.

Now, this Republican Party is making soap bubble promises to behave better in the future. Those bubbles are pretty, those promises are fine, but they will vanish at the first touch of reality.

The actions of the Republican 80th Congress opened the gate to forces that would destroy our democracy.', 'The gate is open just a little bit, right now.', 'We need to slam that gate shut on November 2d with an overwhelming vote for the Democratic Party.', 'Now, you people here in Chicago have a clear-cut example of the difference between the Democratic and Republican concepts of government.', 'The whole country recognizes that the Democratic administration of Chicago is doing a grand job. It is providing first-rate local government. And the whole country knows, also, that the Republican administration of this State has been reactionary, feeble, and opposed to every forward piece of legislation.', 'Such is the spirit behind government by Republicans in this great State. In that spirit, democracy can be destroyed and tyranny born.', 'That is why I say to you that we are now engaged in one of the most important battles in our history. It is a crusade for the right, a crusade for the people against the special interests. I want you to join me in this crusade.', 'This is not just a battle between two parties. It is a fight for the very soul of the American Government.', 'The facts show the Republican Party is unwilling to check inflation and has sponsored repressive labor legislation. The facts show that the Republican Party is working today, as it worked throughout most of its history, to deliver this country into the hands of the special interests and big business.', 'In this battle, the independent voters of the United States will decide the issue. By throwing their weight to the Republicans or the Democrats, they will choose the forces which are to compose our Government.', 'Day by day, ever since this campaign began, more and more independent American voters have been lining up with the Democratic Party.', 'They have learned the facts, and the only way they could learn those facts was to learn them from the President of the United States; and I have talked to more than 6 million people in this United States, and they know the facts now. They are determined to sweep back the forces that threaten democracy in this country.', 'All over the Nation, I have seen unmistakable evidence that the American people are waking up to the tremendous issues which confront them in this election.', 'We are sweeping toward victory, my friends.', 'Everywhere I go, I hear news and see faces that make me know the tide is rolling for us.', 'In the next few days, it is going to roll even higher.', 'With your help, your unflagging courage--with your enthusiasm in a great cause, we are going to win this election on November the 2d.']"
59,Harry S Truman ,"October 25, 1948","[""Thank you, thank you very much. It's a very great pleasure to me, and a very high honor to be so cordially welcomed to this great industrial district. I appreciate most highly the Governor's introduction. I appreciate what Congressman Madden had to say--and, of course, I know you are going to send Congressman Madden back to Congress, because you did that in 1946, when a lot of other Indiana districts went wrong. And I don't have to fear but what Indiana is going to do just what the Governor said it was going to do--going to elect the Democratic ticket from top to bottom. I understand that I'm in the hometown of Chet Fleming, who is running for Secretary of State in this great State of Indiana--and I don't think that is going to take any votes away from me, is it?"", 'I heard a story not long ago about an elderly man who was driving into Gary, and he gave a lift to a young fellow who was going his way. During their talk, the older man asked the young fellow, ""What takes you to Gary?""', 'The young man kind of hesitated, put his head down, and finally said: ""I am working for the Republican State Committee. They are sending me to Gary to see what I can do to get the people there to vote the Republican ticket.""', 'The old man was silent for a while, and then he said: ""Son, I\'ve listened to a lot of sad stories for the last 50 years, but that\'s the saddest one I\'ve heard yet.""', 'I agree completely with the old gentleman. I can think of no harder job than to try to sell the Republican Party to the men and women of Gary, who lived through those dark years of the Republican depression in 1930, 1931, and 1932.', ""More than 12 million able-bodied Americans couldn't find work in those years, and the average hourly wage in industry at that time was only 45 cents, and the take-home pay was barely $17 a week."", 'There was no unemployment compensation, or work relief--just had breadlines.', 'Thousands of farmers lost their farms in those years, and the Republicans did nothing to help save them. Millions of Americans lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, and their hopes.', 'What did the Republicans do for the people they had treated that way? They just did absolutely nothing. The Democrats cured the depression by political action-and the Republican Party has never forgiven us for that.', 'By 1932 the American people had had all they could stand. They elected a great Democratic President--Franklin D. Roosevelt.', ""President Roosevelt brought the capital of the United States back to Washington from Wall Street and it's going to stay there just as long as the Democratic party controls the Government."", 'You all know what the Democratic Party has done for industrial workers in great cities like Gary. Your right to organize and bargain collectively was established by the Wagner Act, and protected by the National Labor Relations Board. Your standard of living was protected for 5 years of war and reconstruction by the price control law.', ""You know what the Republicans did, the very first thing, when they got into power in the Government? They introduced in the Congress--they didn't control the Government, thank goodness; I was still there. The first thing they did, you know, was to pass that rich man's tax bill. They had to pass that three times, because I vetoed that every single time, anti they finally mustered up enough votes to pass it over my veto. Then they passed the Taft-Hartley Act. They said they were going to put labor in its place. They began to tear down the Wagner Act, which is the bill of rights for labor in this country."", 'After the war, we restored free collective bargaining to help you adjust wages so as to protect your purchasing power which the country needs to insure its prosperity.', ""Now, you have got to have good pay-the workingman--and the farmer has to have good prices; and the two go side by side--they go together. And in this day and age--in the year when the greatest national income in the history of the world is this country's income--that income is evenly and fairly distributed so that the farmer gets his fair share, labor gets its fair share, the little businessman gets his fair share. That's not what the Republicans want. They want special privilege. They don't want you to have good wages. They don't want the farmer to have good prices. They immediately began to legislate to undermine all that Democratic program known as the New Deal."", 'Now, we put a floor under wages--by the minimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. And I have been trying to get them to increase that floor. They say they are for minimum wage--but I have come to the conclusion that the smaller the minimum the better they like it.', 'We outlawed child labor. We set up overtime pay at the rate of time and a half for every hour worked over 40 hours a week. We gave all industrial workers protection against unemployment and old age by the Social Security Act of 1935.', ""That Republican Party said it couldn't be done. We did it."", 'Now, this Congress--this 80th ""do-nothing"" Congress, elected in 1946, because twothirds of you didn\'t go to the polls--has been trying to tear down every bit of that program, and if you let them go back, and give them a President, too, they will succeed in tearing it down--and that will be your fault. I don\'t think you\'re going to do it. I know you\'re not going to do it here in Gary.', 'We are today the most prosperous nation on earth. More than 61 million Americans have jobs. They said that was impossible too, the Republicans did.', 'The average hourly rate of pay in industry is $1.33 an hour, instead of 45 cents as it was in 1932. More than three times as much--three times as much under Democratic administrations.', 'Average weekly earnings are $52.96, instead of the measly $17.05 that you got in 1932.', ""I don't see how any man--any farmer, any laboringman--can go to the polls on November the 2d and do anything else but vote in his own interests--and if he does that, he will vote the Democratic ticket."", ""Our farmers have money in the bank and the Government protects it by the Federal Deposit Insurance law. The Republicans said that couldn't be done either. Their farms are almost free of debt and they no longer fear foreclosure and eviction by the moneylenders."", ""The profits of businessmen are running so high that it's almost unbelievable. They are running at the rate--after taxes--of nearly $20 billion a year."", 'Yes, today we have so many blessings that the Republicans say that it is time for a change--things are too good.', 'The special privilege boys are at work throughout the land, crooning ""unity,"" hoping you will open your mouths, shut your eyes, and swallow that soothing syrup, and go to sleep and not go to the polls. That\'s what they are trying to do.', ""Don't be deceived, my friends. They took you to the cleaners in 1929. They want to do it again."", ""They love labor and the farmers in October, but it's a little bit different after election."", ""They say that the Democratic Party has been in power too long. What they mean is they'd like to return the capital of the United States to Wall Street."", ""I say it's time for them to change. It's time for them to change their habit of opposing everything that is done in the interests of the people. It's time for them to change the Taft-Hartley Act--and repeal it. That's what ought to be done with it. It's time for them to change, and support us in raising the minimum wage to at least 75 cents an hour."", ""They talk about cooperation between the President and the Congress. Cooperation for what, I wonder? I say it's time for them to cooperate with us in trying to do the right thing."", 'They ought to cooperate in widening social security protection, increasing unemployment benefits and raising old-age payments.', ""I say it's time for them to cooperate to bring down those Republican high prices. Yes, I agree. I certainly agree that it is time for a change. It is time for them to mend their ways, for you, the people, to elect a Democratic Congress to cooperate with a Democratic President. That's the sort of a change we need."", ""It's time for them to prove that they understand and respect human rights."", 'I have said it before and I say it again: ""The real issue in this campaign is the Democratic Party and the people against the special interests and the protected profits for the privileged few."" That is the sole issue in this campaign. It is the people against the special interests.', ""Now, I trust the people. Every good Democrat does. I trust their commonsense, their decency, and their sense of justice. That's why I'm talking with you right now. We beat this Republican outfit in 1932. beat them in 1936. We beat them in 1940. And we beat them 4 years ago."", ""We'll do it again.""]"
60,Harry S Truman ,"October 26, 1948","['[1.] SOUTH BEND, INDIANA (Rear platform, 9:35 a.m.)', 'Governor Schricker, and ladies and gentlemen--and fellow Democrats of this great city of South Bend, Indiana:', ""I am extremely happy to be here this morning, and I wish I could stay longer. This is not my first visit to South Bend. I have been here on several occasions, when I was Chairman of the Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program in the Senate. I paid two or three visits to this town, and I found that the people of this town and the manufacturers of this town were making a great contribution to the war effort. I never found any fault with what they were doing, and that was unusual. I would like also to stay long enough to see the great Notre Dame football team in action. I have seen them in action. But, as you all know, I have a job to do, and I can't stay very long in any one city. That job is to tell the American people just exactly what is at stake in this election. They aren't finding out from the Republican candidates-they aren't finding out from the Republican controlled newspapers, either. But I believe, and I believe that the Democrats believe that the people ought to know the truth. That is why I am here."", 'Now I am going to tell you about one of the differences between the Democratic and Republican Parties that shows which party really has the interests of the people at heart. South Bend is one of the great melting pots of this country. Families of a great many races and religions work here together side by side as Americans, for the welfare of this great Nation of ours.', 'You know that being an American is more than a matter of where you or your parents came from. It is a belief that all men are created free and equal and that everyone deserves an even break. It is a respect for the dignity of men and women without regard to race, creed, or color. That is our creed. That is the creed of the Democratic Party.', 'Unfortunately, there are some people in the United States who have not learned that lesson yet. They seem to forget that their own ancestors did not get over here very long ago either, comparatively, when you speak about the age of the world and the age of the countries in the world. All of our ancestors are newcomers, no matter how much we may brag about them.', ""Some people don't want the victims of World War II to come to the United States and get a fresh start in life. The Republican 80thCongress has a lot of men who felt this way, and their record proves it."", 'After World War II, when millions of Europeans were drifting around homeless, afraid to return to their birthplaces because the Communists had taken over or because their homes were totally destroyed, I urged the Congress to help them.', 'When I was in Potsdam in 1945 I paid a visit to the displaced persons camps over there and I found about 1,200,000 displaced persons in those camps. They were from all the countries of Europe which had been overrun-they were Poles, Latvians, Lithuanians, and Romanians--people from Austria and France and other countries in those camps. They were so arranged that I suggested that we send 100,000 Jews to Palestine, that we take 400,000 people in this country--400,000 of those people in this country--send 400,000 to South America, and let the British colonies take another 400,000.', 'Now all the other countries fell in with that idea, to some extent, but our own country failed to act.', 'I asked the Congress to admit those 400,000 displaced persons to the United States. That is our fair share of the displaced persons in Europe. And they were good people, the finest in the world--I looked them over. Nobody would be ashamed to associate with any of them. And we needed people in industry here so badly we could have done it easily without displacing anybody or losing anybody his job.', 'But that Republican Congress said, ""oh, no; 400,000 is too many""--and they waited 3 years. And so the 80th Congress passed a law to admit only 202,000 people. They did that grudgingly, at the end of the present session. And to make it worse the Republican leaders wrote so many restrictions into the law which discriminate against people of certain religions--and will serve to keep them out of the United States.', 'I asked the Congress to change that law and make it a decent law--an American law, which we could be proud of instead of ashamed of. But the Republican leaders absolutely refused to change that law. This means that we will be leaving at least 200,000 homeless people in Europe--people whom we ought to have working right here in the United States, now.', 'A majority of the Democrats in both Houses--in the House and in the Senate, voted for amendments to improve the displaced persons bill. They know we need the courage and the skills of the Europeans now, just like the country needed your ancestors and mine.', ""A majority of the Republicans in both House and Senate voted to keep the laws they passed, because they don't want homeless, suffering Europeans of certain religions to get into the United States."", 'If this country is to move ahead in our position of world leadership, we must demonstrate to the world that we practice what we preach.', 'When we tell the world that we believe that all men are entitled to earn a decent living, without regard to race or national origin, or religion, we have got to live up to what we say.', 'If we are to live up to the ideals which have made this country great, then we must elect a Congress and an administration that believes in the principles that have made this Nation great.', 'You people here in South Bend have a fine candidate for Congress in Thurman C. Crook. He is as straight as they come. You are going to have the opportunity on November 2d of electing a man who will vote for the interests of the plain people of this country--and the plain people of all the world. The Democratic Party has a great many fine candidates like Thurman Crook. The Republican Party, unfortunately for this country, has very, very few.', 'Now, if you fail to vote, as two-thirds of you did in 1946, you will get another Republican ""do-nothing"" Congress, the kind of Congress that refused to help you meet the rising cost of living, or find a decent home, a Congress that refused to do anything about the frightfully crowded conditions of our schools and hospitals.', 'It is your duty, as an American citizen, to vote. It is your duty to study the record and know just exactly where the two parties stand.', ""If you want decent housing, lower prices, better schools, more social security, more doctors and hospitals, and a government that acts American and doesn't just talk American, you must go to the polls on the 2d day of November, and vote that Democratic ticket straight from top to bottom--and you will have a Democratic Governor and a Democratic Congressman."", ""And you will have a President in the White House who believes in the welfare of the people--and I won't be troubled with the housing shortage."", '[2.] ELKHART, INDIANA (Rear platform, 10:15 a.m.)', 'Governor, I appreciate that prophecy, and I think you are a good prophet. You are going to be the next Governor of Indiana and I am going to be the next President of the United States--I am sure of that.', 'It is a great pleasure to be here in Elkhart this morning. This is a fine turnout. It proves that the people of Elkhart are concerned about the great issues facing the country today, just as the people are every place I have been on my trips in the last 6 weeks.', 'This campaign has made two facts perfectly obvious to everyone.', 'The first fact is that the Republican candidate for President is in complete sympathy with the desire of the reactionary Republican leaders of the 80th Congress to run this country backwards to the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover days when the Government in Washington was run for the benefit of the wealthy, privileged, special interests.', 'The second fact in this campaign is that the Democratic Party is always fighting on your side--on the side of the people. That has been the case ever since the Democratic Party was organized by Thomas Jefferson. It has been the party for the people and not for special privilege.', ""We are determined to keep our Government a people's Government. We believe that the Government should work for the prosperity of the farmer, of the laboringman, of the small businessman, and the white-collar man."", ""The Democrats believe that everybody should have a fair share of the national income. We do not believe, as the Republicans do, that the rich should skim off the cream and leave the leftovers for the rest of us. They tried it once and it didn't work. The money just did not trickle down as they said it would."", 'Now, for 2 long years I had to fight the Republican 80th Congress to keep them from selling out, lock, stock, and barrel, to the lobbies of big business. I used to think that the election of the Both Congress was a tragedy for this country. Now I think maybe it was a blessing in disguise, because it has brought home to all of us exactly what the Republican Party stands for, and it showed us exactly where the Republican candidate for President stands today. He is standing squarely on the record of that ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress. He boasts about it.', 'Now, the Republicans refused to pass a housing bill.', 'They refused to pass a health bill. They refused to extend social security.', 'They refused to increase the minimum wage.', 'They refused to do anything about the crisis in education.', 'And they refused to do anything about high prices.', ""But they did exempt the railroads from the antitrust laws. They did try to tear down our public power policy. They did take social security away from nearly a million workers. They knocked the props out from under the farmers' prosperity. They did all they dared to crush the strength of organized labor by passing the Taft-Hartley Act."", 'Every time big business snapped its fingers, the Republican leaders in Congress obeyed orders.', 'Now you know what the remedy is. You must get out to the polls on November the 2d and vote the Democratic ticket straight, and then you will have the remedy.', 'We got the 80th Congress because only a third of the voters in this country took the trouble to go to the polls in November 1946. I have here in my hand a report of an interview by one of the leading public opinion experts in this country. This man said, and I quote: ""If everyone in this country voted, it would be hard to elect any Republicans.""', 'What is true of the country is true of Elkhart, Ind. If every one of the registered voters here goes to the polls, I know you will elect a straight Democratic ticket. You learned your lesson from the Republican 80th Congress. You know what you would get from a Republican President and another Republican Congress.', 'If you want to bring prices down, if you want good places to live, if you want prosperity in this country fairly shared by everybody, and if you want a strong United States that can lead the world to peace, then go to the polls on the second of November and elect Henry Schricker here Governor of Indiana, and send Thurman Crook to Congress. That is the best thing you can do for your own safety. Vote for yourselves. When you vote for yourselves you will vote a straight Democratic ticket--then you will be on the safe side.', 'If you will do that, you will have public officials who will work for me for peace and prosperity in the next 4 years--and for places in which to live while you enjoy the prosperity that is justly yours, and the peace which you won for this Nation by the shedding of the blood of your sons and brothers and cousins.', ""I want you now to vote in your own interests on election day. I reiterate that, and keep reiterating it, because when you do that you cannot do but one thing--you can't do anything but vote for the party that is working always in the people's interests, and that is the Democratic Party."", 'Now, go out to the polls on November 2d and vote that Democratic ticket straight, and you can go home and be satisfied that the country will be in safe hands for another 4 years.', '[3.] TOLEDO, OHIO (Civic Auditorium, 2:02 p.m.)', 'Mr. Mayor, I thank you most sincerely for that cordial welcome. I appreciate most highly the introduction of your next Congressman from this district.', ""This is not my first visit to Toledo. I have been here on several occasions, and I have always had a most cordial welcome. The last time I was here it was late at night, and there were more than 7,000 people down at the station from Toledo to greet me. And I think that shows that people are interested in this campaign and the campaign issues. Now, I have been in nearly all the great cities of the country--and I will be in the rest of them before this campaign is over-and I haven't had any more cordial welcome than I had here in Toledo."", 'Now, here in Toledo, in the heart of the ""Arsenal of Democracy,"" I want to talk to you about national defense. I don\'t mean bombs and ships, and I don\'t mean guns and planes. I mean people--you people right here in Toledo, and your neighbors. The basis of our national defense is not weapons-it is the spirit of the men behind them--the spirit of the men and women who make up this great Nation.', 'It is the American spirit, not our wealth, that gives us strength. It is the spirit of a free people, devoted to liberty and justice. It is the spirit of people who are peaceful-peaceful and unafraid.', ""That is the kind of national defense I believe in. This is the kind of national spirit which makes America's strength so important a force for peace in the whole world."", 'National defense begins at home. It begins with the things that make life worthwhile for the average industrial worker, for the average farmer, for the average small businessman.', ""Now the leaders of the Republican Party just don't understand that sort of defense. They may understand munitions contracts on a cost-plus basis, but they don't understand human rights on a man-plus basis."", 'I sometimes wonder what would have happened if Pearl Harbor had come 9 years earlier, 1932, when the Republicans were in power--when we had 12 million unemployed; when the farmers were desperate, losing their farms, thousands a day; when the banks were being closed--you were afraid to go into a bank in those days, afraid it would blow up in your face; when our whole free enterprise system was tottering and there was talk of revolution.', 'We would have pulled ourselves together, of course, and we would have won the war just the same. But it would have taken much longer and cost many more thousands of American lives.', 'Fortunately, when the war did come, we were better prepared. We were better prepared because this Nation had been made strong by a great Democratic President-Franklin Roosevelt.', 'President Roosevelt knew that national defense started with the welfare of the people. He knew that a nation is best defended by people who have a stake in that nation.', ""It is exactly the same today as it was in the 1930's."", 'The strength of America in the worldwide struggle against hunger and hatred, against fear and distrust, lies in our eagerness to defend a form of democracy that has given us so much to live for.', 'The strength of this great Nation lies in its people and in their happiness and prosperity. It lies in its people and in their happiness and prosperity--I repeat that. It lies in the Four Freedoms proclaimed by Franklin Roosevelt--freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom of speech, and freedom of religion.', 'The Democratic Party believes in that kind of America. The Democratic Party has a practical program for seeing to it that we have that kind of America.', ""We have a program for better health and medical facilities--more hospitals, more doctors, more nurses--paid through a system of regular insurance payments. And you know, the Republicans have spent more by misrepresenting that health program than nearly any other one thing in this campaign. They talk about the medical profession being slaves to the Government. They talk about socialized medicine. And they add a lot of other foolish things that have no connection whatever with this plain, commonsense program of mine which would help the doctors and help the nurses and help the hospitals; and it would give the great middle class of this country, who do not have the proper medical care, a chance to pay the doctor by an insurance system that is perfectly sound. Sometime or other I am going to explain that to you in detail and show you just how far wrong these 'people are who are misrepresenting this health insurance program of mine--and it is my program."", 'The Democrats stand for that. Do you know what the Republicans say ? They say: ""We\'re against it."" You will find that the Republicans were against every forward-looking measure that Franklin Roosevelt brought forward--and they haven\'t changed a bit.', 'The defense of this great United States of America lies in more and better schools, more and better homes in American towns and cities and on American farms.', 'The Democrats stand for that. But here again the Republican Party has said: ""We\'re against it."" They want special privilege. They don\'t want anything that\'s good for the everyday citizen.', ""I won't read off the long list of things on which the two parties differ. You know them as well as I do. You know that the Republican Party is responsible for high prices and that the Democratic Party tried to control inflation. You know that just as well as I do. I have merely mentioned a few because they show that there is a vast difference between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. It is the difference between a weak America and a strong America."", ""I do not say that the Republican candidate wants a weak America, but I do say that he doesn't know how to get a strong America, and I do say that the Republican Party would not, and could not, let him take these steps which are absolutely necessary to maintain and develop the strength of this great Nation. He would have the same old leadership in the 81st Congress that I had in the 80th if he were elected with a Republican Congress--and he couldn't do a thing about it."", 'On this point, I have made my position plain. A strong United States is absolutely essential if the world is to remain at peace.', 'Peace is the most important question in the world today. I know that the American people do not want any part in the horrors of modern war. And I say that advisedly. I think I can speak on that better than anybody here. I know that none of the people of the world wants any part in the terrible destruction locked up in the atom and in other new and deadly weapons. That is why we must not let our strength be destroyed.', 'I hold that it is the solemn duty of the President of the United States to take every possible step to lead to peace.', ""Now, I don't believe in peace at any price--no honest man does. But I don't believe that because peace is difficult that war is inevitable."", 'For peace, I took it upon myself to make one of the most terrible decisions that any man in the history of the world had to make. Near the close of the Japanese war, I had to order the dropping of the atomic bomb. That was the most terrible decision that any man in the history of the world had to make.', 'I studied that question with everything I had. I called in the most able men that I could get who would give me advice. I talked to the Secretary of War. I talked to the Chief of Staff of the Army. I talked to the Chief of Staff of the Navy. I talked to the Secretary of War, who at that time was Mr. Stimson. I talked to the Secretary of the Navy, who at that time was Mr. Forrestal. I talked to General Marshall. I talked to Admiral King and Admiral Leahy, and discussed the program. And the judgment of all these able and distinguished men was that it would be a life-saying proposition to bring the war to a close as quickly as possible, and that while we might find it necessary to wipe out a couple of Japanese cities devoted entirely to munitions manufacture, in the long run we would save a quarter of a million young Americans from being killed, and we would save an equal number of Japanese young men from being killed. And I ordered that bomb to be dropped. I never want to have to do that again, my friends. I never want to have to do that again. Right then and there I made up my mind that that must never happen again if it could conceivably be avoided. My friends, I am working for peace, and everybody knows it. Everybody knows that I am doing everything I possibly can as President of the United States to get a just and lasting peace--and that, my friends, is the most important thing in this world. I would much rather have that peace than to be President of the United States. I am trying to dispel the dark cloud of fear and suspicion--and everybody knows that too. And I am keeping the United States strong and firm as well as fair and friendly--and the whole world knows that.', ""That's what worries the Communists. The Communists want a Republican victory. Think about that carefully now. They are helping the Third Party to split the Democratic Party so the Republicans can win, and the Communists want a change in administration. They are supporting that Third Party--and they know that it has no chance of winning--but they do hope that the Third Party will take enough votes away from the Democrats so the RepublicansCan Win."", 'I know there are many fine people in this country who are accustomed to voting the Republican ticket. But they should consider well the strange bedfellows the Republican Party has this year.', ""Communists count on a reactionary Republican administration to make all the mistakes that ignorance and greed can inspire. And they expect that a Republican administration will reduce the American people to another Hoover depression that will undermine the Marshall plan and pave the way for world revolution. That's what they want. That's what the Communists want."", ""The Communists believe that a Republican victory means a weak United States. And that is exactly what I think--we're together on that. But I am going to beat them and there won't be a weak United States."", ""Now, we mustn't let that happen. There is only one way to stop the spread of communism in this Nation and in the world, and that is by the application of real Democratic principles. We must keep on working for the Democratic programs that make this Nation strong. That is our best national defense. That is our answer to the threat of world war and the plan for world revolution."", 'Because it is the right answer, I know we are going to win this election for that very reason.', 'American democracy is on the march.

I believe that the St. Lawrence Seaway would bring a tremendous new boom to ports like Sandusky, and that it would bring great benefits to the whole Middle West.', ""I can't see for myself how any Congressman or Senator in the Great Lakes region can be against the St. Lawrence Seaway project, because it makes every city on the Great Lakes a seaport."", ""The Democratic Party has always believed in building up the resources of the country.

Each year, about 325,000 Americans die needlessly for lack of proper medical care. I believe that there should be a national health program to correct this shocking condition. I also believe that we need a program of Federal aid to the States to help them meet the acute crisis in education. Now, we had an education bill that passed the Senate in this last Congress, but the Republican leadership in the House would not let the House vote on that education bill.', 'Now I believe very deeply that we must have a comprehensive national housing program to dear away city slums, and provide better rural houses and public low-rent housing projects. That bill passed the Senate and was known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. It was killed in the House, because the leaders would not let the House membership vote on it.', 'I not only believe in these things, I have been fighting for them--and so has the Democratic Party.', ""If there ever was any doubt in anybody's mind about what the Democrats believe in, this campaign has taken care of those doubts. Everybody knows now what we have been doing, because I have been telling them exactly what we have been doing.

In this issue of Labor, it makes recommendations on which Congressmen and which Senators to vote for in this election. Now, 92 percent of the men recommended in that publication, that railroad labor newspaper, recommended 92 percent Democrats. That is not surprising.

They began working against you and began working for special interests."", 'I have had to come right out here and tell the American people just what is going on, just how their interests are being sabotaged by the Republicans. Perhaps a good name for this train ought to be, ""The People\'s Special,"" because my campaign is being fought for the benefit of all the people.', 'Let me give you one example of how the Republican Party has been working against you for the benefit of the big corporations. The Republicans don\'t believe in cooperatives because it means that big business can\'t get a rake-off. The Republicans opened a congressional investigation against cooperatives with noisy smears. The Republican chairman of the investigating committee claimed that cooperatives were a threat to democracy. He said this, and I quote him: ""Communism will be on the march. Red fascism will have arrived, and representative government will have become a farce and a delusion."" That is what the Republicans think of our cooperatives.', 'You know that these wild and silly accusations are not true. Cooperatives right here in Lorain County have benefited the farmers, and the great prosperity of our farmers has brought benefits to all the businessmen in this area.', 'I talked about cooperatives as an example to show you how the Republican leaders think in terms of doing whatever they can to help big business and special interests, and nothing for the farmer and the workingman.

If you do that you are taking care of your own interests. You know that, because all you need to do is just study the record and study the platforms of the two parties. Look at the promises in the Republican platform--and when I called them back into special session in July and gave them a chance to carry out those promises they said I was just playing politics. Well, I was playing politics. I was playing politics in your interest, and I have been going around this country letting you know just what these interests are.""]"

They've got a poll that says they're going to win."", 'Well, we all know that for 12 years the Republicans have been poll-happy. In 1936 the Republicans had a poll that told them they had a sure thing. And they did. They met a sure defeat in 1936!', 'In 1940 the Republicans had a poll that told them they had the edge. Well, it was a mighty sharp edge. They got cut to ribbons on election day, if you remember.', 'In 1944--you know that on that ticket in 1944 the Republicans had a poll that told them things were pretty close. It looked mighty promising for the Republican candidate, so the poll said. Now, that promise was all he got. In fact, the Republicans have been full of promises ever since.', 'This year the Republicans have some polls right down the same old line. The Republican candidate is putting out polls.', 'These polls that the Republican candidate is putting out are like sleeping pills designed to lull the voters into sleeping on election day. You might call them sleeping polls.', 'You know that the same doctor I told you about in Pittsburgh the other night--that Republican candidate--keeps handing out these sleeping polls, and a lot of people have been taking them. The doctor keeps telling the people: ""Don\'t worry. Take a poll and go to sleep.""', 'Most of the people are not going to be lulled to sleep or be fooled. They know that sleeping polls are bad for the system. They affect the mind and the body. An overdose could be fatal-can so affect your mind that your body will be too lazy to go to the polls on election day. ""You don\'t need to vote, the election is won--all I have to do is get Truman out of the White House.""', 'Now, these Republican polls are no accident. They are part of a design to prevent a big vote, to keep you at home on November 2d, by convincing you that it makes no difference whether you vote or not.', ""They want to do this because they know in their hearts that a big vote spells their defeat. They know that a big vote means a Democratic victory, because the Democratic Party stands for the greatest good for the greatest number of the people. The special interests now running the Republican Party can't stand a big vote--they are afraid of the people."", 'My friends, we are going to win this election, because the people believe what the Democrats stand for--they also know too well what the Republicans stand for.', 'And, believe me, the Republicans and the Democrats do not stand for the same thing. You can tell that very plainly by looking at the candidates you have to vote for here in Cleveland.', ""Just consider the man who will be your next Governor--Frank Lausche. Frank Lausche is a man of the people, who, like Cleveland's great mayors, Tom Johnson and Tom Burke, thinks with his heart as well as with his head."", 'This is a State of great Democrats--honest, able, fearless men--senior statesmen like my friend Bob Crosser here, and the younger men worthy to fight at their side, like Steve Young, who is going to be your Congressman at Large.', 'Men like Mike Kirwan, the Chairman of the Congressional Campaign Committee, whose work to assure the election of a Democratic Congress will never be forgotten in the history of the Democratic Party.', 'Men like your own great Mike Feighan, and like Walter Huber.', ""The Republicans can't win against candidates like these men when the people get out and vote."", ""They can't win with a candidate for President who dodges the issues, either."", 'The American people want to know what kind of government they can expect from the men and women they elect to office. And, thanks to the record that has been made, this is one time the voters can tell just what to expect.', 'The record of the Democratic Party is blazed across the face of the Nation in a story of a better, healthier, happier life for all Americans. The Democratic record is a record of performance, and not a record of false promises.', 'The record of the Republican Party was a story of obstruction, objection, and reaction from the days of the Hoover depression to the end of the 80th Congress.', 'And then there came a faint ray of hope-a suggestion that the Republican Party might mend its ways.', 'In June of 1948 the Republican Party wrote its platform in Philadelphia. That platform failed to mention many of the issues, but it almost caught up with the Democratic platform of 1932.', 'Now, for 2 long years I had been urging the Republican Congress to do something about high prices and housing, and to bring social security and the other welfare measures up to date. All this time, the situation had been getting worse. Prices had become unbearable for most people. Now, in this 1948 platform, the Republican Party had indicated that it might be willing to do something.', 'Encouraged by this platform, I called a special session of the 80th Congress. The Republicans had a chance to promise in Philadelphia. And I gave them a chance to perform in Washington.', ""I did this because I believe that it is the President's job to get decent laws for the benefit of the American people and because the people were demanding action."", 'Seldom in history has a party had such an opportunity to show good faith by converting its platform promises into legislative performance.', 'But did the Republicans take advantage of that opportunity? They did not. They cared nothing about their platform promises or for the legislation which was so urgently needed for the public good.', 'Let me remind you what the Republicans said when they found out what my recommendations were. The Republican leaders issued an official statement, and this is what it said: ""The President\'s quarrel with the 80th Congress is not the failure to enact legislation, but a fundamental difference in government philosophy between the President and the Congress.""', 'I am going to read you that quote again, because that is of vital importance in this campaign: ""The President\'s quarrel with the Congress--with the 80th Congress, is not its failure to enact legislation, but a fundamental difference in government philosophy between the President and the Congress.""', 'To put it in plain English, it means that I believe in one kind of government: government for the people. The Republicans believe in another kind of government: government for special interests.', 'Now, the question in this election is-which of these two kinds of government do you want? Do you want government for all the people, or do you want government for the privileged few ?', 'Let\'s get one thing clear. When the Republican leaders made their statement they had already picked their candidate for President. That candidate stands for the same fundamental philosophy as that Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress does. Now, just in case there was ever any doubt about that, the Republican candidate has since indorsed the record of that 80th Congress.', ""But all the while the Republican 80th Congress was in session, that candidate was very, very quiet about it. And although he has said he is proud of the record of the 80th Congress, he has been trying to make us forget what that Congress actually did and failed to do. He has treated it like a poor relation; he shut it up in the backroom, so that its bad manners and terrible record won't frighten the voters he is entertaining in the front parlor."", 'And the reason is that in everything it said and did, the Republican 80th Congress showed exactly what the difference is between the Republican kind of government and the Democratic kind of government.', 'And it is my duty to make that difference perfectly clear, and that is what I am trying to do for you. The best way I know of doing that is to explain what I asked the special session of the 80th Congress to do.', 'I know this is going to be painful to the Republican candidate. He is having such a high-level tea party with the voters that he is horrified, whenever anybody mentions the facts of life.', ""Here I am proposing to drag out the old reprobate of a Republican 80th Congress out of the backroom, and disclose him to the guests as the candidate's nearest and dearest relative. I'm going to tell the folks exactly how I gave that old sinner a chance to repent in the special session. I gave him a chance to mend his ways--only 3 weeks after he had taken the pledge at Philadelphia-and how he refused, and backslid again into the gutter of special privilege."", ""The Republican Party can change platforms and candidates, but it can't change its fundamental philosophy of government."", 'If you believe in the things I recommended to the special session of the 80th Congress, you must vote the Democratic ticket straight.', 'My first recommendation to the special session of that Congress was for effective action to hold down high prices. But this was contrary to the fundamental Republican philosophy. It would have interfered with the excessive profits of the big corporations. So the Republicans are against it.', ""I'm still in favor of action to hold down the cost of living, and I believe that you are. And if that is what you want, you can get it by voting the straight Democratic ticket on election day."", 'The second recommendation I made to the special session was for the passage of the Taft-Ellender-Wagner housing bill. This bill had already passed the Senate and would have passed the House within an hour if the Republican leaders had permitted it to come to a vote. But the real estate lobby wanted it blocked, so the masters of the Republican Party blocked it.', ""That is their fundamental philosophy on housing, and I'm glad it's different from mine."", 'This question is going to be before you on election day just as plainly as if it were on your ballot. And to get housing for the masses, you must vote the Democratic ticket on November 2d.', ""If you are for slum clearance--if you are for Government aid for housing at reasonable prices--if you are for immediate action in the people's interest--you must vote the Democratic ticket."", ""Now, let's look at the next question I put up to them. That's Federal aid to education. I don't have to tell you how crowded the schools are and how much we need more classrooms and more teachers at better salaries."", 'This is a matter of national concern. And I have urged that the Congress help the States in meeting the present crisis.', ""It is certainly a disgrace on the richest country in the world not to have rooms enough for its children to go to school, and to be so picayune with the teachers that they can't afford to teach in the schools for the pay they get."", ""Here again, a bill had already passed the Senate and could have passed the House very quickly. And here again the masters of the Republican Party refused to let the representatives of the people even vote on this vital matter. That's the kind of efficiency you get from the Republican Party. And they are always talking about efficiency!"", 'It seems incredible that the Republicans should admit that their fundamental philosophy requires them to oppose adequate schools--but admit it they did. With them, money comes ahead of schools.', 'Remember, you will be voting for or against better schools, more teachers at better pay, on election day. And if you want better schools, more teachers at better pay, you must vote the Democratic ticket.', ""Then I gave this special session a chance to raise the minimum wage. It's only 40 cents an hour now. Suppose some of these Republican Congressmen had to try to raise a family on $16 a week. Maybe they would change their minds about that minimum wage."", 'But, as of last July 28th, a higher minimum wage was contrary to the fundamental philosophy of the Republican Party. Their candidate says he is for a minimum wage, but I have come to the conclusion that the smaller the minimum the better it will suit him. Now, to raise that minimum wage, you have got to vote the Democratic ticket on November the 2d.', ""I asked the Congress to do something else, too. Oh, I gave them a number of chances. I asked them to increase the social security insurance payments. The average payment to an old couple is less than $40 a month. That's a pitifully inadequate sum to try to live on, isn't it? But it's enough to satisfy the fundamental Republican philosophy."", 'In fact, if you judge the Republicans by their actions and not their campaign promises, they are opposed to social security altogether. The kind of action the Republican 80th Congress took was to strip social security insurance benefits from nearly a million people who already had them.', ""If you don't want to take a chance on having your social security benefits whittled away, you had better vote the Democratic ticket on November the 2d."", 'Now, there was something else I asked this special session to do. That was to correct an injustice this same Republican 80th Congress had perpetrated at its regular session.', 'The Congress passed a displaced persons bill at the regular session which discriminated against Jews and Catholics. This display of intolerance aroused such a storm of protest from all fair-minded people that I thought the Republicans might be glad of a chance to correct the injustice they had done to the good people of those two faiths. I gave them that chance. Did they use it? They did not.', ""This was one question on which the Republican candidate felt he couldn't afford to keep silent. So he asked the Republicans in Congress to act. And what did they do? They told him who was really riding the elephant. Now, if that's unity, I don't know unity when I see it. And that is what the Republican candidate is asking for."", 'I gave them a chance to correct another wrong, too. Oh, I was as generous as I could be with that Republican special session!', 'Earlier, at the regular session, when they had acted on appropriations for electric power projects, they had really messed up our national power policy. They had made so many cuts in funds, and included so many restrictions, that a severe power shortage is likely to result in many sections of the country. They even refused funds for the Tennessee Valley Authority to build a steamplant to help furnish power needed for our work on atomic energy.', 'I thought they would be glad of a chance to correct this mistake. But no, sir. They must have consulted their Republican candidate for President and learned his view that the TVA is wonderful, but we ought never to do anything like it again.', 'Finally, I urged the special session to act on legislation to protect the basic rights of citizenship and human liberty. The Republican Party has been paying lip service to legislation for this purpose for many years. But when the showdown comes, they never quite manage to act upon it.', 'The performance of this ""do-nothing"" Both Congress during the past 2 years, and particularly the ""do less than nothing"" special session, has given the country a foretaste of what will happen if the Republican Party is successful at the polls.', 'The people of Ohio, particularly the residents of Cleveland, will long remember 1932, when the Republican Party was in power.', 'Many of you can remember the smokeless smokestacks, the idle plants, the closed banks, the long breadlines, the soup kitchens. You can also remember the assurance you received from the Republicans that prosperity was just around the corner.', 'Now, it was the Democratic Party that lifted the Nation from the worst depression it has ever known, under the leadership of Franklin D. Roosevelt.', 'It was the Democratic Party that inspired and inaugurated a program of social legislation that restored democratic government to its proper place as the servant of the people and not the agent of the privileged few.', 'The Democratic Party stands ready to serve the Nation--ready to serve all citizens and not just the vested interests, ready to carry on its ""fundamental philosophy"" that has done so much for the people of the United States in the last 16 years.', 'Now, during the last 2 years, the Democratic Party has had to spend most of its time and energy in saving the Democratic program--the New Deal--from the Republican attacks upon it.', ""As Democrats, we don't like this. We feel it is a bad thing to spend so much time preventing the Republicans from turning the clock back."", 'We would much rather have the clock go along and go forward. And I would like to go forward with it.', 'Now, what this country needs is not a new President. What this country needs is a new Congress--a Democratic Congress.', 'Now, all I am asking you to do is to go to the polls on November the 2d and vote for yourselves. Vote in your own interests. If you do that, you will have a Democratic administration here in the great State of Ohio, you will have a Democratic President in the White House, and you will have a Democratic Congress that will be willing to serve the people and not the special interests.']"

I have always had a great respect for the citizens of Massachusetts. It's good to be in a State that has given every Democratic Presidential candidate for the last 20 years a majority--and I think you're going to do it again."", 'And I am most happy to have with me today in this great State its former Governor and my Secretary of Labor, Maurice Tobin. He is an able and distinguished public servant, and it is an honor to any President to have him in the Cabinet.', 'I am particularly pleased to be in Berkshire County. The Republicans probably are trying to keep it a secret. But you know, it was always here in western Massachusetts that the real progressive movement began in this country, and it began just after the Revolutionary War.', 'I remember hearing about a Congressman from this district who represented you for a long time in the Congress, and they tell me that that Congressman was very astute-that was before the invention of the radio and television and things of that kind--and he used to tour the mill towns of Berkshire County and tell them how strong he was for Roosevelt and the New Deal. Then he would go up in the hard-shell Republican hills and tell them he was against it. I think that is where the Republican candidate got his ideas this year--that the smart way to campaign is to be on both sides of every issue and never discuss it.', 'But we have learned a good deal about the world since your old Congressman used to get himself elected with double talk. This year you should send Pat O\'Malley down to Washington to help me in the big job of cleaning out the special interests and their lobbies down there in Washington. And I\'m very sure that\'s what you are going to do--I mean, cleaning out the mess made by the Republican 80th Congress. ""The Great Lobby Congress,"" I call it. There were more lobbies in Congress with more money than ever before in the history of this great Nation, and it\'s a disgrace. You ought to dean them out. I think you\'re going to do it.', 'I would like to tell you a little bit about what this Republican Party did to mess up your interests, the interests of the people. I want to tell you what they did to the United States Department of Labor, to which I have just appointed Maurice Tobin. The Democratic Party sponsored the creation of the Labor Department way back in 1913 under a Democratic President, Woodrow Wilson. The Democrats in Congress passed the law that created the Labor Department against the violent opposition of the Old Guard Republicans. Woodrow Wilson named a Pennsylvania Democrat, William B. Wilson, to be the first Secretary of Labor. And after World War I, when the Republicans gained control of the Government, they favored, as they always do, labor-baiting, union-busting, open shop, yellow-dog contract policies. That is the Republican history whenever they get control of the Government. The gains made by the workingmen and women under 8 years of Democratic administration, from 1913 to 1921, were lost.', ""Twelve years later, in 1933, when we had 12 million able-bodied Americans out of jobs as a result of Republican misrule, we elected a great Democratic President, Franklin Roosevelt. The new Democratic administration began immediately to build up the Labor Department. One of the first steps was to create the United States Employment Service in 1933 to deal with unemployment. And I want to say to you that I set up the United States Employment Service in the great State of Missouri. Miss Perkins called me up and asked me if I wouldn't set it up on a-dollar-a-year basis--and I never got the dollar. This Service did great work during the 1930's, finding jobs for men and women and jobs they were best fitted to fill. During the war the United States Employment Service placed 39 million workers on war jobs. That Service helped to win the war. After the war it helped to shift 10 million workers from warwork to peace employment. In the reconversion period that United States Employment Service did a wonderful job for the welfare of this country."", 'And what did the Republican 80th ""donothing"" Congress do for the United States Employment Service? Why, they took it away from the Labor Department, where it belongs--they took it out of the Labor Department where it belongs, and deliberately weakened it. They deliberately weakened the Labor Department by doing that.', ""Another great part of the Labor Department built up by Democratic administrations of the last 16 years is the Conciliation Service. It has settled--now listen to this--it has settled more than 15,000 labor disputes, involving nearly 8 million workers, since the end of World War II. That's a record. It settled 15,000--more than 15,000-labor disputes. What do the Republicans think of this kind of work? What do they think of this fine work of the Conciliation Service? Well, the 80th Congress showed its contempt for labor by taking the Conciliation Service away from the Labor Department. That's another straight blow at labor. Only a few nights ago in Pittsburgh the Republican candidate for President said he would replace the present head of the Conciliation Service, who has done a magnificent job and who, incidentally, happens to be a New England Republican, but he doesn't belong to the Old Guard--that's what's the matter with him."", ""And that is only a part of what the 80th Congress did to the Labor Department. The Republicans slashed so much off the Department budget that it is scarcely able to run. They cut 25 percent off the Wage and Hour Division. They cut the Unemployment Service by 60 percent. They cut the Conciliation Service by 20 percent. They cut the Bureau of Labor Statistics by 60 percent. Do you know why they did that? They don't want the facts about the cost of living, employment, and high prices. That's the reason they cut down the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They just don't want the facts. The facts knock them in the eye, and they can't stand them. They completely wiped out the Division of Labor Standards."", ""There you have a fine example of how the Republican Party keeps its campaign promises. In 1944 the Republican platform promised a strong Labor Department, and they are promising a strong Labor Department now. But you can only judge them by their acts--and their acts say they don't want a strong Labor Department. They don't want any other department that's strong enough to protect the interests of the people. When the Republicans got control of the Congress they tore up the Labor Department."", ""In 1948 the Republicans are again promising a strong Labor Department. You ought to read their platform. It's the most hypocritical, deceitful document that was ever written in the history of political parties. The Republican candidate has already given away the plot this time. He has already said during this campaign that he would like to take away just about everything else that is left in the Labor Department."", ""So that's why I ask you to turn out on November 2d and send Pat O'Malley down to Washington. Help me to get back some of the real gains which we made during the last 16 years, and which the Republican Party will sabotage if it ever gets complete control of the Government. Think of your interests, your own interests, the people's interests, and then vote for yourselves. You know, you are the Government when you exercise your rights and privileges. In 1946 two-thirds of you stayed at home and didn't vote. And that's what caused the 80th Congress. Now, I sincerely hope that all of you, three-thirds of you, will vote on election day, on November 2d, and be sure that you vote for yourselves.

Don't stay away from the polls and then wonder what happened when you get a Government that works for special interests and doesn't work for you."", ""I am asking you with everything I have: Go to the polls on November 2d, and to be absolutely sure you're right, just vote the Democratic ticket straight and you will be all right."", '[2.] THOMPSONVILLE, CONNECTICUT (Rear platform, 10:35 a.m.)', 'Thank you very much. Thank you. would like very much just to stand here and listen to those cheers all day, but I know you want to hear a little something from me.', 'I would like to tell you just what the Republican Party has done to the Labor Department in which you are vitally interested. I want to tell you what they did to the United States Department of Labor. The Democratic Party sponsored the creation of that department in 1913 under Woodrow Wilson. That department was inaugurated and Woodrow Wilson appointed William B. Wilson the first Secretary of Labor, and I have just appointed the last Secretary of Labor, former Governor Tobin from Massachusetts. After World War I, when the Republicans gained control of the Government, they favored, as they always do, labor-baiting, union-busting, open-shop, yellow-dog contract policies. The gains made by the workingmen and women under 8 years of Democratic administration, from 1913 to 1921, were largely lost. Twelve years later, in 1933, we had 12 million able-bodied Americans out of jobs as a result of Republican misrule. We elected a great Democratic President who remedied that. We put Franklin D. Roosevelt in office.', ""Now, the new Democratic administration of 1933 immediately began to build up the Labor Department. One of the first steps was to create the United States Employment Service in 1933 to deal with unemployment. This service did great work during the 1930's finding jobs for men and women, jobs they were best fitted to fill. During the war the United States Employment Service placed 39 million workers on jobs. That Service helped materially to win the war. After the war it helped shift 10 million workers from warwork to peacetime employment."", 'Now, what did the Republican ""donothing"" 80th Congress do to the Labor Department and the United States Employment Service? The Republicans took it away from the Labor Department where it belongs. They deliberately weakened the Labor Department by taking the Employment Service away from it.', ""Another great part of the Labor Department built up by the Democratic administrations of the last 16 years was the Conciliation Service. It settled more than 15,000 labor disputes involving more than 8 million workers since the end of World War II. Now, that's a record. What did the Republicans do with that Service? Why, the 80th Congress showed its contempt of labor by taking the Conciliation Service away from the Labor Department. And that's another blow at labor."", ""That's only a part of what the 80th Congress did to labor. The Republicans slashed so much money off the department budget that they were scarcely able to run. They cut 25 percent off the Wage and Hour Division. They cut the Unemployment Service by 60 percent. They cut the Conciliation Service by 20 percent. They cut the Bureau of Labor Statistics by 60 percent. They don't want the facts about the cost of living, employment, and high prices. That's the reason they cut the Statistics Department. They completely wiped out the Division of Labor Standards. There you have a fine example of how the Republican Party keeps its campaign promises."", 'Now, out in Pittsburgh--out in Pittsburgh, Pa.--the Republican candidate for President said that he was going to institute a Labor Department equal to the Commerce Department and the Agricultural Department. Five days later, in Rensselaer, Ind., when he was speaking for Charlie Halleck, he gave away the last thing in the Labor Department. If he could get elected he said he would put that in a new department that he was going to set up.', ""Now, my Republican opponent's logic reminds me of a story at a New England town meeting. There was a citizen at the town meeting who made a motion to appropriate $50,000 to build a new city hall. An old gentleman got up and made an amendment to the motion and said that he would like to make it $100,000, but that he wanted to make some conditions before they had the $100,000. He said he would like to build a new town hall--this was condition one--on the site of the old one. Then he said he wanted to use every stone in the old town hall to go into the new hall. Then he said he didn't want the old town hall torn down till the new one was built."", ""Now, that's the way the Republican candidate feels about the Labor Department. That's the way he feels about all the issues in this campaign. He's afraid to discuss them. You haven't heard him mention a single Republican administration or a single Republican President. He can't point to them with pride because whenever they have had the chance, they have tried to give the country to special interests. The Democratic Party stands for you and for your interests."", 'Now, if you believe that, get out early in the morning on election day, elect Chester Bowles Governor and the whole Democratic ticket in Connecticut, and send me back to the White House with a Democratic Congress so we can get things done.', '[3.] HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT (11 a.m.)', ""Thank you very much.

Too many people wanted easy profits. Not enough people were alert to the danger, and so the Republican leaders in the Congress led the successful fight against price control.', ""Those Republican leaders, I remember, used to boast about how they'd kill OPA.

It is a disgrace to the country.', 'This real estate lobby predicts that, if it is successful in killing rent control in March, rents will not be increased more than 20 percent.', 'Now, is there anybody here in Hartford who wants his rent jumped 20 percent next March? All you have got to do is send that leadership back that ran the Both Congress.', ""I don't have a doubt in the world that rents would be that high, or maybe even higher, if the Republican Party should win this election."", ""If the same Republicans who ran the Both Congress are back there next spring, they'll kill rent control just exactly like this lobby wants them to."", ""The reason why rents would go up so quickly is that we still have a very bad housing shortage in this country.

We need to clear slums. We need to build at least half a million low-rent housing units.', 'And we most definitely need to retain rent control until the housing emergency is over.', 'The housing bill was killed by the Republican leaders in the 80th Congress just the way price control was killed, just the way they will get rid of rent control next spring if they get a chance.', 'I think the people of Hartford and the people of Connecticut have had enough of that kind of Republican reaction.', 'You have had enough of Republican neglect of your interests in favor of special privilege.', 'What we need is a Democratic forward-looking Government that will keep this Nation strong and prosperous.', 'We must pass that Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill to provide houses that everyone can afford.', 'And we must repeal that other Taft-named bill, that Taft-Hartley Act.', 'We must have at least a 75 cents an hour minimum wage.', 'We must broaden and extend social security.', 'We must pass the Federal aid to education bill so that our States can provide our children with the best education it is possible to give.', 'These are some of the specific things we must do.', 'These are the issues in this campaign.', ""They are not generalizations.

He was that great, outstanding American, Alfred E. Smith.', 'You gave him a tremendous reception. And when the cheers had subsided, he took all of you to his heart with one phrase. He said, ""It\'s good to come home.""', 'I know just how Al Smith felt. For Massachusetts is home to every American who loves freedom and trusts the people.', 'From the first days of our Nation, the spirit of the men and women of the Bay State has impressed upon American life the love of freedom and the hatred of tyranny.', 'Even before the end of the Revolutionary War, Massachusetts freed her slaves--all of them--because the people held that liberty was not for any one race or creed.', ""Here in Boston, you still stand among the Nation's foremost fighters for freedom and against intolerance."", 'Now, many of you recall that campaign of 1928, when Al Smith ran for President against that well-known engineer--Herbert Hoover. He was one engineer who really did a job of running things backward.', 'That campaign of 1928 was one of the most shameful political campaigns in our history.', ""A vile whispering campaign was spearheaded by the Ku Klux Klan and by Klanminded people to discredit Al Smith. The Republican appeal was based on religious prejudice because of Al Smith's Catholic faith."", 'The leaders of the Republican Party served notice on America then and there that they would stop at nothing in order to gain power.', ""Don't think that the elephant has changed his habits in the last 20 years. This Republican elephant is not that kind of elephant.

But, fundamentally, the issue was the same--that is, the rights of all the people against special privilege for the few.', 'I have often thought what a different and better world we would have had if Al Smith had been elected President.', ""But that didn't happen. And the great engineer we elected backed the train all the way into the waiting room and brought us to panic, depression, and despair."", 'Here at home, we had boom and bust.', 'In our dealings with other countries, we had Republican high tariffs, political isolation, and economic confusion--forces that helped to bring on World War II.', 'I say to you people of Boston that if Al Smith--and not Herbert Hoover--had been chosen President in 1928, we and the world would have been spared untold misery and suffering.', ""Unfortunately, there was no mechanical Republican substitute for Al Smith's great heart. No engineering equivalent could be found for his moral courage, his passion for justice, and his love of humanity."", 'After the Republicans had made such a mess of our domestic welfare and world security, we brought to the Presidency a Democrat--that courageous leader and great humanitarian, Franklin D.

Two years ago, when it was the responsibility of the people to elect a new Congress, millions of Americans failed to vote. Almost two-thirds of those entitled to vote did not vote.

The Republican candidate for President in 1944, who is trying again this year, said here in Boston--now listen to this--he said, right here in Boston--that Franklin Roosevelt was soliciting the support of Communists. He said that the Communists were seizing control of the New Deal.', 'Those statements were absurd and ridiculous. They were just as absurd as the reasons this same Republican candidate gave in 1944 as to why the New Deal could not provide jobs after the war.

In stating that doctrine, I said: ""It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.""', 'Our first step under that doctrine was to give economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey, two countries right under the shadow of Communist domination.', 'The whole world knows of the success of this policy.

The salvation of Italy from Communist tyranny is one of the great achievements of our recovery program.', 'And for that the Communists will never forgive me.', 'Our aid has also been a bulwark of free democracy in France.

Human suffering nourishes the Communist menace. That menace withers away where there is prosperity, justice, and tolerance.', 'The real threat of communism in this country lies in the danger of another major depression.

The blame rests on the leaders of the Republican Party--and nowhere else.', 'The National Association of Manufacturers put on a great campaign to fool the American people into believing that we would have more production and lower prices if we got rid of price control. The Republican leaders took part in that conspiracy just to deceive the everyday person.', 'Right in the halls of Congress, Republican leaders made the flat statement that prices would fall, if controls went off.

There were more lobbies in Washington and more money spent in Washington by lobbies during the 80th Congress than in all the history of preceding Congresses. It is shameful and a disgrace to this country that a Congress would let a lobby tell it what to do.

Sidney Hillman fought for the working people, and that includes nearly all of us. I know it includes me because I work 18 hours a day and I don't get time and a half for overtime either."", 'The bosses of the Republican Party work for the men with millions to spend, for the men who believe they can buy your Government behind a smoke screen in hotel rooms.', ""And I want to tell you that I don't care how much money the Republicans have, we have got the votes--and that's what counts!"", ""The Republican leaders and the Republican Party are interested in bigger profits for the corporations, smaller taxes for the rich, and bigger and worse Taft-Hartley laws for labor.

The publicity about that dinner was very careful to point out that the combined income of those 50 foremost business leaders was $7,500,000 a year--$7,500,000 a year! That's an average of $150,000 a year for each one of them."", ""Now, at every dinner like that they must have a speaker.

So they whistled, and the speaker hurried right down here. He was anxious to make a name for himself--because he wants to be President."", 'Right here in the Waldorf-Astoria he rose up before the assembled millions--dollars, not people--and began his speech. This is how he started: ""Fellow victims of the New Deal."" Believe it or not, this man thought it was funny to call the $150,000-a-year men ""Fellow victims of the New Deal.""', ""I really don't think those men had much to complain about. I think they fared very well under the New Deal. And though you'll never get them to admit it, these men owe as much to Bob Wagner as the working people do.

And for Bob Wagner's part in that all of us ought to be eternally grateful to him."", 'He wrote the National Labor Relations Act, the great charter of labor. No greater law ever went on the statute books of any nation than that. Under the Wagner Act labor finally achieved its right to organize unions of its own choosing and to bargain collectively. Union membership in our country grew from 2 1/2 million in 1932, until today that membership is approaching 17 million union members.', ""Bob Wagner thought of the whole Nation. He was one of the chief architects of the Social Security Act. No man ever contributed more to the social well-being and security of any people. We're working now to see that the Social Security Act is extended-extended to all our wage earners, to the farmer, the domestic worker, the self-employed, and to all those who need its protection. The Republicans, though, don't like that. They had, in their platform of 1944, that they were for the extension of social security--but the 80th Congress took a million out from under it. That's how they carried out their promise."", ""Bob Wagner wrote laws for railroad men, too. He wrote laws to help us build houses. His hand can be seen in every decent piece of legislation that has come out of Washington since 1927. We are here tonight to honor Senator Wagner. But no one man, no group of persons, can rightly honor him tonight. It's history that will honor him as he really deserves. History will tell of the security and the happiness and the strength this man brought to the people. The people of our country, the free people of all the world, face the future with confidence, knowing that Bob Wagner is with them in their struggle to achieve a peaceful and decent world in which to live.

I felt it so strongly that I went into consultation with the White House physician. And I told him that I kept having this feeling, that everywhere I go there\'s somebody following behind me. The White House physician told me not to worry. He said: ""You keep right on your way. There is one place where that fellow is not going to follow you--and that\'s in the White House.""', ""I think the doctor's right.

He won't follow me if I go into the record of the Democratic and Republican Parties."", 'The Republican candidate can follow me all the way from Los Angeles to Madison Square Garden, but the Republican record makes it certain that he will still be trailing along behind when the votes are counted. He is doing all he can to make you forget that record. He doesn\'t dare talk about it. I have never in my life been in a campaign where the opposition refused absolutely to discuss the issues of the campaign. I can\'t understand that sort of an approach. But after I had analyzed the situation I came to the conclusion that the record of the Republican Party is much too bad to talk about. The Republican candidate is trying to run on the record of the Democratic Party--of Franklin Roosevelt and myself. He\'s a ""me too"" man.', ""Let's take a look at the record and see why he can't talk about the record of the Republican Party. Let's go back a few years. In 1928, the Republicans elected a well-known efficiency engineer named Herbert Hoover, and they promised us everything. They told us if we wanted prosperity we must vote for Hoover. Well, the people fell for it. And I think this new candidate-well, he's not a new candidate--I think this second-hand candidate thinks the same way. You know what a bitter experience you had after that."", 'Many of you here tonight remember 1932. Over in Central Park men and women were living in little groups of shacks made of cardboard and old boxes. They were known as ""Hoovervilles."" Out here on Eighth Avenue veterans were selling apples. Ragged individualism. I suppose that\'s what you would call it. Farm foreclosures, homeowners\' evictions, starvation wages, labor unions disrupted by company spies and thugs--that was the Republican record when they last had control of the Government. And, you know, there is a peculiar thing about this campaign. I have never heard of a single Republican candidate for office point with pride to any Republican administration or any Republican President.', 'Now, they made an awful mess of things when they had control back there when they were elected in 1928. And in 1932 we turned them out. The vigorous action which saved the Nation and restored our faith came with the Democrats, with the New Deal, and with Franklin Roosevelt.', ""We saved the banks. Now, in the last 3 years there hasn't been a single bank failure in the United States."", ""We saved industry. Now, industry last year and this year have made the biggest profits they ever made in the history of the country--17 billions last year, and nearly 20 billion this year. That's profits after taxes."", 'We saved the insurance companies. We saved the railways.', 'At that point the Republicans said we had done enough. But we went right on saving this great Nation of ours. We saved the people--the farmers, the workers, the unemployed, the old people who had lost their savings, and the young people who had never had a chance. And while we were at it, we saved the United States of America. We replanted the forests, we began soil conservation, we built great dams, we developed whole river valleys. We built roads and bridges, schoolhouses and courthouses. We built sidewalks and sewers, parks and playgrounds, and low-rent housing--and quite a few battleships, too.', ""And all the time, the Republicans kept moaning that we were going too far. I was in the Senate during those years, and I heard them moaning. And the Congressional Record is the best evidence of the policies that the Republicans wanted to pursue, but they couldn't do it. They said we were undermining our own moral fiber--we were destroying individual initiative--that Roosevelt was a dictator--that we were opposed to free enterprise. Now, as early as 1936 they began saying that we were communistic, and socialistic, red, or radical--because we cared for the people and the people knew it, and liked it. They tried to scare labor in 1936--you all remember this--by stuffing pay envelopes with propaganda against social security. That didn't work. They tried a new line of propaganda in 1940, and again it didn't work. The people knew better. They broke with tradition and chose Roosevelt for a third term."", ""World War II had come and the country was in danger. But that meant nothing to Republican leadership. They came within a single vote in the Congress of the United States of disbanding our Army 3 months before Pearl Harbor--and they spent thousands of dollars and time, without stint, trying to prove that Pearl Harbor was brought about by one of the greatest Presidents who ever sat in the White House--and it's all turned out to be a pack of lies! They hindered and delayed our efforts to rearm the Nation. Nobody knows more about that than I do, for I was there watching them."", ""And all the time they kept moaning and groaning that the New Deal had weakened America. Weakened America--think of that! Now, Tojo and Hitler knew better than that. They knew the answer to that one, even if the Republicans don't."", 'But the Republicans kept on trying to stop us, trying to stop the people and trying to kill the New Deal.', ""In 1944 the Republicans tried to talk their way into power again. They nominated a man who was violently opposed to the New Deal. In fact, he wrote a book about it. They nominated the same man they nominated this year--that's the reason I said he was a second-hand candidate. He was saying the same things in 1944 that he is saying today. He was attacking Franklin Roosevelt's administration then, and he is attacking my administration now. He says that because I want to talk about these things and because I want to talk about the issues that I'm just an ordinary political mudslinger. When I go out to the people of the United States, in every corner of the United States, in nearly every State of the Union, and tell them what the facts are-then I'm a mudslinger. He can't stand the facts--that's what the trouble is."", 'Time and again in 1944 he told the voters that what we need is ""strength and unity."" He promised to displace--and I quote--""a tired, exhausted, quarreling, and bickering administration with a fresh and vigorous administration."" Now, doesn\'t that sound familiar to you? And he asked, and I quote again: ""Is the New Deal, the tired and quarrelsome New Deal, all America has to offer?"" ""Must we go back,"" he asked, ""must we go back to leaf-raking and doles?"" Well, you people stuck by the New Deal in 1944, and we haven\'t had to go back to leaf-raking or the doles, or anything else of that kind. And the reason we haven\'t had to go back to Hooverville and breadlines and soup kitchens is because the Democratic policies of the New Deal are correct and right, and they\'re for all the people and not just for the privileged few.', 'I must say, though, that some of you are partly to blame for this, because you didn\'t vote in 1946. That Republican ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress did all it could to start us back down that dismal road.', 'Here\'s another one. At Baltimore just before the 1944 election the Republican candidate said: ""We must have a President who can and will work with Congress."" He said he ""would like to start the largest housecleaning Washington ever had."" That sounds familiar, too, doesn\'t it? Now he is playing the same old record again, and the record is stuck in the same old groove. What a wonderful thing it was for the people of this United States that they didn\'t have a President who would go along with that good-for-nothing 80th Congress! Now, he was speaking of the wartime administration of one of the greatest men in history, who was leading a united people to victory in the greatest war of all time. Roosevelt believed in the people, and the people believed in Roosevelt--and so did I. Even with millions of men overseas and away from their homes the Roosevelt ticket won in 1944. Let me put it differently: The Republicans lost and the people won again in 1944.', 'You know what happened then. We won the war in the most complete military victory ever recorded in history. And since the war we have enjoyed the greatest peacetime prosperity in our history.', 'My friends, that\'s the record. And as Al Smith said, ""If you look at the record, you can\'t go wrong."" The record of Republican failure and Democratic success--that\'s why the Republican candidate won\'t follow me when I talk about the record.', ""There's another place also where he won't follow me. He won't follow me in discussing the issues of this campaign."", ""He can follow me into Framingham, Mass., but he won't follow me in raising the minimum wage to at least 75 cents an hour. He said in this campaign that he is for a minimum wage--and I think the smaller the minimum the better it suits him."", ""He can follow me into Cleveland, but he won't follow me and broaden the coverage of our social security insurance laws and increase their benefits by 50 percent. You know, an old couple now only gets $40 a month, and that's mighty little--just like that minimum wage--$ 16 a week. I've said time and again around the country that I wish that the Republican Congressmen could have to live in Washington for a while on $16 a week or $40 a month. I think they would change their minds just a little bit."", ""He can follow me into Chicago, but he won't follow me in demanding that Congress pass laws for health insurance and medical care. You know, it's a shame and a disgrace that a country as rich and as important as this great country is today--the leader of all the world--is not able to give the people in the middle the proper kind of medical care. I've asked for health insurance because health insurance is the answer to a healthy nation--and some day we're going to get it."", 'He can follow me into Boston, but he won\'t follow me in calling for Federal aid to education so that teachers can get a living wage, and so that modern schools can be built, and so that our children can get a decent education. That\'s another disgrace on this great country. And our Republican opponent has said that the teachers lobby-he called it ""The Teachers Organization""; he\'s trying to work against the teachers lobby--he says it\'s the most vicious thing in this country. Vicious because the teachers want to get a living wage and because they want to get decent housing for our school children! Now, we give money to the States to build roads. Why can\'t we also give money to the States from the Federal Government to build schoolhouses and pay teachers? I think it\'s much more important to see that the children that ride in the buses over these roads get the proper kind of schooling and the proper sort of teachers than it is to build the roads, myself. He doesn\'t go along with me on that.', ""He can follow me to Pittsfield and Providence, but when he gets there they needn't expect him to give them any help on lowcost housing. You know, low-cost houses have been before the Congress for 3 years. It passed the Senate twice. First it was the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. That was killed. And then they introduced a new bill in the 80th Congress and they called it the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill. And when it came up for consideration the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives wouldn't even let it in, and the Members of Congress in the Lower House couldn't even vote on it; and when it came back for reconsideration in the Senate Mr. Taft ran out on his own bill. I don't understand that."", ""He can follow me into New York City-and I wouldn't be surprised if he followed me right here into Madison Square Garden-but he won't follow me in demanding the repeal of the Taft-Hartley law. You can be sure of that. He can follow me right up here on this platform next Saturday night, but he won't follow me in calling for a law to control high prices. You can be sure of that."", 'On all these issues, when it comes to doing something for the people, the Republican candidate won\'t follow me--you can be sure of that. Sometimes it looks as if he is almost persuaded to follow me on some of these questions, but that\'s as far as he goes, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is as far as he\'s going to go. Because every time the publican candidate looks at the program of the Democratic Party, he says, ""Me too,"" and his party\'s record says, ""Nothing doing."" And his party\'s record speaks louder than he does. You know, he is trying to persuade the people at large in the country that the elephant\'s got the new look, but it\'s just the same old elephant--you can be sure of that.', ""He could follow me all over the country in his campaign special, but he couldn't get his party to follow me and support a decent law for displaced persons."", ""Now, he couldn't get that old elephant to behave before election time, and I wonder how in the world he's going to get it to behave after election time with that same old leadership in the Congress. He can't do it."", 'Now, let me say in all seriousness that I am glad the Republican candidate has followed me around over the country, because it has shown the people how little he has to offer them. And the American people are not going to be fooled. They want to hear something more than platitudes. You know, ""G.O.P."" now stands for ""Grand Old Platitudes.""', ""The Republican candidate can follow me to every city, town, and village in this country. But so long as he is afraid to tell where he stands on the issues he will lose more votes than he gains. Some of those Republican papers now are getting a little scared. They agree I might win. Don't you worry about that--I will win! A Democratic victory is on the way and he is doing all he can to help us win it, and I'm glad of that."", 'I wish to speak now upon a subject that has been of great interest to me as your President. It is the subject of Israel. Now, this is a most important subject and must not be resolved as a matter of politics during a political campaign. I have refused consistently to play politics with that question. I have refused, first, because it is my responsibility to see that our policy in Israel fits in with our foreign policy throughout the world; second, it is my desire to help build in Palestine a strong, prosperous, free, and independent democratic state. It must be large enough, free enough, and strong enough to make its people self-supporting and secure.', 'As President of the United States, back in 1945, I was the first to call for the immediate opening of Palestine to immigration to the extent of at least 100,000 persons. The United States, under my administration, led the way in November 1947, and was responsible for the resolution of the United Nations setting up Israel, not only as a homeland, but as a free and independent political state. The United States was the first to give full and complete recognition to the new State of Israel in April 1948, and recognition to its provisional government.', 'I have never changed my position on Palestine or Israel. As I have previously announced, I have stood--and still stand-on the present Democratic platform of 1948. The platform of 1944 had provisions in it under which I have been trying to act. The platform of 1948 reiterates those positions and goes a little further--and I am glad it did go a little further. What we need now is to help the people of Israel--and they have proved themselves worthy of the best traditions of hardy pioneers. They have created out of the barren desert a modern and efficient state, with the highest standards of Western civilization. They have demonstrated that Israel deserves to take its place in the family of nations.', 'That is our objective. We shall work toward it, but we will not work toward it in a partisan and political way. I am confident that that objective will be reached. I know that no American citizen, of whatever race or religion, would want us to deal with the question of Palestine on any other basis than the welfare of all Americans of every race and faith.', 'That is the spirit in which all liberals face the issues of this campaign. We are concerned with justice, and we are deeply concerned with human rights--here in America as well as in the rest of the world.', 'I am happy to say to you tonight that the spirit of liberalism is going to triumph at the polls on November 2d, just as sure as you are sitting in this hall.', ""The forces of reaction gained a beachhead in 1946 when they elected a Republican Congress. And this year they have redoubled their efforts to take over control of your Government. And it is your Government when you exercise the right to vote. And when you don't exercise the right to vote you can't complain when such things as the 80th Congress come along and commence doing things to you."", ""I have never lost faith in the people. I know that when the issues were laid before them they would arise to preserve their liberties. I have not been disappointed. All over the country the people have become aroused. Democracy is on the march, and it's on the march to victory!"", ""I have only one request to make of you: vote on election day. Vote for yourselves. You don't have to vote for me. Vote in your own interests. And when you do that, you can only vote one way--vote for the welfare of the country, vote for the welfare of the world, and vote for your own welfare by voting the Democratic ticket straight on November 2d.""]"

He has attacked my conduct of foreign affairs in unmeasured terms. He has torn off his mask of bipartisanship and revealed the ugly partisan passion underneath."", 'I feel, therefore, that I would be failing in my duty to bring the issues to the people, if I did not discuss the Republican record in the field of foreign affairs.', 'Let me say at the outset, in a few words, what our American foreign policy is.', 'The heart and soul of American foreign policy is peace.', 'We are supporting a world organization to keep the peace, and a world economic policy to create prosperity for all mankind.', 'The first and most important feature of our foreign policy is to strengthen the United Nations, which seeks to bring about a peaceful adjustment of differences between nations.', 'Our guiding principle is international cooperation. The very basis of our foreign policy is cooperative action with other nations.', 'Unfortunately, our hopes for worldwide cooperation have been hampered by the Soviet Union whose policies and objectives seem to be at odds with what the United States and other democratic nations are striving for.

While he looks ahead, working for a happy outcome, he must also take thought of possible disasters.', ""The President's responsibility goes far beyond the formalities of diplomacy. It extends to ultimate reality--the final consequence of war and peace."", 'A President must approach this task humbly and sincerely. He must be sure in his heart that no error, no pride, no arrogance on his part offers an obstacle to the achievement of peace.', 'The President is the servant of the American people. He must leave no stone unturned in expressing their will for peace.', 'Throughout the world today the people yearn for peace. If all peoples were free to express themselves as we are, there would be absolutely no danger of war. But, unfortunately, we are confronted by a dangerous and difficult circumstance.', 'The people of the Soviet Union are surrounded by a curtain of censorship through which very little of the truth about the other people of the world can penetrate.', 'The leaders of the Soviet Union are victims of their own iron curtain.', 'There is a vast amount of misinformation and misunderstanding in the minds of those who control the destinies of the Russian people.', 'One of the problems which I face, and one of the problems which my great predecessor faced, is to pierce that iron curtain and to get the truth across to the leaders in the Soviet Union.', 'We must try to get them to understand that our people are united in what we think is right, that we have no evil intentions, that we stand firmly behind the United Nations.', 'Our experience has shown that formal diplomatic channels do not always succeed in doing this. It is the duty of the President, therefore, to consider and study every possible approach to the heart and understanding of the Soviet leaders.', 'I have given this problem prayerful consideration. I shall continue to do so.', 'There are some misguided persons who believe that further peaceful discussions are useless.', 'But that is not the position of the United States Government.', 'So long as I am President of the United States, the door will not be closed to peace.', 'I will always explore every possible means, no matter how difficult or how unconventional, for reaching agreement.', 'I welcome the abuse that is showered upon me by those who have made up their minds that war is inevitable.', ""In my search for peace, I do not care what epithets may be hurled at me by those who think that we must hurry on to an inevitable .catastrophe. I don't care about that. I don't care what they say. There is nothing new they can say about me. It has all been said. And I am here to tell you that the American people don't believe it."", 'But when the Republican leaders deliberately misinterpret my private consultations with the Secretary of State, and try to tell the people of America that my constant concern about peace is wrong, then I have to protest about it.', 'I do not believe that war is inevitable, and I shall make use of every honorable means to prevent it.', 'The way in which our foreign policy has been attacked raises doubts as to the good faith with which the Republican leaders in this campaign are approaching this whole question.', 'Do they regard it as nothing more than a campaign issue? Do they understand that the stakes in this matter are war or peace, life or death, not only for ourselves and our children, but for our civilization?', 'These doubts are made more serious by the record which the Republican Party has made in foreign policy over the years.', 'Let me say right now that I welcome the real contributions made to our foreign policy by certain Republicans in recent years. They have been helpful, and I will always give them full and friendly credit.', 'But these contributions, however real, must not blind us to the fact that the Republican Party, as a party, is a late convert to the cause of international good will and cooperation.', 'After the First World War, the United States had its first great opportunity to lead the world to peace. I have always believed that it was the will of Almighty God at that time that we should enter into and lead the League of Nations. How much misery and suffering the world would have been spared if we had only followed Woodrow Wilson!', 'We are not now making the same mistake that was made in 1920. God willing, we will never make that mistake again. God willing, we will never make that mistake again.', 'In the fateful election of 1920, the Democratic Party urged the people to take the lead in international affairs. The people recognized that this was their duty. But they were betrayed--betrayed by another Republican candidate who campaigned on both sides of the issue, and a Republican Party which sabotaged the ideal of international cooperation as soon as it had won the election.', ""Why did this happen? It happened because powerful interests in the Republican Party were so selfish and so shortsighted, that they blocked our participation in the world effort for peace. And those same interests are still powerful in the Republican Party. Don't let anybody tell you anything different."", ""Let me give you an example of their influence today. Remember that in the 1920's the Republican Party moved into Washington and enacted the highest tariffs in our history--tariffs that helped bring on World War II."", ""Then in the 1930's the terrible errors of the Republican high tariff were corrected by the Democratic Party, under the leadership of President Roosevelt and that great Secretary of State, Cordell Hull."", 'Using the powerful instrument of reciprocal trade agreements, we have demonstrated the possibility of an expanding world economy. We have provided a new foundation for a prosperous and a .peaceful world. But now this foundation is threatened by Republican reaction.', ""The leader of the Republican high tariff lobby in the 1920's was a gentleman from Pennsylvania by the name of Joe Grundy. That same Mr. Grundy showed up at the Republican Convention in Philadelphia this year, and masterminded the choice of the Republican candidate. And his personal protÃ©gÃ© is now the Republican Chairman of the National Committee. Do you want to return to Grundyism?

When the European recovery program was before the Senate, the isolationist forces in the Republican Party rose behind Senator Taft in an attempt to slash that program and change it from one of world reconstruction to one of handout relief.', 'It is preposterous for the Republican candidate to say that ""Republican statesmanship""--if there is such a thing--changed our original idea of the European recovery program into a practical measure.

On the basis of the record, the Communists believe that these forces would control the Republican Party and lead to an American policy of hit-and-run diplomacy."", 'The Communists want us to get out of Europe and Asia. They want us to stop helping European countries and China. They want us to withdraw and leave the field entirely to them. They know they can never get what they want so long as the Democratic Party remains in control of this Government.', 'But the Communists have real reason to hope that Republican isolationism will exert its pressure within the Republican Party, and, in a period of time, they can take over nation after nation.', 'My friends, that must not happen!', ""We must never withdraw to the Republican isolationism of the 1920'S. If you do that, communism will become so powerful that the security of this Nation will be gravely endangered."", 'As the Communists make their crafty plans, they find that on issue after issue they can expect no help from the Democratic Party.

The fate of mankind depends on the foreign policy of the United States. Grave decisions lie before us.', 'The next Congress will have to decide whether we shall continue our reciprocal trade policy or abolish it.', 'The next Congress will have to decide whether the European recovery program shall be continued.', 'If the forces of reaction and isolation gain control of our Government in this election, these fateful issues will be decided the wrong way.', 'And if they are decided the wrong way, our present great contribution to world peace will end. With it will end the hope for which this generation of mankind has sacrificed so much. The Democratic Party rejects that tragic course.', ""Now, our foreign policy is a people's foreign policy. Its purpose is to win a people's peace. It demands a people's government in Washington, not a special interest government. It demands that we maintain here in America a firm democratic base for world democracy."", 'It demands that we maintain here in America a secure economic base for world recovery.

I am most happy, most happy and pleased at this wonderful reception which you have given me here this afternoon. I think that Yonkers almost has it on New York City for the turnout.', 'You know, this is not unusual. In nearly every city where I have been the people have been turning out just this way--breaking records with the crowds, because they want to hear the truth and the facts in this campaign. And they know that I am trying to give them the truth and the facts. I think that you people of Yonkers have come here this morning for that same reason--that you want to know exactly what the issues are in this campaign.', ""I have been traveling all over the country-from coast to coast, from Minnesota to Texas and from Puget Sound to the Straits of Florida--telling the American people where I stand on the critical issues in this election. I have also been telling them--cause they can't find it out any other way-just exactly where the Republican Party stands, and what the country can expect if the Republican candidate for President were, by some chance, elected. I can't go into all the problems which face the Nation today, but I would like to talk to you about places to live."", ""I don't need to tell you that we have an acute housing shortage. You know that yourselves. There are more than 3 million families living doubled-up--two families where there is only room for one. Five million other families are living in what we are forced to call slum districts. There is a desperate shortage of apartments and houses for rent at prices that workingmen and women can afford to pay. That is a disgrace to a nation as rich as ours--and I want to correct that situation."", ""I have been fighting for 3 years to get a comprehensive housing law through the Congress. We need a law that will permit the Federal Government to clear away slums, build large-scale, low-cost rental housing, and help farmers as well as city folks to improve their homes. The Republican leaders in Congress, working hand in glove with the real estate lobby, stalled off action on the Federal housing bill until the last hours of the 80th Congress. And then they very quietly murdered that bill and passed a fake one with which they want to fool you people. That means we will continue to have a very great shortage of houses and apartments for a long time to come. That means that if the Republicans are elected next Tuesday you won't get any relief from the housing shortage, because the same backward-looking men will still be errand boys in Congress for the real estate lobby. The real estate lobby isn't through with you yet."", ""Just killing the house bill isn't all they want to do to you. Only 2 weeks ago they gave us a preview of what we can expect next spring if the Republicans win control of the Congress again."", 'The National Apartment Owners Association held a meeting out at Coronado, Calif. When it was over, this is what the Wall Street Journal reported in the issue of October 13th--if you want to know exactly where the Republicans stand, all you have to do is read the Wall Street Journal--""The Nation\'s landlords are going after rent control this year with a double-barreled shotgun."" This is dated Wednesday, October 13th. ""One barrel, repeating the single-shot blast used before, will renew a direct appeal to Congress to kill this last remaining wartime control. The other, aimed at enlisting John Public in the hunt, will pepper him with landlord laments and pleas to help get rid of restrictions which, he will be assured, are working to his own disadvantage.""', 'You see, they started out with the idea of fooling you to begin with.', 'The Wall Street journal is a wonderful paper to read if you want to find out what the Republicans believe, and how they are going to act towards the people.', ""This story continues with the news that the Apartment Owners Association is planning to spend a quarter of a million dollars in trying to deceive you into believing that we don't need rent control any longer."", ""You know, that 80th Congress was the most thoroughly surrounded Congress with lobbies in the whole history of this great country of ours. There were more lobbyists in Washington, there was more money spent by lobbyists in Washington, than ever before in the history of the Congress of the United States. It's disgraceful, and you ought not to let that happen again. Now, those lobbyists know they won't have any trouble with a Republican Congress, but they're afraid you might rise up in wrath and keep rent control from being repealed unless you have been influenced by their deceitful propaganda."", ""Let's go on with the story in the Wall Street Journal. It says that the Apartment Owners Association feels that rents won't go up more than 20 percent if they succeed in killing rent control. Twenty percent!"", ""Do you want your rent boosted 20 percent next spring? All right, if you don't, you most certainly ought to prevent it by voting the Democratic ticket straight, and then they can't do it. Cast your vote for yourselves, in the interests of yourselves. Don't cast it for those lobbyists. If you cast it for the Republican Party in this coming election you are voting to keep those terrible lobbies in Washington--and I am trying to run them out."", 'Now, the party that killed price control and killed the housing bill now wouldn\'t mind killing rent control. The Republican Party believes, apparently, that there ought to be two families in every garage. You know they said, ""two chickens in a pot,"" one time. Now they want to put two families in every garage.', ""If you want a decent place to live at a decent price, if you want lower prices, if you want permanent prosperity fairly shared by all of us, if you want a prosperous United States and a peaceful world, I say to you, the best way to get that is to vote in your own interests on the 2d of November by voting the Democratic ticket straight--and you can't make any mistake on that."", '[2.] YONKERS, NEW YORK (Alexander Smith Carpet Works, 12:40 p.m.)', 'Mr. Chairman, and ladies and gentlemen:', 'I certainly am highly pleased and much impressed by your wonderful turnout here this afternoon.', ""During the past 6 weeks I have been going around the country, talking to the American people about two different ideas of government. I have been proving by the record that the Republican Party, no matter what its candidate may say during the election campaign, works for the benefit of special interests. And I have been proving by the record that the Democratic Party works for the benefit of all the people. I have been asked a lot of questions. I have given straight answers and honest facts and correct figures. I think by this time you know exactly where I stand. There is good reason why I can be frank and honest in this business. It's because I have made no secret deals with lobbies or big business. I have no commitments except the commitment to serve the American people for the benefit of the whole country. I don't resort to double talk to conceal what I stand for and what I propose to do. I have told the people time and again what I think about high prices, the housing shortage, social security, and labor laws, and minimum wage. I have told exactly what I think ought to be done. Maybe my way isn't the way to run an election campaign. Some people say I would have more money for publicity if I wasn't so frank--the radio commentators and the newspapermen wouldn't be against me if I hadn't been against so many big corporations and so many lobbyists. But keeping quiet on the issues that are in the interests of the American people is not my way. I would rather be defeated trying to do what's right than to be elected under false pretenses. I never sit on the fence. Nor do I hang out on an upside-down farm gate trying to fool the people into believing that I know all about the farm. I spent 10 of the best years of my life on the farm."", ""One issue on which I have made my position clear is the Taft-Hartley Act. The Taft-Hartley law was passed by the Republican 80th Congress for just one reason--to crush the power of organized labor. The Republican bosses think that labor unions have too much power. They want to weaken unions so that you can't bargain for better wages and better working conditions."", ""The Taft-Hartley law is only a first step in what the Republicans have in mind to do to you if they get another chance. They intend to pass even more oppressive labor laws. I still say that that's wrong. I believe the Taft-Hartley Act ought to be repealed, and I am working to get that done. I believe that labor must always be in a position to bargain for wages which will enable the workingman of this Nation to maintain good standards of living. A time when Republican high prices are squeezing every one of us to the wall is no time to strip from American workers their best weapon of defense."", ""If you want a Government that will repeal the Taft-Hartley Act, provide good houses and apartments at prices you can afford to pay, build more schools and hospitals, extend social security and raise the minimum wage, and put a stop to rising prices--if you want a Government that will do these things for you, then you had better go to the polls next Tuesday and vote the Democratic ticket straight.

I stopped yesterday in one of the great shoe towns of the country, and that shoe manufacturing center is running on half time for the simple reason that shoes have gone so high that people have quit buying them. They are not selling as many shoes now under this Republican program as they sold when we had price control and rationing, and they're not making as much money, either. The high level cost of living is one of the penalties we are having to pay for letting the Republicans get control of the Both Congress."", ""But I don't think that was altogether a bad thing. I think it was a blessing in disguise, for we found out that the Republicans haven't changed one little bit in their policies since 1932."", ""Two-thirds of the people entitled to vote stayed at home in 1946, and as a result we got that high cost of living Both Congress, which wouldn't do a thing to help me control skyrocketing prices.

But the Republican leaders were more interested in big profits for big business than in helping you pay your grocery bill."", ""The 80th Congress was a mighty serious worry to me.

A man getting $60 a week got a reduction of about $1.58 a week in his taxes under this rich man's tax bill, and that $1.58 has been taken up by the prices that have been going out the roof--it doesn't make any difference in your pay envelope now."", 'But the fellow who got a $100,000 a year received a saving of more than $16,000--that is nearly four times the net salary of the President of the United States, what he saved.', ""And, you know what they did?

They had to pass it three times. I vetoed it three times. They finally got enough votes to pass it over my veto, but that tax bill is one of the most outrageous things that has ever happened in this country."", 'You know, the fellow with a big income gets a big saving, but the fellow with the little income gets nothing out of it. A fellow getting $60 a week saves about $150, which I think is the exact figure, but prices have gone up so that that is wiped out; but the fellow getting a $100,000 a year gets more than $16,000 of his income back.

We know where the Republicans stand, and we know where the Democrats stand, and I brought those issues to the country, my friends.', 'I have traveled up and down this Nation 22,000 miles since the campaign started, and 9,100 miles on a nonpolitical campaign before the campaign started.', ""I have told the people that there is just one big issue in this campaign and that's the people against the special interests."", 'The Republicans stand for special interests, and they always have.', 'The Democratic Party, which I now head, stands for the people--and always has stood for the people.', 'In 1932 the farmers in this great Nation were being foreclosed and were going broke at a terrific rate. I think, in 1932, 123,000 farmers were evicted from their farms. The net farm income that year was $2Â½ billion. The total income was $4 1/2 billion.', 'In 1947 the gross income of the farmers was $30 billion, and the net income was $18 billion. In 1947 there were less than 800 farm foreclosures. The Democratic Party is responsible for that result, and nothing else!', ""And I'll say to you that any farmer in these United States who votes against his own interests, that is, who votes the Republican ticket, ought to have his head examined!"", 'One of the first things that this Republican, ""do-nothing"" 80th Congress did was to hamstring the Commodity Credit Corporation, so they couldn\'t make price support loans to the farmers.', ""When I was over here in Illinois about a month ago, corn was selling down there in southern Illinois at 47 cents below what the support price ought to be, because the Commodity Credit Corporation could not furnish the bins in which to store that corn. That's a provision that the Republicans put in the Commodity Credit Corporation charter, when they renewed it. That's how they love the farmers! They want to bust them just like they did in 1932."", ""When the Democrats took over in 1933, labor was at its lowest ebb. Labor unions had a very small membership at that time-about 3 million. And there were 12 million people walking up and down the streets in this country, hunting for jobs that they couldn't get."", 'And one of the first things that the Democratic administration did was to inaugurate a charter for labor, a bill of rights for labor, known as the Wagner Labor Relations Act. And under that Wagner Labor Relations Act, the wages of labor are three times what they were in 1932 and 1933.', ""There are 61 million people at work in this country. And jobs are hunting for people, not people hunting for jobs. And that's the result of Democratic policy."", 'And one of the first bills introduced in this ""do-nothing"" Republican Both Congress was to cripple the Wagner Labor Relations Act. That Taft-Hartley law was passed over my veto. That bill was passed over my veto, and it was passed with the idea, so the Republican leaders in the Congress said, of putting labor in its place. They wanted to take the bargaining power away from labor, so it could not deal with industry on a fair basis.', ""Do you know how that came about? That came about, because two-thirds of the people in 1946 decided that they did not have an interest in their Government, and two-thirds of them didn't vote. Most laboringmen stayed away from the polls in 1946--and see what they got! They got the Taft-Hartley Act."", ""Now, I am advising you, as I have advised every audience to whom I have spoken in these United States, that your duty--you owe a duty to the Government, because the Government is yours, when you exercise that power to vote. And if you don't vote on November the 2d, and you send back an 81st Congress under the same leadership that the 80th Congress had, you will be in some fix sure enough--because the Republicans have already said what they are going to do to labor, if they get control of the Government."", 'Now, one of the laws which was passed in that period of Democratic administrations was the minimum wage law. That minimum wage law was intended to put a floor under wages, and it put a floor of 40 cents an hour under wages. That was the Fair Labor Standards Act, and it limited the hours which could be worked to 40 hours a week, and it eliminated child labor.', 'I have been trying to get this Both Congress, ever since January 3d, 1947, when it met the first time, to raise that standard--that floor under wages--to 75 cents an hour. They refused to do that. And I thought maybe a remedy would be if I could manage it--and I can, of course--that I would like to see those Republican congressional leaders try to live in Washington on $16 a week and support a family.', 'The Democrats have believed always that the welfare of the whole people should come first, and that means that the farmers, labor, small businessmen, and everybody else in the country should have a fair share of the prosperity that goes around.', 'We have placed the farmers in the best position they have ever been in the history of the world.', 'We have placed labor in its best position it has ever been in the history of the world. And we have been against monopoly from the start.', 'Now, when farmers are prosperous, and when labor gets good wages, business is bound to be good. And that is the reason the national income is higher in this country than it has ever been before in the history of the world.', ""You know, these Republican old dealers-these fellows, these special privilege fellows--try to tell the farmers that labor is getting too much 'pay and that is the reason for the high cost of living; and they tell the laborers that the farmers are getting too much for their crops, and that is the reason for the high cost of living."", ""Well, I will tell you what the reason is: it's the fellow in between who is getting too much profit, that's what the difficulty is."", 'The income of the great corporations in 1932 was $3 billion minus, on the red side of the ledger. In 1947 it was $17 billion plus, on the right side of the ledger.', ""And the Democrats brought that about too--don't let anybody tell you anything different about that."", 'Now, I asked in this 21 point program, which I referred to in the beginning, for a housing bill. Three years ago, I asked for that housing bill. That was the bill known as the Wagner-Ellender-Taft bill. That bill was a housing bill, which was in the interests of all the people. It was mainly fixed to help low income people to clear slums and to help the cities get low-rent housing. Well, that bill was killed in the House of Representatives. And then, in 1947, it was reintroduced and it was known as the Taft-Ellender-Wagner bill--you see, they reversed it a little bit.', ""I sent message after message to the Congress to get that bill passed. Well, they didn't pass it. They passed a fake housing bill, a housing bill which was intended to build no housing. And they are trying to make you believe they 'passed a housing bill."", ""Of all the fake campaigns, this one is the tops, so far as the Republican candidate for President is concerned. He has been following me up and down this country making speeches about home and mother and unity and efficiency, and things of that kind. He won't talk about the issues, but he did let his foot slip, when he endorsed the 80th Congress. He endorsed that Congress! He said that Congress had done great things for the future of this country."", ""It has done great things for the special interests in this country. It has worked for the lobbies, the worst lobby outfits in the history of the United States have been in Washington, surrounding that 80th Congress. And they haven't done a thing that these good-for-nothing lobbies haven't asked them to do."", ""The reason they couldn't get that housing bill was because the real estate lobby was sitting by the rathole and wouldn't let it come out of the committee."", ""I asked that Congress to do something about high prices. In fact, I called them back into special session twice, and begged them with everything I had to do something about the inflationary price spiral that is going on. Oh, no, they couldn't do that. But they could pass a rich man's tax bill, a tax bill that benefited the fellow at the top income bracket, but didn't do the poor boys any good."", ""I want to show you why they passed that bill. I will read you one of their campaign documents, which is a record of what the Republicans believe in. Now, that rich man's tax bill, which I vetoed three times-and they had to pass it three times before they could make a law out of it--gave a fellow who was getting $60 a week a saving of about a $1.58 a week. And the price spiral has taken that all away from him, and it has gone on out through the roof, and taken some of his savings away from him, too."", 'But that same tax bill gave the fellow who was getting a $100,000 a year $16,658.44 in savings. That is four times the net salary of the President of the United States!', 'Well, you know why they did that? Here is what this thing said: ""There\'s Money in Your Pocket!""--now this is a document put out in a number of States to the Republican State Committees--""The Republican 80th Congress Reduced Your Income Tax. The following table shows your approximate savings under the new tax saving law effective May 1, 1948."" That is after I vetoed it three times.', 'Now listen to this--this is outrageous-this is one of the most terrible political documents ever I saw. Now listen to it.\' ""Do you want more of this sort of constructive--constructive--Government action? Then--use your tax savings to make a substantial investment in a Republican victory."" In other words, you fellows that are getting all these savings on this tax income thing that we gave you, send it to us so that we can spend it to beat the Democrats! That is literally what that means.', ""Now, there is another issue between me and this Congress on which we didn't agree, and that was education. There was an education bill to help the States, introduced into this Congress; and it passed the Senate. And it provided $300 million to be allocated to the States on the same basis that we allocate the road money to help build roads. But the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives wouldn't let the House vote on that bill."", ""They are not interested in whether teachers have good pay or not. They are not interested in whether the kids get a proper education or not. They don't care if there are 75 or 80 kids in one room and one teacher to look after them at a salary that is not a living wage. They are not interested in that."", 'I want to say to you that I think it is just as important to see that these children get the proper sort of place to go to school, and the proper sort of teachers to teach them, as it is to build roads for them to ride in buses over the roads to school.', ""Then I asked this Congress to do something about the health of the people of this country. I asked them for health insurance. I asked them for hospitals. You know, in this country there are two classes of people that get all the medical care that they ought to have; and that is the fellow who has got a million dollars at this end of the scale, and the fellow that hasn't got a cent at this end. But the people in the middle, the large number of people in the middle between those two classes, can't afford to go to a hospital, they can't afford to pay what it costs, sometimes; and they can't afford sometimes even to pay the doctor's bill, after they get service."", ""I wanted an insurance program that would work, so that a fellow would have a little money saved up, when it came time to pay medical and hospital bills, and the doctor and the hospital would get paid promptly. But the Republicans are against that. They say that's socialized medicine. Well, it isn't. That's just good commonsense, and some of these days we are going to get it, because the Democrats are going back in power, and we are going to see that we get it."", ""Now, my friends, I have been all over these United States from one end to another, and when I started out the song was--well, you can't win--the Democrats can't win. Ninety percent of the press is against us, but that didn't discourage me one little bit. You know, I had four campaigns here in the great State of Missouri, and I never had a metropolitan paper for me that whole time. And I licked them every time!"", 'I have been in San Diego, I have been in Boston, I have been in Seattle, I have been in Miami, I have been in New York, Chicago, and all the county seats nearly, and State capitals, and I have never had such a reception as you have given me here tonight. And I think that means something. People are waking up to the fact that this is their Government, and that they can control their Government if they get out and vote on election day. That is all they need to do.', ""When I was in New York yesterday, and the day before, I had the greatest turnout that has ever happened in that city in its history, so everybody told me--about 4 1/2 million people came out to see what I looked like, and to listen to what I had to say.. There were a million people on the streets in Chicago, and Ed Kelly told my secretary that there wouldn't be that many people in Boston, because Boston didn't have that many people in it--but there were."", 'People are waking up that the tide is beginning to roll, and I am here to tell you that if you do your duty as citizens of the greatest Republic the sun has ever shone on, we will have a Government that will be for your interests, that will be for peace in the world, and for the welfare of all the people, and not just a few.']"
