0,John F. Kennedy ,"January 02, 1960","['I am announcing today my candidacy for the Presidency of the United States.', 'The Presidency is the most powerful office in the Free World. Through its leadership can come a more vital life for our people. In it are centered the hopes of the globe around us for freedom and a more secure life. For it is in the Executive Branch that the most crucial decisions of this century must be made in the next four years--how to end or alter the burdensome arms race, where Soviet gains already threaten our very existence--how to maintain freedom and order in the newly emerging nations--how to rebuild the stature of American science and education--how to prevent the collapse of our farm economy and the decay of our cities--how to achieve, without further inflation or unemployment, expanded economic growth benefiting all Americans--and how to give direction to our traditional moral purpose, awakening every American to the dangers and opportunities that confront us.', 'These are among the real issues of 1960. And it is on the basis of these issues that the American people must make their fateful choice for their future.', 'In the past 40 months, I have toured every state in the Union and I have talked to Democrats in all walks of life. My candidacy is therefore based on the conviction that I can win both the nomination and the election.', 'I believe that any Democratic aspirant to this important nomination should be willing to submit to the voters his views, record and competence in a series of primary contests. I am therefore now announcing my intention of filing in the New Hampshire primary and I shall announce my plans with respect to the other primaries as their filing dates approach.', 'I believe that the Democratic Party has a historic function to perform in the winning of the 1960 election, comparable to its role in 1932. I intend to do my utmost to see that that victory is won.', 'For 18 years, I have been in the service of the United States, first as a naval officer in the Pacific during World War II and for the past 14 years as a member of the Congress. In the last 20 years, I have traveled in nearly every continent and country--from Leningrad to Saigon, from Bucharest to Lima. From all of this, I have developed an image of America as fulfilling a noble and historic role as the defender of freedom in a time of maximum peril--and of the American people as confident, courageous and persevering.', 'It is with this image that I begin this campaign.']"
1,John F. Kennedy ,"January 14, 1960","[""The modern presidential campaign covers every issue in and out of the platform from cranberries to creation. But the public is rarely alerted to a candidate's views about the central issue on which all the rest turn. That central issue--and the point of my comments this noon-- is not the farm problem or defense or India. It is the presidency itself."", ""Of course a candidate's views on specific policies are important, but Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft shared policy views with entirely different results in the White House. Of course it is important to elect a good man with good intentions, but Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding were both good men with good intentions; so were Lincoln and Buchanan; but there is a Lincoln Room in the White House and no Buchanan Room."", 'The history of this Nation--its brightest and its bleakest pages-- has been written largely in terms of the different views our Presidents have had of the Presidency itself. This history ought to tell us that the American people in 1960 have an imperative right to know what any man bidding for the Presidency thinks about the place he is bidding for, whether he is aware of and willing to use the powerful resources of that office; whether his model will be Taft or Roosevelt, Wilson or Harding.', 'Not since the days of Woodrow Wilson has any candidate spoken on the presidency itself before the votes have been irrevocably cast. Let us hope that the 1960 campaign, in addition to discussing the familiar issues where our positions too often blur, will also talk about the presidency itself, as an instrument for dealing with those issues, as an office with varying roles, powers, and limitations', ""During the past 8 years, we have seen one concept of the Presidency at work. Our needs and hopes have been eloquently stated--but the initiative and follow-through have too often been left to others. And too often his own objectives have been lost by the President's failure to override objections from within his own party, in the Congress or even in his Cabinet."", 'The American people in 1952 and 1956 may have preferred this detached, limited concept of the Presidency after 20 years of fast-moving, creative Presidential rule. Perhaps historians will regard this as necessarily one of those frequent periods of consolidation, a time to draw breath, to recoup our national energy. To quote the state of the Union message: ""No Congress . . . on surveying the state of the Nation, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time.""', ""Unfortunately this is not Mr. Eisenhower's last message to the Congress, but Calvin Coolidge's. He followed to the White House Mr. Harding, whose sponsor declared very frankly that the times did not demand a first-rate President. If true, the times and the man met."", 'But the question is what do the times--and the people--demand for the next 4 years in the White House?', 'They demand a vigorous proponent of the national interest--not a passive broker for conflicting private interests. They demand a man capable of acting as the commander in chief of the Great Alliance, not merely a bookkeeper who feels that his work is done when the numbers on the balance sheet come even. They demand that he be the head of a responsible party, not rise so far above politics as to be invisible--a man who will formulate and fight for legislative policies, not be a casual bystander to the legislative process.', ""Today a restricted concept of the Presidency is not enough. For beneath today's surface gloss of peace and prosperity are increasingly dangerous, unsolved, long postponed problems--problems that will inevitably explode to the surface during the next 4 years of the next administration--the growing missile gap, the rise of Communist China, the despair of the underdeveloped nations, the explosive situations in Berlin and in the Formosa Straits, the deterioration of NATO, the lack of an arms control agreement, and all the domestic problems of our farms, cities, and schools."", 'This administration has not faced up to these and other problems. Much has been said--but I am reminded of the old Chinese proverb: ""There is a great deal of noise on the stairs but nobody comes into the room.""', 'The President\'s state of the Union message reminded me of the exhortation from ""King Lear"" but goes: ""I will do such things--what they are I know not . . . but they shall be the wonders of the earth.""', 'In the decade that lies ahead--in the challenging revolutionary sixties--the American Presidency will demand more than ringing manifestoes issued from the rear of the battle. It will demand that the President place himself in the very thick of the fight, that he care passionately about the fate of the people he leads, that he be willing to serve them, at the risk of incurring their momentary displeasure.', 'Whatever the political affiliation of our next President, whatever his views may be on all the issues and problems that rush in upon us, he must above all be the Chief Executive in every sense of the word. He must be prepared to exercise the fullest powers of his office--all that are specified and some that are not. He must master complex problems as well as receive one-page memorandums. He must originate action as well as study groups. He must reopen channels of communication between the world of thought and the seat of power.', 'Ulysses Grant considered the President ""a purely administrative officer."" If he administered the overnment departments efficiently, delegated his functions smoothly, and performed his ceremonies of state with decorum and grace, no more was to be expected of him. But that is not the place the Presidency was meant to have in American life. The President is alone, at the top--the loneliest job there is, as Harry Truman has said.', 'If there is destructive dissension among the services, he alone can step in and straighten it out--instead of waiting for unanimity. If administrative agencies are not carrying out their mandate--if a brushfire threatens some part of the globe--he alone can act, without waiting for the Congress. If his farm program fails, he alone deserves the blame, not his Secretary of Agriculture.', '""The President is at liberty, both in law and conscience, to be as big a man as he can."" So wrote Prof. Woodrow Wilson. But President Woodrow Wilson discovered that to be a big man in the White House inevitably brings cries of dictatorship.', 'So did Lincoln and Jackson and the two Roosevelts. And so may the next occupant of that office, if he is the man the times demand. But how much better it would be, in the turbulent sixties, to have a Roosevelt or a Wilson than to have another James Buchanan, cringing in the White House, afraid to move.', 'Nor can we afford a Chief Executive who is praised primarily for what he did not do, the disasters he prevented, the bills he vetoed--a President wishing his subordinates would produce more missiles or build more schools. We will need instead what the Constitution envisioned: a Chief Executive who is the vital center of action in our whole scheme of Government.', 'This includes the legislative process as well. The President cannot afford--for the sake of the office as well as the Nation--to be another Warren G. Harding, described by one backer as a man who ""would when elected, sign whatever bill the Senate sent him--and not send bills for the Senate to pass."" Rather he must know when to lead the Congress when to consult it and when he should act alone.', 'Having served 14 years in the legislative branch, I would not look with favor upon its domination by the Executive. Under our government of ""power as the rival of power,"" to use Hamilton\'s phrase, Congress must not surrender its responsibilities. But neither should it dominate. However large its share in the formulation of domestic programs, it is the President alone who must make the major decisions of our foreign policy.', 'That is what the Constitution wisely commands. And even domestically, the President must initiate policies and devise laws to meet the needs of the Nation. And he must be prepared to use all the resources of his office to ensure the enactment of that legislation--even when conflict is the result.', 'By the end of his term Theodore Roosevelt was not popular in the Congress--particularly when he criticized an amendment to the Treasury appropriation which forbade the use of Secret Service men to investigate Congressmen.', 'And the feeling was mutual, Roosevelt saying: ""I do not much admire the Senate because it is such a helpless body when efficient work is to be done.""', 'And Woodrow Wilson was even more bitter after his frustrating quarrels. Asked if he might run for the Senate in 1920, he replied: ""Outside of the United States, the Senate does not amount to a damn. And inside the United States the Senate is mostly despised. They haven\'t had a thought down there in 50 years.""', ""But, however bitter their farewells, the facts of the matter are that Roosevelt and Wilson did get things done--not only through their Executive powers but through the Congress as well. Calvin Coolidge, on the other hand, departed from Washington with cheers of Congress still ringing in his ears. But when his World Court bill was under fire on Capitol Hill he sent no message, gave no encouragement to the bill's leaders, and paid little or no attention to the whole proceeding--and the cause of world justice was set back."", 'To be sure, Coolidge had held the usual White House breakfasts with congressional leaders--but they were aimed, as he himself said, at ""good fellowship,"" not a discussion of ""public business."" And at his press conferences, according to press historians, where he preferred to talk about the local flower show and its exhibits, reporters who finally extracted from him a single sentence--""I\'m against that bill""--would rush to file tongue-in-cheek dispatches claiming that: ""President Coolidge, in a fighting mood, today served notice on Congress that he intended to combat, with all the resources at his command, the pending bill . . .""', 'But in the coming months we will need a real fighting mood in the White House--a man who will not retreat in the face of pressure from his congressional leaders--who will not let down those supporting his views on the floor. Divided Government over the past 6 years has only been further confused by this lack of legislative leadership. To restore it next year will help restore purpose to both the Presidency and the Congress.', 'The facts of the matter are that legislative leadership is not possible without party leadership, in the most political sense--and Mr. Eisenhower prefers to stay above politics (although a weekly news magazine last fall reported the startling news, and I quote, that ""President Eisenhower is emerging as a major political figure""). When asked early in his first term, how he liked the ""game of politics,"" he replied with a frown that his questioner was using a derogatory phrase. ""Being President,"" he said, ""is a very great experience . . . but the word \'politics\' . . . I have no great liking for that.""', 'But no President, it seems to me, can escape politics. He has not only been chosen by the Nation--he has been chosen by his party. And if he insists that he is ""President of all the people"" and should, therefore, offend none of them--if he blurs the issues and differences between the parties--if he neglects the party machinery and avoids his party\'s leadership--then he has not only weakened the political party as an instrument of the democratic process--he has dealt a blow to the democratic process itself.', 'I prefer the example of Abe Lincoln, who loved politics with the passion of a born practitioner. For example, he waited up all night in 1863 to get the crucial returns on the Ohio governorship. When the Unionist candidate was elected, Lincoln wired: ""Glory God in the highest. Ohio has saved the Nation.""', 'But the White House is not only the center of political leadership. It must be the center of moral leadership--a ""bully pulpit,"" as Theodore Roosevelt described it. For only the President represents the national interest. And upon him alone converge all the needs and aspirations of all parts of the country, all departments of the Government, all nations of the world.', 'It is not enough merely to represent prevailing sentiment--to follow McKinley\'s practice, as described by Joe Cannon, of ""keeping his ear so close to the ground he got it full of grasshoppers."" We will need in the sixties a President who is willing and able to summon his national constituency to its finest hour--to alert the people to our dangers and our opportunities--to demand of them the sacrifices that will be necessary. Despite the increasing evidence of a lost national purpose and a soft national will, F.D.R.\'s words in his first inaugural still ring true: ""In every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory.""', 'Roosevelt fulfilled the role of moral leadership. So did Wilson and Lincoln, Truman and Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt. They led the people as well as the Government--they fought for great ideals as well as bills. And the time has come to demand that kind of leadership again.', 'And so, as this vital campaign begins, let us discuss the issues the next President will face--but let us also discuss the powers and tools with which we must face them.', 'For we must endow that office with extraordinary strength and vision. We must act in the image of Abraham Lincoln summoning his wartime Cabinet to a meeting on the Emancipation Proclamation. That Cabinet has [sic] been carefully chosen to please and reflect many elements in the country. But ""I have gathered you together,"" Lincoln said, ""to hear what I have written down. I do not wish your advice about the main matter--that I have determined for myself.""', 'And later, when he went to sign, after several hours of exhausting handshaking that had left his arm weak, he said to those present: ""If my name goes down in history, it will be for this act. My whole soul is in it. If my hand trembles when I sign this proclamation, all who examine the document hereafter will say: \'He hesitated.\'""', ""But Lincoln's hand did not tremble. He did not hesitate. He did not equivocate. For he was the President of the United States."", 'It is in this spirit that we must go forth in the coming months and years.']"
2,John F. Kennedy ,"July 15, 1960","['Governor Stevenson, Senator Johnson, Mr. Butler, Senator Symington, Senator Humphrey, Speaker Rayburn, fellow Democrats: I want to express my thanks to Governor Stevenson for his generous and heart-warming introduction.', 'It was my great honor to place his name in nomination at the 1956 Democratic Convention and I am delighted to have his support and his counsel and his advice in the coming months ahead.', 'Let me say first that I accept the nomination of the Democratic party. I accept it without reservation and with only one obligation—the obligation to devote every effort of my mind and spirit to lead our party back to victory and our nation to greatness.', 'I am grateful, too, that you have provided us with such a strong platform to stand on and to run on. Pledges which are made so eloquently are made to be kept. ""The rights of man""—the civil and economic rights essential to the human dignity of all men—are indeed our goal and are indeed our first principle. This is a platform on which I can run with enthusiasm and with conviction.', 'And I am grateful, finally, that I can rely in the coming months on many others—on a distinguished running-mate who brings unity and strength to our platform and our ticket, Lyndon Johnson—on one of the most articulate spokesmen of modern time, Adlai Stevenson—on a great fighter for our needs as a nation and a people, Stuart Symington—on my traveling companion in Wisconsin and West Virginia, Senator Hubert Humphrey—on Paul Butler, our devoted and courageous chairman—and on that fighting campaigner whose support I now welcome, President Harry Truman.', 'I feel a lot safer with all of them on my side. And I am proud of the contrast with our Republican competitors. For their ranks are so thin that not one challenger has dared to put his head up in the last twelve months.', 'I am fully aware of the fact that the Democratic party, by nominating someone of my faith, has taken on what many regard as a new and hazardous risk—new, at least, since 1928.', 'The Democratic party has once again placed its confidence In the American people, and in their ability to render a free and fair judgment and in my ability.', 'And you have, at the same time, placed your confidence in me, and in my ability to render a free, fair judgment—to uphold the Constitution and my oath of office—to reject any kind of religious pressure or obligation that might directly or indirectly interfere with my conduct of the Presidency in the national interest.', 'My record of fourteen years in supporting public education—supporting complete separation of church and state—and resisting pressure from sources of any kind should be clear by now to everyone.', 'I hope that no American—I hope that no American, considering the really critical issues facing this country, will waste his franchise and throw away his vote by voting either for me or against me solely because of my religious affiliation. It is not relevant.', 'I am telling you now what you are entitled to know: As I come before you seeking your support for the most powerful office in the free world, I am saying to you that my decisions on every public policy will be my own—as an American, a Democrat and as a free man.', 'I mention all of this only because this country faces so many serious challenges, so many great opportunities, so many burdensome responsibilities, that I hope it is to those great matters that we can address ourselves in the coming months.', ""And if this statement of mine makes it easier to concentrate on our nation's problems, then I'm glad that I have made it."", 'Under any circumstances, the victory we seek in November will not be easy. We know that in our hearts. We know that our opponents will invoke the name of Abraham Lincoln on behalf of their candidate—despite the fact that his political career has often seemed to show charity towards none and malice for all.', ""We know that it will not be easy to campaign against a man who has spoken and voted on every side of every issue. Mr. Nixon may feel that it's his turn now, after the New Deal and the Fair Deal—but before he deals, someone's going to cut the cards."", 'That ""someone"" may be the millions of Americans who voted for President Eisenhower but would balk at electing his successor. For just as historians tell us that Richard the First was not fit to fill the shoes of the bold Henry II—and that Richard Cromwell was not fit to wear the mantle of his uncle—they might add in future years that Richard Nixon did not measure up to the footsteps of Dwight D. Eisenhower.', 'Perhaps be could carry on the party policies—the policies of Nixon, and Benson, and Dirksen and Goldwater. But this nation cannot afford such a luxury. Perhaps we could afford a Coolidge following Harding. And perhaps we could afford a Pierce following Fillmore.', 'But after Buchanan this nation needed Lincoln—after Taft, we needed Wilson—and after Hoover we needed Franklin Roosevelt.', ""But we're not merely running against Mr. Nixon. Our task is not merely one of itemizing Republican failures. Nor is that wholly necessary. For the families forced from the farm do not need us to tell them of their plight. The unemployed miners and textile workers know that the decision is before them in November. The old people without medical care—the families without a decent home—the parents of children without a decent school—they all know that it's time for a change."", 'We are not here to curse the darkness. We are here to light a candle. As Winston Churchill said on taking office some twenty years ago: ""If we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future. ""', 'Today our concern must be with that future. For the world is changing. The old era is ending. The old ways will not do.', 'Abroad, the balance of power is shifting. New and more terrible weapons are coming into use. One-third of the world may be free—but one-third is the victim of a cruel repression—and the other one-third is rocked by poverty and hunger and disease.', 'Communist influence has penetrated into Asia. It stands in the Middle East, and now festers some ninety miles off the coast of Florida. Friends have slipped into neutrality—and neutrals have slipped into hostility. As our keynoter reminded us, the President who began his career by going to Korea ends it by Staying away from Japan.', 'The world has been close to War before—but now man, who survived all previous threats to his existence, has taken into his mortal hands the power to exterminate his species seven times over.', 'Here at home, the future is equally revolutionary. The New Deal and the Fair Deal were bold measures for their generations—but now this is a new generation.', 'A technological output and explosion on the farm have led to an output explosion.', 'An urban population revolution has overcrowded our schools, and cluttered our cities, and crowded our slums.', 'A peaceful revolution for human rights—demanding an end to racial discrimination in all parts of our community life—has strained at the leashes imposed by a timid executive leadership.', 'It is time, in short, for a new generation of leadership.', 'All over the world, particularly in the newer nations, young men are coming to power—men who are not bound by the traditions of the past—men who are not blinded by the old fears and hates and rivalries—young men who can cast off the old slogans and the old delusions.', ""The Republican nominee, of course, is a young man. But his approach is as old as McKinley. His party is the party of the past—the party of memory. His speeches are generalities from Poor Richard's Almanac. Their platform, made up of old left-over Democratic planks, has the courage of our old convictions. Their pledge is to the status quo—and today there is no status quo."", 'For I stand here tonight facing west on what was once the last frontier. From the lands that stretch 3,000 miles behind us, the pioneers gave up their safety, their comfort, and sometimes their lives to build our new West.', 'They were not the captives of their own doubts, nor the prisoners or their own price tags. They were determined to make the new world strong and free—an example to the world to overcome its hazards and its hardships, to conquer the enemies that threatened from within and without.', 'Some would say that those struggles are all over—that all the horizons have been explored—that all the battles have been won—that there is no longer an American frontier.', 'But I trust that no one in this assemblage would agree with that sentiment. For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won. And we stand today on the edge of a new frontier—the frontier of the Nineteen Sixties; the frontier of unknown opportunities and perils; the frontier of unfulfilled hopes and unfilled threats', ""Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom promised our nation a new political and economic framework. Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal promised security and succor to those in need. But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer to the American people, but what I intend to ask of them. It appeals to their pride. It appeals to our pride, not our security—it holds out the promise of more sacrifice instead of more security."", 'The New Frontier is here, whether we seek it or not. Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace end war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.', 'It would be easier to shrink from that New Frontier, to look to the safe mediocrity of the past, to be lulled by good intentions and high rhetoric—and those who prefer that course should not vote for me or the Democratic party.', 'But I believe that the times require imagination and courage and perseverance. I\'m asking each of you to be pioneers toward that New Frontier. My call is to the young in heart, regardless of age—to the stout in spirit, regardless of party—to all who respond to the scriptural call: ""Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be dismayed. ""', 'For courage, mot complacency, is our need today; leadership, not salesmanship. And the only valid test of leadership is the ability to lead, and lead vigorously. A tired nation, said David Lloyd George, is a Tory nation—and the United States today cannot afford to be either tired or Tory.', 'There may be those who wish to hear more—more promises to this group or that—more harsh rhetoric about the men in the Kremlin as a substitute for policy—more assurances of a golden future, where taxes are always low and the subsidies are always high. But my promises are in the platform that you have adopted. Our ends will not be won by rhetoric, and we can have faith in the future only if we have faith in ourselves.', 'For the harsh facts of the matter are that we stand at this frontier at a turning-point of history. We must prove all over again to a watching world as we sit on a most conspicuous stage whether this nation, conceived as it is with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives, can compete with the single-minded advance of the Communist system.', ""Can a nation organized and governed such as ours endure? That is the real question. Have we the nerve and the will? Can we carry through in an age where we will witness not only new breakthroughs in weapons of destruction, but also a race for mastery of the sky and the rain, the ocean and the tides, the far side of space, and the inside of men's minds?"", 'That is the question of the New Frontier. That is the choice that our nation must make—a choice that lies not merely between two men or two parties, but between the public interest and private comfort—between national greatness and national decline—between the fresh air of progress and the stale, dank atmosphere of ""normalcy""—between dedication or mediocrity.', 'All mankind waits upon our decision. A whole world looks to see what we shall do. And we cannot fail that trust; and we cannot fail to try.', 'It has been a long road from the first snowy day in New Hampshire many months ago to this crowded convention city. Now begins another long journey, taking me into your cities and homes across the United States. Give me your help, and your hand, and your voice. Recall with me the words of Isaiah:', '""They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary.""', 'As we face the coming great challenge, we too, shall wait upon the Lord and ask that He renew our strength. Then shall we be equal to the test. Then we shall not be weary. Then we shall prevail.', 'Thank you.']"
3,John F. Kennedy ,"July 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. This is Senator Jackson of the State of Washington, who is chairman of the Democratic Party, who is visiting us in Cape Cod. I am afraid the weather reminds him of his own State.', 'I do want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Vice President on his nomination. He an I have been in the Congress for 14 years. We came to the House of Representatives on the same day and both served on the Labor Committee, and I therefore congratulate him on his nomination and on the support he has achieved from his own party.', 'If the reports are correct that Mr. Lodge is going to be the Vice President - he is a resident from this State. He is a very able public servant and, therefore, I know that if he is chosen by the Republican Party, the Democrats will have a vigorous fight in the fall.', 'QUESTION. What do you think will be the main issue in the campaign?', 'KENNEDY. I think that both parties in their platforms, though naturally I prefer our platform, have committed themselves to great goals - the strengthening of the United States, the improvement of economic security for our citizens, the improvement of American agriculture. I think in their platforms both parties have set these goals. I think the question is which party by its record in the Congress, by the record of its administrations in the past, really has evidenced a true commitment to the program of economic growth, to the needs of our older citizens, to assistance to education, to do something about American agriculture, to improve American security, to strengthen our Armed Forces, to assist the underdeveloped world. I think that the question is whether, based on the record, whether we can do the job or whether the Republican Party can do the job. I think we can.', 'QUESTION. Last night Tom Dewey charged that you once said that the President should apologize to Khrushchev over the U-2 incident. Have you any comment on that?', ""KENNEDY. No, I didn't say that. I said I thought at the time it would have been better for the President to express regret at the crash on Soviet territory rather than putting out a lie, as we did, which was later proved to be a lie before world opinion. However, I don't really mind Mr. Dewey. I perhaps have had worse things said about me by Democrats, and I therefore feel it's all proper and, in addition, Mr. Dewey's record as a political prophet is not without some blemish."", 'QUESTION. Senator, what do you propose to do to improve the international situation?', ""KENNEDY. I think we ought to strengthen the armed forces. I don't know whether it's going to be possible for us to appropriate an additional amount of money in the special session of Congress. I hope to talk about that with Senator Johnson tomorrow. Senator Jackson is a member of the Armed Services Committee and has done a great deal of work on that. I think he would agree, and he said so on many occasions on the Senate floor, that we should do it. I don't think we should wait until next year. I am not satisfied with the relative position of the United States vis-a-vis the Soviet Union and the Chinese in military strength. We have seen the great developments in the Polaris in recent days, but we only have a limited amount of Polarises that will be available in 1961 and 1962. I think this program, the commitment which we have made to maintain an airborne alert - all these will require additional funds. I hope it will be possible for us to do it in this session of the Congress. If not, we will have to do it in January."", 'Senator JACKSON. I think too that it should be pointed out that the Polaris program was accelerated by the Democrats in the Congress and the additional funds provided for this program and the stepping up of that effort was above and beyond the requests submitted by the President of the United States, and I think this is indeed an example of the kind of constructive record in the field of national security that the Democrats have established in the past several days - a constructive record of constructive criticism.', 'QUESTION. Senator, do you have any comment on the analysis that President Eisenhower gave tonight on the defense posture of the United States?', ""KENNEDY. I don't think that there is any doubt that today the strength of the United States in comparison to that of our adversary is certainly equal - in some areas it may even be greater. The question is whether the relative rate of growth of the United States in comparison to the Soviet Union and the Communist world is greater. I believe that by 1961-62-63, unless the United States takes immediate action, that there is danger that we will slip into a position. When Governor Rockefeller has said this very precisely in recent days - that we will slip into a position where we will not be able to carry out a second strike. Now I don't think there is any doubt that the belligerent and bellicose attitude displayed by the Communists in recent days and weeks is because they believe that the balance of power is shifting in their direction. And as the next President of the United States must negotiate over Berlin, and he must negotiate over other questions, and because I believe we should meet our commitments, I believe we should make a greater effort in the field of national defense. If we are wrong, then perhaps we will have appropriated unnecessary money. But if we are right, and the administration is wrong, then the security of the United States will be threatened."", 'QUESTION. Do you feel there is a difference between the general attitude that President Eisenhower has taken toward defense spending and the position that Mr. Nixon and Mr. Rockefeller have taken?', ""KENNEDY. I think there is a substantial difference between the position which Mr. Rockefeller and the administration have taken. Mr. Rockefeller, in his statement of a month ago, called for an expenditure of additional money this year. He gave the figure of $3 billion for defense. He has indicated in recent days that he believes that should be done. I don't think that is the administration's position."", 'QUESTION. Did anything happen at the Republican Convention either in the platform or in the agreement with Governor Rockefeller causing you to make any changes in the campaign plans you have already made?', ""KENNEDY. No, this is going to be a hard-fought campaign. I do believe that the Democratic platform played a major role in improving the Republican platform. In addition, I do think that the concessions made to Governor Rockefeller on Friday night at the last minute improved the Republican platform. But the question is why it was necessary for Governor Rockefeller to threaten a floor fight if he did not have his views accepted on national defense and economic security and civil rights, and it was only by that threat that the Republican platform committee was persuaded to take a more liberal stand. I think that Mr. Rockefeller has been quieted, but I do believe that the issue still remains before the American people - which party is really committed to these goals. I don't doubt Mr. Rockefeller's commitment, I do doubt the commitment of the Republican Party."", 'QUESTION. The Vice President has suggested you ought to take up civil rights during the August session. Do you think that would be a good time to pass some of the platform promises?', ""KENNEDY. I think that whenever we can successfully move in expanding civil rights we ought to do so. As you know, a good deal of the Democratic platform called for an affirmative executive action. I think that if the Vice President can persuade the administration to do that, we should do it. We do have 3 weeks. Quite obviously it will be an extended debate. But if there is a determination by the Republicans to join in that, then I think that, perhaps, action can be taken. But I don't want to mislead those who believe in civil rights, as I do, by thinking that we can provide for the entire platform in 3 weeks when in the period of 8 years we have been only able to take care of the matter of voting. This is a serious matter; it requires executive action and congressional action, and it's going to require a substantial effort in both the House and Senate. Whether we can do that in 3 weeks is a matter which I will discuss with Senator Johnson tomorrow."", 'QUESTION. You mentioned Mr. Rockefeller several times. Do you think that the Republican ticket of Nixon and Lodge is the strongest one they could have found?', ""KENNEDY. Well, I didn't try to draw their ticket. I think that Mr. Lodge is a very able figure. He comes from Massachusetts. He and I have met on occasion and I think he is a formidable opponent."", 'QUESTION. Speakers at the Republican Convention indicated that during the campaign there is going to be a lot of stress made on charges that you are immature. Is there any one main point you expect to be aiming at Vice President Nixon?', ""KENNEDY. I think that the position which the Republicans are taking on my candidacy, I don't criticize. Mr. Nixon and I have been in the Congress for 14 years. I think the real issue is: Which party and which candidate is committed to these goals? Which has demonstrated it by his past record, not merely by a platform compromise, but by his record? I think that that is the real issue: Which candidate, which party understands the sixties and the problems we are going to face, which is ready to move forward, and which wants to stand still? I think that is the question that is going to be before us, not the relative age of Mr. Nixon and myself."", 'QUESTION. President Eisenhower has been a pretty popular president, as you know, by the vote he rolled up in 1956. How much of a factor do you expect him to be in this campaign?', 'KENNEDY. I think he is very helpful to Mr. Nixon.', 'Senator JACKSON. He has also demonstrated, however, his ability to extend his popularity is limited to himself. We have had three Democratic Congresses during his administration.', 'KENNEDY. Well, none of us are able to elect other people, unfortunately in this country. But I do think he is a help to Mr. Nixon. I would be glad to have his cooperation but I think he is already committed. (Laughter). Thank you very much.']"
4,John F. Kennedy ,"August 05, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for being kind enough to come here this morning and to give me a chance to talk with you. This is really the first speech I have made since the Democratic Convention, but I was anxious to come here to New York today to talk with you.', 'I think that you have a most important role to play in the coming election. I do not think of this election as merely a political exercise. Rather, I see it as an opportunity for Americans to make their choice as to which road this country should take in the coming months and years. I think that this election will give us an opportunity to re-assess the problems which face us. It will give the Congress and the next President an opportunity to go before the people in the early months of January, February, and March of 1961, with the support of the American people and attempt, with new vigor and vitality, to carry out new programs and move in new directions.', 'The problems which the foreign language press primarily face are problems which they have faced for many years. All Americans are immigrants. Some have come in more recent years than others. The function, I feel, of the foreign language press is really threefold-', 'First, to make it easier for those who are newly arrived in the United States, for those who have arrived at a point in their life here in this country where they find it somewhat difficult to move immediately into the mainstream of American life. The contact which you bring them with their older life, I think, is most significant. In this way you serve as a bridge between the new life and the old life. You serve as a method of transition. You do not merely keep alive the old life - you also bring them in contact with the new life.', 'Secondly, you help maintain in this country a very valuable national asset and that is the connection with the past; that is the connection with foreign languages. The knowledge of foreign languages, the knowledge of foreign cultures, the knowledge of foreign history, is really the most important asset that we, as a nation, have in our relations with countries abroad.', 'When an American goes to Poland, he comes not as a stranger - he comes, even if he is not of Polish extraction himself, and I have seen this on the various occasions that I visited Poland. He comes as a friend, because nearly every Pole has a relative living in the United States. And, what is true in Poland is true in Estonia and in Latvia and Lithuania and Czechoslavakia and Hungary and the Balkans and in Yugoslavia and in all of these countries, who in the last 50 or 60 years have sent so many of their fellow countrymen to the United States.', 'An American is not a stranger. He is, in many cases, to them a fellow countryman. That is a tremendous asset. This forms a great well of friendship and I think that the foreign language press, so-called, really helps keep alive that most important link.', 'In addition, I think the foreign language press can bring home to the American people the problems of those who are immigrants, the problems of those who have newly arrived, the problems of the countries from where these Americans have sprung.', ""I don't think that there is any doubt that one of the most powerful forces for the correction of two great policies are our immigration policies and our policy toward the captive nations. I think this has been due to the vigor and the constancy and the perseverance of the foreign language press - by keeping alive the issue of the captive nations, by reminding us of the desire of these people to be free, by reminding us that this is unfinished business, before the American people and before the bar of world opinion. I think it has served the cause of freedom."", 'Secondly, by its constant fight to try to improve American immigration laws, I think the foreign language press has performed a notable service to the people of this country - not to the immigrants - to the people of this country. Not to the countries abroad who are adversely affected by our immigration policy but to the people of this country because in the last analysis, we are the ones who suffer. If we present, in this area an image to the world of hostility, of saying that one country is better than another, by writing that into our national immigration laws, I think we do a disservice to our people and to our country.', 'So, I am here today to meet you, to say that I think you performed valuable functions in the past and to say also that you have great responsibilities to meet in the future.', 'I hope that I will have an opportunity to work in a position of influence to meet some of these problems. I hope that it will be possible to be elected President, but whether I am elected President or continue in the Senate, these are great problems for the United States.', 'The idea of a perfect Union has been one which has inspired this country from our earliest days. It is not achieved - and in a sense probably it is a goal to which we will always be working to reach - but it is a goal which is worthy of our effort. You play a most important role, as there is really a tie between Europe and the United States, between Latin America and the United States, between Africa and the United States, between the Middle East and the United States and, we hope more in the future, between Asia and the United States.', 'In a world where peace is our great endeavor and where we are fighting continually for the good will of all mankind, I think that you serve on the frontlines of that struggle.']"
5,John F. Kennedy ,"August 10, 1960","['Today we begin debate upon the minimum wage bill known as the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1960.', 'The bill has two major purposes. First, it will raise the minimum wage now received by 2 1/2 million workers from $1.10 to $1.25 an hour. Second, it will extend the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act to 5 million additional employees, chiefly in large-scale interstate retail and service industries, thereby guaranteeing these employees a fair minimum wage and a just premium for overtime.', 'Conscience and good business sense join in demanding the enactment of this measure. The bill will extend to the lowest paid workers - to 3 1/2 million men and women and their families - a fairer opportunity to shave our high standard of living. To pass them by - to water down the help they need - or merely assume that prosperity at the top will someday reach them - shocks the conscience of those who care.', 'The increases in purchasing power resulting from a higher minimum wage will help to restore consumer demand required to put our idle industrial capacity back to work. The elimination of unfair competition based upon substandard wages will protect fairminded employers anxious to maintain fair labor standards.', 'The pending bill is the result of long and careful study. The Labor Subcommittee of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held hearings on 10 days, in which it beard 77 witnesses. The relevant bills were reviewed in executive sessions in the course of which all members of the subcommittee made helpful contributions. The committee bill embodies a wide consensus of opinion among Senators from both sides of the aisle. The minority report is signed by only three Senators.', 'The full extent of the changes to be made in the present law is summarized in a memorandum which I ask unanimous consent to have printed after my remarks in the Record. At this point I desire to speak only of the principal provisions.', '', 'The bill raises the minimum wage applicable to employees now covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act in three stages: To $1.15 an hour, effective January 1, 1961, to $1.20 an hour on January 1, 1962, and, on January 1, 1963, to $1.25 an hour.', 'In one sense, this is not new legislation. The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in 1938 in order-', '\n  to protect this Nation from the evils and dangers resulting from wages too low to buy the bare necessities of life and from long hours of work injurious to health.\n', 'When the original 40-cent minimum became inadequate Congress raised it to 75 cents and later to $1 an hour. Now economic progress again requires a higher wage if we are to carry out the central purpose. An increase from $1 to $1.25 an hour is necessary to put those wage earners who earn the minimum in the same position, relative to other segments of the economy, that they occupied after the 1955 amendment. Thus the present bill merely extends to lower paid workers the gains already achieved by more fortunate groups through increased productivity and collective bargaining.', 'Just a few figures make the point clear. In 1955, when the present $1 minimum was established, the average hourly earnings of employees in manufacturing industries were $1.88. By March 1960, average hourly earnings had increased 41 cents, or 22 percent. To maintain the same cents per hour differential, the statutory minimum would have to be raised to $1.41. To maintain even the same relative position, it would have to go immediately to $1.22 an hour instead of the $1.15 recommended by the committee. A small part of the change in average hourly earnings is probably the result of shifts into higher paid types of employment; but the comparison demonstrates beyond doubt that failure to enact the increases recommended by the committee would remit 2 1/2 million wage earners to a declining status.', 'The need for action is the more acute because of the sharp increase in the number of employees dependent for a fair wage upon congressional action. In 1955 roughly half a million workers covered by the act were receiving either the statutory minimum wage or an hourly rate no more than 5 cents higher. The latest figures available show that 1 1/3 million workers covered by the act are receiving either the statutory minimum or a rate no more than 5 cents higher. This is 2 1/2 times the earlier figure.', 'Consider the meaning of this trend to the workers affected. Since 1955, there has been a 15-percent rise in productivity. They shared none of this gain. There has also been a 10-percent rise in the cost of living. The workers dependent upon the minimum wage have therefore suffered a 10-percent decline in real earnings - in their ability to provide food, clothes, homes, and health for their families.', 'Let me be still more precise. There are 35,000 workers in the apparel industry in New York City alone who depend upon the Fair Labor Standards Act for a fair minimum wage. The New York City Department of Welfare regards $74 a week as the minimum budget for health and safety for a family of four - a man and wife and two children. Working the standard 40 hours, a man would earn only $40 a week at the preset minimum - $34 short of the pay-check needed. Even the proposed minimum of $1.25 would leave his earnings $24 short of the sum required to support his family. In some families more than one person is employed; but even if the man and wife both worked full time every week, the present statutory minimum would hardly cover the budget; expenses rise when both adults are working.', 'The proposed increases will not injure business firms. They are not inflationary. They will not cause significant unemployment. If the dangers fancied by the minority were real I would join them in opposing the measure. The welfare of the business community is essential to a prosperous economy. To drive firms out of business or to force them to curtail operations would defeat our very purpose. But the same arguments were presented against minimum wage legislation in 1938, 1949, and 1955. History disproved them. On each of these three occasions increases for sharper than those we propose today were put into effect without injury to employees, inflation, or unemployment. The fancied dangers were never realized.', 'The experience after the 1955 amendments is the most instructive because their impact is traced in a careful study prepared by the U.S. Department of Labor. The Department found that the increase from 75 cents to $1 an hour did not substantially affect any of the standard statistical series measuring trends in hours of work, employment, or consumer prices. The impact was too small to be discernible in relation to overall economic activity.', 'More detailed study of 15 low-wage industries showed that employment rose in some industries after the $1 minimum was put into effect and declined in others. Evidently the change in the minimum wage was not a determinative factor. In order to obtain a still broader view, the study was extended in six communities so as to include both covered and noncovered industries. During the 2 months following the statutory increase employment in the covered industries rose in one, fell in two, and was virtually unchanged in the others. These changes in employment can hardly be attributed to the statutory increase but it is interesting to note that 3 years after the statutory increase employment in the same communities had risen 20 percent in the industries subject to the act and only 14 percent in those outside the statute.', ""In short, the Labor Department's study fully supports the conclusion that the 1955 minimum wage increase did not result in any substantial changes for the Nation in either price levels or employment."", 'The increases now proposed can have no greater impact. In 1955 the increase was 25 cents an hour, or an average of 15 cents for each employee directly affected. In 1960 the increase will be only 15 cents, or an average of 9 cents for each employee directly affected. Put another way, the 1955 increase raised the statutory minimum 33 1/3 percent, whereas the 1960 increase will be only 15 percent. The increase in the total wage bill will also be markedly smaller. Since the 1955 increase was readily absorbed by the economy, we are bound to conclude that it can now absorb the smaller 1960 increase. The 5-cents-an-hour increases in 1960 and 1961 are no larger than might be expected in collective bargaining.', 'The exaggerated fear of adversely affecting costs, prices and employment apparently results from the fallacious assumption that an increase in the Statutory minimum requires corresponding wage increases all up and down the line. Secretary Mitchell disposed of this argument in his testimony before the House Labor Committee.', '\n  * * * as to the allegation that there is an upward, forward movement immediately corresponding to the wage increase, that experience has shown that this does not happen.\n', 'Any increase in the minimum would undoubtedly require some adjustment of the wages of other employees of the same business even though they earn more than the statutory minimum, but the increases would taper off rather quickly. As I pointed out earlier, since 1955 average hourly earnings have increased much faster than the statutory minimum. Generally speaking, wages at the bottom of the scale can be brought up to their old relationship without unduly narrowing differentials.', 'It would be naive to deny that there will be no dislocations. In a few instances there may be an undesirable compression of the wage structure. But, fairly read, both history and the available studies show that the increases can be absorbed without damage to business, inflationary price increases, or unemployment.', '', 'The committee bill would extend to 5 million additional wage earners the guarantees of a fair minimum wage and a reasonable premium for overtime employment.', 'The major expansion of coverage brings under the act retail and service establishments whose annual gross sales exceed $1 million. Establishments grossing less than $1 million a year will not be affected. They will also continue to benefit from the present section 13(a) (2) exemption. I emphasize the point because there has been widespread misunderstanding. The bill does not touch ordinary inns, hotels, restaurants, or motels in any part of the country. For example, a motel owner who charged $15 a unit and maintained 180 units which he rented every night of the year would be too small for the bill to affect him.\nLikewise, the bill does not apply to the independent grocer or druggist, the country store, or even the independent department stores and supermarkets found in most American cities. Ninety-seven percent of all retail enterprises would not be affected.', 'We are concerned only with the large metropolitan department stores and vast chains which now dominate the retail industry. Their outlets spread through many States. The management is centralized. Prices are often uniform. Goods are purchased in large quantities from all over the Nation often at prices which cannot be obtained by independent merchants. Their operations depend upon the channels of interstate commerce. And where hotels and other service establishments are large enough to gross a million dollars their conditions of employment also become matters of national import.', 'It is grossly inaccurate to describe these million dollar enterprises as local businesses which ought not to be regulated by the Federal Government. In 1938 the point was doubtful, but the constitutional power of Congress has now been established. Many Federal statutes already apply to such large retail enterprises - the pure food and drug laws the Wool Products Labeling Act, the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the National Labor Relations Act. The NLRB conducts elections among the employees whom this bill would bring under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Their employers obtain Federal assistance against boycotts and picketing. Last year their trade associations were outspoken lobbyists for additional Federal restrictions upon the rights to strike and picket. At the present session some of them are actively sponsoring Federal legislation for resale price maintenance. Bringing under the Fair Labor Standards Act the employees of retail and service establishments grossing $1 million in annual sales conforms the law to otherwise uniform pattern of social legislation. There is no merit to the argument that the bill changes the balance between State and Federal authority.', 'The extension of coverage to retail and service establishments which gross $1 million annually will not even indirectly affect smaller businesses. Experience shows that a high wage employer can move into a community with relatively little effect upon the wage scale of smaller local industries unless there is a shortage of qualified labor. Similarly, the wage scales of large metropolitan department stores and multiunit chains will exert no great influence upon smaller businesses.', ""The other major change in coverage will correct a historic accident. In 1937 and 1938, there was grave uncertainty concerning the constitutional power of the Congress to enact a minimum wage law. Various constitutional theories were suggested. The Senate bill followed one course; the House took another. The conference report based coverage on the work of the individual employee. Under the present law, therefore, a worker is covered only if he himself is engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. The nature of the employer's business is irrelevant. Thus, there may be two employees, working side by side in the employ of the same employer, one of whom is protected by the statutory minimum wage and one who is not. For example, a wholesaler's order clerk who typed orders for goods purchased out of State would be entitled to the statutory minimum, but the billing clerk at the next desk who typed bills for customers inside the State would lack the same protection. The distinction is arbitrary and capricious."", 'So far as I am aware, the Fair Labor Standards Act is the only statute under which coverage depends upon the work of the individual employee. The supposed constitutional justification no longer exists. Accordingly, the committee bill puts coverage upon an establishment basis, as under other labor legislation.', 'The change will greatly simplify enforcement of the statute. Employers and the officials of the Wage and Hour Division will be able to determine the status of all employees in an establishment without checking the individual work of every employee. The inequity between employees in the same establishment will be abolished.', 'The justification for applying the proposed new minimum wage to the newly covered employees is the same as the reasoning which supports the increase in the minimum. The employees have the same needs. Their wages have fallen behind average hourly earnings to the same, and possibly a greater, extent than the wages of employees earning the statutory minimum. They are equally entitled to share in economic progress.', 'The fiscal burden of an inadequate minimum wage law lies upon the community, and thus upon every taxpayer. In New York City, 44 percent of the families to whom relief is extended include those who are wage earners but whose incomes are inadequate. An economic burden also lies upon competitors whose ability to pay a just wage is frustrated by unfair, low-wage competition. But the burden which should concern us most lies upon the American conscience. We can no longer tolerate growing patches of poverty and injustice in America - substandard wages, unemployment, city slums, inadequate medical care, inferior education and the sad plight of migratory workers. The enactment of this bill is only one step, but an essential step forward, as we cross this frontier to grasp the high opportunities which face the Nation.']"
6,John F. Kennedy ,"August 14, 1960","['I am grateful to you, Mrs. Roosevelt, for allowing me to be here today. For I come to Hyde Park not to instruct but to learn.', 'And I think that we can all agree that Eleanor Roosevelt is a true teacher. Her very life teaches a love of truth and duty and courage. The wide world is her neighborhood. All its people are her daily concern. She is frank; she is outspoken; she is forthright - and I know she always will be.', ""A visit to Hyde Park is both a pilgrimage and a challenge. We journey here to pay tribute to one of America's most honored leaders. And we find here a challenge to renew the march toward those high goals of peace, and freedom, and a decent life for all men, to which he dedicated his life."", '""I occasionally go back home to Hyde Park,"" said Franklin Roosevelt, ""so that I can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a whole."" Today, in the turmoil and conflict of our daily lives, we, too, can pause here a moment to think about the man whose home this was - and about the Nation which he led to greatness.', 'Standing on this quiet lawn - this spacious and soothing scene - it is difficult to recall the furious battles which were fought by the man who lies here in honored glory - the conflicts which he waged; the victories which he won.', 'Yet we who lived while he governed can, here at Hyde Park, still hear the echoes of those heroic struggles; the struggle to rescue America from poverty and economic collapse, the struggle to build a new America where all could live in dignity, the struggle to secure freedom against the ominous armed advance of tyranny and oppression, and, the last, the most arduous, the unending struggle, the struggle which his wife still steadfastly carries on, the struggle to build a world of free and peaceful nations.', 'If these battles were nobly fought, if the America of Franklin Roosevelt had a rendezvous with destiny, it met that rendezvous only because it was guided to its destination by a great leader of men.', 'Today we commemorate one of those battles - the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935 - the most important single piece of social welfare legislation in the history of this country. It was 25 years ago this very day that Franklin Roosevelt could say, after a long and arduous struggle: ""Today a hope of many years\' standing is in large part fulfilled""; and with that he signed his name and social security became law.', 'For millions of Americans, with that one stroke of the pen, their insecurity and fear were transformed into hope - their poverty and hunger were transformed into a decent life - their economic degradation was transformed into a chance to live out their days in the dignity and peace they had so richly earned.', 'But the job which Franklin Roosevelt set out to do in 1935 is not yet done. That opening battle was won - but the war against poverty and degradation is not yet over. And no one realized this more than Franklin Roosevelt himself. ""This law,"" he said, 25 years ago today as he signed it, ""represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but which is by no means complete."" We are here at Hyde Park today - not merely to commemorate the cornerstone but to help complete the edifice.', 'It is fitting that we celebrate this anniversary. It is essential, from time to time, that we pay tribute to past greatness and historic achievement. But we would betray the very cause we honor if we did not now look to the future as well. We would be unfaithful to the man we honor if we did not look beyond his work to the new challenges - the new problems - the new work which lies ahead. For the last public message he ever wrote, on the morning of his death, closed with these words to the American people: ""The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.""', 'This is not 1935 - or 1945. This is 1960 - and today there are 16 million Americans past the age of 65; 3 out of every 5 of these - more than 9 1/2 million people must struggle to survive on an income of less than $1,000 a year; 3 million more receive less than $2,000 from all sources combined; and those who draw social security receive an average check of $72 a month which - in 1960 dollars - does not begin to do the job.', 'With the cost of living continually spiraling upward, with the cost of basic items continually rising - $72 a month or $1,000 a year cannot pay for even the most basic rudiments of a decent and dignified old age. And, even worse, the substandard incomes - the poverty and neglect - dissipate and destroy the morale, the self-respect, the personal pride of our older citizens.', ""These are shocking and shameful figures. They unmistakably reveal the dismal poverty, the hardship and the lonely want which millions of Americans must face as they near retirement - they describe the meager and humiliating reward which this, the richest country on earth, gives to those who have contributed to our country's strength."", 'This poverty and hardship becomes heartbreak and despair when illness threatens No costs have increased more rapidly in the last decade than the cost of medical care. And no group of Americans has felt the impact of these skyrocketing costs more than our older citizens. Almost 20 percent of all those on social security must use one-quarter to one-half of their meager annual incomes for medical expenses alone. Those over 65 suffer from chronic diseases at almost twice the rate of our younger population - they spend more than twice as many days restricted to bed - and they must visit a doctor twice as often. And even these impressive figures do not tell us of the uncounted thousands who suffer from lack of needed medical care - from lack of vital drugs - and of hospitalization simply because they cannot afford to pay the bills.', 'Of course, some of those who are now uncared for can get free health care. But such public assistance is often painstakingly slow, the tests for giving it are often rigid and unrealistic. The care itself is often impersonal and inadequate.', 'And even more important - thousands of our older citizens would rather endure pain and suffering than rely on public charity. And they should not have to ask for charity.', ""This story is a living story, not merely statistics. It is deeply burned into every city and town, every hospital and clinic, every neighborhood and rest home in America', whenever our older citizens live out their lives in want and despair under the shadow of illness."", 'You have seen it in your States - I have seen it in my travels across all 50 States. It is a sight engraved upon our minds and hearts, but it is a sight which, together, we can wipe from the face of this great rich land forever.', 'First, we must enact immediately an adequate, comprehensive plan to enable our older citizens to meet their pressing medical needs. Such a plan, a soundly financed program without a destructive, degrading means test - based on the tried and tested operation of the social security system, is now before the Congress; and it can - and should - and must be enacted this year.', 'But I also say to you that this bill will be - like the original social security law - only a single stone in an unfinished structure. It is an important start toward meeting the health problems of our older citizens - but it is only a start. And the coming years will require even more of us.', 'Second, we must broaden and extend the current scale of social security benefits, which have barely kept pace with the rising cost of living. We must devise machinery that will enable us to keep ahead of rising prices - so that human welfare will not be cruelly dissipated by inflation.', 'Third, we must raise the amount which retired persons can earn and still be eligible for social security benefits - so that our older people can supplement their meager benefits with meaningful outside employment.', ""Fourth, we must provide more than benefits. Our older people must receive not only their earned reward for their contributions to America's past - they must be allowed to share in the great task of building America's future. Today too many of our older people who can work - who want to work - cannot find work. Their abilities and skills - their experience and wisdom and knowledge - are wastefully ignored, by a country which desperately needs their services."", ""We must embark on a great program to use the skills of older Americans - through changes in Government hiring policies - through expanded employment services - and through an intensive education of our Nation's employers to the immense value of this great reservoir of unused talents."", 'And, since new work for our older citizens will often require new training, we must expand vocational training facilities to ease their change to new job opportunities.', 'Fifth, we must provide adequate housing for the aged - housing which will be an integral part of the community in which they live. For this we may need a new program of loans, and new incentives to builders to construct homes which meet their special requirements.', 'Sixth, if we adopt these programs of housing and employment, and construct a system of adequate benefit - then we can move to reduce the number of those who must depend on public assistance, thus increasing the benefits to those who still need assistance.', 'Seventh, we must expand our basic research into the causes and prevention of those chronic illnesses and diseases which are associated with advancing age.', 'Eighth, we must do more for the widows and children who survive. Today, the widow whose savings are gone - who is forced to live on an income even less than her husband\'s retirement benefits - is truly the ""forgotten woman"" of social security.', 'We must remedy this shameful defect in our law.', 'And social security is just one of the many, vital battles for human welfare which are now being waged. I come to you from a Congress where we are fighting to secure a decent, minimum wage for millions of Americans. This, too, is an important and arduous struggle. And many other such struggles lie ahead.', 'To meet these urgent responsibilities will take determination, and dedication, and hard work. But I believe that America is ready to move from self-indulgence to self-denial. It will take will and effort. But I believe that America is ready to work. It will take vision and boldness. But I believe that America is still bold.', 'The writers of the Declaration of Independence did not promise us happiness - they promised only the ""pursuit of happiness - and by this they meant fulfillment as a Nation and as human beings.', 'It is this pursuit - this endless questing - which we must now resume. There are new problems, new dangers, new horizons - and we have rested long enough. The world is changing - the perils are deepening - the irresistible march of history moves forward. We must now take the leadership in that great march - or be forever left behind.', 'And this is why we have gathered here at the home of enduring greatness - not merely to pay tribute - but to refreshen our spirits and stir our hearts for the tasks which lie ahead. We celebrate the past to awaken the future.', 'This was said for all time almost 100 years ago, by a great American standing at another graveside, at another memorial service. ""It is,"" he said, ""for us the living to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion * * * that this Nation, under God, may have a new birth of freedom.""', 'Today, in that spirit, we pay our humble tribute.']"
7,John F. Kennedy ,"August 17, 1960","['Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regard the statement made by the Senator from Pennsylvania as the most unfair, distorted, and malignant attack I have heard in 14 years in politics. I have received very recently a wire from Mr. Frank Montero, who heads the African-American Students Foundation, dated August 16 and received the 17th.', '\n  Senator Hugh Scott, of Pennsylvania, has announced in Washington earlier today that the State Department has offered $100,000 to the African-American Students Foundation, Inc., to airlift 250 east African students to the United States this September.', ""We appreciate Senator Scott's announcement of the State Department's belated offer in this matter."", 'This offer however was only made after the foundation, which had repeatedly requested help during the past 12 months and finally turned down late last month was successful in obtaining a grant of $100,000 from a private foundation. This private foundation has also agreed to provide continuing support for these students during their next 4 years in this country.', 'It is therefore regrettable that Senator Scott would attempt to reap political advantage from this nonpolitical educational program which originated out of the initiative and partnership of responsible east and central African leaders and private American citizens.', 'The fact is the State Department has repeatedly turned a cold shoulder to the airlift Africa program.', 'When an emergency situation developed and it appeared that the students would be unable to come to the United States to take advantage of the scholarships so generously offered by more than 200 American colleges and institutions, we turned to a number of private foundations and individuals for help and finally were successful in obtaining the funds.', 'On Monday of this week the State Department suddenly took interest in the project. Now that the State Department has given recognition to the urgent need to bring large numbers of African students to study in the United States, we hope these funds which they have allocated will be made immediately available to other African students on a continuing basis.', 'May I say Mr. Robinson arranged for Mr. Montero to see the Vice President in late June. The Vice President stated he was interested in the program, and I believe he was, and he referred Mr. Montero to Mr. Satterthwaite, who is Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. Mr. Satterthwaite, after considering the matter, wrote a letter to Mr. Montero, which I have here, in which he stated the State Department, because of other commitments, would not be able to participate in the airlift of these students.', 'While I was at Cape Cod I was called by Mr. Montero, who asked me if I would talk to Mr. Mboya. I did not know at that time what he wished to speak to me about. As a matter of fact, I have a copy of the letter from Mr. Satterthwaite to Mr. Robinson, in which he said:', '\n  Unfortunately, it does not appear possible to comply with either of the two proposals mentioned in your letter to the Vice President.\n', 'So the State Department felt it could not do that. In our conversation he asked if he could get help from private foundations to help them. They had private scholarships. They had raised $200,000, and they needed transportation. I said I did not know what could be done. I asked Mr. Shriver. I talked to my brother, who was a member of the foundation and also the president of the African foundation student exchange for the last 2 years, what could be done. Mr. Shriver talked to other foundations, the Phelps-Stokes, Ford, Marshall Field, and others. The foundations were committed to other programs and could not proceed. I then informed Mr. Montero that the Kennedy Foundation would do it with the understanding that we would not in any way connect the foundation with the administration of the project.', ""When Mr. Mboya was there, a press conference was held, and no mention was made of our foundation's participation. No mention was made of our foundation's participation until the first of the past week."", 'What happened was that after we saw one of the foundations and we had decided we could go ahead, some information was evidently given to somebody in the State Department from one of the members of the foundation.', 'Mr. Jim Shepley called up Mr. Montero and said he could arrange for $100,000 to be given to this program; and I have a memorandum from Mr. Frank Montero telling the events day by day.', 'On Wednesday, August 10, Mr. Montero and Mr. Scheinman came to Washington to meet with Mr. Shriver and his associates to further discuss and finally confirm the commitment. The meeting concluded in agreement that the commitment was essentially established, but that final details would be worked out and the matter completely settled in a later meeting to be held on August 15 here in Washington.', ""On Saturday, August 13, for the first time, Mr. Montero was advised by Mr. James Shepley, a representative of the Vice President's office, that the Vice President's office was again interested in the proposed airlift program. Mr. Shepley was informed by Mr. Montero that a source of private funds was available to underwrite the proposed airlift program. Mr. Shepley indicated that he had just become involved in this proposal and he hoped he could arrange such a definite offer of the cost of transportation being borne by the Government."", 'I wish to say in conclusion - I do not see any point in dragging this matter out - that the Kennedy Foundation went into this quite reluctantly. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa. I think this is a most important program. We have a good many other commitments in the foundation. It was not a matter in which we sought to be involved. Nevertheless, Mr. Mboya came to see us and asked for help, when none of the other foundations could give it, when the Federal Government had turned it down quite precisely. We felt something ought to be done. To waste 250 scholarships in this country, to waste $200,000 these people had raised, to disappoint 250 students who hoped to come to this country, it certainly seemed to me, would be most unfortunate, and so we went ahead.', 'I will say to the Senator that I think it is unfortunate that he has chosen this means of attacking me and the foundation, suggesting that we wish to spend the money improperly. There is nothing I can say to that.', 'I merely say to the Senator, whoever does this, it ought to be done. There are a good many other African students who wish to come here. If the $100,000 which Mr. Shepley was able to get from the State Department at this late date can be used beneficially to bring other students to the United States, I would be delighted to do it.']"
8,John F. Kennedy ,"August 20, 1960","['Mr. TRUMAN. Well, boys, do your stuff. What do you have on your mind? You are talking to the President of the United States who is to be.', 'QUESTION. Have you read the President ahead of you\'s new book, ""Mr. Citizen,"" Mr. Kennedy?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Yes, sir, and he also gave me a copy of it today, the author's edition."", 'Mr. TRUMAN. Thank you, Ben, for that.', 'QUESTION. What have you and the candidate accomplished this morning? Just what took place?', ""Mr. TRUMAN. We have accomplished enough to win the war, that is all. Isn't that enough?"", 'QUESTION. Mr. President, did you and Senator Kennedy talk over the things that Senator Kennedy would like you to do in the campaign, sir?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. Yes, and you will have to ask the Senator about it, and he can answer that question much better than I can.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I asked President Truman to participate actively in the campaign in his travels through the country and he said that he would.', 'QUESTION. Mr. President or Senator Kennedy or whoever would want to answer the question, is there any date or places that you could tell us about now where Mr. Truman will campaign?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. I have only one firm commitment and that is at Marion, Ind., for a Labor Day meeting on the 5th day of September, and I discussed the other proposed meetings with Senator Kennedy, and he has approved of the one in Marion, Ind.', 'QUESTION. Is it quite probable that there will be one in New York City, sir?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, yes. I asked President Truman to come to New York City, and he said he would.', 'QUESTION. Do you plan to use what is known as your ""Give \'em hell"" style?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. I never did have any ""give \'em hell"" style. I used to tell the truth on the Republicans, and they called it that. I still continue to tell the truth, and they will still think it is hell. They had two squads to follow me around, Senator, you remember, and I invited him to get on the train, and he was afraid and he could not.', 'Senator JACKSON. They have revised it again, and of course the truth does not need a squad.', 'Mr. TRUMAN. That is true.', 'QUESTION. What caused you to decide that Senator Kennedy was ready for the country?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. When the Democratic National Convention decided to nominate him for President. That is all the answer you need. The National Democratic Convention is the law for the Democratic Party. I am a Democrat and I follow the law.', 'QUESTION. On July 2, I believe you said that you thought the convention was fixed. Have you changed your opinion?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. I did not say that. I said it looked to me as if the convention was already made up the way it was supposed to go, and that is what the trouble was. And it was, and it has been done all right, and they nominated this man and I am going to support him. What are you going to do about that?', 'QUESTION. Mr. President, what is the prospect for the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in your home State of Missouri?', ""Mr. TRUMAN. They will carry Missouri by an overwhelming majority, don't you worry about that."", 'QUESTION. I would like to ask the Senator, we have been hearing of him this week as not being in the best of health. How are you feeling this morning?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am recovered.', 'QUESTION. Your voice and your sinus?', 'Senator KENNEDY. It is all right.', 'QUESTION. I am mighty glad to see you looking so well.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.', 'QUESTION. There has been some complaint by newsmen that the incumbent President does not hold news conferences often enough. If you are elected President, what will your policy be with regard to the holding of news conferences?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think it is probably a question that had better wait, but I do think it is useful to see the press, and I think that the custom has been once a week. I would think that whoever was President would see the press at least once a week.', ""Mr. TRUMAN. If you don't, they will lie on you."", 'QUESTION. Mr. President, could you tell us what you think the overriding issue is going to be in this campaign.', ""Mr. TRUMAN. There are so many of them that I can't explain them all here, and not make a political speech."", 'QUESTION. Could you name a single one?', ""Mr. TRUMAN. There are three or four of them. The principle one, I think, is the foreign policy of the United States of America. The next one is handling of the agricultural policy. You know, they quarrel about what it costs to have an agricultural policy in this country. It cost $1 billion in the last 2 years I was in office and it is now costing $6 billion. The operation of the national debt and the handling of the finances of the United States has been a disgrace to the country, and it has cost the people about $20 billion. I think those are the principal issues, and I can't speak to you for the Senator, but you know what they are because you have been there."", 'QUESTION. Would you make any recommendations to the candidate about foreign policy, any specific recommendations?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. The recommendations that I make are made on questions from the candidate for President as a result of my criticism and so you will have to ask him about that.', 'QUESTION. Would Senator Kennedy say something about that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We discussed the farm program and we talked about the Democratic platform and I think the Democratic platform on farm policy is admirable, and I support it strongly.', 'QUESTION. In that connection, did you ask the President to do anything other than participate in the speaking engagements in the campaign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is all we discussed.', 'QUESTION. Do you have any plans either in formative stages, or have you thought about asking President Truman to become official or unofficial foreign policy adviser if you are elected?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, but I think President Truman is a source of advice and counsel on all issues, including foreign policy, and that was one of the reasons I was anxious to talk to him.', 'QUESTION. Mr. President, I would like to ask you a question concerning something about which you should be an expert.', 'Mr. TRUMAN. I am an expert in nothing, Eddie, but go ahead.', 'QUESTION. The Gallup poll recently showed Vice President Nixon leading Senator Kennedy by I think it was 50 to ---', 'Senator KENNEDY. Forty-four.', 'QUESTION. I would like to have your comment.', 'Mr. TRUMAN. Do you remember a Gallup poll had showed Dewey to be 60 to 42 in 1948? That is about the same answer.', 'QUESTION. Sixty to forty-two?', ""Mr. TRUMAN. Or whatever it was. That is my viewpoint on polls. The Senator must make up his own mind on that. They don't mean a thing."", 'QUESTION. Did you discuss with Senator Kennedy how he might turn this special session of Congress to his advantage, like you appeared to do in 1948?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. He is a Member of Congress, and I am not and you will have to ask him about that.', 'QUESTION. Did that come up for discussion, sir?', '(No answer.)', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, have you asked Mr. Truman to talk on any particular issues such as the farm program or national defense?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, whatever he talks about will be appropriate.', 'QUESTION. You say that as a good Democrat, you of course will support Senator Kennedy. You told us out here before Los Angeles that you felt that Senator Kennedy was too young and inexperienced.', 'Mr. TRUMAN. I said the National Democratic Convention solved that, and that is all there is to that.', 'QUESTION. You now feel that he is?', 'Mr. TRUMAN. That is all there is to that.', 'QUESTION. Senator, you spoke of asking the President to campaign for you in New York. Could you tell us some of the other places you discussed and places where you would like to have him come in?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, but we just mentioned New York and there were some other States, but I think that the Democratic National Committee is going to be talking to President Truman about his schedule. We did mention New York and I think we were talking about making farm speeches, and speeches in some other areas, and perhaps it would be better to wait until it is lined up.', 'QUESTION. You have said, Mr. President that he will win Missouri overwhelmingly. Would you care to make a prediction about the country?', ""Mr. TRUMAN. I am no political prophet nor pollster and I can't answer that question, for the simple reason that I don't have any faith in political prophets or pollsters, because the Democrats are going to win and that is all there is to it."", ""QUESTION. I want to direct a question to the new national chairman of the Democratic Party, Senator Jackson, from Washington. I know you are going to do an able job of leadership. What do you think Senator Kennedy's chances are going to be?"", 'Senator JACKSON. There is no doubt about what the chances are. He is going to win. Let me state it this way. I can say in all candor, if a party chairman can be candid, that there is not a single State that as chairman I would be warranted in writing off today to the Republicans, not a single State. In other words, we have a chance to win in all 50, and we are going to put up a fight in all 50. We are going to win. I don\'t think that you can name a State where an objective reporter could come up and say, ""The Democrats don\'t have a chance.""', 'Mr. TRUMAN. That is right.', 'Senator JACKSON. I am not saying we are going to carry them all necessarily, but there is not a single State. Vermont and Maine were famous in 1936, and Maine is now a Democratic State or at least it is a strong two party State. We have a Governor, a Senator, and two or three Congressmen. In Vermont, we elected a Congressman for the first time in 102 years or 106 years. That is the best way I can say it.', 'QUESTION. I wonder if you could give us just a little detail on your talk? What did you talk about, and how did it go? Any detail we would appreciate, any detail at all.', 'Mr. TRUMAN. We did not have any recording machine but we talked about winning an election, and that is what we are going to do.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, do you have any plans for further conferences with the President concerning either campaign plans or policy?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, I will be talking with him during the campaign.', ""QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, we have heard President Truman and Senator Jackson's analysis of your chances for November. Would you care to give us your own analysis at this time?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. Yes. I think we have a tough fight, and I think it is going to be contested in every State, but I think that we are going to win. I must say that I share the President's view to some degree about the difficulty of making a political prediction, or of a poll in August making a judgment of November. I have seen that go wrong in my own personal experience in so many occasions but I would say that we have a tough tight. In some areas it may be uphill. In my judgment we are going to win after a very vigorous campaign, and I am particularly glad that the President is going to join with us. We need the help of Democrats like him. I think we can get it. I think the fact that lie is willing to travel over the country on behalf of a candidate who runs almost 12 years after he won his victory in 1948, I think that gives us great encouragement. So I must say that I then am delighted that we all had a chance to come, and I am delighted that the President has been willing to associate himself in a strong way with our campaign."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, you said some areas might be difficult. Would you spell that out?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I just finished saying I think it will be a hard fought campaign, and a tough campaign. I don't take the view that we will win 50 States, but Senator Jackson may be right."", 'QUESTION. I think we have been fortunate to hear from most of the team and I think we ought to hear from the Senator from the great State of Missouri, Senator Symington, what he thinks about it all.', 'Senator SYMINGTON. Well, I am glad to be here, and Senator Kennedy, that is a privilege in itself, and it is a great honor for both of us to be here with President Truman. I am confident that the President will give all of his support, and he told me that before, to Senator Kennedy, and I think it is going to be very helpful. I fully concur with the President when he says that Missouri is going Democratic for Senator Kennedy, and I believe he has made a very wise choice in Senator Jackson, my colleague for many years in the Senate. We have been sitting next to each other and he is one of the hardest working and most dedicated Democrats I know. I think that the people of the United States are going to elect Senator Kennedy in November.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I have a question from Massachusetts. She wants to know if you have endorsed Endicott Peabody for the Democratic Governor of Massachusetts.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am not taking any position in the primaries in that State.', 'QUESTION. I would like to address a question to Senator Kennedy and Senator Jackson.', ""Senator, when Senator Johnson became the Vice Presidential nominee in Los Angeles, most people regarded it as a 10-strike, and thought it would assure carrying Texas and other States in the South. I believe the Republicans at first thought that, and now they seem to have some second thoughts on that. Leonard Hall, I think, sincerely is now talking about Nixon carrying Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and some other States in the South. I don't think it is just campaign talk. I wondered if you or Senator Jackson would comment on it?"", 'Senator JACKSON. Well, we have a hard fight in those areas. When I referred to the 50 States, I tried to make it clear that there is not a single State that we would write off, and I wanted to make that abundantly clear. We do have a hard fight in Texas, and I would say in Florida, Virginia, and possibly in Oklahoma. But a hard fight may be a good thing for us, because I think it will make us redouble our efforts to win. But we can carry those States, and I am confident that we will.', 'The most encouraging part of it is the fact that the hard working Democrats in those areas now recognize that we do have a tight and they are in there pitching. This to me is the most hopeful sign. We have other areas where we have hard fights.']"
9,John F. Kennedy ,"August 21, 1960","['No conference in this campaign is more important than this one. No domestic issue in this election is more important than the farm issue. No part of the American way of life is more important - or in more trouble - than the family farm.', 'The Republicans like to say, over and over again, that the big issue in this campaign is executive experience. Their candidate, they say, has experience in the executive branch - he has participated in its decisions - he has shared in its responsibilities - he has been educated in its programs.', ""I will discuss Mr. Nixon's experience in other fields on other occasions. But when it comes to agriculture, I can only say that disaster has been his experience, and Benson has been his teacher."", 'I do not use the word ""disaster"" lightly. During these last 8 years of Mr. Nixon\'s experience in making decisions, farm purchasing power has been cut some 20 percent. During the 8 years he was sharing executive responsibility, hundreds of thousands of farm families gave up the struggle against the cost-price squeeze. During these last 8 years of Benson, Nixon, Dirksen, and Morton, the average farm family was reduced to a net income of less than $50 a week.', 'Here in the Middle West, Mr. Nixon hardly speaks to Mr. Benson. He disowns the man he once called ""the best Secretary of Agriculture we ever had."" But in Portland, Maine, a week ago he talked along different lines. The reason Mr. Benson has not been successful, he said, is because the Democratic Congress has never given his program a chance.', ""To that, the American farmer can only ask, Where would we be without the Democratic Congress? For we have seen enough of Mr. Benson's program in effect to know what it would do. His program is to drive farm prices down. His program is to drive farm families off the farm. Contrary to Mr. Nixon's statement, the Congress did give Mr. Benson's program a chance - but Mr. Benson's program never gave the farmer a chance."", 'Now, that an election is near, the Republicans are talking about new slogans, new promises, and a new Secretary of Agriculture. But do not be misled. In the Republican platform today, as in any Republican administration of the future, the Benson song may have ended, but his melody lingers on.', ""For Republican opposition to farm income protection is not a whim of Mr. Benson. It is a bedrock principle of the Republican Party. It is that party's ironbound obligation to those who stand to profit when farm prices are kept down, when the farmer is without meaningful bargaining power in the marketplace."", 'I am not talking about the consumer. The Republican farm program has not benefited the consumer. Prices have stayed at a record high level, as every housewife knows, regardless of how hard the farmer is hit.', 'And I am not talking about the taxpayer. The Republican farm program has not benefited the taxpayer. The total costs and losses on farm price support operations under Benson and Nixon have amounted in 7 years to more than seven times as much as the total for 20 years under Roosevelt and Truman. In fact, they have spent several billion dollars more on agriculture than all the previous administrations in the history of this country combined.', ""The Republican policy of collapsing farm income does not benefit farmers, or consumers, or taxpayers. It benefits only those powerful interests who benefit from the farmer's adversity - the same interests who kept Mr. Benson in his job - the same interests that dictated this year's Republican farm platform."", 'That platform calls for ""price supports best fitted to specific commodities."" It doesn\'t say who decides - it doesn\'t say at what level - and it doesn\'t say best for whom.', ""The Republican leadership has already demonstrated that they don't mean what's best for the farmer."", 'The Democratic platform, on the other hand, spells out what we will do to reverse the decline in farm income, and to meet our responsibilities to our farmers, our consumers, and our taxpayers, to all America and to a hungry and troubled world.', 'That platform pledges, in unmistakable language, ""positive action to raise farm income to full parity of income levels and to preserve family farming as a way of life.""', 'It means that farmers shall receive returns for their labor, for their managerial skills, and for their investment which are equal to the returns received for comparable human talents and resources in other types of enterprise.', 'This is the strongest pledge ever given to the farmers of America by any political party in history.', 'I stand behind that pledge, and I intend to make good on it, beginning next January.', 'I do not say the job will be easy. There are no new or magical solutions. Mr. Nixon\'s talk about a ""massive land retirement"" plan with ""indemnity payments"" is no different than the 1956 ""acreage reserve"" plan of Ezra Taft Benson. More empty slogans and wishful thinking will not solve the problem.', 'The first thing to be done is to face up to the problem squarely, to recognize its magnitude. We have a revolution on our hands in agriculture. The headlines are full of revolutions in other parts of the world - but we have one right here on our farms. It is a revolution of technology. More and more food is being produced by fewer and fewer people on less and less land.', 'It is the result of improved machines and equipment, improved pest and disease control, improved water control, improved breeds and varieties, improved timing in cultivation, improved feeding practices, farm plant layout, and farm management.', 'Our land-grant colleges and private research are producing new miracles every year. Last month it was announced that chlorophyll can now be synthetically produced - that we can do in the laboratory what since the beginning of time we have relied on plants to do in the field - that is, convert sunshine, water, and carbon dioxide into food materials.', 'Where is this revolution going to lead? A revolution of abundance is better than one of scarcity. But people are being driven out of agriculture at a fantastic rate. The young people leave the farm and never come back. The families hit by failure, merger, or foreclosure move to the city, regardless of whether the city has jobs or homes.', 'Our small towns are being badly hurt - so are their churches and schools and businessmen - and so is the whole United States.', ""It would be nice to believe, as the Republicans believe, that migration off the farm will solve the problem of surpluses. But the facts of the matter are that, during these last 8 years when millions have been leaving the farm, our agricultural production has actually increased at a faster rate than our total population. Mr. Benson has acquired surpluses in storage six times as high as the 1952 level-surpluses which are costly to the taxpayers, frustrating to the world's hungry people and depressing in their effect on farm prices. Instead of population pressing on food supplies, as Malthus and others predicted, food supplies in this country are now pressing on the population."", ""It would also be nice to believe, as the Republicans believe, that as farm prices fall, consumers will buy more food and eat up the surplus. But it hasn't worked that way. Food prices have not fallen. We are on the whole, an affluent, well-fed people. Our stomachs can expand only so far. It takes a 20-percent drop in farm prices to move 2 per-cent more food into consumption. And even then, the surpluses would not be going to where they are really needed - to the underfed, the unemployed, the overlooked - to the families forced to get by on less than $20 a month worth of surplus flour, rice, and cornmeal, with some occasional dried eggs, lard, and skimmed milk."", 'At the same time, there are other revolutions going on around the world - populations growing faster than food supplies - new nations in need of assistance - underdeveloped nations in need of food for capital. These are fast-changing, fast-moving times. The Republican Party is, as it always has been, the party of the status quo - and today in agriculture there can be no status quo.', 'In short, timid and temporary measures will not do. The Benson-Nixon-Dirksen philosophy will not do. Four more years of decline and disaster will not do.', 'We must harness these revolutions. We must ride these waves of change. We must learn to manage our abundance - to bring the great productive capacity of American agriculture into balance with total needs at home and abroad, at prices that will yield to our farmers a fair return on their capital and labor.', 'That is not a radical goal - or an impossible one. Nor does it treat the farmer any differently from anyone else. It may take hard work - it may mean a difficult transition - it may require tough decisions and many complaints. But the job can be done and I pledge every effort of mind and heart to do it.', 'I would rather he accused of breaking precedents - than breaking promises.', 'I am here today to learn. It is my intention to spell out programs throughout this fall. They will offer no special privileges. They will help no segment of the American economy at the expense of another. They will not satisfy everyone - they will not reflect the wishes of any one group - but they will reflect what I think is right. And they will live up to the strongest farm platform in American political history.', ""That farm program will not be based on cold statistics. It will not be based on economics textbooks, on academic theories or remote trends. It will be a program for the individual farmer and his family - the man who has done more for America and received less for it than possibly any other group in our Nation - the man who fights year after year to do a good job, to use his soil and water wisely, to cooperate with Government policies, to maintain a decent home for his family, only to see his crop price go down and down as the cost of his equipment and his utilities and his family's clothes and doctor bills go up and up."", 'That program must contain four basic objectives:', '\n  First, a positive policy of supply management to raise farm prices and incomes to parity levels - and that will require a sympathetic Secretary of Agriculture using a whole arsenal of tools (marketing quotas, sales quotas, land retirement, soil conservation, commodity purchases and loans, marketing orders and agreements, and many others - on a commodity-by-commodity basis) in cooperation with decisions made on the local level by local farmers themselves.', 'Secondly, a positive food and nutrition policy for all Americans, with better diets and distribution to our schoolchildren, our unemployed and our unfortunate, and a security reserve against the hazards of modern war expanding existing programs and using the new ones a timid administration has been unwilling to test.', 'Third, a dynamic food and fiber policy for worldwide use, emphasizing above all a ""peace reserve"" aiding all nations in distress, and to which each farmer would be proud to contribute, instead of being constantly shamed in public on the grounds that he is piling up wasteful surpluses.', 'Fourth, a long-range program for low-income farms, credit, research, and new rural industries.', 'Both parties describe one phase of their policy as ""food for peace."" But I would give that name to our entire program. For peace is man\'s greatest aspiration - a just peace, a secure peace, without appeasement.', 'We will not accept the peace of foreign domination - we do not seek the peace of the grave. We want more than this so-called peace that is merely an interval between wars.', ""There will be no farm program - there will be no farm boys or farms - if we cannot get off this deadly collision course on which we are presently headed. It's time for real leadership again in foreign affairs - fresh, firm leadership for peace. And in that mighty effort, we shall depend again - as we have in all our history - on our food, our farms, and our loyal, tireless farmers.""]"
10,John F. Kennedy ,"August 21, 1960","['QUESTION. I would like to ask the Senator what his reaction to this entire midwestern trip is, and how much of the Midwest does he think he can carry.', 'Senator KENNEDY. First, I want to express my appreciation to Governor Loveless and to all of you. My reaction to this trip is that it has been most useful and worth while. As I said earlier this afternoon, the decline in agricultural income is the No. 1 domestic problem of the United States. This meeting held today, and the only one that we shall hold in the month of August, I think indicates the importance that we put in demonstrating that the Democratic Party is determined to reverse this downward curve. We are going to move it upward, and I think that in November we will be endorsed in this view by the farmers of the Midwest.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, you heard the milk comments of Governor Freeman. Are you for that type of a program that will enable the midwestern milk to get into the big eastern markets?', 'Governor LOVELESS. The question was, had the Senator heard the comments of Governor Freeman in relation to the milk standardization acts, and do you favor it?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Our constitutional meeting or convention was formed in order to originally promote interstate commerce and provide for its free flow. I don't believe that any unnecessary or artificial standard should be used any place, in any area, in any part of American life to block the flow of commerce."", 'QUESTION. This is kind of a long question because it grows out of a statement that Senator Scott made on College News Conference today.', 'Governor LOVELESS. Do you have it written so that I could read it from here?', 'QUESTION. Yes.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is the question: This is a question that arises about the charges made by Senator Scott, of Pennsylvania, on ""College News Conference"" today. He declared that the Kennedy family fortunes have been used in an attempt to buy votes for Kennedy. The Republicans, he said, would have a lot of questions to ask about the use of money in the campaign. He said that evidence of your expenditures to date vary from 1 1/2 million to 7 million, and he said ""I am sure that more will be used."" He said that Kennedy cash would be used to buy the farm vote, and pay the transportation for immigrants.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Senator Scott as you know is a member of the Republican Truth Squad, but he may well have lost his membership today. I think Mr. Scott is himself a member of the five-man strategy board of the Vice President, and I hope that we are not going to be taken down the old road of campaign tactics and untrue charges. I don\'t share in the last part of the question, to ""turn on the faucets to buy the farm vote."" I don\'t share the view that the farm vote is for sale. I think that the voters in November will deal with the ""truth squads,"" and the strategy boards, and I believe the Vice President of the United States.', 'Governor LOVELESS. The next question is, What is your opinion of nationally organized labor unions for farmers?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think it is appropriate that farmers organize together. If the phrase ""nationally organized labor unions"" refers to the farmers union and other organizations in which farmers who think alike are joined together in a national farm organization such as the Grange and the Farm Bureau - whatever group you think you should join, you should join, because you ought to make your views felt. I think what would be the most helpful, however, would be if the various farm organizations who do speak for the farmers would speak together and in one voice, commodity by commodity, joining together. Then I think we could begin to move ahead in Washington.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is the next question: What sort of qualifications will you look for in the man you would select for the next Secretary of Agriculture?', 'Senator KENNEDY. First, I think that he should have been at some part of his life a farmer. Secondly, I think that he should live in the Midwest United States. Thirdly, he should believe that his responsibility is to preserve the family farm and not liquidate it. Fourth, and finally, it would be helpful if he were a Democrat.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is the next question: Senator, this falls in sort of line with the last one. We have heard much about the family-sized farm. Will the Senator please give us his definition of a family-sized farm?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would say it is a farm that a family can work. And No.2, the family can make a living off of.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is a question: How can we best attack the problems resulting from the nuclear arms race?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I spent with Senator Jackson and Senator Symington, both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, last night and this morning at the SAC Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebr., which as you know is the great retaliatory shield of the United States and the entire free world. I think that we have many arms in the arsenal, and one of course is that, and we should keep that second to none. Secondly, I hope that we can try to work out with our adversaries, the Communists, a realistic system with inspection for the lessening of arms tension, for the cessation of nuclear tests and for the beginning of disarmament, and lift that heavy burden from us all. Thirdly, I think that we should assist those countries to the south of us who are attempting to solve their staggering economic problems and help them join with us. Fourth and finally, we should continue to demonstrate this: Today in talking to a major in SAC who had just finished a 24-hour flight, I said to him: ""Why do you serve at SAC?"" He said, ""I serve at SAC because I like being on the first team."" I think that as long as Americans feel like that, we are going to be safe and maintain our freedom.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is the next question: Senator, do you believe that the Corrupt Practices Act of 1935 and Taft-Hartley should be revised allowing corporations and unions to contribute openly to political campaigns? ""It takes money to get elected and should corporations and unions contribute?""', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would be opposed to changing that provision of the law as it affects the national campaigns. I think what is important is for all of us not only to vote and be interested, but also participate in the financing of a campaign. Personally I hope that the day will come that the program of Theodore Roosevelt will come about, which provided for Federal financing of presidential elections. But in the meantime I would be opposed to permitting corporations or unions to use union dues or corporation money to finance directly national campaigns.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This gentleman asks your reactions to the statement last night that Mr. Benson made, that he is being made the scapegoat for the Democratic Congress in farm policies.', ""Senator KENNEDY. I thought he was being made the scapegoat for the Vice President, who says he has been disagreeing with him for years unsuccessfully. The fact of the matter is, as Senator Lyndon Johnson said, I don't make Benson the scapegoat. I think the Republican Party's farm policy is unfortunate, and I don't think that that farm policy will be changed merely by changing the Secretary of Agriculture. Mr. Seaton, the Secretary of the Interior, speaking in Omaha, Nebr., this morning, one of the five men who are on Vice President Nixon's strategy board along with Senator Scott, stated that the trouble with Benson program is that it had not been adopted by the Democratic Congress. Now, if that is the plan of the Nixon strategy board, to elect a Republican Congress and a Republican President so that they can write into the statute books the entire Benson program, I don't want any of it."", 'Governor LOVELESS. The next question: Do you expect an emergency farm bill to be passed during this session of the Congress? Do you think an emergency bill is necessary?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We did pass a bill on Friday, which will raise the support price of grade B milk from about $3 to about $3.24. Senator Proxmire introduced the bill, which Senator Humphrey and Senator Symington and others cosponsored. But I have a list here of the bills which the President of the United States has vetoed. I think in order to write into the statute books a farm program it is going to require a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President. The President of the United States vetoed in 1956 a measure to restore 90 percent of farm parity prices. He vetoed in 1958 a bill freezing farm price supports at the 1957 level. He vetoed in 1959 a wheat price support bill which would have raised the support from 75 to 90 percent in return for an acreage reduction.', ""Now, I don't think that there is any sense in our thinking it is possible for us to go ahead and then find in the farm area that we are going to be set back. I think that we can go ahead, but I think that we need the endorsement of the American people, which I think we can get for the Democratic platform and its program, and we can get that endorsement next November and go to work."", 'Governor LOVELESS. How did the Kennedy-Truman ranks stand after your Missouri trip?', 'Senator KENNEDY. They are as one, I am glad to say. I hope that I can do as well as he did. He told me all about how he did it. I hope that I will come out as well as he did.', 'Governor LOVELESS. This is the question: Senator Kennedy, you have stated that you will let the farmers decide the farm programs they want. Which farmers?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would think the farmers chosen by their fellow farmers in the counties and in the States, so that it comes from the farmers through the Department of Agriculture. We will have not only legislation moving from the top down, but also support for that legislation and suggestions moving from the bottom up. The kind of a meeting that we had today indicates, I think, that partnership which can exist between the farmers of this country and the Federal Government.']"
11,John F. Kennedy ,"August 24, 1960","['THE BASIC ISSUE: EXPERIENCE', 'The Republican orators are fond of saying that experience in foreign policy is a major issue in this campaign. I agree. But the issue is not merely the experience of the candidates. It is the experience which the whole Nation has gone through in the last 8 years - and what an experience it has been.', 'Never before have we experienced such arrogant treatment at the hands of our enemy. Never before have we experienced such a critical decline in our prestige, driving our friends to neutralism, and neutrals to our outright hostility. Never before have the tentacles of communism sunk so deeply into previously friendly areas - in Iraq and the Middle East, in the Congo and Africa, in Laos and Asia, and in Cuba, 90 miles off our shores, and elsewhere in Latin America.', 'Mr. Nixon is experienced - experienced in policies of retreat, defeat, and weakness.', 'They say he has presided over the Security Council. During the 8 years he has been presiding, our security has declined more rapidly than over any comparable period in our history - in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory power, in terms of our alliances, in terms of our scientific effort and reputation. Mr. Nixon may now say he has been urging an acceleration of our defense all along - but in his August 10 press conference the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint by the Vice President, adding: ""Certainly if there is, he hasn\'t come to me about it.""', 'What was the Security Council doing while the Nation was undergoing this experience? Why would anyone point with pride to presiding over successive blows to our security and prestige - Indochina, Hungary, Suez, Sputnik, the riots in Venezuela, the collapse of the summit, the riots in Japan, the collapse of the Baghdad Pact, the failure of disarmament, the U-2 fiasco, and now Cuba and the Congo?', 'Why would anyone boast about presiding over the Security Council during the years it rejected the now accepted findings of the Gaither report, the Killian report, and the Rockefeller report - during the years it held back our missiles and frustrated our efforts in Space - during the years it failed to come up with one new idea of any importance: for ""Atoms for Peace"" was a slogan, the Eisenhower Middle East Doctrine was a farce, the ""open skies"" plan was a gesture, and the Baghdad Pact was a failure. Mr. Nixon has presided, in short, over the decline of our national security.', ""They say he has traveled abroad. He has. In Vietnam he urged the French to keep fighting. On Formosa, he implied our support of invading the mainland. In India, he questioned Nehru's right to be neutral. In Venezuela, his good will tour provoked a riot. And in the Soviet Union, he argued with Mr. Khrushchev in the kitchen, pointing out that while we might be behind in space, we were certainly ahead in color television."", 'Mr. Nixon may be very experienced in kitchen debates. So are a great many other married men I know. But does anyone think for one moment that Mr. Khrushchev\'s determination to ""bury"" us was slowed down one iota by all these arguments and debates? Can anyone cite one instance of Mr. Khrushchev pulling back his lines as the result of some Nixon trip or debate?', 'So let us talk about experience in this campaign - the experience of the last 8 years - the most expensive experience in the history of the Nation. To learn our lesson from that experience - to learn that neither smiles nor frowns, neither good intentions nor harsh words, are a substitute for strength - to learn that if America stands still Mr. Khrushchev will try to run over us - to learn these things, to discuss these things, is not un-American, as Mr. Nixon implies.', ""For the Democratic program is not one that will please Mr. Khrushchev. Our criticism is not born out of disloyalty - but out of our deep loyalty to all America means and will mean. Mr. Nixon has said that when the Communists are running us down abroad, it's time to speak up for America. I would add to that: It's also time to build up America."", ""That is the real issue in this campaign - not who can best talk back to the Communist - not who can best swap threats and insults - not who can stand up to Khrushchev. The real issue is who can stand up and summon all the resources of this land to the defense of freedom, to restore our Nation's relative strength and leadership. For as long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way - as long as he is convinced that time and the course of history is on his side - then no amount of good will trips or kitchen debates can compel him to substitute fruitful negotiations for force. And no amount of Republican oratory about appeasement or apologies can conceal the trouble we are in today."", 'That is a hard issue for a political campaign. It involves unpleasant facts. It is easier to talk about trips and debates and experience. It is pleasanter to hear popular slogans and growing promises.', 'But the facts are there. They must be faced. The answers are not easy. And I believe the American people would say what Virginia\'s own Patrick Henry said in 1775: ""For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst and to provide for it.""']"
12,John F. Kennedy ,"August 24, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Fenwick, thank you for that generous introduction. Governor Almond, who, from the day that I was nominated in Los Angeles, has been my friend and counselor, my running mate, Lyndon Johnson, and Mrs. Johnson, Governor Battle, my friend and campaign chairman in this State, Bill Battle, Members of the Congress, the next Congressman from this district, Ralph Kaul, who will be one of the great ones, Dorothy McDiarmid, and members of this great Democratic meeting in the State of Virginia, 170 years ago Thomas Jefferson and James Madison left the State of Virginia and went to New York on a botanical expedition up the Hudson River. After they had caught fish and butterflies, they rode down the river and stopped in New York City, and there they met Aaron Burr, and the Knights of St. Tammany, and founded the modern Democratic Party, a party which has united the country and the city, the East and the West in the only and oldest national party in the history of the world. [Applause.]', 'I come here tonight not on a botanical expedition, not to catch fish and butterflies, but I come to the home of this party with Lyndon Johnson and ask for your help. You started it, you began the Democratic Party, and I cannot believe in the most dangerous time in our country\'s history, that Virginia is going to say, ""We will not join up again.""', 'We ask your help and we are here tonight to begin this campaign. [Applause.] Virginia is an old State and it values the past. But if there is any lesson that history has ever taught us, it is that those who hold the past are the ones who move ahead. This country was founded by men who valued the past and were revolutionaries to preserve it. I cannot believe that there is anyone in the State of Virginia who believes that this country should stand still, who believes that everything that had to be done was done in the past, who does not believe that there is any necessity for us to break new ground in the future. If they are, they should vote Republican, because that is what they are going to get - standstill. [Applause.]', 'I know that there are some Americans and some Democrats who say that they have now developed a wonderful arrangement in Washington. The Congress is Democratic and the President is Republican and nothing happens and isn\'t it wonderful. [Laughter.] Thomas Jefferson of the State of Virginia was so anxious for this country to move that when he came back from Europe after the Constitutional Convention he objected to George Washington because the Constitutional Convention had agreed to the founding of the Senate. He said, ""Why is a Senate necessary?"" And, as you know according to the story, Washington said, ""Why do I pour my coffee in a cup? To cool it. So we need the Senate.""', ""I don't want legislation so cooled off that after it passes the House and the Senate that it is vetoed by a Republican President and sent back to die. [Applause.]"", ""I value the American Constitution enough to believe that the checks and balances required by our system were written into the Constitution, the House, the Senate, the legislative, the executive, the judiciary, the Federal Government, the State governments, townships. Those are the checks and balances which permit freedom to develop and yet action to take place. They have had a session of the Congress for the last 3 weeks. It has not been a happy experience. But if the people will study it, they will see that in the last 3 weeks we will have, if the Republicans are successful, a microcosm of what will happen in the next 4 years, of a Congress in the hands of one party and an administration in the hands of another party, with threats of vetoes, with party war in the most dangerous time in the life of our country. I think it is time to move. I think this country wants to go ahead, and the way to do it is to give us the responsibility or give the Republicans the responsibility. But don't divide it and end up with no one responsible. [Applause.]"", 'Finally, let me say what I consider to be a most important issue in this campaign. The Republican orators are fond of saying that experience in foreign policy is the greatest issue in this campaign. I agree. But the issue is not merely the experience of the candidates. It is the experience which the entire Nation has gone through in the last 8 years, and what an experience it has been. [Applause.] Never before has this country experienced such arrogant treatment at the hands of its enemy. Never before have we experienced a more critical decline in our prestige, driving our friends to neutralism, and neutrals to our right of hostility, never before has the grip of communism sunk so deeply into previously friendly countries. Mr. Nixon is experienced in policies of weakness, retreat, and defeat. [Applause.]', 'During the past 8 years that he has presided over the National Security Council, never in all that time in our country\'s history has our strength declined more rapidly than it has during the comparable period, in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory capacity, in terms of our alliances, in terms of our scientific effort, and our national reputation. Mr. Nixon may now say that he has been urging an acceleration of our defense effort all along, and yet in his August 10 press conference, the President said he knew of no such different viewpoint of the Vice President, adding ""Certainly if there is, he has not come to me with it."" [Applause.]', ""Why would anyone boast of presiding over the National Security Council during the years that it rejected the now accepted findings of the Killian report, the Gaither report, the Rockefeller brothers report, during the years it held back on our progress in missiles and space. During the years it failed to come u p with one great single idea of international importance. They say he has traveled abroad. He has. In Vietnam he urged the French to continue to fight. On Formosa he implied our support of an invasion of the Mainland of China. In India he questioned Nehru's right to be neutral. In Venezuela his goodwill tour provoked a riot, and in the Soviet Union he argued with Mr. Khrushchev in the kitchen, it is true, pointing out that while we may be behind in space, we were ahead in color television. [Applause and laughter.] But does anyone think for a single moment, do they take the Communists so lightly that they think Mr. Khrushchev was diverted for a single moment from his objectives by an argument in the kitchen? Do they think he changed his plans, pulled back his forces since that argument? He could argue in the kitchen every day and move every night. [Laughter.]"", ""So let us talk about experience in this campaign, let's talk about it. Let's talk about the experience of this Nation. Let's learn from that experience, to learn that neither smiles nor frowns - and President Roosevelt and President Truman and President Eisenhower had the same experience, they all made the effort to get along with the Russians. But every time, finally it failed. And the reason it failed was because the Communists are determined to destroy us, and regardless of what hand of friendship we may hold out or what arguments we may put up, the only thing that will make that decisive difference is the strength of the United States. [Applause.]"", 'Three years ago I went to Havana. I was told that the American Ambassador was the second most powerful man in Cuba. Probably he should not be, but he is not today. We have within 90 miles by the same group who have stood up to Khrushchev, we have Castro, who attacks us daily. In the Congo, the most intimate adviser to the new Prime Minister is the Soviet Ambassador. In Laos where we have spent more money per capita than in any country in the world, they are moving from neutralism to hostility, and the reason is singlefold. Though it may vary in shape in every country and the reason is the same impression you get from standing by a beach, if you look at the ocean and watch it, you see no change. But if you leave it and come back in 3 hours or 5 hours, you may see that the tide has run out. We standing here tonight cannot, with certainty, make a judgment of our times or the last 5 years or the last decade.', ""But I think there is a great danger that history will make a judgment that these were days when the tide began to run out for the United States. These were the times when the Communist tide began to pour in. These were the times when people began not to worry what they thought in Washington, but only to wonder what they thought in Moscow and Peking. I run for the office of the Presidency not because I think it is an easy job in soft times. I think it is going to be the most difficult and hazardous year in our country's history. This is a time of danger. I don't think anyone should vote for the Democrats if they are satisfied with what is happening, if they feel that our status is fine, if they are not concerned by the fact that last year we had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. If you are satisfied, then I think this country should make Mr. Nixon the President. But if you feel that we have unfinished business, that our generation faces the same kind of challenge that Franklin Roosevelt faced in 1933, then I say to you that this country will move and the Democratic Party will lead it. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

That resolution showed courage, it showed conviction, and it showed loyalty to all we hold dear - and it makes me proud to be a member.', 'I would like to give those rosy reassurances, too, as any American speaker would like to give them. I would like to tell you facts that any American would like to hear. I would like to be able to say to you categorically and proudly that the United States is first in the world militarily, economically, scientifically, and educationally, and will be in the future.', ""But I cannot make that speech. I cannot in all honesty make those claims. I cannot go to the country with appeals to the voters' complacency.

Have you, since your days in school, ever known any boy or man of unsurpassed strength who did not always receive the respect of his enemies as well as his friends? And then ask your selves whether you have ever known a period when this Nation was treated with less respect and with such open arrogance by our enemies around the world, and regarded with such doubt by our friends.', 'Possibly the days preceding the War of 1812 are a precedent - when the French and British contemptuously halted our ships and seized our sailors - much as the Russians seized the crew of the American RB47 downed over the East German border. But I can think of no other period in our history when our peace Conferences were broken off with such contempt - when our President was not free to travel abroad - when enemy rockets were rattled from a once friendly nation only 90 miles off our shores - and when the leader of our leading enemy dared to voice an interference in our presidential elections.', 'These are unpleasant facts - unpleasant to recite - unpleasant to face. But face them we must. For, as Winston Churchill told the British House of Commons in an age of similar peril: ""We shall not escape our dangers by recoiling from them.""', 'To face those facts is not disloyal, as some have implied - it is the highest type of loyalty. To state these facts does not divide the country - and let us hope Mr. Khrushchev knows it. As Secretary of State Herter told him some weeks ago, after the convention: ""Mr.Khrushchev, do not be deceived.""', ""We are a united country. We are not divided by our views on communism versus freedom, on firmness versus appeasement, on peace versus war. These are not at issue in this campaign. The issue in this campaign is which candidate and which party can best summon all of America's people and resources to rebuild and regain our strength as a free Nation, and I want Mr. Khrushchev to know it."", 'Those who are gathered in this hall today are accustomed to facing harsh reality. That is our link with each other. That is our link to the past. But the American veteran of today is not looking merely to the past. He is not assuming that his service to his Nation is over.', 'He is looking ahead instead to the kind of goals for America that he believed in, fought for, and shares with every other American - not an America of special privileges we have not earned - not easy promises of a soft life - but an America that is on the move, that is shoring up its weaknesses, facing up to its challenges, living up to its name and its traditions.', 'As veterans, we do not ask that our Nation look constantly backward at our deeds of duty and sacrifice. But we do expect a Nation determined that those deeds shall not have been in vain - a Nation determined to maintain and expand the world security and leadership for which we fought.', 'The harsh facts of the matter are that our security and leadership are both slipping away from us - that the balance of world power is slowly shifting to the Soviet-Red Chinese bloc - and that our own shores are for the first time since 1812, imperiled by chinks in our defensive armor.', 'We are still the strongest power in the world today. But Communist power has been, and is now, growing faster than is our own. And by Communist power I mean military power, economic power, scientific and educational power, and political power. They are moving faster than we are: on the ground, under the ocean, in the air and out in space.', ""The world's first satellite was called Sputnik, not Vanguard or Explorer.

I mean first in military power across the board. Only then can we stop the next war before it starts. Only then can we prevent war by preparing for it. Only then can we pave the way to disarmament by showing Mr. Khrushchev the futility of Russian armaments.', 'But let us always remember that Mr. Khrushchev is not going to be impressed by mere words. He is not going to be deterred by mere rhetoric. He is not going to be moved by mere arguments and debate. It would be all right if the next war were to be a war of words. But Mr. Khrushchev respects only one thing: power.', 'Today the United States of America is the greatest Nation on earth. And today we all agree that this is the most powerful Nation on earth. But what of 5 or 10 years from now? This Nation in 1965 will still be the greatest - but will it still be the most powerful?', 'The facts of the matter are that we are falling behind - behind in our schedules, behind in our needs, behind the Russians in our rate of progress. The missile lag looms larger and larger ahead. Our Army and Marine Corps lack the manpower, the weapons and the jet airlift mobility to put out a brush-fire war before it becomes a conflagration. We need to put our Strategic Air Command on an air alert and under wide dispersal - improve our systems of continental defense - step up our antisubmarine warfare effort - increase the thrust of our rocket engines - harden our missile bases - and modernize our outdated Pentagon research, organization, and weapons evaluation.', ""All this and more. must be done. It all can be done. Let us hope that it will not require the launching of Russia's first reconnaissance satellite peering down on every part of the Nation like a daily fleet of U-2 planes.

And I do not believe they regard the statement of our needs - in your resolution or my address - as either defeatist or disloyal. For we are proud of our country and we know what it can do with a little leadership. But when you are proud of something, you don't let it deteriorate. You don't let it stand still so others can run over it."", 'If the day ever comes when the American people are not able to face the facts - or are not allowed to face the facts - then we will be all through as a Nation. The first test of leadership in this country is not an ability to argue with the Russians - anyone can do that. It is the ability to tell the people the truth about our danger - and to summon the people to meet it.', ""And this is where the veterans have a special role to play. For we remember the meaning of peril. We remember the warnings we sounded in years gone by, even when our might was unchallenged, our hopes were high and our enemies still far behind. And we remember, too, those first dark days of World War II, when many were downcast or fainthearted - only to see America dot the skies with planes, fill the seas with ships, and dispatch one victorious mission after another, the best-trained, best-equipped and most successful fighting force in the world's history."", 'Today the challenge is somewhat different - not only because the enemy has the power to destroy us - but because he also seeks, by economic and political warfare, to isolate us. He intends to out-produce us. He intends to outlast us.', 'And the real question now is whether we are up to the task - whether each and every one of us is willing to face the facts, to bear the burdens, to provide the risks, to meet our dangers - and to provide for them.', 'Will we be like the Congressional war hawks prior to the War of 1812, who responded to the arrogant treatment our sailors were receiving with tough talk and a hard line - but who failed to provide our Nation with the frigates needed to keep the peace?

But I cannot think of any other period in our history when our peace conferences were broken off with such contempt, when our President was not free to travel abroad, when enemy rockets rattled off the coast of the United States 90 miles away, and when the leader of our leading enemy dared to voice an interference in our Presidential elections.', 'These are unpleasant facts, unpleasant to recite, unpleasant to face. But face them we must; for, as Winston Churchill told the British House of Commons, in a period of similar peril for Great Britain:', 'We shall not escape our dangers by recoiling from them.', 'To face those facts is not disloyal, as some have implied. It is the highest type of loyalty. To state these facts does not divide the country, and let us hope Mr. Khrushchev knows it.

We are not divided in our views on communism versus freedom, on firmness versus appeasement, on peace versus war. These are not at issue in this campaign.

But Communist power has been, and is now, growing faster than our own and at a greater rate of growth, and by ""Communist power,"" I mean military power, economic power, scientific power and educational and political power. They are moving faster than we are.', ""The world's first satellite was called Sputnik, not Vanguard or Explorer. The first vehicle to the moon was named Lunik.

I do not mean first, when. I do not mean first, if. I mean first - period. I mean first in military power across the board. Only then can we stop the next war before it starts. Only then can we prevent war by preparing for it.', 'Let us always remember that Mr. Khrushchev is not going to be impressed with words. He is not going to be deterred by rhetoric. He is not going to be moved by mere argument or debate. We cannot at the age of 65 make Mr. Khrushchev into a Democrat or a Republican by debate. Mr. Khrushchev respects only one thing, and that is power.', 'Today the United States is the greatest nation on earth and today we all agree that we are the most powerful nation on earth. But what of 5 or 10 years from now? This Nation in 1965 will still be the greatest nation, but will it be the most powerful?', ""The facts of the matter are that we are falling behind in our rate of growth. The missile lag looms large. Our Army and Marine Corps lack the manpower and airlift. We need to put SAC on an airlift around the clock and it is not on airlift today, as I visited the SAC headquarters last Saturday afternoon. We need to increase the thrust of our rocket engines. The Soviet Union's recent missile that they recovered weighed 5 tons and until we get a powerful rocket engine second to none, we are going to be second in space, with all of the significance which space is going to have."", ""We do not want the Soviet Union to be the first country to put a reconnaissance rocket around the globe, which will be like having a flight of U-2's pass over our country every day."", 'All this can be done. All this can be done in this country, but let us put an end to this policy of deciding our fiscal requirements and then deciding what we can spend on defense. Let our danger decide our fiscal requirements, and then fit our fiscal requirements to meet them.', 'As you know, there is a dispute over whether the administration should unfreeze defense funds previously appropriated by this Congress. Let me make my position crystal clear.

15,John F. Kennedy ,"August 26, 1960","['Prophecy is a Jewish tradition, and the World Zionist movement, in which all of you have played so important a role, has continued this tradition. It has turned the dreams of its leaders into acts of statesmanship. It has converted the hopes of the Jewish people into concrete facts of life.', 'When the first Zionist conference met in 1897, Palestine was a neglected wasteland. A few scattered Jewish colonies had resettled there, but they had come to die in the Holy Land, rather than to make it live again in greatness. Most of the governments of the world were indifferent.', 'But now all is changed. Israel became a triumphant and enduring reality exactly 50 years after Theodore Herzl, the prophet of Zionism, had proclaimed the ideal of nationhood. It was the classic case of an ancient dream finding a young leader, for Herzl was then only 37 years of age. Perhaps I may be allowed the observation that the Jewish people - ever since David slew Goliath - have never considered youth as a barrier to leadership, or measured experience and maturity by mere length of days.', 'I first saw Palestine in 1939. There the neglect and ruin left by centuries of Ottoman misrule were slowly being transformed by miracles of labor and sacrifice. But Palestine was still a land of promise in 1939, rather than a land of fulfillment. I returned in 1951 to see the grandeur of Israel. In 3 years this new state had opened its doors to 600,000 immigrants and refugees. Even while fighting for its own survival, Israel had given new hope to the persecuted and new dignity to the pattern of Jewish life. I left with the conviction that the United Nations may have conferred on Israel the credentials of nationhood; but its own idealism and courage, its own sacrifice and generosity, had earned the credentials of immortality.', 'Some do not agree. Three weeks ago I said in a public statement: ""Israel is here to stay."" The next day I was attacked by Cairo radio, rebuking me for my faith in Israel, and quoting this criticism from the Arabic newspaper Al-Gomhouria:', '\n  As for the question of the existence and the nonexistence of Israel, Mr. Kennedy says that Israel has been created in order to exist. Time will judge between us, Mr. Kennedy.\n', 'I agree. Time will judge whether Israel will continue to exist. But I wish I could be as sure of all my prophecies as I am of my flat prediction that Israel is here to stay.', 'For Israel was not created in order to disappear - Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom; and no area of the world has ever had an overabundance of democracy and freedom.', 'It is worth remembering, too, that Israel is a cause that stands beyond the ordinary changes and chances of American public life. In our pluralistic society, it has not been a Jewish cause - any more than Irish independence was solely the concern of Americans of Irish descent. The ideals of Zionism have, in the last half century, been repeatedly endorsed by Presidents and Members of Congress from both parties. Friendship for Israel is not a partisan matter. It is a national commitment.', 'Yet within this tradition of friendship there is a special obligation on the Democratic Party. It was President Woodrow Wilson who forecast with prophetic wisdom the creation of a Jewish homeland. It was President Franklin Roosevelt who kept alive the hopes of Jewish redemption during the Nazi terror. It was President Harry Truman who first recognized the new State of Israel and gave it status in world affairs. And may I add that it would be my hope and my pledge to continue this Democratic tradition - and to be worthy of it.', 'What is needed now is leadership - impartial but firm, deliberate but bold - leadership instead of rhetoric. There has been enough rhetoric in recent years about free transit through the Suez Canal - but there has been no leadership. Our policy in Washington and in the United Nations has permitted defiance of our pledge with impunity - indeed, with economic reward.', ""If America's word in the world community is to have meaning - if the mutual security amendment which I cosponsored with Senator Douglas is to have meaning - and if the clear, thoughtful language of the Democratic platform is to have meaning - the influence of this Nation and other maritime powers must be brought to bear on a just solution that removes all discrimination at the Suez Canal for all times. And the White House must take the lead."", 'We have also had much rhetoric in recent years about opposing an arms race and a solution by force in the Middle East. The rhetoric has not only been empty and negative. Even more fundamental is the premise that if the United States and the United Nations are to reject a solution based on force, then they must accept the task of finding a solution based on reason and justice.', ""We can no longer shun this task by pleading that the problem is too difficult. The danger is already acute from delay. Russia's position is more entrenched. The Arab States are more divided and restless. The influence of the Western nations has steadily diminished."", 'When I talked with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion on his most recent visit to this country, he told me of dangerous signs of unrest beneath the deceptive quiet that has fallen over the Middle East. For there is no peace in that region today - only an embittered truce between renewed alarms.', 'American intervention, on the other hand, will not now be easy for the record is not one to which we can point with pride:', '\n  The humble plea by the George Allen mission to Cairo, to urge Egyptian reconsideration of their acceptance of Soviet arms;', 'The series of incredible American blunders which led to the Suez crisis of 1956, events in which the role of our Government has never been fully explained;', 'The so-called Eisenhower doctrine, now repudiated by some of the very nations which accepted our aid, and the cause even at that time of widespread antagonism from Middle Eastern leaders who felt we were cynically trying to use them for our own cold war ends;', 'And, in general, a deterioration in our relations with all Middle Eastern nations, primarily because neither Israel nor the Arabs knew exactly what to expect from us. At times it must have appeared to many in the area that the shortest route to Washington was through Moscow. At times it must have appeared that champions of democracy and freedom were being punished for their virtues, by being taken for granted by a neglectful administration that suddenly showed concern only when it was displeased by their conduct.', 'Peace in the Middle East is not one step nearer reality today than it was 8 years ago - but Russian influence is immeasurably greater.', 'What can a new President do? More weakness and timidity will not do. More stubborn errors redeemed at the last moment by impulsive action - will not do.', 'Now we must take the risk of leadership, and use our influence to compose this ugly situation before it breaks out in a new threat to peace. And I know we will not be alone in searching for a peaceful settlement - if our aims are high, and if they are centered solely on the genuine needs of the Middle East, and on an honorable end to these ancient quarrels.', 'First: I propose that the new President reaffirm our sincere friendship for all the peoples of the Middle East, whatever their religion or race or politics.', 'Second: I propose that we make it crystal clear that the United States means what it said in the tripartite declaration of 1950 - that we will act promptly and decisively against any nation in the Middle East which attacks its neighbor. I propose that we make clear to both Israel and the Arab States our guarantee that we will act with whatever force and speed are necessary to halt any aggression by any nation. And to complete the effectiveness of this guarantee, I propose that we invite all like-minded nations to join with us in signing, registering, and depositing this declaration with the United Nations.', ""At present the tripartite declaration is too uncertain of execution and effect to be a useful shield for peace. With countries so close to one another in a sensitive tension-ridden area, a delay of only a few days in international reaction to aggression might well be fatal to a nation's freedom and indeed the peace of the entire world. Once the nations of the Middle East have a firm and precise guarantee, the need for continuing the arms race will disappear, the easing of tensions inevitably will follow, and both sides will be able to devote their energies and talents to peaceful pursuits."", 'Third: I propose that all the authority and prestige of the White House be used to call into conference the leaders of Israel and the Arab States to consider privately their common problems, assuring them that we support in full their aspirations for peace, unity, independence, and a better life - and that we are prepared to back up this moral support with economic and technical assistance.', 'The offer would be made with equal frankness to both sides; and all the world would be watching the response of each side. I sincerely believe that an American presidential initiative for peace, honestly intended and resolutely pursued, would not be lightly rejected by either side. And I promise to waste no time in taking this initiative.', 'For I have always believed that there is no real conflict or contradiction between the genuine aspirations of the Arab nations and the genuine aspirations of Israel. The Arab peoples rose to freedom and independence in the very years which saw the rise of Israel. From the cooperation of these two awakened nationalisms could come a new golden age for the Middle East. But from their destructive vendetta can come nothing but misery and poverty and the risk of war.', 'The Middle East needs water, not war; tractors, not tanks; bread, not bombs. There is already little enough available in the way of financial and physical resources for either side to be devoting its energies to huge defense budgets. The present state of tensions serves only the worst interests of Arab and Israeli alike. But a new spirit of comity could well serve the highest ideals of both.', 'For the original Zionist philosophy has always maintained that the people of Israel would use their national genius not for selfish purposes but for the enrichment and glory of the entire Middle East. The earliest leaders of the Zionist movement spoke of a Jewish state which would have no military power and which would be content with victories of the spirit.', 'The compulsions of a harsh and inescapable necessity have compelled Israel to abandon this hope. But I cannot believe that Israel has any real desire to remain indefinitely a garrison state surrounded by fear and hate. And I cannot believe that the Arab world would not find a better basis for unity in a united attack on all their accumulated social problems - an attack in which they could benefit immensely from a closer cooperation with the people of Israel.', 'The technical skills and genius of Israel have already brought their blessings to Burma and to Ethiopia. Still other nations in Asia and in Africa are eager to benefit from the special skills available in that bustling land. Why should the Middle East alone be cut off from this partnership? And why should not the people of Israel receive the blessings available to them from association with the Arab world?', 'When we think of the possibilities of this association, an emotion of soaring hope replaces our somber anxieties about the Middle East. Ancient rivers would give their power to new industries. The desert would yield to civilization. Disease would be eradicated, especially the disease that strikes down helpless children. The blight of poverty would be replaced by the blessings of abundance.', 'But it is a long and painful step from the era of the boycott to the era of partnership - and that step needs the direct encouragement and help of the White House. The next President of the United States should always be personally available to stimulate every experiment in cooperation, from the joint development of a river, to a reconsideration of the Arab refugee problem, to the crowning mercy of the final reconciliation that can be brought only by a true peace settlement.', 'Peace is our primary objective in the Middle East - and peace is partly our responsibility. ""Seek peace, and pursue it"" commands the psalmist. And that we must do. With open minds, open hearts, and the priceless asset of our American heritage, we shall seek peace in the Middle East, as elsewhere. And when history writes its verdict, let it be said that we pursued the peace with all the courage, all the strength, and all the resourcefulness at our command.', 'In this task, I ask for your assistance, your patience, your wisdom, and your support - until we can say to Jew and Arab alike ""Peace be within thy walls and plenteousness within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions\' sake, I will wish thee prosperity.""']"
16,John F. Kennedy ,"August 30, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, this press conference was called to make an announcement on a subject and I wanted to confine the press conference to that subject but I would be delighted to hold a press conference before I leave here. My present plan is to do that on Friday and, therefore, I would suggest sometime Thursday and I would be delighted then to answer any questions dealing with any subject.', 'In addition I will have some comments to make myself on several subjects, but at that time, if agreeable, I would be delighted to go into any matter of interest to you.', 'Today I would prefer to confine what I have to say and the discussion afterward to this one subject.', 'The Democrats have traditionally held that the officials who man our key posts in defense and foreign policy should be selected for their superior ability, whatever their party affiliation may be. We believe the yardstick should be simply this: Who can do the job best?', 'In the war crisis of 1940, Franklin Roosevelt called to public service many outstanding Republicans, including Henry Stimson and Frank Knox. Similarly, Harry Truman brought into the defense and foreign policy areas many distinguished Republicans, among them Paul Hoffman, John J. McCloy, and Robert Lovett.', ""Unfortunately, in recent years this tradition has not been respected, and I feel we should return to it. The test of capacity to serve in key national security posts should not be a man's party affiliation. It should be how much talent and dedication he can contribute to the Nation."", 'I propose to start the renewal of that tradition right now. I have already appointed a number of advisers on defense and foreign policy problems from my own party. I wish also to have available the broadest range of expert thought in this critical area, without regard to party.', 'For this purpose, I have instituted a series of nonpartisan consultations on problems in the field of national security. In order to assist me in these consultations, I have named a four-man group. Its members are:', '\n  Paul H. Nitze, chairman, president, Foreign Service Educational Foundation; vice chairman, U.S. strategic bombing survey, 1944-46; director, State Department policy planning staff, 1950-53.\n  The Honorable David K. E. Bruce, U.S. Ambassador to France, 1949-52; Under Secretary of State, 1952-53; U.S. Ambassador to Germany, 1957-59.\n  Roswell L. Gilpatric, partner, Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Under Secretary of the Air Force, 1952-53; member, Rockefeller special studies project, 1956-57; chairman of the board of trustees of Aero-Space Corp., private agency responsible for technical supervision of the ballistic missile and military space projects of the Air Force.\n  James A. Perkins, vice president, Carnegie Corp.; member, Gaither Committee appointed by the President in 1957 to survey national security problems.\n', 'This group will consult on my behalf on national security problems with the ablest and most experienced authorities in the Nation, without regard to party.', 'In this dangerous period, it is imperative that we maintain the highest national unity and the utmost responsibility in matters of national security at all times. I will be vigorously criticizing various aspects of current national security policies, but that criticism will be responsible and constructive. Both during the election and during the transfer of power from one administration to the next we must demonstrate to the world that America is united, responsible, and alert - ready and able to meet any crises that may arise.', 'It is with this purpose in mind that I wish to have the benefit at all times of the best advice and counsel I can get, on a nonpartisan basis. Therefore, I have asked Mr. Nitze to undertake this responsibility and he has generously been willing to assume it, and he has been joined by three very dedicated and experienced public servants in the field of national security.', 'If we are successful in this election in November, the United States will be faced, and the incoming administration, with serious and heavy responsibilities in the field of national security. I think the work that this committee can do now in preparation for that period on a nonpartisan basis will be most advantageous to the Nation.', 'Mr. Nitze, perhaps, would make a statement and then I would be glad to answer any questions.', 'Mr. NITZE. The place in which one can probably find the greatest number of people of the type that Senator Kennedy has referred to are the committees that have worked for this administration on problems of national security. That is the Gaither Committee, the Draper Committee, the Boschenstein Committee, and groups of that kind. I have already been in touch with a number of people who have worked on those committees and they are quite prepared and anxious to cooperate with an approach such as that which Senator Kennedy has outlined.', 'QUESTION. What is the party affiliation of these nonpartisan experts that you named here, four of them?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Nitze is a Democrat.', 'Mr. NITZE. I am a Democrat. At one time I was a Republican.', ""Senator KENNEDY. May I say that I have not discussed the party affiliation of the various members and I do not know what Mr. Perkins' affiliation is, and Mr. Gilpatric, I think, is a Democrat, and Mr. Bruce last served both administrations."", 'The point is that it is my hope that they will consult on a non-partisan basis with people from both parties. The list of people that Mr. Nitze has already contacted in order to prepare these consultations include people from both parties. Therefore, I think that I have not the party affiliation.', 'QUESTION. Is there anybody on there who has not already committed himself to this?', 'Mr. NITZE. I do not think Mr. Bruce has taken a public position on this one way or the other. I do not know whether Mr. Perkins has. I have.', 'QUESTION. How, exactly, Senator, or Mr. Nitze, is this committee going to operate? Is this going to funnel ideas to you during the campaign or is this designed to provide ideas if you are elected in November?', 'Senator KENNEDY. May I say it is not planned to funnel ideas to me during the campaign unless there happens to be a matter of a serious national crisis which requires some bipartisan action in the country. Then I would consult with the committee, but otherwise I envision their responsibility to be one of the area from November to January, and not for the campaign. In other words, I will not consult with them about speeches or other matters.', 'QUESTION. Who will this group cooperate or work with - the group under Senator Symington?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I will be commenting later in the week on Senator Symington's responsibility, which deals with a different matter."", 'QUESTION. Will you seek access to such Presidential reports as the Gaither Committee report, and other reports?', 'Mr. NITZE. I should think not. The question is: Would we seek access to such Presidential reports, such as the Gaither Committee report, which have not been released? Two of us on this four-man group were members or at least associated with the Gaither Committee work. We obviously are familiar with that. A number of the people with whom we propose to consult and have already been in touch were members of the Gaither Committee. The world has moved, though, a good deal since 1957, and the situation today is not exactly the situation as it was in 1957. I think it would be improper for us to seek classified information in this connection. I think that would have to await a later date. But I think the type of person with whom we propose to consult is as knowledgeable as anyone can find in the United States, apart from those right at the heart of affairs in the executive branch today. I think this is the best that we can do in this regard today.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, is this four-man group eligible to receive and digest such intelligence as you and Candidate Johnson get from the administration?', ""Senator KENNEDY. No. I think under the conditions suggested by the President at the time of Mr. Dulles' briefing was arranged, I believe he felt that the matters confided to us should be limited to us."", 'QUESTION. Senator, you have had one briefing from Allen Dulles. Have you had any other briefings from any other Government officials since that time?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; but I have asked the administration, and I am going to talk to a representative of theirs from the Defense.', 'QUESTION: When will that be?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I hope this week, in the field of national defense. The President has arranged for me to talk to somebody over there. I have not seen Mr. Dulles since then.', 'QUESTION. Senator, would you explain whether Adlai Stevenson or Chester Bowles will or will not work with this group during the campaign?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I stated at Hyannis Port that I would be talking with Governor Stevenson during the period on the problems of foreign policy, and I will do so. Of course, Congressman Bowles has been helpful in that field for many months. This envisions, however, as I said at the beginning, that we will carry on a nonpartisan consultation. I am talking to them about some of the problems facing us in the field of foreign policy during the campaign. Mr. Nitze's effort will not be connected with the campaign in any way."", 'Mr. NITZE. Senator Kennedy, I might mention the names of some of those with whom we propose to consult. We would propose to consult with Mr. Sprague and Mr. William Foster who worked on the Gaither Committee, and we would propose to consult with some of those that worked on the Draper Committee. Mr. Draper, Mr. George McGee, General Hull, and we propose to consult with Bob Bowie, who is a director of the policy planning staff, for a considerable part of the time, and Arthur Dean, General Smith, Mr. Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Mr. Henry Alexander, who worked on the Boschenstein Committee, and General S. L. A. Marshall of the Detroit Times.', 'We would also hope to get the advice of some of the retired generals, such as in addition to General Hull, Admiral Carney, General Taylor, General Ridgway, General Putt, General Gruenther, and General Bradley and General Gavin, and also some of the scientists who have been closest to the national security problem.', 'QUESTION. Could I ask about Mr. Sprague? I seem to recall his name appearing on one of the committees who inform Vice President Nixon. Does he have a part in this kind of study?', 'Mr. NITZE. Both Mr. Sprague and Mr. Foster I have talked to, and they are thoroughly prepared to consult.', 'QUESTION. Senator, this morning in this prepared announcement you made a very specific point of the importance of bipartisanship in defense and foreign policy. But the predominant accent of the four men that you have mentioned and most of those that I believe Mr. Nitze has just mentioned, with the possible exception of the military, is Democratic.', 'Do you have any specific plans now to include in this general area of discussion people who are widely known as Republicans?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Let me say, as to this four-man committee, I don't know its political division, and certainly the emphasis of its public service has been nonpartisan. Mr. Bruce has served both administrations. While his party registration may be Democratic, I think the emphasis has been nonpartisan in public service. I think the same is true of Mr. Nitze and Mr. Gilpatric and Mr. Perkins. I have no idea what Mr. Perkins' party affiliation is. Evidently Senator Jackson states he is an independent."", 'But the consultations will be on a nonpartisan basis and the people with whom they will consult will include people from both parties. The men whom they consult understand that this is not connected with the campaign, and I will not consult with this committee on matters dealing with the campaign. The emphasis of this committee will be on the period, if we are successful in the election, from November to January.', 'So that we have done at least the best we can to emphasize the fact that this is a matter dealing with public service.', 'QUESTION. Have you had an opportunity to discuss with these four men or did you plan to discuss with them such problems as the suspension of nuclear testing to get their views on the possibility of an agreement on the problems or the question of resuming underground testing before negotiations have ceased between the Soviet Union and the United States?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would certainly hope that the committee would concern itself with the problems of nuclear testing for the period from November to January.', 'QUESTION. You said that these men would not in any sense contribute to your campaign material. You will certainly during your campaign be giving your views on these problems, will you not?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes; that is correct.', 'QUESTION. Would you go to these people for their advice?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; I want to emphasize that this is not connected with the campaign nor will their services be connected with the campaign.', 'QUESTION. Senator, what exactly do you mean when you say the period between November and January. Assuming that you are elected, you have no authority until January. Is this designed to produce a program which you would then use in the new administration if elected or what exactly do you mean?', 'Senator KENNEDY. This is designed to make sure, if I am successful, that the months of January, February, and March would be used most effectively.', 'QUESTION. What form of end result do you expect these consultations to take? Will there be one large report or will there be a series of position papers, or what?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think perhaps after the committee has met and after they have functioned for a while, we can make a determination as to what form their report should be.', 'QUESTION. Mr. Nitze has pointed out that most of the people who will be consulted have served on advisory boards to the Eisenhower administration. On what then do you base your charge that the Eisenhower administration has not respected the tradition of using people without consideration of their partisan affiliation?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't recall that in the positions of responsibility - this is the point that I want to emphasize this morning - I think my statement suggested I don't think there has been great bipartisan effort or the same effort to secure bipartisan implementation of administration policies as well as developing those policies that there was during the international crisis years of the Roosevelt administration. I do not recall in the Department of Defense or particularly in the field of foreign policy any high level Democrats from the previous administration."", 'QUESTION. You say the group will consult with the most experienced authorities in the Nation. Does that include Mr. Gates and Mr. Douglas and General Lemnitzer, or will you not discuss the problems with people who are running the Departments today?', 'Mr. NITZE. I think we would seek such information as they would be prepared to give us.', 'QUESTION. From the Defense Department?', 'Mr. NITZE. That is correct.', 'QUESTION. Would one of the important Republicans you might consult be Governor Rockefeller?', 'Mr. NITZE. Yes; and Mr. Gilpatric was one of the members of his group.', 'QUESTION. Have you talked with the Governor?', 'Mr. NITZE. No.', 'QUESTION. Would it be fair to infer from what you have said about the bipartisanship appointments that you would retain, if elected, in your administration, those distinguished members of the present administration who met that test.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes; I would hope we would secure the best talent we could get, and I say particularly in the responsible positions involving national security, without regard to party.', 'QUESTION. What happens to this committee in the untoward event that the voters should not subscribe to your wisdom and select Vice President Nixon?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am sure that I would hope that under those conditions that the work would not have been in vain, and that the Vice President might be interested in the judgments of the committee.', ""QUESTION. Senator, Senator Jackson has a committee report which we understand won't be released until after the election. Will the members of this committee be allowed access to the findings of the Jackson committee report?"", 'Senator JACKSON. Well, that information will be made available after the election to the winner, and the whole burden of our effort as you know is a nonpartisan study on national security policy machinery. We are withholding the main report in connection with those recommendations until after election.', 'QUESTION. But in the interim period, will this committee be allowed access to your files?', ""Senator JACKSON. Well, all of the testimony has been made public, and if there is any classified information that either Senator Kennedy's committee would desire or Mr. Nixon's advisory people would like to have, certainly if there is no problem of confidential relationship involved it will be available to anyone, and it has been right along."", ""QUESTION. Senator, groping for a little bit more of a tangible function of Mr. Nitze's committee, would it be fair to infer that it will consult with whatever budgetary and fiscal advisers you now have or will have, and come up with a recommendation to you if you should be elected for the defense part of the budget?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I would think certainly if I am successful that I would consult with this committee on the requests we would make in the field of both the Defense Department and State Department on appropriations.', 'QUESTION. Senator, does this announcement indicate that despite the views of the Vice President and the President and Senator Smathers, that you still consider the defense problem a major issue in the campaign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the relative position of the United States and the Soviet-Sino power is an issue in this campaign. Whether sufficient is being done in that area is a matter of national importance.', 'QUESTION. From whom will you take advice on the African crisis?', 'Senator KENNEDY. As you know, Governor Harriman went to the Congo and I will talk to him when he gets back. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee and we have some information in the committee, and generally I think I can learn that.', 'QUESTION. Why did you not put him on this committee?', 'Senator KENNEDY. This is dealing with a different matter. This is dealing with the postcampaign period, and Mr. Harriman is discussing the fall campaign.', 'QUESTION. Thank you very much, Senator.', '(The press conference concluded at 11:20 a.m.)']"
17,John F. Kennedy ,"August 30, 1960","['President Hanover, Chairman Hollander, Secretary-Treasurer Garno, Legislative Director Corbett, and my friends of the New York State AFL-CIO:', 'I truly regret that I cannot be with you in person today, but I know you will understand what keeps me here in Washington. As this session of Congress moves into its final stages, the long overdue improvements in the minimum wage law still await final action by the Congress. As you know, this matter is now in conference. It was, therefore, impossible for me to leave the Capitol at this critical time.', 'I accept, with gratitude, your endorsement of my candidacy. The support and encouragement which I have received from your organization, and from the rest of the American labor movement, fill me with pride.', ""I am proud of this support. I know that the American labor movement wants for America what I want for America: the elimination of poverty and unemployment, the reestablishment of America's position of leadership in the world, the end of racial discrimination everywhere in our society. I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose: complacency, unemployment, economic stagnation, and national insecurity."", 'I believe in the things the labor movement believes in and fights for. You have indicated, by your endorsement, that you believe that I, and the Democratic Party, can provide the leadership which will win that fight. I promise you that I will do my best to be worthy of your expression of faith in me.', 'Let me give you a report on the progress we have made this session.', 'I had hoped that we would be able to enact an amendment to the social security law which would provide prepaid medical insurance for our retired citizens. I had hoped that we would be able to amend the Taft-Hartley Act so as to validate common situs picketing. I had hoped that we would be able to enact much-needed legislation on the problems of housing and education.', 'There appears to he no chance for any of these measures at this session. I am still trying to put together an up-to-date minimum wage law which will provide a more realistic minimum and will extend the protection of that humane law to millions of underpaid workers. Even on this bill, however, we are meeting determined Republican opposition.', ""It is inconceivable to me that anyone could oppose these measures. How can a nation as rich as ours tolerate substandard wages? How can we justify the absence of a decent program of health care for our older citizens? Why must so many of our children attend crowded and inadequate schools, and live in squalid homes? Why must we continue to have unfair and arbitrary restrictions on labor's right to use its economic power in support of its legitimate collective bargaining objectives?"", 'But, we have just begun to fight. If the American people give us their support at the polls in November, and elect a Democratic administration and a liberal Congress, we will be able to give this country the legislation and the leadership which it so badly needs.', 'The Republicans tells us that we are dreamers, and that we are making impossible promises and misleading the American people. This charge is one which we of the Democratic Party are quite used to. And it is one which the American people are used to. This country was built by men who were called ""dreamers"" by those of weak heart and little faith.', 'In 1776 there were men who said that the idea that this Nation could be free and independent was an idle dream.', 'In 1789 there were men who said that the idea that the several States could be molded into a strong Union was an idle dream.', 'In 1860 there were men who said that the idea that the slaves could be freed was an idle dream.', 'In 1932 there were men who said that the idea that we could once again regain full employment and a booming economy was an idle dream.', 'Yet all these things were accomplished, in spite of the doubters. And I say to you that the great program of the Democratic Party will also be accomplished, in spite of the doubters.', 'Fifty years or so ago the American labor movement was little more than a group of dreamers, and look at it now. Nearly 14 million men and women belong to unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. From coast to coast, in factories, stores, warehouses, and business establishments of all kinds, industrial democracy is at work. Employees, represented by free and democratic trade unions of their own choosing, participate actively in determining their wages, hours, and working conditions. Their living standards are the highest in the world. Their job rights are protected by collective bargaining agreements. They have fringe benefits that were unheard of less than a generation ago. Is there any better monument to the unlimited ability of Americans to turn dreams to reality than the American labor movement?', 'As we enter the new decade of the sixties, America faces challenges greater than any which it has faced before. This is no time for complacency. This is no time to abandon the drive and the optimism and the imaginative creativity which has characterized this country since its birth. This is no time for timidity or doubt. This is a time for boldness and energy. This is a time for stouthearted men who can turn dreams into reality. This is a time when America once again needs the leadership of the Democratic Party, which has led this country successfully through every major challenge it has faced in this century.']"
18,John F. Kennedy ,"September 01, 1960","['QUESTION. Senator, on page 3 of your statement, you say, ""A majority of the Republicans voted against civil rights, while we were supporting civil rights.""', 'By ""we"" you mean the undersigned, not all the Democrats.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, the undersigned.', 'QUESTION. You have 42 here, and there are 66 Democratic Senators. Does that mean that the other 24 are opposed or are you united on it?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; but these Senators all voted for the five measures that I mentioned in the statement.', 'QUESTION. That would imply that only a minority of the Democratic Senators voted that way.', 'Senator KENNEDY. It implies that these Senators voted for all five of these measures.', 'QUESTION. Yes, but that is still only less than half of the Democratic Senators.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think you can count and I can count.', 'QUESTION. Yes; that is right. But how can it be the Democratic program, then, if only 24 out of 66 are for it?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The program that I am announcing is my view and the view of these Senators.', 'Senator CLARK. And also the view of the platform.', 'QUESTION. How can it be carried out in the Senate?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We are attempting to carry that out.', 'Senator CLARK. We will have more than half.', 'Senator KENNEDY. There were others who voted for these measures. We will have their support.', 'QUESTION. I notice your running mate, Senator Johnson, is not included here. Does he endorse or support this statement?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am sure there were other Senators who would have signed it, but we asked the Senators who voted on these five key amendments to support it.', ""QUESTION. Senator, in the light of Senator Clark's motion to table the civil rights bill during this session, do you think he can adequately explain his position and your position as well on civil rights?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. Obviously I do. That is why I asked him to serve on this committee. Senator Clark's record is well known. He can comment on it."", 'Senator CLARK: For myself, I may say I have no doubts on that subject.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the reasons for the tabling motion were suggested in my statement.', 'QUESTION. Senator, on civil rights next year, will you run into the same difficulties that you ran into this session with other legislation, in the House Rules Committee and in the possibility of extended debate in the Senate? What do you propose to do about those things or to urge Congress to do about those things if you are elected?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Of course, the rules of the House and the rules of the Senate have to be determined by the Members of the House and the Members of the Senate. I have voted - I think my record is clear on that matter, when it was suggested by Senator Anderson in 1953 and again in 1957. If I am a Member the Senate, I will express my views on that occasion.', 'Senator CLARK. I would like to say in that regard that I think we take the platform a lot more seriously than some of you gentlemen do. I think you are going to find that this platform is going to be implemented when Senator Kennedy becomes President.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, if you are elected President, will you urge the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives to change the rules so that legislation may be brought to the floor with more ease than it is now?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would say I think it would probably be inappropriate for me to comment on the rules of the House as a Senator, as a presidential candidate. Well, therefore, I don't plan to do it. My views on the rules of the Senate, as I say, are well known because I have commented on them and have voted on them. I think there are Members of the House who are extremely concerned that the rules of the House will be responsive to the needs of the times. But that is a decision which the Members of the House must reach."", 'QUESTION. Would you encourage them, Senator?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, we will make a judgment on what my responsibility would be in that field next January. But I do think that the Members of the House have to decide what the House rules are.', 'QUESTION. Senator, in view of the problems that they had passing the civil rights bill this year, would you encourage the public to believe that they could properly expect that passage of the full civil rights plank in your platform next spring?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think all we can do is commit ourselves to that object. I don't think there is any doubt that there is a great deal of difficulty in trying to pass civil rights legislation. We have passed two bills, and in neither one of those bills do I think there was everything that some of us wanted in them. But at least they were progress. This is a difficult fight. It is not easy. If it were easy, we would not be talking about it now. But all I am saying is that we are committing ourselves to the fight."", 'QUESTION. Senator, in view of the issues that were in this short session, and all over the world, could you tell us, sir, how it happens that as the session ends your first major press conference is devoted to civil rights?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, only because I do think we should give a clear explanation of our position on a very important question. There has not been an opportunity to pass in this session of the Congress the kind of civil rights bill which I thought should have been passed. I think that it is an appropriate time to consider the matter. We were not able to do anything in this session, but I would not want our inability to do anything about the platform in civil rights in this session to mislead anyone that we were not going to try to do it in the proper time.', 'QUESTION. Are there also some votes in this issue?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would say there are a good many arguments about that question, and you are familiar with them all. But I do think it is proper, when we go out and ask people for our votes in the North, the South, the East and the West, that at least they have my view on this question. I will say that I am sure my view will not be totally endorsed, what we have said here today, politically.', ""QUESTION. Senator Johnson's name is absent from this list. Does that mean that he does not join you?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. The question was why Senator Johnson's name is not on the list? We did not attempt to secure the support, the signature, of Senators who had not voted for what we considered to be the five key amendments that were attempted to be tied to the civil rights bill this year. I think a good many Members of the Senate would have stated their support of the platform. But we confined it to those Senators who had this year voted on these five key measures alike."", 'QUESTION. You did not ask Senator Johnson to sign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I did not. I informed him I was making this statement, but we confined it to those Members.', 'QUESTION. Sir, are you saying today that civil rights legislation will be the first piece of domestic legislation that you will urge to a Democratic majority, if there is one in the Senate, to push for it, should you become President in January?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, I am saying that we are going to do the preliminary work under the leadership of Senator Clark and Congressman Celler. Early in the session we will attempt for the bill to be introduced and we will attempt to secure action on the bill early in the session. Therefore, it is a matter of great importance.', 'QUESTION. This pledge to obtain consideration of a civil rights bill next year follows two other developments, one the large crowds that Vice President Nixon is drawing in the South and also the fact that religion is becoming more of an issue in the South. Does that mean that you are going to concentrate more in the South and feel that the so-called solid South is going to drift away?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No. We are merely restating our position taken in the platform which was taken before both of those events.', 'QUESTION. Senator, how many Southern States do you expect to carry?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't know."", 'QUESTION. Since Senator Clark feels---', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't know how many Northern States we are going to carry, either."", 'QUESTION. That you people are considering the platform more seriously than some of us are, may I digress to another field as long as I stay within the platform? You mentioned about a week ago that you were standing on the platform, including its pledge to repeal the authorization for the States right-to-work laws. In that connection, sir, I ask you, since you in March 1955, I believe, were a cosponsor of S. 1269 which called for changes in the Taft-Hartley law, including repeal of the authorization for the States right-to-work laws, does that represent your present thinking, particularly in view of the Democratic platform pledge to that effect?', ""Senator KENNEDY. My view about right-to-work - I have never supported right-to-work bills. I don't think it is a---"", 'QUESTION. Sir, you were a cosponsor listed on that bill.', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is it. That is why I say I have never supported right-to-work laws.', 'QUESTION. In other words, your present thinking is that you not only support the platform but personally would support a repeal of States right-to-work laws?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I gave a hearty answer to the North Carolina delegation. I don't know when that matter might come before the Congress. I cannot make that judgment. It has been before the Congress since 1948. It has not come to the floor for a vote. Therefore, I have never stated that the platform would be implemented in every way immediately. But I do make the statement that my view on the question has been indicated on many occasions."", ""QUESTION. Didn't S.1269 in 1955 come before the Labor Committee?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I do not believe that it ever came to a vote, no. That is what I meant, that it had not come for any votes.', ""QUESTION. It didn't come up for a vote?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. That is right.', ""QUESTION. Why does civil rights have this No.1 priority whereas the labor platform planning doesn't seem to have any importance at all?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. It has importance. I am now talking about civil rights. I will be talking about labor in the campaign.', 'QUESTION. You said it did not have any particular priority on bringing up the right to work.', ""Senator KENNEDY. That is right; I don't."", 'QUESTION. This is being worked on before inauguration?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is right. I think this is extremely important. I think it involves a great question that is of great interest to all American citizens and I think it is good for us to state our views on it.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, did you anticipate that you would have as much trouble with your legislative program in this postconvention session in the Senate?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No.', 'QUESTION. In retrospect, do you think the session was a mistake?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No. I think we had to come back. I think it would have been a much bigger mistake for us to say that we were not going to do anything about these matters, and that we were going to adjourn and not do anything about some of the appropriation bills, the Antarctic Treaty, education, housing, minimum wage, and care of the aged, that we were not going to try. We did not do as well as I thought we should have done. But I do think it was better coming back and making the effort because we can now get a clearer picture on what the problems are in attempting to carry out this kind of legislation. I think we bad a good experience in the last 3 weeks. I am delighted we came back.', 'QUESTION. Senator, do you feel you have been hurt by this session?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the legislation has been hurt. I think the final political effects, I would not make a judgment on yet, because the conclusion I draw from this session, and there are different conclusions that are being drawn, but my conclusion is that it is impossible to carry out this sort of legislation against the wishes of a President. I think that there is not any doubt that a Congress can block the President, and President Truman discussed that in the 1948 campaign. But there also is not any doubt that a President can block a Congress. When you have a President who is not supporting this legislation but is opposed to it, who threatens to veto it if it comes m a form not satisfactory to him, it is extremely difficult to carry action in both the House and Senate, and in a short period of time.', 'QUESTION. Actually the President did not veto any of these bills. The bills were blocked by the coalition of southern members in your own party and the Republicans.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes but you will recall in the discussion on medical care to the aged being tied to social security, offered as an amendment to the Kerr bill, the minority leader made it clear that the President would veto any bill that had the Anderson amendment in it. Therefore, any Member who was anxious to secure the passage of the Kerr bill had a good argument for not voting for our amendment, and that is ""If I vote for is amendment, the total bill will be dead,"" and it is better to get some action than no action. The same thing happened to a degree in the minimum wage. I am not saying that some members of the Democratic Party did not vote against us. Quite obviously they did in both the House and Senate. But if you take the minimum wage conference as I said yesterday, every Democrat participating in that conference but one voted for the $1.25, every Republican participating in that conference except one voted against it. Six out of seven supported the $1.25 and six out of seven voted against it. Because we lost one Democrat we were defeated in the conference. I don\'t deny that the Democrats voted against us, but they have been aided because they had the argument that if this legislation passed, it would be met by a veto. I have some confidence, even though I recognize that in two parties there will be elements in both parties that don\'t have the same views, but I do think that with the support of a President who does believe in this legislation and fights for it, we can secure majority support. I will say there is quite a division in the Republican Party. A majority voted against the minimum wage, but 15 Senators voted for the $1.25.', 'QUESTION. May I ask you one question about the question of leadership involved in this campaign which you and your opponent have both made quite a point of? Do you feel it reflects on you that you as the new leader of the party would not be able to get through your own Senate the very program that you pledged yourself to get through?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We did get through minimum wage, on which I had a personal commitment. We failed by five votes in getting through social security for the aged. But I think I have explained some of the difficulties connected with that bill. On the question of housing and education, we had passed it in the Senate, as you know, and we could not get it out of the Rules Committee. In the case of both of those bills, in the House Rules Committee, not one of the Republican members would vote to bring either one of those bills to the floor of the House. My understanding is that the only way that they reach an agreement to permit the minimum wage was because they had an understanding with the House conferees that they would not go beyond the House bill. So I think we did not do as well as I had hoped we could do. But I must say in attempting to analyze what happened in this session, I think that it was the result of a President who opposed us, using the vast constitutional powers that he has, plus the fact that some members of my party do not support this position. But they have not for many years. But two-thirds of them do.', ""QUESTION. Senator, would you like to make an appraisal of the Vice President's role in this session?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. No. No; I am not going to discuss the Vice President until he is out of the hospital.', 'QUESTION. Would you discuss him in another context? Governor Almond of Virginia said yesterday that he thought the Vice President was surreptitiously encouraging the introduction of the religious issue into the campaign. Would you comment on that?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am not sure - I am sure that the Vice President does not want this campaign, and I hope the members of his party feel the same way, I am sure the responsible ones do; do not want this campaign to hinge on a religious debate. I am sure that is not the Vice President's idea of a successful campaign, whether he wins or loses."", ""QUESTION. Senator, Communists reproach us because in this country, full of agricultural surpluses, families can't afford to buy the food that we have. As President, are you going to be able to do better than the Republicans in 8 years with the cost of living going up all the time? How would you bring the cost of living down for ordinary people, particularly food? You were in West Virginia; you know what it is there."", ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, Miss Craig, I am not running on the expectation that I am going to bring about a reduction in the cost of food in the United States in the 1960's. I hope that the increase in the cost of food will not take place, but I don't think that anybody in office today can tell you that the cost of food is going to be reduced in the 1960's."", ""QUESTION. Isn't that a reproach to capitalism? We have the food and people can't get it."", ""Senator KENNEDY. No. What I would like to see in the 1960's is to make sure that every American has a standard of living and an income which would permit him to buy the food we produce. Unless the Federal Government is going to embark on a program of subsidizing directly each food item that appears, you are going to have to pay a price for food which permits the farmer to make a decent income. I hope that it is going to be possible for us. In the ease of West Virginia, the problem there is not the cost of food, though I hope what he finally pays for it could be lessened, but the problem there is that there are not any jobs. If the people had jobs, they could afford food, but they don't have any jobs. I do think there are some things that the Federal Government can do about that. I never thought that a farm program would provide a reduction in the final cost in the 1960's of food items. I don't think that is going to happen."", 'QUESTION. Is it not the history that the cost of living outclimbs wages all the time?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, it is not the history since the war. Wages have gone up more than the cost of living has gone up since 1945. But the problem is that there are those in the bottom part of the economic ladder where wages have not kept up, which is one of the reasons why I think it is unfortunate that this Congress defeated the minimum wage bill. To talk about constitutional issues connected with this bill as an argument for not paying a decent wage I think is most unfortunate, and that is what the real issue was in this discussion in the Congress. It was not a constitutional debate. It was a question of whether these people in business, making that kind of an income, would pay a decent wage. The problem is that the unusual workers are able to maintain their wages in relationship to the cost of living, that the people at the bottom are not. That is why the Federal Government has a responsibility.', 'QUESTION. Senator, do you think that the planned visit of Premier Khrushchev to this country, the United Nations, has a real significance on this campaign? Do you think it is going to in effect upstage you and the Vice President during the campaign?', 'QUESTION. We could not hear the question.', ""Senator KENNEDY. The question was whether I thought Mr. Khrushchev's visit to the United States would have an effect of upstaging Mr. Nixon and myself in the campaign."", ""The problem may happen, but I don't think that is his central purpose. But I don't think that concerns us, really."", 'QUESTION. What do you think is the significance?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, Mr. Khrushchev wants to come because he wants to present the Russian view on disarmament and probably other related questions in a major forum. That is why he is coming. I hope while he is here that he understands that while we are glad, as part of the United Nations charter, to serve as host to any foreign government, and those who make up the delegations, that we are involved in an important campaign. I am sure it can be explained to him before he comes that he should respect our tradition of settling this matter in our own way in our own country. His involvement in it would be unwelcomed by us.', 'QUESTION. Senator, did you say that you are not going to discuss the Vice President until he is out of the hospital?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is right.', 'QUESTION. Does that mean no personal references in your speeches?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is right.', 'QUESTION. But you will resume?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, we will see what happens then. I may discuss some of the Republican shortcomings but not Mr. Nixon's."", 'QUESTION. You are not going to mention his part in any of them?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Unless I can praise him', 'QUESTION. Do you mean that as long as he stays in the hospital, he has sanctuary?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, that is right. And I may go there.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, this morning Congressman Powell said if he is chairman of the House Labor Committee next year, as he normally would be, that he expects to appoint an FEPC Committee right away with himself as chairman and attempt to get FEPC legislation through. Would you endorse that effort and expect it as part of your civil rights program?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I have never discussed it with Congressman Powell. The Democratic platform calls for FEPC. I have supported it when I was in the House of Representatives when it came up. I would feel that we should take action in every available area to expand civil rights, jobs and all the rest of it.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I have a personal question to ask you. There have been reports that your father has removed himself from the public eye because he considers himself controversial. I would like to ask you, sir, whether you have discussed this matter with the Ambassador and whether he intends to have any active role in the campaign.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, as far as the first question, he has gone every year in the month of August to Europe in the last 15 years, and he went this year. He was not, therefore, exiled, but went willingly. He is coming back Sunday, I think, Sunday or Monday, as he always does, for his birthday.', 'Now, on the second part, I think he is not going to participate actively in the campaign, but he never has. But I will be talking to him, frequently.', 'QUESTION. Senator, would you tell us how you voted in the labor committee on the Goldwater antidiscrimination amendment to the situs picketing bill?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think I voted to table it. I do not think anybody suggested, including Senator Goldwater, that that was any effort except an attempt to hold up the situs picketing bill. I do not think anyone would say anything but that. Senator Goldwater would agree to that.', 'Senator CLARK. This would clearly prevent its passage.', 'Senator KENNEDY. If you would say, am I in favor of that kind of legislation, I would say I am, but that is not the purpose that held the situs picketing because if there had been interest it could have come up any time this year, this bill.', 'QUESTION. Would you accept an invitation to talk to Mr. Khrushchev while he was here, or do you intend to take the initiative?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I do not intend to take any initiative. If I were invited and the Vice President invited, I would undertake to see Mr. Khrushchev , but only if the invitation were extended to us both and if it worked out satisfactorily to both of us.', 'QUESTION. This morning, someone said that in his opinion the election would be decided in New York State. Would you agree?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think New York is a key to winning the campaign, but I don't know. It is going to be decided in a lot of States, but I think New York is essential. But so are a lot of States. Some people in other States feel it will be decided there. I suppose it is decided by a combination of electoral votes, but I would think New York would be essential to securing the necessary combination."", 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.']"
19,John F. Kennedy ,"September 02, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Ed Muskie; my friend and your next Governor, Frank Coffin; Lucia Cormier, Dave Roberts, John Donovan, ladies and gentlemen, I came here to Maine to start this campaign in my own backyard. I do so not merely because I live in Massachusetts. I do so because here in this part of the United States we have in a very real sense the same feeling of a new frontier that I talked about in Los Angeles when I accepted the Democratic nomination. And I am here also because we have in this State, I think, a singular opportunity to send some distinguished people to hold positions of responsibility in the Government of this State and Nation in the next 4 years.', ""I must say I don't come here and speak for them just because they are Democrats. I think in this election the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are means to an end, not an end in themselves. They are a means of providing gifted men and women for the service of this country in a difficult and dangerous time."", 'I think that Lucia Cormier, Frank Coffin, Dave Roberts, and John Donovan follow in the tradition of Ed Muskie, who was chosen by a State which had been Republican, not because he was a Democrat, but because they thought that he was the kind of a man that they wanted to speak for them in this State and in the Nation. And what is true of Ed Muskie is true of Frank Coffin, it is true of Lucia Cormier, it is true of Dave Roberts, and it is true of John Donovan. Adversity brings out the best in a man and in a country. And it brings out the best in a political party.', ""The reason that the Democrats of this State have selected unusual people is because it isn't easy. Now, the challenges that face this country aren't easy.

The President of the United States represents not only the Democrats of this country, he represents all of the people around the world who want to live in freedom, who look to us for hope and leadership.', 'I must say that if I am elected President of the United States, I am not going to attempt only to select men for positions of high leadership who happen to have the word ""Democrat"" after their name.', 'When Franklin Roosevelt became President in 1932 he selected three Republicans to be members of his first Cabinet. When President Truman was the President, he selected men like John McCloy, Robert Lovett. He continued men like James Forrestal. He brought John Foster Dulles into the State Department to negotiate the Japanese Treaty. He secured for the great positions of responsibility the best men and women he could get.', 'That is what we are going to do in the future.', 'Can you name me a man or woman in the great offices of this country in the last 8 years involving the security of all of our people who was a member of the Democratic Party, comparable to the positions held by Knox, Stimson, and all the rest during World War II and afterward?', 'The reason is simple.', ""We believe in securing the best for our country because nothing but the best will do, because we believe this is the best country, and because we realize that it isn't the President of the United States that is in trouble, it isn't the Republican Party that is in trouble, it is the country that is in trouble and it is we who are in trouble. The reason we are in trouble is because we are faced by a dedicated and determined adversary who recognizes that we live in a revolutionary world and who is reaching toward the future. I don't want it said that here in the 1950's and the 1960's we began to be passed by - that kind of leadership is what we need, a helping hand. [Applause and laughter.]"", 'In any case, we are here today to ask your help. We have about 65 days between now and the first part of November when this election is going to be decided. In spite of all the debate between political parties, we have a common interest today to select the best people we can get, people who recognize the kind of State we live in, the kind of country we live in, the kind of world we live in; people who look to the future, who are ready to break into that future, who are ready to lead, and who want this country to move again.', 'Thank you very much.']"
20,John F. Kennedy ,"September 02, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Miss Cormier, Frank Coffin, Jim Oliver, John Donovan, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks and appreciation to Ed Muskie, my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, and I am delighted that I have had a chance to come here in this State on the opening day of a long campaign. As you probably may have heard, we leave tomorrow at 9 o'clock to speak at Anchorage at a dinner there, at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening, and then come back on Sunday night and go to Detroit. I suppose it took about a year and a half to 2 years to go to Alaska a few short years ago. But you can go to Alaska now in the space of a day, almost as fast as the sun. It is one more dramatic indication of the kind of world in which we live, the changing face of this world and the changing face of our country."", 'My grandfather and my mother spent many summers of their life within a short radius of this city in Old Orchard Beach. My father and mother came to this State on their honeymoon. I know Maine well because I live in Massachusetts. [Laughter.] It is not so different there; it is not so bad in Massachusetts. [Laughter.] I want some of you to go to Boston sometime and see what it is like.', ""I sit with Ed Muskie and I sit across, in the Congress, from Frank Coffin and from your Distinguished Congressman. Actually, as you know, the Constitution of the United States provided that the duty of the Senators should be confined to approving treaties and approving presidential appointments. But the Constitution of the United States gave great authority to Members of the House of Representatives, and particularly two authorities. One to raise taxes and the other to spend your money. That is what Frank Coffin has been doing for the last 2 years. [Laughter.] And if you have any complaints, don't take them to Ed Muskie or myself, but talk to Jim Oliver and Frank Coffin and all the rest of them that have been doing that. [Laughter.]"", 'In any case, he has done a good job. He is the kind of young leader which our party needs. But more important than that - which our country needs. We cannot possibly afford to waste the talent that we have. Therefore, I am confident, and I say this as a fellow New Englander who is concerned that here in the oldest section of the United States, that we, too, should move ahead. I am confident that this State will give him a ringing endorsement as their Governor, and that you will send to the U.S. Senate a distinguished Senator in Lucia Cormier.', ""I sat in the U.S. Senate and saw our efforts to obtain medical care for the aged on social security fail by five votes in the U.S. Senate two weeks ago. If Miss Cormier had been a member of that body, she would have voted with us and we would have needed only four more votes. A Senator's voice is important. Decisions hang on the judgment of a few people. The contests are close, and, therefore, I urge this State to send her to Washington to speak with a voice of progress and vigor from an old section of the United States. And Jim Oliver and Dave Roberts and John Donovan to sit there in the House of Representatives and speak for Maine."", ""This is an important election. The last Democratic President of the United States was Franklin Pierce from the State of New Hampshire, from this section of the country. It took him 35 ballots to be nominated and he accepted reluctantly. It didn't happen that way in Los Angeles. I ran for the office of the Presidency after 14 years in the house of Representatives and the Senate because I have come to realize more than ever that this is the great office, that the power that the Constitution gives the President, the power and the responsibility which the force of events have thrust upon the President, makes this the center of action, makes this the mainspring, the wellspring, of the American system. Only the President speaks for the United States. I speak for Massachusetts. And Ed Muskie speaks for Maine. And Clair Engle speaks for California. But the President of the United States speaks for Maine and Massachusetts and California and Hawaii and Alaska. And he speaks not only for the United States, but he speaks for all those who desire to be free, who are willing to bear the burdens of freedom, who are willing to meet its responsibilities, who recognize that freedom is not license, but, instead, places a heavier burden upon us than any other political system."", ""This is an important election, as Ed Muskie said. I come here to Maine as a neighbor, but I don't come here saying that if I am elected that my only interest is going to be the protection of New England. That isn't what New England wants in a President. They want someone who understands this section and its needs, but they also want someone who will speak for the country in a difficult and trying period."", 'Demosthenes, when he was trying to rally the Athenians against Philip of Macedonia, said that ""If you analyze it correctly, you will conclude that our critical situation is chiefly due to men who try to please the citizens rather than to tell them what they need to hear.""', ""I hope that that will not be said about any Democratic candidate for any office, from the lowest office in the county to the President of the United States. I don't run for the office of the Presidency to tell you what you want to hear. I run for the office of the Presidency because in a dangerous time we need to be told what we must do if we are going to maintain our freedom and the freedom of those who depend upon us."", 'A well-known and distinguished Republican once said, ""I am a liberal abroad and a conservative at home."" I could not disagree more. You cannot possibly separate the world around us and carry out one set of policies there, and here in the United States drag down our efforts to move ahead.', 'The two Presidents of the United States in this century who had the most vigorous and vital foreign policy were Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, and the reason for it was because the 14 points of Woodrow Wilson were directly related to his new freedom and the Four Freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt were directly related to the idealistic aspirations of the New Deal. The effort to make a better life for people in our own country reflected itself around the world.', 'You cannot be successful abroad unless you are successful at home because every problem that you have here in the United States has its implications abroad. If you have a bad and weak school system in this country, with poorly paid teachers, then you do not educate a child, and when that child is not educated you can never get it hack. He has lost his chance. And the Soviet Union works night and day to turn out the best educated citizens they can get in the disciplines of science, mathematics, and engineering.', 'Every time we waste our food in a hungry world here in this country, that affects the foreign policy and the security of the United States. Every time we deny to one of our citizens the right of equality of opportunity before the law, the right to send their children to schools on the basis of equality, so much weaker are we in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, where we are a white minority in a colored world.', ""I don't hold the view at all that we can isolate ourselves into a system, while around the world we attempt to carry on the principles of the American Revolution. They are intermixed. If we are successful here, if we are moving ahead with a dynamic economy, then we shall be successful abroad."", 'Do you think it is any accident that the decline of American prestige relative to that of the Communist world takes places at a time when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world?', 'I visited the Soviet Union in 1939. The Soviet Union was isolated, with countries hostile to her on every boundary. Today, 21 years later, China, Eastern Europe, her influence in the Middle East which has been an object of Russian policy for 300 years - you cannot possibly be satisfied that the power and influence of the United States is increasing relatively as fast as that of the Sino-Soviet bloc, and you do not have to look 90 miles beyond the coast of the United States if you think different.', ""I visited Havana 8 years ago and I was informed that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba. He is not today. He cannot even get to see the Foreign Minister's assistant. This is the problem that we face in 1960."", 'What shall we do in this country? What shall we do around the world to reverse the trend of history, to take those actions here in this country and throughout the globe that shall make people feel that in the year of 1961 the American giant began to stir again, the great American boiler began to fire up again, this country began to move ahead again?', 'Those who live in Africa, Asia, and Latin America began to wonder what America was going to do and not merely what the Soviet Union was doing or the Chinese Communists. And the young men and women, those who are students, those who teach them, those who represent the intellectual vitality of these countries, began to look to the United States as a dynamic country which carried with it a hope for a better life for people all over the world.', 'Should we be astonished at what is happening in the Congo today when they have less than a handful, probably less than 14, college graduates in the whole country? When there is no officer who is a Negro who is native in any of their armed forces? Do you think that a country can manage a system as sensitive as democracy when it does not have the chance to educate its people ?', 'In Laos, Cambodia, the Congo, and Cuba we have seen in the last few years the tide turn against us. But I do not concern myself with the feeling that the decline of the United States has set in. This is a great country. It represents the best system of government there is. It represents in a real sense the kind of system that everyone wants to live under because it fits a basic aspiration of human beings, to live in an independent nation in a free way themselves.', 'We have the best system. We have every chance. We have the most power. We can, I believe, be a decisive influence in a difficult and trying period.', 'I ask your support in this campaign. This is not a contest merely between the Vice President and myself. This is a contest between all of us who believe that the future belongs to the United States. All of the men and women of talent and industry and interest and vitality who wish to serve this country, who wish to play a part in its life, I ask the support of all of you in this campaign in the State of Maine.

Bernard Boutin, Marie Devine, Mr. Mayor, Senator Muskie, Romeo Champagne, Joe Moyer, Stuart Nims, our next Senator, Professor Hill, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express on behalf of my wife and myself our appreciation to you. This is really the beginning of this campaign. You cannot guess how glad I am to leave the dust of Washington behind us and start in on this campaign which will take us in the next 60 days to all parts of the United States. I was anxious to come and start this campaign, however, in the State of New Hampshire, where I was 6 months ago in 1 foot of snow beginning to run for the nomination.', 'There is no doubt in my mind that the start that we secured here in this State in the primary last March began the road to the nomination in July. Therefore, I come again today and begin this campaign in this month for the office of the Presidency of the United States here in New Hampshire.', 'One by one the States of New England, which 30 years ago were all Republican - Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, then Maine - began to move into the Democratic column until now there stands only two States, New Hampshire and Vermont, and they are going Democratic in November.', 'New Hampshire will make a judgment on who it should select for Governor, for Senator and for the Congress. But I must say that I hope you secure as the representatives for you in Washington and here, the men who sit with me on this platform. They are in every case the kind of men that have brought victory to the Democratic Party in other States. Ed Muskie is right, the Democratic Party is successful in New England only so long as it presents for high office men of character and responsibility, who have some understanding of the revolutionary and changing times through which we move. I spoke in accepting the nomination in Los Angeles of the new frontier that is coming into our country. I come here today and speak in New Hampshire, one of the oldest sections of the United States, a section of the United States that Bernard De Voto said 30 years ago was a finished place. I talk in this State also of the new frontier.', ""I do not accept the idea at all that New England is finished. I think in many ways that it is the youngest part of the United States, and I think that it is possible, both in the State of New Hampshire and in the Nation, to set a governmental climate which will permit us to prosper. We don't have coal and iron and oil, but we have human talent. We can clean our rivers, we can provide an atmosphere for business to move ahead. We can reform our transportation system. We can protect our textile and shoe industries. We can bring in new industries. We can perfect our educational system to have the best trained people."", 'All these things can be done in partnership of the State and the Government working together. I have spent 14 years addressing myself to the same problem in Massachusetts that you face here in the State of New Hampshire. But I have the greatest confidence. I think the solution lies in recognizing the tremendous changes that are taking place in this country and in this world, in grasping the future and not letting the future pass us by, not permitting other countries and other sections of this country to move ahead when we stand still.', 'The new frontier is in New Hampshire, just as much as it is in Alaska, just as much as it is in any section of the world.', 'I ask your support in this campaign. I ask your support here in the State of New Hampshire. I think we can win this election, and I think it is proper to start here in New Hampshire.', 'Thank you.']"

[Laughter.]"", 'In any case, I am delighted to come here. Ed Muskie informed me I am the first presidential candidate to come to this county. I think it is a good beginning. I am delighted to start on this campaign, on this first day, in this county. I come here to Maine to participate in the campaign in this State with other distinguished citizens of this State - with Frank Coffin, with whom I served in the House of Representatives; with Miss Cormier, who, I am confident, is going to be the next U.S. Senator; and with men and women from all sections of Maine. I think that Miss Cormier runs for the Senate and Frank Coffin runs for Governor, and Dave Roberts runs for the House of Representatives, and I run for the office of the Presidency, all for the same reason, and that is because we have the greatest possible confidence in this State and in this country, because in our own way, and in our own places, we wish to serve Maine and serve the United States.', ""Some of us have been, in recent weeks and months, critical of what has been happening here in this country. We don't criticize because we enjoy criticizing; we don't criticize because we think there is something wrong with this country.

In all these 10 countries in both scientific advances and military strength, a majority thought that the Soviet Union would be the strongest.', ""That is what we are fighting against. We are fighting to demonstrate to people all over the world that here in this country there are endless sources of vitality and strength; that our brightest days were not in the past but are in the future; that here in this State of Maine and this country we can grasp the future. We don't want to live off the accomplishments of the past. We don't want people in Africa or Latin America or Asia looking to Moscow or Peiping for hope, for the secret of the future, for scientific advances, for production of new engineers, for greater turnout of trained people from their sources of education. We don't want them to demonstrate that the future belongs to them and the past belongs to us."", 'I think that is the basic issue of this campaign. It transcends the differences in the two parties.

We run not promising that if we are elected life will be easy in this count or in this State, but promising that if we are elected we will reach forward to the future and by 1970 the position of the United States here in the United States and around the world will once again be unchallenged."", 'Thank you.']"
23,John F. Kennedy ,"September 02, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is a great pleasure to be here in Maine today. This is really, in a sense, the beginning of our campaign, and I have been traveling the State of Maine with Ed Muskie, Frank Coffin, who is the candidate for Governor, Lucia Cormier, who is the candidate for the U.S. Senate, Jim Oliver, Congressman from this district, John Donovan, and Dave Roberts. We have traveled from Presque Isle, and we are going to speak tonight and go to Washington. Tomorrow morning I fly to Alaska and speak to a dinner in Alaska tomorrow night. In a way, therefore, I am covering the oldest section of the United States, Maine, and going to the newest section, Alaska. But in a very real sense, both Maine and Alaska have the same problems, because they are the problems of the United States, in a very difficult and dangerous time for us all. This campaign is important because the issues we face are important, and because what happens to this country is important. I am glad to be here and I would be delighted to answer any questions that the press might have.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, would you tell us how you feel about your chances in Maine in November, and those of the other candidates of your party?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think that we are hopeful in Maine in November. Ed Muskie has given Maine the kind of leadership which I think these other candidates, all of whom I know personally - I think the kind of leadership which they can give the State. There is an old saying that as Maine goes, so goes the country. I would hope that we would do well in Maine and as Maine went, so went the West of the United States.', 'QUESTION. Following Vice President Nixon\'s southern swing, he said, ""The Kennedy-Johnson ticket is in real trouble in the South."" Would you care to comment on that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have problems in the South and I suppose we have problems in all sections of the United States. The Democratic Party is the national party, the oldest party in the world. There are farmers in it, workingmen, businessmen, ranchers, fishermen from Maine, farmers, it covers the whole United States. I think the problem which any candidates have for the Democratic Party is to rally all the multigroups that have maintained the Democratic Party and put the national interest first. I think, finally, we are going to be successful in November, but it is going to be a hard campaign and it will be a hard campaign in the South as well as in Maine.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, if you are elected President, will the Passamaquoddy Bay project become a reality?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I have supported the Passamaquoddy Bay project since I have been in the U.S. Senate. I have great hopes for it. It is now before the Commission. I hope that the United States and Canada will come to an agreement. It will be a great source of power, for not only Maine, but I think the whole Northeastern United States. I support the project, whether I am in the Senate or I am President.', 'QUESTION. If you were President, would you attend the General U.N. Assembly, the session which Mr. Khrushchev said he would attend?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the President should make the judgment on whether he attends the United Nations because he is the President and he is responsible for foreign policy until his term comes to an end. I would not, therefore, attempt to suggest. This is going to be an important session, but I would not attempt to advise the President on this question.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, would you explain why you, the new titular leader of the party and Lyndon Johnson, the majority leader in the Senate, were not able to get more of what you wanted out of this recent session?', 'Senator KENNEDY. As you know, we thought five or six bills were of great importance, medical care to the aged, tighter social security, a bill to increase the minimum wage to $1.25, and a housing bill. In addition, we wanted to try to do something for the farmers, which I think need particular relief at this time. We were not as successful as I hoped we would be. But I think the real difficulty is the fact that on the two bills which were most controversial, the $1.25 minimum wage, and the aid to the aged and social security, we were informed in both cases that if those bills passed, the President would veto them. All the President has to do to stop action is to veto any bill and he needs, according to the Constitution, only one-third plus one of either body to sustain his veto. It is extremely difficult for us to enact legislation if a President were opposed to it. If I were President, I would indicate my support for these programs and I think in those cases the Congress would respond. But this way, when the Congress acts, and it is threatened with a veto during every stage of its action, it is extremely difficult, with the division of powers in our Constitution, to secure action.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, on balance, would you say that the reconvened short session helped or hurt your candidacy in terms of the political impact of the decisions or the nondecisions?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think it was unfortunate for the public interest because I did not think we got by what we should have gotten by. As you know, we had a good deal of opposition on the other side of the aisle. Unfortunately, this was a session where the political atmosphere was highly developed. In the long run, however, I am not so sure this session is a loss. I think that the American people have seen in the last 3 or 4 weeks the difficulty of operating a governmental system where the President and the Congress hold different views on great public questions. I think there are sufficient divisions of power given to us in the Constitution without having a President of one party who is opposed to these programs and a Congress of another party which is committed to these programs. If there is anyone who is listening to me who does not want action and who does not want the Congress to carry out these programs, then this divided government is fine. But I think what we need, and I think this last 3 weeks showed it, is a Congress and a President working together for progressive, responsible pieces of legislation. I am committed to that program, and I think that we have had a good evidence in the last 3 weeks why it is necessary to unite the President and the Congress and not separate them.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, one theme of the Republican campaign appears to be that Vice President Nixon has experience and maturity which are superior to your own.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, I have heard that said.', 'QUESTION. How do you intend to answer this argument during the campaign?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well I think as far as our ages they are very close. We both came to Congress 14 years ago. In fact, the same day. As far as experience, I have been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I spent a good deal of my life before the war, at least in the last years, traveling. I was in the Soviet Union, I think, in 1939, and in Poland. I have been an active member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in my service in the Senate as well as the Labor Committee. I have been concerned about foreign policy since my father was in London, and my judgment is that the American foreign policy has been, in general, relatively unsuccessful in the last 4 or 5 years; that the power and prestige of the United States in relationship to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists in the underdeveloped areas of the world has declined relatively. Therefore, I do not feel that the last years have been so successful that we should move from those to an endorsement of a previous action. I don't think that you can suggest to me one new program in the field of foreign policy which has had general acceptance around the world that has been developed in the last year. Nothing comparable to the Marshall plan, to NATO, to point 4. I think what we need is a new administration with new people, new vitality, and new ideas."", 'QUESTION. Senator, can you tell us what you had in mind earlier when you spoke of protection for New England industry? Are you implying some new trade proposal here?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, but what I am implying is that as we get to atomic power as well as the Passamaquoddy power, which will permit us to compete more successfully, as we are able to clean our rivers to make them less polluted, as we are able to attract new industries by providing, I would think, a minimum wage which puts us on a par with other sections of the United States, as we concentrate our effort on education, our colleges and universities and schools, in order to have the most highly skilled people, in these ways I think we can strengthen our position.', 'QUESTION. But the word protection was used, Senator. That is what aroused our interest. What does that mean?', 'Senator KENNEDY. It means to try to protect and nourish and develop our industries in this section.', 'QUESTION. By means of tariffs?', 'Senator KENNEDY. In the case of textiles we have had some protection from the voluntary quotas which have not been altogether successful. I supported the peril point and the escape clause, both of which are in the present Reciprocal Trade Act. I would not suggest additional legislative action, however, on reciprocal trade. But I do think it is a matter of great concern what is happening to our textile industry and I do think we want to make sure that the domestic industry is permitted to maintain itself.', 'QUESTION. You mentioned there were problems in all parts of the Nation. I think one of the issues possibly that would affect Maine quite a bit is the Democratic plank on full parity price support.', 'How could you convince Maine people of the rightness of this plank in view of the fact that its implementation would mean higher grain costs for Maine farmers and would mean higher costs to the consumers of food products and higher taxes for our taxpayers?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't consider that that is an altogether accurate description of the Democratic plank. I think that farm income nationally is wholly unsatisfactory. It is as low now as it was 20 years ago. It is a matter of national concern. Farmers of the United States, whether they live here in Maine or whether they live in Oregon, are the very important segment of the American economy. I don't think the Maine economy prospers if American agriculture is on the decline. You sell a good many things that you manufacture in this State, and we do in Massachusetts, to the Midwest. Therefore, it is a matter of great national concern if the farm income sharply declines. The average wage for a dairy farmer in the State of Wisconsin - and it is true that our own dairy farmers have been hard hit - is 50 cents an hour. The grain farmers income in many grain parts of the country is the same level it was in 1938. I think this is a matter of great national concern. Farmers are the No.1 market for Detroit automobiles. Detroit automobiles are the No.1 market for Pittsburgh steel. If farm income drops, so does Detroit, so does Pittsburgh, and so does Maine. So I don't consider it a battle between Maine and Wisconsin or Iowa."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I have a two-part question here for you. This has to do with the OAS conference that was recently held. At that conference, I believe the United States agreed to sever relations with the Dominican Republic, I presume in an effort to get the South American countries to go along with our suggestion that they censure the Castro government, and perhaps place restrictions on the Castro government.', 'If we severed relations with the Dominican Republic, granted Trujillo is a dictator, and there are other dictators we do recognize, he has never done anything to us, he is anti-Communist and there is the possibility that a Communist regime will succeed him if he topples. At the OAS meeting all they did with regard to Castro was to adopt a vague resolution condemning the penetration of South America, by Communists, not mentioning Cuba by name.', 'Do you think we were wise in severing our relations with Trujillo, No.1, and, No.2, do you think we were successful at this OAS conference?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I do think that our policy toward Trujillo is wise. The basic wave which has swept South America in the last 10 years is to have independent governments within their own countries. It is antidictatorship. The reason that American policy in South America does not enjoy the high esteem which it enjoyed during the 1930's during the period of good neighbors was our relations with the former dictator of Venezuela, our intimate relations with dictators in several other countries. I don't think we can expect the people of Latin America to join us against the dictatorships in the whole hemisphere unless we also don't attempt to play the game the way it is."", 'The second point which is a valid one is that the Latin American resolution against the Castro government was not as strong as we wanted it to be. That I consider a very ominous sign. That is the Castro regime has sufficient popularity in Latin America, both because it is directed against us and our stature is not strong there, and also because too long people of Latin America have been denied their economic opportunity. Therefore, the political leaders of those countries, who I think are anti-Castro without a doubt, were not politically strong enough to afford to condemn Castro out of hand. I think he should be condemned. I think he is a source of maximum danger. I think the big task of the next administration is going to be to contain this revolution in Cuba, itself, and not have it spread through Latin America. We did make progress to a degree, though not satisfactory, however, in my opinion, and a constant struggle is going to go on if we are going to isolate this Communist conspiracy in Cuba.', ""Now, let me say that I am critical of this administration for its policy toward Castro in its early days and its policy toward Batista's dictatorship in the last days. I don't take the views that the only alternative to a dictator is a Communist dictator. If the United States had just had its influence, and at that time the United States was extremely powerful in Cuba, it seems to me we could have persuaded Mr. Batista to hold free elections at the time he was permitted to go and permit the Cuban people to make their choice instead of letting Castro seize power through revolution."", 'I think we are going to have a good deal of trouble in the future with Castro through all of Latin America. I agree we did not do as much as we wanted to toward Castro. I do not agree with our policy toward Trujillo.', 'QUESTION. The House Inter-American Subcommittee recommended today that the United States retain complete control over the Panama Canal and, in effect, keep the U.S. flag flying exclusively. What is your view toward this?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think we should keep the flag flying over the Panama Canal, and I think we should also be concerned about our relations with Panama. I think we should make our relations with their country as palatable as possible. I would keep the American flag flying from the points of ownership, but I would certainly attempt to keep close relations with Panama. It is very difficult to operate that canal if it is operated in a sea of hostility.', 'QUESTION. I come from a section in the State of Maine that will either go Democratic or Republican. The people I have talked to think there is a great similarity between both programs. I would like to have you tell us tonight where the Democratic platform differs from the Republican. I know it is a big subject, but what is the greatest difference?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think the Democratic Party and I hope the candidates running, certainly the candidates in this State and I think the candidates nationally, I think, are better prepared to meet the very revolutionary future which faces the United States and the free world. This administration has been in office 8 years. They have been in office during some of the most difficult and trying periods. But I do think in that 8-year period, the image of the United States as the most vigorous, vital, and powerful country in the world has begun to dim. I mentioned in Presque Isle today a poll which Gallup took in 10 countries, asking those people whether they thought the Soviet Union or the United States in 1970 would be first militarily and scientifically. The Soviet Union won both of those polls in the 10 countries involved, in both categories. I don't think there is any doubt that 10 years ago the United States was preeminent. I think the Democratic Party is prepared to bring new people, new ideas, with a true recognition of the seriousness of the struggle that we face."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, yesterday, Mike Wallace, he is the TV man, said that there has been a tremendous outbreak of what he calls scurrilous and malicious literature and he says it is having its effect on some parts of the country. I wonder if it is your feeling that this work is the work of a well-organized group or whether it is something that is coming from what you might call a lunatic fringe group and could be ignored.', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't think it probably could be ignored, and I would be reluctant to think it came from any organized group. There are a good many Americans who are concerned about the question of religious freedom. The power of the President is great. There are a good many Americans of good will who honestly want to hear my views on the question of religious liberty, constitutional separation of church and state, and so on. I have given those views on every occasion that I am asked and I am glad to give it again. Of course. I believe in the U.S. Constitution. Ed Muskie, Frank Coffin, and I take the same oath as the President takes, to defend the Constitution as Members of Congress, and I would take that oath if I were elected President, and I would take it on the Bible. So I am delighted if anybody asks me my feeling about it. I don't feel at all reluctant to discuss it. I know there is a group of people who would not accept any answer, who are not interested in my views on the matter, who are not interested in my experience, who are not interested in what has happened in this country in our history where we all believe in it. I can't answer them and I suppose they are going to vote against me. All I say is they are really wasting their vote, because here in the most difficult time, when we in this country are on trial as the exponents of free government, are going to spend the next 2 months discussing our churches, and where we go - I think my candidacy would be unfortunate. The purpose of this discussion is to discuss issues and give alternatives."", 'QUESTION. You do understand the type of literature I am talking about?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I have seen it sent to me.', 'QUESTION. You do not believe it is the work of an organized group?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Obviously it is organized enough to send it around the United States, but I just feel we are going to meet that problem. I have faced it before. I ran into it in West Virginia and we emerged successfully. The State of Maine has shown that what it values as the kind of men they choose for office is not what their religion is. That is why this country has been so successful. I am not prepared to say that we are not going to have a comparable experience in this election. My judgment is that come November this matter will assume its proper proportion.', ""QUESTION. Senator, last week's Kiplinger Washington Letter mentioned that both you and Vice President Nixon have your own private, personal public opinion polls. I am wondering how yours compares with the latest Gallup report?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I have only seen a couple of polls since the election. I thought this last Gallup poll was about the way mine was. I would say this is a very close election.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, prior to World War II, the United States had undisputed economic lead throughout the world because of its mass production methods. Today we have equipped most of these foreign countries with modern machinery as we have, if not actually more modern than ours in many instances. Their wages are very low. We have dropped our tariffs considerably to accommodate their goods. I understand that recently for the first time foreign concerns have been able to undersell us in Europe and they are underselling us at home today. If our wages here continue to spiral and limitations are placed on the amount of work that people may do, how are we going to increase our economy by 5 percent a year?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, let me say in the first place the balance of trade is still relatively in our favor. Where we have lost is because we have maintained troops overseas and we have contributed a good deal to maintaining the economies of other countries. That is what has really contributed to the balance of payments run against us. The trade balance is still even and in many cases is in our favor. I do suggest - I do agree that you have suggested a long-range problem, and that is how can we compete successfully with not only Western Europe but also the Soviet Union. I think it is going to be a matter of the greatest possible concern. We can stay ahead. I think that we are going to find a great investment in capital goods. I think by changes in our tax laws we can stimulate new investments in new machinery. I think our productivity is going to be maintained. I would say it is a serious problem but it is one that is possible of solution. I don't think what is causing us difficulty is that we are paying generous wages. I am not interested in driving our wage levels down. I think we are still meeting the competition. Generally we are and we can continue to do so."", ""QUESTION. In the prepared text of your speech at Manchester this morning, with reference to the decline in the textile industry here, you listed full use of valuable weapons against the excessive imports as one means of reversing a serious decline. I gathered from your response to Donovan's question that you are opposed to fixing mandatory quotas or increasing tariffs in order to achieve this. Is that correct?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, in the case of worsteds we have a quota in the sense that when worsted imports go over 5 percent, then the tariff changes. In the case of cotton textiles we have relied on the so-called voluntary system, though of course we do have some protection for cotton. All I am suggesting is that while the Japanese have relaxed their imports in accordance with agreement, we are getting a great increase in textile imports from Hong Kong and certain other countries. I think these must be a matter of concern. Several appeals have gone to the Tariff Commission and we are still in rather critical condition in the textile industry. I think that there is a proportion in every industry between imports and domestic production. I don't want to see any domestic industry driven to the wall by excessive imports and that is my general view. I say in the case of textiles, the last 18 months have been a matter of concern to me."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, you mentioned that the threat of veto had some effect on at least two pieces of major legislation during the special session and yet your opposition publicly and through various periodicals has said that you assumed the mantle of leadership from Mr. Johnson and you failed miserably. Would you want to comment on it?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I realize that that is what the Republicans say, but they are entitled to do it. We did not do as well as we could hope. Let us take a look at two pieces of legislation in which I was extremely interested, housing and education. Neither one of those bills came to a vote in the House of Representatives because there they were bottled up in the Rules Committee. There are four Republican members of the Rules Committee, and not one of them would vote to permit, even though the President requested housing legislation and aid to education, not one of the four Republican members of the Rules Committee would permit either one of those bills to come to the floor for a vote. Two Democrats joined with them. I think that was a mistake. But the four of the Democrats voted for those bills to go to the floor. Not one Republican on the Rules Committee would vote with us.', ""No.2, we went to conference between the House and the Senate on minimum wage. Six out of seven Republicans on that conference voted against that not only the $1.25 minimum wage, but also against the President's own program which we finally offered as a compromise. Six out of seven Democrats on the conference voted for the $1.25 minimum wage. I will give you the fourth one."", 'In the case of medical care for the aged on social security, 45 Democrats voted for it and 1 Republican voted for it, even though Governor Rockefeller had endorsed it strongly and even though it was the most efficient and economic way to do the job. I think the record is quite clear in this Congress, and I think the American people are going to have to decide whether they want a repetition of the kind of negative blocking actions which were carried on in this Congress or whether they want us to move ahead. We cannot possibly challenge a President who is opposed to us. The Constitution gives him too many powers. All I say is the American people ought to decide whether that is what they want or whether they want to move ahead.', 'MODERATOR. Ladies and gentlemen, you have time for one more question.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, in a few days the State of Maine will be the first State in the Union to be without any passenger train service, according to the Supreme Court of Maine. They say it is coming all over the country. Some of us think it is more important to get to Bangor than to the moon right now. I wonder if you have any thoughts about the transportation problem nationally.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the matter is a matter of greatest possible concern, the breakdown in negotiations. I am sure that the President is extremely concerned and I am hopeful that he will use the influence of his office to attempt to have the two groups reach an agreement. In the final analysis there is every important public interest as well as the interest of the parties, and I am hopeful that the President can serve as the bridge.', 'Let me say finally that I guess we are all finished. I want to thank Miss Cormier, who I hope is going to serve in the Senate, Frank Coffin, the candidate for Governor, Jim Oliver, the Congressman from here, and John Donovan, and all the rest who I think would serve as a first class team for Maine.', 'We finish here, but we are coming hack. I think we have in the great State of Maine to demonstrate that we have a new frontier. This is an old section of the United States, but I believe that its promise is still bright. I am going to carry that message to Alaska, and I hope that Dave Roberts and all the rest will be traveling the State of Maine with me when I come back in October. Thank you very much, everybody.']"
24,John F. Kennedy ,"September 02, 1960","['New England is ready to move forward. Our problems are serious - and they have been with us for a long time. Our hard-hit textile and fish industries - the pockets of chronic unemployment and poverty - the problems of failing transportation - of unfair competition - of economic ""old age."" But these are problems which leadership and vision - and faith in the people of New England - can conquer. Their solution lies just across the boundaries of the new frontier.', 'It is true that we cannot rely on our natural resources - our coal mines or oil wells or abundance of waterpower - to solve our problems. We cannot rely upon the stability of the industrial giants - or the advantages of cheap fuel, cheap labor, or cheap transportation costs. For we do not have them.', 'But we do have our own resources - human resources - the skill and experience and determination of our people - the New Englanders who have conquered the obstacles of the last 300 years and who are ready to meet the challenges of the decade ahead.', 'If we are to put these human resources to work - if we are to give New Englanders the chance to revive their economy and restore their prosperity - then we need vigorous leadership and understanding, coupled with an effective, workable program for action.', 'Such a program is not a program for New England - it is a program for America. By building New England we build America. By helping the New England economy we strengthen the American economy. By working toward a brighter future for the people of New England we help assure a brighter future for the people of New England, we help assure a brighter future for all Americans.', ""First, we must assist New England's efforts for industrial development and diversification. This means an expansion of credit, incentive to modernize, the development of our resources, cleaning up our polluted rivers, ending unfair freight rates, expanding transportation, and reversing the discriminatory Government policies which have led to the highest rate of small business failures in our history. The Federal Government cannot do for us what we must do for ourselves, but it can, with more progressive leadership, set the atmosphere in which our economy can be revitalized, introducing a new era that will bring new business and new jobs and new income to New England."", ""Second, we must reverse the serious decline in New England's textile industry. Through a program of plant modernization, full use of valuable weapons against excessive imports, and expansion of markets through research, the highly developed skills that made our textile industry great can once again lead the way to greatness."", 'Third, we must work to establish decent, adequate and fair national standards of unemployment compensation and minimum wages. The raising of the minimum wage and its extension to cover millions of unprotected American workers must be one of the first items on the agenda of the next administration. Our unemployment benefits, too, must be standardized and extended. By assuring working Americans of a living wage, by assuring unemployed Americans that they will be able to have the basic necessities of life, we help not only New England against substandard competition; we help the entire Nation.', 'Fourth, we must pass an adequate program of area redevelopment to help our distressed areas. The area redevelopment act which was passed by the Congress and twice vetoed by the President is such a program. It would provide areas of chronic unemployment with the tools which can bring new industry and new jobs to men who want to work, have the capacity to work but are unable to find work. I will continue to fight for this program in whatever capacity I am serving next year to help our distressed areas help themselves.', 'Finally, New England shares in the urgent economic needs of the entire Nation - the need to provide a decent life for our older citizens and a decent education for our young - the need to provide adequate housing for middle and low income groups - the need to eliminate the slums and the congestion which are strangling our great cities - the need to provide equal opportunities for all Americans of all races and beliefs. These are programs for the Nation - they meet national needs - and they will bring new hope and new progress to all Americans.', ""This is a program for New England - and New England's program for America. Its fulfillment will require effort and sacrifice and dedication. But it is a program of hope and of faith in New England's future - and we can have faith in New England's future - if we only have faith in our country and ourselves.""]"
25,John F. Kennedy ,"September 03, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Senator Bartlett, Senator Gruening, Congressman Rivers, Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Price, Mr. Miller, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation for that warm Alaskan welcome. As Bob Bartlett said, we started out about 9 o'clock in the morning from Baltimore and it is now 4 o'clock in the morning for those of us living on eastern time. I have not made a speech that late in the evening since some of the early Massachusetts political banquets which I attended when I was first a Congressman, when they would put the junior members on about this hour. [Laughter.]"", 'This is my second trip to Alaska. I came here to participate in the election of Governor Gruening. Actually I did not do as much for the Governor as Secretary Seaton did. [Laughter and applause]. There is good news, however, that the Secretary is expected next week, and I want you all to be at the airport and give him a warm welcome. [Laughter and applause].', 'I am delighted to come back here again, because I wanted to start my campaign in Alaska. First, because I told the Alaska caucus that if they voted for me I would come up here and campaign, but also because I thought that here in Alaska this State and the people who live in it typified what I was trying to express in my acceptance speech when I talked about the new frontier. I meant that really not in the physical sense. This is, in a great way, a new frontier, and in another way it is the last frontier. But what I was talking about earlier was a state of mind. Those people in this country who do not want things done for them, but want to do them themselves. When I talked about the new frontier, I was not talking about the geography of this country or about Alaska as a new area of the world. I was talking about the spirit which has built this State, the kind of spirit which I think has built our country, the kind of spirit which can build our country again.', 'Therefore, I am delighted to come to this State to ask your support in this election. Alaska is small, but nevertheless I think that this State has the greatest importance for us in the future. It reminds us of what we have been and what we can be again. I am delighted to be here tonight with three distinguished Members of Congress who have spoken for Alaska and the country, and with your distinguished Governor, who supported my nomination at the Los Angeles Convention.', ""My idea of Alaska, however, I don't think, is held by this Republican administration. They still believe it is an icebox in Alaska. They see it as an area which represents a drain on the Treasury. They see it as a colony for commercial interests. They see it as a cost to the taxpayer and, as far as they are concerned in many cases, it is still Seward's Folly."", 'But I see Alaska, the Alaska of the future. I see an Alaska where there will be more than 1 million people. I see a giant electric grid, stretching all the way from Juneau to Anchorage and beyond. I see the greatest dam in the free world, the Rampart Dam, producing twice the electricity of the TVA, lighting the homes and mills and cities and farms of the great State of Alaska. [Applause.] And I see highways linking all sections of this great State. I see Alaska as the destination of countless Americans who come here not searching merely for land and gold, but coming for a new life in new cities, in new markets. I see an Alaska that is the storehouse of our Nation, a great depository for minerals and lumber and fish, rich in waterpower and rich in the things that makes life abundant for those of us who live in this great Republic. [Applause.]', 'I do not say that this is the Alaska of 1961 or perhaps even of 1971. I do not say that a Democratic administration can magically bring about all of these things by itself overnight. The work must be the work of many, and the burden must be the burden of many. It will take your efforts and your help, but I think it is time we got started. [Applause.]', 'For the Alaska that I see is not the Alaska of no new starts. It will not come about when forests and fisheries are depleted, when highways are neglected and water runs useless to the sea. It will not come about as long as Alaska faces discrimination under the Federal Highway Act or is saddled with high shipping rates that make it impossible to develop the economy of this State. [Applause.] And it will not come about through any administration which governs this State by a system of Presidential vetoes. [Applause.]', 'I know that Alaska has had every reason to be grateful to Americans of both political parties, to Abraham Lincoln and to Theodore Roosevelt in particular among the Republicans, but there is a special tradition of the Democratic administrations in connection with this State: Woodrow Wilson founding the Alaskan Railroad and the city of Anchorage; FDR founding the Matanuska Valley which I flew over today, which is as rich a farming section as I have ever seen in the United States [applause] - Harry Truman founding the Eklultna power project, and a host of others. I can give you my pledge that if I am elected President this November, I will attempt to carry out this great tradition. [Applause.]', 'I come here tonight seeking the support of the people of Alaska because this is a sovereign State. Your rights are equal to those of any State. You send two U.S. Senators to the U.S. Senate, the same number as the State of New York. But many nations have learned that political equality and independence are not enough without economic equality and independence, and while a Democratic Congress could grant the State of Alaska just the political rights, it will take a Democratic administration to grant this State its just economic rights. [Applause.] I voted for Alaska to be a sovereign State, not a colony, and I find the discrimination now practiced against this State hard to believe. I can hardly believe that the largest State in the Union receives less money under the Federal Highway Act than the smallest State. I can hardly believe that the study of the Rampart Dam, according to the present appropriations and plans of this administration - that the study will take 10 years to complete. I could hardly believe that the Secretary of Interior, after the commitments which I heard him make in Alaska in 1958 in regard to fishtraps, should be still fighting the efforts of this State government to abolish them. [Applause.] And why has the Department of Interior refused to resurvey the land of this State in order to stimulate its development?', 'These are in a very real sense local issues, local to the State of Alaska, but in a larger sense they symbolize all of the problems here at home which I believe this administration has neglected. All of the opportunities it has passed by, which in some cases can never be regained, the untapped treasures of Alaska are only a part of the untapped treasures of the United States, water resources, mineral resources, natural resources of every kind, and above all, human resources, and it is a source of interest and satisfaction that the two Americans in this century who did more to develop the natural resources of the United States were both from the Eastern United States and the State of New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.]', 'The untapped energies of the American people which are more powerful than the atom itself must once again be committed to great national objectives. The Alaskan frontier was not won by men who were satisfied and complacent with what they had. They were not going to stay where they were and let a great opportunity pass them by. And this State is not going to realize its potential as long as it is approached from long range distance by those who are fainthearted. Since the convention in Los Angeles, I have been asked on many occasions what do I mean by a new frontier. But there is no need for that question here in the State of Alaska, for this is a State and a people who know the meaning of hardship and peril, who show spirit and dedication in their daily lives and who know that hard work and great hearts can win again the new frontier. This is a great State, but it can be a greater State, and the United States is a great Nation, the greatest nation on earth, but it can be a greater nation, a nation whose strength will be respected by our friends and enemies alike. To build this State and Nation is not simply a task for the Democratic Party, and this presidential election is not simply a contest between two parties. Nineteen hundred and sixty, whether we wish it or not, whether there were an election or not, is a turning point in our history. Either we move with new leadership, new programs, and a new spirit of education, or we stand still and therefore we fall back. This is the call of the new frontier. It is not what I promise I will do; it is what I ask you to join me in doing. [Applause.]', 'I come here tonight and ask your support. This is a great State and a great country. I don\'t think that there is anyone in it who is satisfied with our program in recent years. I know that there is no one in the State of Alaska who wants it said that during the years when they held power and influence, the balance of power began to turn against the United States and the free world. We are committed to the survival of the United States, but we are also committed to the survival of freedom all over the globe. When the American Revolution came about, Thomas Paine wrote that ""the cause of America is the cause of all mankind.""', 'But the cause of all mankind in the revolution of 1960 is the cause of America. What we do here affects what people will do every place. This is a responsibility which I believe we are glad to assume. It is a responsibility which I believe can successfully be met. But none of us will be satisfied, nor will anyone who believes in freedom be satisfied, until people all over the world wake up in the morning and wonder what the United States is doing, not what Khrushchev or China are doing; what the President of the United States is going to do, not what our adversaries are going to do. [Applause.]', 'During the Korean war, a young American was called out of the ranks by his Chinese captors and they said to him, ""What do you think of Gen. George C. Marshall?"" He said, ""I think General Marshall is a great American.""', 'He was hit by the butt of a rifle and sent to the ground. They picked him up and said, ""What do you think of General Marshall now?""', 'He said, ""I think General Marshall is a great American."" This time there was no rifle butt because in their own hard way they had classified him and determined upon his courage. I think in the next decade as individuals and as citizens of the United States, we, too, are going to be called out of the ranks. The same hard answers are going to be asked of us, the same questions are going to be addressed to Americans. I am confident that here in this country once again we, too, shall give the same affirmative answer. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
26,John F. Kennedy ,"September 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Fisher, Governor, Senator Bartlett, Senator Gruening, Congressman Rivers, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday afternoon I campaigned in Aroostook County, Maine, which is the potato center at the other end of the United States. I am glad to be here in this rich valley on the opposite end of our country, but united with Maine in a common determination to build a stronger State and a stronger United States.', ""I am the first candidate for the Presidency to actively campaign in the State of Alaska. [Applause.] There are three electoral votes in Alaska. I left Washington, D.C., this morning at 8 o'clock. It is now 11:30 in Washington. I have come, I figure, about 3,000 miles per electoral vote, and if travel 800,000 miles in the next 2 months, we might win this election. But I am prepared to do it. [Applause.]"", ""There is a story that once a traveler from Boston, Mass., used to complain that the train stood still at night in the West, and the reason, of course, was that when they woke up in the morning, they saw the same mountains and the same rivers that they had seen the previous morning. I, too, come from the other end of the American continent. I was born in one of the oldest cities of the United States, the city of Boston, and I find myself tonight in one of the youngest cities of this country. I was raised in one of our smaller States, and I find myself tonight in our biggest State. But I feel at home as an American in the State of Alaska, and for good reason, for Alaska is a new State, and it typifies the kind of opportunity and determination which we need if we are going to restore our country to a position of second to none around the world. [Applause.] For in America, too, nothing stands still at night. This is a changing State here in Alaska an it is a changing country. The pressures and needs have increased, and yet we have stood still. I don't thing that that is the kind of action which in the State of Alaska they want, if this State is going to realize its great potential."", ""Tomorrow there will be 7,000 more Americans living in this country than lived here today. By the year 2,000 there will be over 300 million people living in the United States, many thousands here in the State of Alaska. But I don't think that we have begun to prepare for that day, either in this State or in this country. I don't think we have looked to the future with the same kind of courage and determination which it took to build this valley."", 'I come here to Alaska because I believe in a very real sense this is the last frontier, and in a sense it is a new frontier. This State can be one of our great States. It needs vigorous action on the Federal level, and so does our country. [Applause.]', 'We have substituted in this State a program of no new starts. We have failed to recognize the fact which the Soviet Union has recognized, and that is the necessity of power as the key to their national development. On the Angara River, north of Mongolia, the Russians are building a hydroelectric project which will be twice as large as any project ever built in the United States of America, twice as large as the Grand Coulee and Boulder Dams combined. Their one project will be the largest in the world and they are doing more. The tragic fact of the matter is that if Alaska belonged to the Russians today, Rampart Canyon Dam would be underway.', ""I don't think it is going to take the Russians to do it. I think we can do it. I think this is the kind of project [applause] which Alaska needs."", 'I came here in 1958, and I come back again in 1960. I think here in the largest State of the Union we have an unparalleled opportunity to grow, by recognizing our great natural resources, by harnessing our rivers, by building our roads and highways, by improving our fishing resources, by recognizing that this is an opportunity not merely for the people of Alaska, but for the People of the United States.', 'I come here to Alaska with pride as an American in this State, and with confidence that this State and this country will be, by the year 1970, once again second to none, the capital of the free world, the hope of men who desire a better life for themselves and their children. Alaska represents what can be done. I am delighted to be here today. I am delighted to campaign in this State. I hope the Vice President comes here after me, because here in Alaska it is an education for him and for me. Whoever is President must know this State, must recognize its opportunities. I can assure you that if I am successful, the needs of this State will be recognized, because here is the new frontier.', 'Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause and laughter.]', 'Last night I spoke in the oldest part of the United States, in Portland, Maine; today at lunch, I speak in San Francisco; tonight at Anchorage, Alaska. We are going to carry this campaign to all parts of the United States, in order to show the American people that this country cannot possibly afford 4 more years of Republican leadership. [Applause.] We are going to take our case to the only forum where it belongs, where there is no threat of a Presidential veto, where there is no parliamentary obstruction, where we shall be successful, and that is the forum of the American people themselves. [Applause.]', ""This last session of the Congress for the last 4 weeks is a vivid example of what can happen when the country is divided in its leadership; because the Republican Party opposed the $1.25 minimum wage, we didn't get it. Because the Republican Party - and only one Senator voted against them - opposed medical care for the aged tied to social security, which had the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller, as well as the Democratic Party, and it was beaten by five votes. And Time magazine this week said that the leader of the Republican Party smiled when he heard the results - this is the kind of thing which has happened in the month of August. But we are going to reverse it in November. [Applause.]"", 'The theme of this campaign is going to be action, action here at borne to keep pace with the growing needs of an expanding country, and action abroad to meet the challenge of our adversaries.

The pressures of our schools, the plight of our aged, the necessity of maintaining full employment, in spite of the revolutions of automation, the necessity of expanding equal rights to all Americans, wherever they may live - these are the things that require action.

In 1952, we in this country had never heard of Nasser, or Castro, or Lumumba, or any of the others, and now they are household words and their efforts are not dedicated to the well-being of the United States.

In the last 3 years, the Republic of Cuba, under a dictatorship of Batista, closely associated with the United States, with the American Ambassador, the second most powerful man in Havana, now finds itself a Communist satellite. This is the kind of foreign policy. This is the kind of image we have presented to a watching world. The United States looks tired. It looks like our brightest days have been in the past. It looks like the Communists are reaching for the future, and we sit back and talk about the ideals of the American Revolution. The way to put the ideals of the American Revolution into significance is to act on them, not to talk about them. [Applause.]', ""My basic belief is that this country is not satisfied to live in a period of relative decline. I don't think that there is any American who wants it said that in the days of his generation, when he bore responsibility as a citizen, the power shifted from the free world to that of the Communist. I don't want historians in 1970 to say that in the 1950's and 1960's the Communists made a decisive breakthrough."", 'This is the challenge which is before us as Americans. Not merely as Americans, but as believers in freedom. This is not a choice between the Vice President of the United States and myself. This is really a choice between the two philosophies of government, between a party that wishes to act, between a party which is not satisfied with things as they are, between a party which wishes to move ahead to a new frontier, and a party which believes in maintaining the status quo. [Applause]', ""I am a candidate for the office of the President. I do not run for that office under any expectation that it is an easy, honorary job. It is the wellspring of American action. Only if the President of the United States sets before the American people the same kind of unfinished agenda which Franklin Roosevelt set before us in the 1930's [applause] and which Woodrow Wilson set before us in the new freedom, and which Adlai Stevenson set before us in his call for greatness [applause] which Harry Truman stood for in his own administration those are the names of the Americans who moved this country. Therefore, today I ask your support. This is a weekend which we take off. But I can assure you that if I am elected in November, this country's vacation will end and this country will begin to move again. [Applause.]"", 'Thank you.']"
28,John F. Kennedy ,"September 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I want to thank the Governor for being here, and I will be glad to answer any questions anyone will have.', 'QUESTION. Senator, the Republicans have cited this just ended session of Congress as an example of, according to them, your inability to push through your own legislation, even with a majority in both Houses. Will you comment on that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think that the session of Congress--', 'QUESTION. Will you repeat the question?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't like to repeat it, but I will. [Laughter.] The Republicans have cited this session of Congress, according to the questioner, and I think accurately, as an example of my inability to put through our program. My answer to that is that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to put through any program, particularly if the program is controversial and new, if the opposing party uses all of the parliamentary devices that are available to Members of the House and Senate, and if we are opposed by the President of the United States."", 'Now, in the case of medical care for the aged, as I said in my statement, being tied to social security, which I thought was extremely important, as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican, and we were informed by the minority leader, Mr. Dirksen, when the matter came to a vote, that if we passed social security, it would be vetoed by the President.', 'In the case of the $1.25 minimum wage, which was my bill, which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1, we failed in the conference with the House, after Mr. Dirksen, the minority leader, announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $1.25 minimum wage. There were two other bills that I thought of importance. One was the housing bill and one was the aid to education. Both of those bills were tied up in the Rules Committee. Of the four members, Republican members of the Rules Committee, not one of the four members would vote to permit those bills to come to the floor of the House. We had passed both of those bills in the U.S. Senate.', ""Now, there isn't any doubt in my mind that if the President of the United States states he is going to veto a bill, if the minority party associates completely with that effort to block it, in a short bobtail session, it is possible to hold up or emasculate any controversial piece of legislation. So I feel that this session has indicated that the Republican Party is not fit to lead the United States in a very difficult and dangerous and revolutionary time; that it is committed to the status quo, that it is opposed to all of these programs, which involve, I think, very basic necessities for the American people. That is the experience which we had in the August session. If the American people do not want action in the next session of Congress, then I think they should vote for the Republicans."", 'QUESTION. Senator, are you saying, then, that this program could have been put through Congress if there had been a Democratic or favorable President?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am completely convinced of it. As I said, we did secure the passage in the Senate of the minimum wage 2 to 1, which was a bill that I sponsored. We missed on medical care for the aged in the Senate only by five votes. We missed passing $1.25 an hour minimum wage in the House. A change of five votes in the House would have given us $1.25. So we came very close. It was with the threat of a veto hanging over any piece of legislation that does not fit the Republican program that it is extremely difficult to pass legislation.', 'QUESTION. Senator, I understand that the Governor said the other day he expected you to win in California by approximately the same margin by which he won in 1958, roughly 1,100,000. Would you comment on your prospects in California', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would say that the Governor is being kind and generous. I don't expect to match his record at all. I think there is going to be a very hard fight in the State of California. I hope that we are going to win. I will be very happy if we do win. But I appreciate what the Governor said. But he knows California better than I do. However, I think he may have been optimistic."", 'QUESTION. Do you have any comment on the Southern States, how you think Johnson will help you at all?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think we are going to have a hard fight. I would say the fight is going to be hard in all parts of the United States. I look with some hope for the election, but I think that many of the Southern States are going to have a close contest. The Vice President has been down there, and has gotten a warm reception. Senator Goldwater has been campaigning effectively in several Southern States. Of course, he has been taking a position entirely different from the position which has been taken by the Republican platform and the Democratic platform.', 'We are going to have a formidable fight, I would say, in the Southern States. I think we will be successful finally.', 'QUESTION. Do you think you will carry all of them?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would not make a guess on that.', 'QUESTION. What was the question?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was, Do I think we will carry all of them and I said ""I could not make a judgment on that at this time. I have not been down South yet.""', ""QUESTION. Senator, what would you do as President in regard to Mr. Khrushchev's forthcoming visit to the United States?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would make a judgment which only the President of the United States can make as to whether he should attend, himself. This session is going to he extremely important. There are a good number of African nations which are going to be seated in the United Nations. Mr. Khrushchev has stated that he is going to make a special appeal to them. We are going to have a discussion of disarmament. But I do think that in the final analysis that the President should make a judgment as to whether he should attend the United Nations. I think it would be a mistake for anyone lacking his responsibility to attempt to advise him.', 'QUESTION. Senator, if you were the President, what would you do about it? Would you attend?', 'Senator KENNEDY. My judgment is that I would attend, but I would not attempt to advise the President or criticize him for not attending. I think in the final analysis he should make the judgment.', 'QUESTION. Would you attend at the time Khrushchev was there or would you wait until later?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think I would have made my decision probably - I don't think I would tie my decision to Mr. Khrushchev's decision, but I do think that this is going to be an extremely important session of the United Nations. I do think that the United Nations is going to represent a stronger, even in spite of its difficulties in the Congo and perhaps because of them - is going to represent a stronger force for peace than it has in the past, I would like to see the United States, therefore, associate itself as strongly as it can with the efforts of the United Nations and give it the support it can. I would not go there to respond in a debate to Mr. Khrushchev. I would not attempt to make a summit meeting out of the United Nations."", 'I would feel that we should use every means at our command to indicate to the members of the United Nations the great hopes we have of it, and the confidence we have in it. I do want to make it clear, however, that this is a matter that involves a Presidential decision, and if he decides differently I would not criticize that.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I have a rather disagreeable question. Do you feel that the anti-Catholic literature and statements appearing throughout the Nation are being either inspired or encouraged by State or National Republican officials?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I have no idea of what is the source of these and, having no idea, I would not attempt to lay them at anyone's door."", 'QUESTION. Senator, do you plan to return to San Francisco during the campaign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I do. I think we will spend probably more time in California than any other State of the Union.', 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.', 'SENATOR KENNEDY. Thank you.']"

Kennedy ,"September 03, 1960","['This rally marks the official beginning of the 1960 presidential campaign.', 'From now until November 8 we are taking our ease to the forum in which it belongs, where there is no threat of veto, where there is no parliamentary obstruction, and where we will be successful - and that is the forum of the American people.', 'Until a Democrat is in the White house, the Republicans can block action on an adequate minimum wage, they can water down medical care for the aged, they can play politics with civil rights, they can block action on a decent housing bill and a good school bill. But they cannot block the American people on November 8.', 'The theme of this campaign is going to be action - action at home to keep pace with our growing needs, to help the unfortunate, to build a still greater nation - and action abroad, to match the rise in Communist power, to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe.', ""I believe the American people elect a President to act. I believe the crises of the 1960's require him to act. And I believe the voters all across the country in November 1960 are going to call for action."", ""There are times in the life of a nation, as in the life of any family, when we simply want to get away from it all. We want to relax, to forget about our problems, to shut out the noise and the confusion, and simply count our blessings. Perhaps we have been going through such a time in the life of our Nation. Perhaps in 1952 we needed such a time. But the 1960's are not going to be that kind of time."", 'For this is not the same Nation as it was in 1952. Automation was little more than a word then - now it means unemployment and hardship for untold thousands of workers. The pressure on our schools - the plight of our elderly - the cost-price squeeze on our farmers - the decline of our cities - the high cost of medical care - these are newer and greater problems and pressures which in 1960 are still growing and changing and demanding new leadership.', 'The world is changing, too. The old era has ended. The old ways will not do. In 1952 most of us had not even heard of Nasser, Lumumba, Castro, or even Khrushchev. We did not know of any serious Communist problems in the Middle East, in Africa, or in Latin America.', 'But now there are new leaders, new nations, new weapons of destruction. The balance of power is shifting. The gap between rich and poor is growing. And the world in which we are only a tiny minority is restless, watching and on the move.', 'We must move, too. This Nation is ready to start moving again. Our vacation is over. Our relaxation is at an end. We are ready to face the facts, to shoulder our burdens, to tackle the job of building a new and better world beyond the New Frontier.', 'But we are going to undertake that job, a standstill philosophy will not do. A do-nothing party will not do. Four more years of a Republican President blocking action by a Democratic Congress will not do. What we need, what we seek, what this campaign is intended to bring, is action, instead of drift - leadership, not salesmanship - and dedication, in place of mediocrity.', 'We are not talking simply about a political contest. I am in this campaign as your candidate for President of the United States. That is the greatest office in the world. That is the office which historically, constitutionally, and logically always must be the fountainhead of our leadership. The Congress cannot do the job alone - that ought to be clear to everyone by now. If this Nation is to reassert the initiative in foreign affairs, it must be Presidential initiative. If we are to rebuild our prestige in the eyes of the world, it must be Presidential prestige. And if we are to regain progressive leadership on our domestic problems, it must be Presidential leadership.', 'But this is not a one-man crusade. The New Frontier is not to be won by one man or two or even the leaders of one political party. It is a challenge to all Americans - to all who are willing to commit themselves to the future instead of the past - to all who find their duty in the harsh realities of our times.', 'For these are harsh times. The future will not be easier. Our burdens will not lessen. Our enemies will not weaken. But I cannot believe that history will say of our time: ""They were the greatest, richest, strongest Nation on earth - but they stood still too long.""', 'I believe that history will write a different story. I believe that history will mark this as a turning-point in the life of our Nation and in the pursuit of peace. I believe that with your help, with your efforts, joining the efforts of millions like you all over America, we can make this a time of greatness - a time of which history will truly say, when reciting our perils, that we lived by the Scriptural injunction: ""Every one shall help his neighbor, and shall say to his brother: Be of good courage.""', 'I call upon you, not as Democrats, not as Californians, but as neighbors and brothers, to help make that prophecy a reality.']"

We did not make that trip for pleasure. We made it because we believe it is vitally important that the Democratic Party win this election.

31,John F. Kennedy ,"September 04, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I will just make a brief statement, and I will be glad to answer any questions that anyone might have. I want to thank Senator Bartlett and Senator Gruening for being here this morning.', 'I wanted to make a statement on registration and what progress we have made and what progress we expect to make before the registration period nationally is over. I talked this weekend to Congressman Frank Thompson, who is in charge of our registration drive across the Country. Congressman Thompson, after giving the matter all of his time for the last 2 months, states that he believes that between 10 and 20 million more voters will vote in 1960 than voted in 1956. He thinks that 10 million - and my brother shares the view - is rock bottom. The registration has gone better than we expected it would. We expect to register 800,000 new people in the State of California. We have been registering from 7,000 to 10,000 a day in Los Angeles.', 'QUESTION. Ten to what? I did not hear you. How many a day?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Seven thousand to ten thousand a day in Los Angeles.', 'QUESTION. Are those Democrats or both?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We will have to get Pierre on these figures. We will check on that.', 'QUESTION. What is the proportion of Democrats?', 'Senator KENNEDY. These are figures without regard to party. We expect to register 350,000 in New Jersey. I would like to emphasize, if I could, the importance of registration, particularly for those in most of the other States between 21 and 31 and in the State of Alaska between 19 and 31. Actually, since 1956, nearly 10 million people have entered this age group and are eligible to vote. We are anxious and I think that this is true of both parties, we are anxious that they make a special effort to be registered. They have, of course, the longest life investment in this country, and, therefore, they should be particularly anxious to participate in this election. We have begun on registration a particularly vigorous job in the State of California, and, in fact, in the whole West, on the Spanish Americans, and I think in the State of California we have set a goal of 100,000 in this group alone, and over 53,000 have already been registered.', 'I will be glad to turn this over to anyone who wants any of these figures that I read. This includes without a breakdown of registration, though I do think it is fair to say that the Democratic registration has been higher than that of the other party.', 'QUESTION. Senator, I think it is your brother, Robert, who said on occasion, as well as Congressman Thompson, that out of every 10 voters who are registered, 7 of those would probably vote Democratic. Would you give us on what basis that has been arrived at?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, of those who are unregistered, a higher percentage of them have a commitment to the Democratic Party and the philosophy of the Democratic Party.', 'QUESTION. More specifically, if they would go into a big city, would they feel because they were urban dwellers, they would be more inclined to the Democratic Party?', 'Senator KENNEDY. In the cities, of course, there is a higher percentage of Democratic supporters than Republican and a higher percentage that are unregistered, relatively. It has been our belief, based upon experience, that as we increase the registration that there are more supporters of the Democratic Party that are newly registered. We will have to wait and see if that theory bears out.', 'QUESTION. This figure that you mentioned of 10 million, would you think that ratio would apply, that of that 10 million, 7 million would probably vote Democratic?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't think I probably better draw that conclusion, but I would think that this would strengthen the Democratic Party. However, I would not attempt to make a breakdown."", ""QUESTION. If you can register this many in August, when people are all out on holidays, theoretically, wouldn't you expect to do an awful lot better in October?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, it starts to close in some States at the end of September, or the first part of October. In the State of Massachusetts, it has to be a month ago. In one ward in Baltimore, out of 1,028 people registered in one of the cities, it was 6 to 1 Democratic.', 'QUESTION. What was that again?', 'Senator KENNEDY. In one ward in Baltimore, out of 1,028 people registered, the percentage was 6 to 1 Democratic.', 'QUESTION. Senator, are you in favor of resumption of nuclear testing?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, not at this particular time.', 'QUESTION. Why?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Because I think that a continued effort should be made to - and I am not prepared to abandon that effort at this time - to secure an agreement between the Communist and the non-Communist world. In any case, I am particularly anxious that tests not be resumed that pollute the atmosphere. I think it is possible to secure an agreement on that, because it is easy to police. The difficulty, of course, is policing the underground tests. No satisfactory agreement has been reached on a method to police those tests. But it is possible to police atmospheric tests. I am hopeful that neither side will resume those tests.', 'QUESTION. Senator, would you say, sir, that the bigger the vote in November the better it is for you, for the Democratic Party? That is, the bigger the turnout?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We used to say in Massachusetts when there were over 2 million votes, this was 1952, that we were going to secure 3 out of 5 of every one over 2 million. But then it turned out there was the biggest vote in history and President Eisenhower swept the State. So I am never completely convinced of that theory. But I do have hopes that that theory bears this year. But I would say generally I do agree with the theory that the bigger the vote, the better the prospects for the Democrats.', 'QUESTION. You would think that so this year, sir?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would judge that, but there have been notorious exceptions to that.', 'QUESTION. I read in the paper when we got out here last night, and I forget who the story was written by, that this registration drive had been so successful that you or the Democratic Party was going to take $1 million which had been earmarked for radio and TV campaigns and put this into the registration drive. Is this correct?', ""Senator KENNEDY. We did put an initial sum into it, and they are going to make an additional effort. I don't know about the figures. But we are going to put some of our money that had been for other purposes, into the registration drive."", 'QUESTION. Do you believe without an arms agreement that nuclear holocaust is imminent in 15 years?', ""Senator KENNEDY. No, but I do think an arms agreement would be desirable. However, I don't think we can take the conclusion that if we don't get the agreement we will have a nuclear war. But I do think it increases the prospects, but not enough for me to be convinced of it. I think it would be so mutually destructive that even if we do not get an agreement and even though other countries begin to possess the atomic capacity which now appears quite possible, I am still hopeful we can avoid nuclear holocaust."", 'QUESTION. Do you think this contradicts the pollster figure that 6 percent of the voters are undecided, this registration figure?', 'Senator KENNEDY. My judgment would be that it is higher than 6 percent.', 'QUESTION. You predicted a close election. Is it your view that a successful registration drive would put you over the top?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, but I think it is useful from the public interest point of view to increase the registration and the turnout. I do think it would be helpful to the Democratic Party, but in the final analysis I think that registration is an element of success, but I think in the final analysis they will make it an independent judgment, everyone who is registered, on who would be the best candidate and the best party. So it is an element of success but not the key to success.', 'QUESTION. What kind of reports did you get from the leaders, (1) in California; (2) in Alaska, as to your own prospects for those electoral votes?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have a hopeful prognosis in Alaska, and we got - well, in California they felt it would be a close, hard fight.', 'QUESTION. Senator, you said that on the basis of past experience, you feel that a heavier registration would tend to favor the Democratic Party.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, but I would not carry it to the extreme.', 'QUESTION. Have you had any samplings taken elsewhere than Massachusetts and Baltimore? That ward is terribly heavy Democratic anyway. They have a Democratic Congressman up there. Have you taken any in the suburbs where you hope to do better this year?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, we will have additional information as time goes on, but I have not enough to give you anything. In the beginning, we have not done as much registration in the suburbs and towns as we hoped to do. Perhaps in the next 2 or 3 weeks we will do better.', 'QUESTION. Some of our bases in Africa and other parts of the world seem to be becoming untenable, and yet the Defense Department has announced the closing of one up here in Alaska, Ladd Field. What do you think about that at this time?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I am concerned about what we do about the defense of Alaska. The strategic decisions as to what weapons are most useful for defending Alaska or any other part in the final analysis is a decision for the Department of Defense, and the President of the United States. I don't think we should close any base unless we are prepared to place alternative stress on other weapons. I think missiles are going to provide a great means of defense for Alaska. This is a key defense area. While they may have made a determination that the technological changes in weapons make fighters unnecessary in this area, I do hope they will not draw the general conclusion that Alaska defenses should not be fully maintained. I am hopeful that as we make progress in other weapons Alaska needs will be recognized."", 'As far as Africa, itself, there are going to be many changes in our base structure in Africa. Some have already taken place in Morocco, and they may take place in other areas of Africa in the next year.', 'QUESTION. Senator, you were promised military intelligence briefings, from the President. Have you received that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes. I talked on Thursday morning to General Wheeler from the Department of Defense. He came over to my office and I talked to him for an hour.', 'QUESTION. General who?', 'Senator KENNEDY. General Wheeler.', 'QUESTION. What is his first name?', ""Senator KENNEDY. He didn't brief me on that. [Laughter.]"", 'QUESTION. What size general was he?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Three stars.', 'QUESTION. Do you care to comment on that? What is his job?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I will give you his title. He works under the Chiefs of Staff, but his complete title I will have to provide you.', 'QUESTION. How did you feel afterwards? Have you any comment on that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think that General Wheeler did admit his responsibility.', 'QUESTION. Senator, you told Allen Dulles when he came up, ""Don\'t you ever have any good news in that bag?"" Did you say the same thing to Wheeler?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, I thought--', 'QUESTION. Or did he have some good news?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think that in the SAC briefing of General Wheeler there was emphasis on the good.', 'QUESTION. Senator, do you feel that failure of your personally sponsored bills in the predominantly Democratic Congress was, as the Republicans say, a political setback?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think that the experience of the last Congress, and I think that Senator Bartlett and Senator Gruening will agree, and both of them took the same position on all of these controversial pieces of legislation that I did - minimum wage, medical care for the aged, housing, education - I think that the lesson we learned from this session was that you cannot possibly pass these bills unless you have the support of the administration, unless you have the affirmative endorsement by whoever is President of the United States, because the power of veto hangs so heavily over the Congress, especially in a short session, where it would be extremely difficult to override and especially with the parliamentary devices available. I would say that the lesson of this Congress is that you cannot pass these bills which I consider to be essential unless you have the support of the President. It is extremely difficult to operate under the conditions that we were compelled to. So I think the lesson of this Congress is that we need a Democratic President.', 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.']"

I take my case to you because I know you agree with me that racial discrimination must be eliminated everywhere in our society; in jobs, in housing, in voting, in lunch counters, and in schools.', 'And finally, I am here because I know we share a deep-seated belief in free collective bargaining, and in the growth and development of free and responsible unions - and unlike our opponents, we do not believe in this only on Labor Day.', ""I welcome the support of the working men and women of this country.

I know the American labor movement opposes what I oppose: complacency, unemployment, economic stagnation, racial discrimination, and national insecurity."", 'Our labor unions are not narrow, self-seeking groups.

But we can be still greater. This is the most prosperous country in the world. But we can be still more prosperous . . . so that every American can share in that prosperity. We have the means to achieve our goals - to put our house in order - to regain our position of preeminence in the world. It all comes under the name of ""economic growth"" and today I want to talk with you about economic growth. There is nothing cold or dull about the meaning of economic growth. It means jobs and homes and schools for our children. Lack of growth means unemployment and pockets of poverty and a weak, declining nation.', 'Under Republican leadership, we have not been growing. The workers have noted it in unemployment and short workweeks. Businessmen have noted it in idle plant capacity and rising inventories. And Mr. Khrushchev noted it when he promised to ""bury"" us.', 'Three facts are indisputable:', 'Fact No.1: Between 1947 and 1953, under the administration of Harry Truman, our average annual rate of growth was 4 1/2 percent. Between 1953 and 1959, under a Republican administration, the rate was only 2 1/2 percent - less than half as much. And today our key industries such as auto and steel are operating at much less than full capacity.', 'Fact No.2: While our economy is crawling forward at an average rate of only 2 1/2 percent, the Russian gross national product is annually increasing 7 percent - three times as fast.', 'Fact No.3: Our rate of growth was surpassed by almost every major industrial nation during the past years of drift and indecision - including Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Japan. These are the facts which we must face. This is the record which our opponents have described as a ""healthy rate of growth."" And I defy them to find anything healthy about it.', 'When this country, with all its potential, is growing at less than half the rate achieved by the Soviet Union, less than the rate of almost every major industrial nation on earth, then our health is obviously down and we had better call for a new doctor in Washington. These facts and figures are not remote. They affect the welfare of everyone. With a really healthy rate of growth, each family of four would have received, on the average, an additional $1,300 every year between 1953 and 1959 - a total of more than $7,000 - $7,000 you could have had for a rainy day, or to finance a college education, or to take a trip, or help buy a house - $7,000 that these restrictive policies have kept out of your pocket.', 'With a really healthy rate of growth, we can have full employment - and let me make clear right now my conviction that in this country we cannot afford to have any goal except genuine full employment.', 'With a really healthy rate of growth, we can end the gnawing doubts about our national defense. If we had maintained a healthy rate of growth, it would have paid many times over the cost of the vital defense programs which the administration has said we cannot afford - the cost of putting our Strategic Air Command on a continuous air alert, the cost of modernizing our Army and Navy, and the cost of building more Polaris and Minuteman missiles. These are steps which must be taken and, once this country starts moving again, these are steps that will be taken.', 'With a really healthy rate of growth, we can provide our children with the best in education and eliminate the shortage of classrooms and the scarcity of teachers which is depriving millions of young Americans of adequate school training. And finally, with a really healthy rate of growth, we will win the crusade for economic justice. Here we have no time to spare. For it is a shameful fact that 32 million people in this, the richest land on earth, are forced to live on a standard of living that is woefully inadequate - a standard below that which $2,600 a year would buy for a family of four. It is a shameful fact that 7 million of our fellow citizens are dependent upon charity for their existence - that 5 million city homes lack plumbing - that breeding places of juvenile crime abound in our cities - and that abject poverty characterizes too much of our farm community.', 'These are some of the reasons why I say economic growth is not simply a cold, remote statistic. And these are some of the reasons why it is not enough to merely talk about it. It is time to do something about it - and we are going to start on next November 8.', 'The first step we must take is to put into office an administration which has faith in a growing America. The Republican Party, since the departure of Theodore Roosevelt some 48 years ago, has not had this faith - and it does not have it today. For example, on August 10 the President said that automobile production may exceed 6 million - and this, he said, ""is really a very fine year."" But the facts of the matter are that we made 7.5 million cars a few years ago. The facts of the matter are that thousands of autoworkers are out of jobs today or working on short time. If this is ""a very fine year,"" I don\'t want to see a very bad one.', 'While these men are idle - while these facilities are idle - we see critical needs on every side of us that could ""consume and absorb"" their output, if only given a chance. We see the need for schools - for highways - for dams and powerplants, homes and hospitals, stronger defenses, and a rebirth of our cities. These projects need busy plans and working men. And so our second step toward economic growth must be to put back to work our idle machines and men - to return to the Democratic policy of full employment which for 8 years has been shamefully neglected. We have the tools - the legislation and the programs to put men back to work - and in 1961 we are going to do it.', 'As a third step, we can help our Nation grow by unlocking the riches of our natural resources. From our forest must come the timber, from our rivers must come the water and power, and from our mines must come the fuels and metals to meet the needs of an expanding population. Franklin Roosevelt raised the economy of an entire region through unified development of the Tennessee Valley. The Bonneville and Grand Coulee Dams have repaid their cost a hundredfold. Yet the Republican policy is ""no new starts.""', 'Fourth, we must put to work the wonders of automation in a way which will be a blessing for all America - not merely a curse for the workers. In the coal beds of West Virginia automation means joblessness, poverty, and deprivation. But automation can also bring lighter work, lower prices, and better jobs under a Government which cares for people - a Government which is unwilling to have men thrown on the scrap heap like obsolete machines.', 'And fifth and finally, if we want to grow, let us put an end to scarce money and high interest. Those who collect the interest may have profited. But every American who has financed a home, an automobile, a refrigerator, or a television set has suffered. Those of you who buy a home with a $10,000, 30-year mortgage today will pay out $3,300 more in interest charges than you would have paid under the last Democratic administration - $3,300 that could have been put to better use for you and your family.', 'This is a sound workable program to stimulate the growth of our free enterprise economy - a program which will keep our economy healthy and free - a program which will bring growth without inflation or increased government controls. We have heard that this kind of growth is merely an idle dream. But this country was built by dreamers - not by those of weak hearts and little faith.', 'In 1776 there were those who said that national independence was an idle dream. In 1789 there were those who said that a sovereign union of equal states was an idle dream. In 1860 there were those who said that freeing the slaves was an idle dream. In 1932 there were those who said that a New Deal for the American people was an idle dream.', 'Now, in 1960, we face problems unlike any we have faced before. Never has the challenge been so great. Never have the stakes been so large. Never have the dreams and the ideals and the dedication of free men been so essential.', 'We have no time for complacency, timidity, or doubt. This is a time for courage and action. This is a time for strong leaders - leaders who are not afraid of New Frontiers - leaders who are not afraid of the facts - leaders who can turn our dreams into reality.', 'Give me your mandate. Give us the men. For I believe the job can be done.', 'During the dark days of World War II, Winston Churchill appealed to America for help, pleading ""Give us the tools and we will finish the job."" Today - in 1960 - when America faces challenges and perils greater than ever before, I say to all Americans who want to build a better America - ""Give us the job for we have the tools.""']"

[Applause.] I have come here today on a day that belongs to the working men and women of America, to ask you for help in translating the Democratic platform into reality. Give me your help; give me your men; give me men like Pat McNamara and Phil Hart in the United States Senate.

[Applause.] And next January there will be no threat of a Republican Presidential veto. [Applause.]', 'Give us next January more men like the Democratic Congressmen from Michigan and next January we will get a minimum wage of $1.25 without Republican opposition. [Applause.] Elect John Swainson as the Governor of Michigan to succeed a great Governor of Michigan, and we can tell you that we are going to work to make Michigan a stronger State, and a stronger Nation, with John Swainson and Mennen Williams. [Applause.]', 'I am taking our case to the American people in the next 2 months because I believe that the American people should decide which direction this country is going to go. The issue is before you and I am confident that in November you will make a choice for progress, not for standing still. [Applause.]', 'I am confident that the American people will make a choice that they want this country to be first in the world and first in the fight for peace. I take my case to you as the descendants of immigrants who will welcome other immigrants to this country without fear or favor, here a home for the homeless. [Applause.]', ""I take my case to you because I am confident that the American people do not want to continue in this country poverty and discrimination and disease and slums. They want to move ahead again, and we are going to do it beginning January 1961. [Applause.] I take my case to the American people because I am confident that the American people will want to bring an end to racial discrimination everywhere, in the schools, in the homes, in the churches, in the lunch counters. I want every American free to stand up for his rights, even if some times he has to sit down for them. [Applause.] And finally I am here because we share a common, deep-seated belief in the workings of free collective bargaining and in the growth of free, responsible unions, and, unlike our opponents, we don't just believe that on Labor Day. [Applause.]"", 'I welcome the support of working men and women everywhere and I am proud of the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. [Applause.] For the labor movement is people. The goals of the labor movement are the goals for all Americans and their enemies are the enemies of progress. The two cannot be separated. The man and party who oppose a decent minimum wage also oppose decent wages for our teachers. The man and the party who oppose medical care for the aged have no more compassion for the small farmer or the small businessman, or hungry families here in the United States or around the world. That kind of man and that kind of party likes things the way they are. Their slogan is, ""You never had it so good."" But let them tell that to the 4 million people who are out of work, to the 3 million Americans who must work part time. Let them tell that to those who farm our farms, in our depressed areas, in our deserted textile and coal towns. Let them try to tell it to the 5 million men and women in the richest country on earth who live on a surplus food diet of $20 a month.', 'The facts of the matter are that the Republican Party for 40 years has opposed all kinds of progressive social legislation. They did it in the special session in the last 4 weeks, and if they are successful they will oppose legislation for the next 4 years. That is not what we want for this country. We want America to move again. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt said it when he accepted the second presidential nomination before 100,000 people in Franklin Field in Philadelphia, and in that speech he said', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. [Applause.]\n', 'For the last 8 years in this country we have bad a Government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. Where Franklin Roosevelt set before our country its unfinished tasks, the unfinished agenda for America, this administration has set ceilings, has set goals. I think we must recapture the spirit of Franklin Roosevelt and start moving forward on the unfinished business facing this country. [Applause.]', 'This is a great country, but it can be greater. This is a prosperous country but it can be the most prosperous country in the world, where all Americans share that prosperity and none live on the marginal edge of existence. But we have to grow, and under Republican leadership this country is standing still, here in this country and around the world. Our workers have seen it in shorter workweeks, our steel industry sees it in producing 50 percent of capacity, and Mr. Khrushchev sees it when he promises to bury us.', 'Here are three facts: One, our economy under the first 6 years of the Republican Administration grew one-half as much as under the last 6 years under the Truman Administration.', 'Fact No. 2, the Russian economy is growing at three times the rate of ours.', 'Fact No. 3, last year, the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.', ""I don't like to see the United States second to any country. We are going to make the United States the first, here, and to all those who look for freedom. [Applause.] With an average rate of growth in this country, every workingman in the last 8 years would have received $7,000 more than he has received, for an education or a new house or a rainy day or his old age. With a really healthy rate of growth, this country can have full employment for all who want a job. With a really healthy rate of growth we can pay for all the defenses that this administration says we can't afford. With a really healthy rate of growth we can afford the best schools for our children and the best paid and the best trained teachers."", 'Finally, with a really healthy rate of growth, we can talk about an economic crusade for justice. But it is time that we stopped talking about it and elected an administration that will do something about it. [Applause.]', ""The fact of the matter is that the President of the United States stated on August 10 that we had a fine year in automobile production, even though a few years ago we produced 1,500,000 more cars than this year, and even though in the city of Detroit you know those who work with you who are unemployed in the auto industry. I don't take that view of the American economy. I think this country's power is unlimited. I think if the President of the United States will just merely set before us our national goals, that all of us are willing to bear the burden that must come to reach those goals. [Applause.]"", ""I spent 1 month in West Virginia in the primary, and I saw all through the coalfields men waiting at 45 years of age for a job they will never get because automation has thrown them out of work, and yet this administration has not even recognized the problem, which may be the most serious domestic problem which our country will face in the next 10 years. We don't want to have machines throwing men out of work. We want machines that will help men live a better life. [Applause.]"", 'And finally, if we are going to grow the way we should grow, we must adopt fiscal policies that will stimulate growth and not discourage it. Every American who financed a home, who bought a refrigerator, who bought an automobile, bought a television set, has suffered from this high interest rate policy. Those of you who bought a home for $10,000 with a 30-year mortgage are going to pay out $3,300 more for that house than you would have paid in the Truman administration. This kind of growth that I am talking about is not antibusiness. It is probusiness. It is not antiprivate enterprise. It is proprivate enterprise, and it is pro the American people.', ""I run for the office of the Presidency not because I think it is an easy job. In many ways I think the next years are going to be the most difficult years in our history. I don't run for the office of the Presidency telling you that if you elect me life is going to be easy, because I don't think that life is going to be easy for Americans in the next decade. But I run for the Presidency because I do not want it said that in the years when our generation held political power that those were the years when America began to slip, when America began to slide. I don't want historians writing in 1970 to say that the balance of power in the 1950's and the 1960's began to turn against the United States and against the cause of freedom. I don't want it said that when we held office and when we were citizens that the Russians and the Chinese Communists began to expand their power. The new frontier is not what I promise I am going to do for you. The new frontier is what I ask you to do for our country. Give me your help, your hand, your voice, and this country can move again.

Now, in 1960, in the great world revolution, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we succeed in this country, if we make this a great country to live in, if we reflect our vitality and energy and strength around the world, then the cause of freedom is strengthened. But if we fail, all fail. If we stand still, freedom stands still.', 'I ask your help.

34,John F. Kennedy ,"September 05, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Williams, distinguished guests, I don't see how the Flint High School football team ever loses any football game with that cheering section.

[Laughter and applause.] Senator McNamara, my friend and colleague who sits next to me in the Senate and advises me always right, Lieutenant Governor and Governor-To-Be John Swainson, Governor Church, Otis Smith, and all the Democrats who are here today who believe that we must win this election, ladies and gentlemen. [Applause.] I come here today to participate in this Labor Day and I come here today as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States, and I come here today and ask your support in that election. [Applause.]"", 'I have served for 14 years on the Labor Committees of the House and the Senate, and year after year, in issue after issue, issues which are important to the working men and women of this country, I have seen liberal Democrats fight for progressive legislation and I have seen the Republican Party vote against them. This is an important election because in this election we are going to determine which way this country is going to go, whether we are going to move ahead or whether we are going to stand still. The record of the Democratic Party in this century is written in the names and the records of four great men, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Mennen Williams, and all the others who carried our banner. [Applause.]', 'I divide the issues which face us as a country domestically into two categories: First, I think it is necessary that we finish the job which Wilson and Roosevelt began, the fight for medical care for the aged, for minimum wage of $1.25, for Federal aid to education, for housing, for a better life for all Americans under a system of equality for all Americans, and then I say that there are new problems which Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman never heard of in their generation.', ""In my race for the Presidency I traveled in many primaries and in many States, in the deserted textile towns ot New Hampshire, in the deserted farms of Wisconsin, in the deserted coal mines of West Virginia, in the lumber fields of Oregon, where men were out of work, even though we needed housing. I saw within the industrial history of those towns one of the great problems which the United States faces in the 1960's and I have seen it in Michigan - and I mean automation. In the county of McDowell, in West Virginia, there is more coal mined than ever before in our history, and in that same county more men and women wait every month for a surplus food package from the Government, composed of a few pounds of rice, some grain, and this summer the Department of Agriculture has announced they are going to add lard. That is what automation means in West Virginia, and it could mean the same across the United States, unless we recognize that machines should provide a better life for people and not a life of desperation for men who are 45 years and 50, and who can't find a job. In the last 5 years in the auto industry in this State you have lost, because of automation, 10,000 jobs, and this has been a matter of indifference to the Federal Government. I do not recall hearing this administration ever discuss it, and unless we begin to attack it, not as a problem in one plant or in one company, but as a national problem which demands our attention, then by 1970 the blight of West Virginia could spread across this country. That is what this election means, issues such as this, where we need to move ahead again, and where we can move ahead if we have vigorous leadership. [Applause.]"", 'First, I think the Federal Government should convene a conference of union leaders and industrial leaders in the basic industries, to discuss with them how they can maintain full employment, whether they move in new machines. Secondly, we must make it plain that the installation of new machinery is a proper subject for collective bargaining. Third, the Government must offer technical assistance to those companies which want to bring in new machinery, but want to do so without undue hardship to the workers. Four, we should expand the activities of the U.S. Employment Service so that we can take care of those people who are hard hit. [Applause.] Fifth, we have to provide job retraining and also decent unemployment compensation standards on a Federal level for those who are thrown out of work. This is an issue which is just beginning, but it is the kind of all issue which I think the Democratic Party recognizes. I am talking about something that can affect the lives of every man and woman in this stadium.', 'Economic growth, automation, full employment - those are the issues of the 1960\'s, a decent life for all Americans. And what Franklin Roosevelt attempted to do in the 1930\'s, in a different scale, facing different problems, we are going to do in the 1960\'s. I ask your help in this ejection. [Applause.] This is a great country. I think it can be greater. I don\'t think that there is any doubt that there is no one in this stadium who is satisfied to see the United States ""first, but,"" \'first, when."" We want to be first, period. [Applause.]', ""We need your help in this election. I hope you will get out and register and participate and get your friends out. This election is your election. I can assure you that if you return these Democrats in this State, if you send Pat McNamara back to the Senate, if you elect Jerry O'Rourke to represent you in the Congress, the House, the Senate, and the Presidency will work together.

Governor Williams, Lieutenant Governor Swainson, and the next Governor, Senator McNamara, and the next Senator, Senator Hart, Don Jennings, who is going to be a great Congressman from this district, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to the Governor. Every time he introduces me as the potentially greatest President in the history of the United States, I always think perhaps he in overstating it in one or two degrees. George Washington wasn't a bad President, and I do want to say a word for Thomas Jefferson. But otherwise I will accept the compliment. [Laughter and applause.] In any case, I am grateful for his support now - Hoover was a great President, too [laughter] and Dewey was a great candidate [laughter]."", 'I want to express my appreciation to the Governor for his present support and his support before the Convention. I spent the day in the State of Michigan, following Walter Reuther around, and I want to say that what I think has been particularly impressive has been the quality of the party leadership here in the State of Michigan, and the wholehearted support and confidence and support that the people of this State have given the Democratic leadership. I appreciate what the Governor said about the St. Lawrence Seaway. I know that in the State of Massachusetts at that time it is not very popular, but it is a source of satisfaction to me that when I ran for office for reelection to the Senate 2 years ago, I secured in the State of Massachusetts the highest vote that was ever given, and I say that because the people of Massachusetts recognized in the long run that a rising tide lifts all the boats, and what is good for one part of the United States is good for all parts of the United States. [Applause.]', ""I do not consider a politician's chief duty to consider how he can gain popularity at the moment. His chief duty, his chief obligation, in fact, his only reason for service, is to tell the truth to the American people, not to serve to please them, but to serve them. That is the responsibility in the difficult years of the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'My criticism of this administration basically, my criticism of the Republican Party is that in the most dangerous years that this country has ever faced, they still use a slogan, ""You\'ve never had it so good."" I don\'t go around the country criticizing present leadership because I enjoy it. I admire the President of the United States as a man, but I do not believe that we can continue the same kind of leadership in the future. [Applause.] A Gallup poll taken in 10 countries a few months ago asked the people of those countries who they thought would be first in 1970, militarily and scientifically, the Russians or the United States. Now, if you had asked them 10 years ago everyone of them would have said the United States. But in 1970, a majority of the people of those countries thought that the Russians would be first, both militarily and scientifically. That is what hurts the United States. If they think we are on the decline and the Russians are on the rise, if they think that our brightest day is somewhere in the past and now the future belongs to the Soviets, then all those people who want to go with the winner turn against us and move in the direction of Moscow and Peking. I want it said in 1970 that we are first, scientifically and militarily, educationally, economically. We should be first because we represent the greatest system of government ever devised. But this system, if it is going to work, requires that all of us dedicate ourselves again. I don\'t run for office telling you what I am going to do for you. I run for office asking you to join with me in rebuilding the prestige of the United States, in demonstrating that we are the greatest country on earth. This country is ready to move.

You have heard of Pocatello. There was a famous story of a U.S. Senator from Idaho who got defeated as we all do sooner or later, and therefore it is always regarded as Senators who stay on and on after being defeated that they don't want to go to Pocatello. I will know tomorrow why that is. [Laughter.] In any case, I am delighted to be in Muskegon. We really have had a great day. I must say I am encouraged. I don't know if they just took me in the strong Democratic areas, but in any case we really had a good day and I am most appreciative to you. [Laughter.]"", ""I am most appreciative to Mennen. This is Governor's day in this district. He endorsed me at a crucial time in my race for the nomination.

He said if this is what Michigan is like in its childhood, what will it be like in its old age. Senator Kass said, ""Michigan or the United States will never have an old age.""', ""I think that is what we are going to decide in 1960. [Applause.] The Democratic Party is the oldest political party on earth. We trace our intellectual descent back to Thomas Jefferson. Our call this year, however, is to the young at heart, whether they are over 65 or under it. All those who believe and have lived through the days of Woodrow Wilson's new freedom, through the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, through the Fair Deal of Harry Truman, through the great crusade of the last 8 years, they know how important this election is that the Democratic Party assume control of the executive branch of the Government. [Applause.] And the Democratic Party of Michigan, under John Swainson, with Pat McNamara and Don Jennings, and all the rest, are prepared to offer that kind of leadership in this State. This has been true of the Democratic Party throughout our history. When the Federalist Party was old and tired, Thomas Jefferson began the Democratic Party. His first action early as President was the Louisiana Purchase, against the wishes of all those who came from my own section of New England, who wanted the country to remain small, secluded, belonging to a few. Instead, he took a chance and spread the United States west, and even though when he became President the western boundary of America was Virginia, he sent Lewis and Clark all the way to the Pacific Ocean to open up the entire United States. That has been the spirit of the Democratic Party. It has been the spirit of Jackson and Roosevelt and Truman and all the rest, and that is the spirit we are going to recapture. [Applause.]"", 'I think this is an important election. I know that candidates think every election is important, but I think that the election of 1960 is important. I think we have an opportunity to make a choice of whether we are going to continue to move forward, as I believe we must. What is at stake in this election is not only our security within this country, but also the position of the United States around the world.', 'Senator Johnson and I are prepared to carry on a great effort to secure a new frontier for the United States, a frontier which offers not merely what we are going to promise in this campaign, but offers an opportunity to all of us to serve the great Republic. It is, I think, a source of concern to us all that the first dogs carried around in outer space were not named Rover and Fido, but, instead, were named Belka and Strelka. It was not named Checkers, either. [Laughter.]', 'In any case, we are finishing in Michigan for the time being, but we are coming back to this State. We have to carry this State. [Applause.]', 'The law says that you can only vote once on election day, but if you will go out and register one person between now and the time of election in November, then you can vote twice. I think that this is an important time. I ask your help in this election. We can win this one. Let us try to work together and make Michigan Democratic, sweep this country in November, and then begin to go to work and roll up our sleeves and begin to move. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.]', ""I want you to know that this campaign, I think, is the most important election that we have had in many ways since the election of 1932. I don't think we want to turn this country for 4 more years over to the Republicans. I think we can win. We can send Pat McNamara back to the Senate, elect a great Governor to succeed Mennen Williams, John Swainson, and give me your help. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

We want him next November 8 to be with us, and if he stays here and listens to the message, maybe he will join us. [Laughter and applause.]', ""This is a great picnic, a beautiful day, and we are delighted to be here. But 1960 is also a serious time in the life of our country. I don't think that there is anyone here today who can possibly be satisfied with what is happening to this country here in this State, here in this country and dear to the cause of freedom around the world. That is what we are concerned about, not as Democrats, not as a political party, but as Americans who believe in this country. [Applause.]"", 'We don\'t say that there is anything wrong with America, but we say that we are not going to be satisfied until America is second to none. We are not going to be satisfied until every American who desires a job can find one at decent pay. [Applause.] We are not going to be satisfied in this country until every American boy and girl is given a decent education; that sign which says ""Welcome, Senior Citizens"" hangs over every labor picnic in the United States today, and it hangs over every Democratic Party meeting, but it does not hang over the Republican national headquarters because just the month of August when we attempted to secure the passage of medical assistance for the aged in social security, we got the vote of only one Republican in the U.S. Senate. We are not satisfied. We are not satisfied to be second. We are not satisfied to have 16 million Americans living out their lives as senior citizens with an average social-security check of $78 a month. I am not satisfied as an American to have the average unemployment compensation check for an American out of work and seeking a job to be $31 a week in the richest country in the world. I am not satisfied to have the average for laundrywomen, and most of them are Negroes, in five large cities, to be 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. This is a great country and we are confident we can move ahead, but we want every American, regardless of where he may live to live in a decent home, with decent schools and a decent hope for the future. That is what we are fighting for in this election. [Applause.]', 'Three years ago I went to Havana, Cuba, and I was told that the American Ambassador was the second most powerful man in Cuba. I am not saying he should have been, but he was. Today the Soviet Ambassador is the second most powerful man in Cuba.', 'I am not content to see the vision of the United States as a strong and vital country dimmed around the world. I am not satisfied to see people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, who used to look to President Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Truman, now wonder what has happened to us, why we are on the decline, and look to Khrushchev and Peiping.', 'This is a great country. It can be greater. It is a powerful country. It can be more powerful. I ask your help in this campaign.

Forty-eight hours ago I went to another fair in the city of Palmer in the State of Alaska. There I saw in that new city, surrounded by the Matanuska Valley, which 25 years ago was a desolate wilderness, and which is today one of the richest farm areas in the United States - I saw a cabbage which weighed 2 pounds. I saw a squash 2 feet long - at least they told me it was a squash. [Laughter.] It indicated in that deserted valley of just a few years ago what Americans can do. The whole State of Alaska, and the State of Michigan, and my own State of Massachusetts, indicates what America can do. [Applause.]', 'This fair tells the story of America. It shows our dependence on the farms. It shows our dependence on the cities. I preach the doctrine of interdependence of the American economy, because this country cannot be prosperous unless the farmers and the workers are prosperous together.

All of us, regardless of our party, regardless of such section of the United States that we live in, want the same things for America. We want security for our families. We want peace in the world, and we want to see the cause of freedom strengthened. That is our obligation. That is the responsibility which we are willing to meet.

41,John F. Kennedy ,"September 06, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Church, State officers, I want to express my appreciation to you for your generous reception at 4:30 in the morning, and also 9 :30. I must say that I was not surprised that Frank Church told me this morning that one-third, pretty near, of the people who had gone to Alaska had come from the State of Idaho, when I saw 100 people at the airport at 4:30 in the morning. Back East the Democrats go to bed about 9 o'clock regardless of what happens, so I was very impressed and my appreciation goes to all. [Laughter.] I have been traveling around the United States for the last few days since the close of Congress, really beginning the Democratic campaign of 1960. In that campaign, I have been discussing some of the problems which the United States faces, and also some of the opportunities which I have included under the general heading of the New Frontier, some of the opportunities which we face as a country. I do not take a depressed view of the future of the United States. I think our potential is unlimited, because the combination of an energetic people, of a free society, occupying a happy land, I think makes us an unbeatable combination for the future."", 'I look to the future of the United States with optimism. I regard our function as the minority party, as members of the Democratic Party, to merely offer the American people alternatives which will increase their strength, their prosperity, and their security. We do not travel in the United States and criticize present action because we feel depressed about the future of our country. We travel the United States in this campaign because it is our responsibility to present to the American people alternative courses of action which will make this a stronger and a better place in which to live. The more I travel in this country, the more I see of it, the more optimistic I become. I think the future of the United States is unlimited, and I say that after traveling to Maine on Friday, to the last frontier of Alaska on Saturday, and to the great industrial frontier of Michigan yesterday.', 'I come today to the frontier of energy, which is symbolized by the vitality which is on the surface in Alaska, and also the energy which is underground in the State of Idaho. [Applause.] I recognize that Idaho is regarded as the potato capital of the world. I was in Aroostook County, Maine, which regards itself as the potato capital of the world. I do not know enough about the rival claims or I know too much about them to make a judgment on which really is the potato capital of the world, except I do believe that it is vitally important for us in this campaign, perhaps not to settle that dispute, but to settle the question of where the capital of the free world is, and that should be Washington, D.C., and will be again. [Applause.]', 'The great issue which the United States faces in this campaign, of course, is our relation with the Sino-Soviet bloc, how we can live in the same world with them, possessing, as we both do, a hydrogen capacity which could destroy mankind as well as our society, and also maintain our security and the security of the free world. That is the basic issue which is before us as Americans, and as believers in freedom, and it is the solution to this somewhat parochial situation that we must address our energy.', 'But I also think it is true that we cannot possibly hope to be strong and vigorous in foreign policy, we cannot hope to assert our will against that of the Communists, until we are a strong and vigorous country here at home. I do not accept the view that we can be influential abroad, that we can be a source of leadership abroad, unless we also are a source of leadership here at home. [Applause.]', 'I think the administrations of Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman prove that point. It is a fact that in those administrations the vitality of the American system was mostly developed, and it has been in those administrations which have stood still at home that we have stood still abroad. Therefore I address myself to domestic matters here in Idaho, but I do so with the realization that they involve our future security throughout the world. I think that the test, of course, of a free society is the kind of leadership it has. The leadership and the support that that leadership can secure, really is essential to the successful working of a free system. A democracy is the most difficult kind of government to operate. It represents the last flowering, really of the human experience. The Communist system really is as old as Egypt, and we represent really the most modern and evolutionary development of the human experience. Therefore, what we need is good leadership, and I think Frank Church is the kind of man which this country needs in a position of leadership. [Applause.]', 'It was not an accident that he was chosen to keynote the Democratic convention as one of the youngest members of the Senate, as a Member of the Senate who has not served out his first term, and coming from a small State, with few electoral votes. He nevertheless was chosen to express the vision of the Democratic Party at the Democratic convention. That is a testimony not only to Idaho but to Frank Church, and I am delighted with it. [Applause.]', 'I hope this State will send another Senator to stand beside him in the Senate and speak for progress for this State and for the country, and will send Bob McLaughlin to the U.S. Senate in November. [Applause.]', ""This last session of the Congress did not fulfill our expectations. One of the reasons was the parliamentary obstruction which the House Rules Committee threw in the way of a successful consideration of bills on education and housing. Both of these are most important issues to the State of Idaho. This State could well use Federal aid for education. It could well use Federal aid for teachers' salaries, and this State's lumber industry could well use a go-ahead signal in the housing industry. But in both of those bills, after they had passed the Senate, members of the House Rules Committee, every Republican member of the Rules Committee, joining with a few Democrats on that committee, in spite of the wishes of the majority of the Democrats on the House Rules Committee, voted against even permitting the Members of the House to vote on housing and education."", 'Now, you cannot move ahead when a few men block passage. Therefore, I think it is essential if we are going to secure a green light to move ahead, that we send Ralph Harding to speak for this district in the Congress of the United States. [Applause.] I have been in the Congress for 14 years, and if there is any lesson that I have learned in that 14 years, it is that in spite of the fact that the Congress of the United States is one of the three coordinate branches of the Federal Government, equal in all respects to the executive and the judiciary, the fact of the matter is that both by the Constitution and by the pressure of events a President is necessary who will cooperate with that Congress if that Congress is going to be effective. If we appropriate money, the President is not compelled to spend it. If we appropriate $600 million for defense, the President can impound it. If we pass legislation dealing with the minimum wage or medical care for the aged tied to social security, if the President vetoes that bill, his veto can be sustained by one-third of the Senate plus one and/or one-third of the House plus one. Therefore, in order for the Congress, which is today Democratic, to fulfill its commitments as supporters of the Democratic platform it is also necessary to have a President that can work with the Congress and not against it. I run for the Office of the Presidency recognizing that the Presidency is the wellspring of action in the American constitutional system. Only the President speaks for the United States. Frank Church speaks for Idaho, and I speak for Massachusetts and Senator Jackson speaks for Washington. But only the President of the United States speaks for Washington and Idaho and Massachusetts, and only if a President supports action can this country hope to move ahead. You have seen that as it affects the State of Idaho in recent weeks. The decision of the President of the United States to veto the bill which would have brought relief to the lead and zinc mines of the State of Idaho indicated that in spite of the fact that it had passed both the House and the Senate, the President of the United States was able to kill it because of the powers of that Office. I do not say that those powers should be limited. It should be within the jurisdiction of the President and in his competence to veto bills. But I do say that we will move ahead more if a President of the United States shares the views of a Democratic Congress rather than opposes them. [Applause.]', 'Another bill which I think is of importance, and I was asked about it at the press conference this morning, but I did not know what they were talking about, was, of course, the project which deals with the Burns Creek. I had considered the matter and voted for it twice as part of the effort to finish the Palisades project. Let me make it clear that project has come before the U.S. Senate twice. It deals with a matter of supporting power and irrigation. I supported it on both of those occasions. Unfortunately, in the last days of the last session that bill did not come to the floor of the House of Representatives. I want to make it perfectly clear that if I am elected President or if I serve in the U.S. Senate, that that project will receive my support for the third time. [Applause.]', ""I don't want to, however, dwell on the past. I want to stress the future, for this election does not really go in the long run to the records of the two parties in past years. The only significance of analyzing the past is that it does give us some key to the future. I think that here in this particular part of Idaho we have one of the keys for the future. That is in the National Reactor Testing Station at Arco. Here is the key to our own military mobility. But it is also a key to the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy, which can make atomic energy not merely a burden for mankind but a blessing. This station is an important output and an important outpost to the new frontier of energy. This Nation can be proud of what is going on at that station. But the Nation should also be concerned about what is not going on at the Arco station. That station is doing an excellent job of testing atomic powerplants and reactors. But if we are moving ahead, if we are going to move ahead with more vision and vigor in this field, Arco today could be testing on an extensive scale advanced reactor concepts for rocket propulsion, space vehicles, and civilian atomic power. If this Nation were moving ahead with more aggressive research and development in this field, the benefits would be felt throughout the West, for in this region alone are more than three-fourths of the free world's known uranium reserves, uranium mines which are now plagued with cutbacks and stretchouts could be tapped to their fall potential. But even more important, that kind of aggressive atomic research and development is needed if this country is going to win the race for peaceful competition. [Applause.]"", 'The harsh facts of the matter are that this Nation today is not moving ahead on the kind of research and development project in atomic energy that we must do if we are going to maintain our position of leadership in this vital field of energy. The National Science Advisory Committee on Mineral Research has also indicated that we are not moving ahead in that field, and they have recommended more intensive research into getting at minerals deep under ground, to find new ways of locating the vast wealth which is underneath the sediment covering the Western States.', 'Our methods of exploring mineral deposits on or near the surface are no longer sufficient, particularly if we are to compete with foreign producers who work rich ranges of ore. Similarly, our research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy has fallen far short of expectation. This is a matter of particular interest to the people who live in my own section of New England. We have the highest power rates in the United States, nearly twice as high as they are in the Tennessee Valley or in the Northwest United States. Our only hope of maintaining our industry in that old section of the United States, for we lack your hydro resources, is to secure, quickly, atomic energy for peaceful uses. We will be the first section of the United States to use that atomic energy. Therefore, I want to point out once again the interrelationship between the American economy. This is of interest to you because you have the stations and you have the uranium. It is of interest to those of us who live in the East because we can use it first. This is the kind of partnership which the Democratic Party preaches and it is under that kind of partnership that this country will move ahead. [Applause.]', ""This is an important election because this is a most important time. All of us who read this morning's paper about what goes on in the Congo, or who has read the paper of 2 months ago about what went on in Laos, or has read the papers of the last 2 years about what has been going on in Cuba, know that there is no real balance in the power relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. That balance can be changed by a change in government. If the people of those areas of Latin America and Africa and the Middle East and Asia come to feel that the future belongs to the Communist world, that we are on the way out, that our system, while very nice, is a system which has a definite evolutionary limitation, then, of course, the young and aggressive, and those who are ambitious and searching for power, will begin to make their peace with the Communist world. They will begin to travel in China and Russia. They will begin to exchange visits, students will want to go to school in Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Moscow, and Peiping, and not be so interested in coming to France or England, or the United States. Once they feel that the sun of the West is setting and that the sun of the East is rising, that we are unable to solve our problems, that the Communists who have moved from a room in Switzerland in the days before World War I into dominating great reaches of the globe and great masses of the population are still expanding their power outward, then quite obviously the power balance be gins to shift against us."", 'It may not require military intervention. It may be a long, slow process like the rotting of a great tree inside, which ultimately blows over from the first small wind that passes, and then we all say, ""What happened? We never thought that tree would fall.""', 'That is what we have to be concerned about, to make sure that the people of the world feel that this system of ours has endless vitality, that we are moving ahead, that we are solving our problems, that they can look to us for leadership in the future, that the balance of power is shifting to us, not to the Communists. That, I think, is the basic issue of this campaign.', 'I mentioned before the fact, and some of you may have seen it, that a Gallup poll was taken in 10 countries scattered around the world, asking those people which country they thought would be first in 1970, militarily and scientifically. A majority in both categories in the 10 countries felt that by the year 1970 the Soviet Union would be first, militarily and scientifically. They have seen the Soviet Union first in space; they have seen it first around the moon, and first around the sun. They see them turning out more engineers and scientists than we do. They see them making gains in Cuba and the Congo, Laos, in the last years. They realize that in January or February, India, which represents a great hope for freedom, may be facing an economic crisis. They see uncertainty in other countries. They see the Soviet Union having a foothold in the Middle East, which has been an object of Russian policy for two or three hundred years, and they come to the conclusion that the Soviet tide is rising and ours is ebbing. I think it is up to us to reverse that point. I think it is up to us to demonstrate that this is a great country, representing the greatest form of government, but that freedom and strength go hand in hand, and are not contradictory. I ask your help in this election. I think we can win this election. [Applause.] And I think then that this country will begin to move again, and that the title of citizen of the United States will once again be the proudest boast of any people. This country is a great country. I think it can be greater. This State is a great State, but I think it can be greater. It is with that optimism and that confidence that I think we should move again in this State and country. I ask your help. I am convinced that with it we can win. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Governor and Mrs. Rosellini, Senator Jackson, fellow Democrats in the State of Washington, I am grateful for a generous introduction from a distinguished Governor of a great Northwestern State, who, I am confident, will be returned as Governor in the November election, Governor Rosellini. [Applause.] And I am delighted to be in this State with my friend and colleague who has joined me in this great effort in this campaign as chairman of the National Democratic Party - your friend and Senator, ""Scoop"" Jackson. [Applause.]', ""In the last 4 days I have taken this campaign to five States, stretching from the oldest part of the United States, the State of Maine, into the newest and the last frontier, the State of Alaska, and in that campaign, in those States, I have found a common impulse facing the American people in 1960, and that is their desire for action. [Applause.] They want this country to begin to move again here at home, to meet the tremendous problems that we face here in this State and in the country, and they want us moving again abroad in order to stem the Communist advance. [Applause.] I believe that the American people will elect a President to act. I believe that the crises of the 1960's will compel the next President to act, and I believe that if this country is to endure and prevail, that it must start moving again."", 'I am in this campaign as a candidate for the Office of President of the United States. That is the greatest Office in the free world. The Congress cannot do the job. As a Senator I speak for Massachusetts and Senator Jackson speaks for Washington. But the President of the United States speaks for both Washington and Massachusetts. [Applause.]', 'This election in many ways is the most significant, certainly, since the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. [Applause.] And the task of the next President will in many ways be more difficult than any since the election of 1860 of a distinguished American President. In a world of danger and trial, peace is our deepest aspiration, and when peace comes we will gladly convert not our swords into plowshares, but our bombs into peaceful reactors, and our planes into space vessels. ""Pursue peace,"" the Bible tells us, and we shall pursue it with every effort and every energy that we possess. But it is an unfortunate fact that we can secure peace only by preparing for war. Winston Churchill said in 1949, ""We arm to parley."" We can convince Mr. Khrushchev to bargain seriously at the conference table if he respects our strength. [Applause.] He will never resort to war, and in that way we shall secure peace, if he realizes that the balance if power is shifting against him. I can imagine no more hazardous course than for the United States to gamble on its defenses, to take a chance that the Russians and the Chinese Communists will follow a peaceful role if we disarm here in the United States, or if we fail to maintain our strength. If we are strong, then peace will be our reward, and that is the doctrine that we preach in the year 1960. [Applause.]', 'That requires only one kind of defense policy, a policy summed up in a single word ""first."" I do not mean ""first, if,"" I do not mean ""first, but,"" I do not mean ""first, when,"" but I mean ""First, period."" [Applause.]', ""The next President of the United States will be compelled to submit to the next Congress a whole new set of defense goals. It will require a reevaluation of our commitments around the globe, a reevaluation of our weapons and a reevaluation of our budgetary policy. We must put more of our present B-52's in the air to guard against a surprise attack [applause] while we intensify and concentrate our energy in building the most modern, mobile, invulnerable missile force on which our ultimate ability to retaliate will finally depend. But bigger and better weapons, and faster and more effective armies are not enough. The needs of modern defense cut across the ancient and traditional service lines. Missiles are fired from the air and from the land and from under the sea. The modern force needs planes for transportation and ships for support. Specific combat missions and strategic goals are shared by many forces. It is essential, therefore, that we compel the complete reevaluation of our national defense organization, that we eliminate the wasteful duplication, the service rivalry, the competitive overlapping, that has consumed our money and prevented us from developing maximum strength; that we move forward toward a defense technology to meet the modern demands of the fight for peace."", ""That is a difficult subject, but it is a difficult world. I don't think that there is any doubt that the road for peace ahead can be won if we maintain our own vitality here in the United States and around the world. This is a great country, but I believe it can be a greater country. It is a powerful country, but I believe it can be more powerful. And I think that if we realize all of our opportunities here in the United States, if we move ahead and develop our economic strength here in this country if we maintain our defenses, then we can maintain our leadership in the free world, maintain our security and protect the peace."", 'That is the object of this campaign, to serve the American people and suggest a whole course of action in the various areas of the national effort so that we in this country can be secure and so the cause of freedom can be strengthened.

I run emphasizing the services which the American people must offer their country. [Applause.] My call is not to those who believe they belong to the past.

In 1860 Lincoln said, ""This Nation cannot exist half slave and half free."" I don\'t think in the 1960\'s that this world can exist half slave and half free. and the basic question of this election is what course of action should we adopt, what course of energy should we follow, what course of leadership should we practice if the world is going to move not in the direction of slavery but in the direction of freedom. That is the issue of this campaign and it is most appropriate, therefore, that we meet under the statue of Lincoln. He faced it in his country in 1860.

From Aroostook County to Anchorage, the oldest part of the Nation to the newest, I have met the American people - I have listened to them and I have found them ready for one basic change: Action.', 'They want action at home to keep pace with needs, to help the unfortunate, to build a still greater nation. And they want action abroad, to match the rise in Communist power, to meet the turbulent revolutions reshaping our globe.', ""I believe the American people elect a President to act. I believe the crises of the 1960's require him to act. And I believe the voters all across the country in November 1960 are going to call for action."", 'I am in this campaign as your candidate for President of the United States. That is the greatest office in the world - the only office that speaks for all the people. The Congress cannot do the job alone - that ought to be clear to everyone by now. If this Nation is to reassert the initiative in foreign affairs, it must be presidential initiative. If we are to rebuild our prestige in the eyes of the world, it must be presidential prestige. And if we are to regain progressive leadership on our domestic problems, it must be presidential leadership.', ""If the President does not move, if his party is opposed to progress, then the Nation does not move - and there is no progress. But this country cannot afford to stand still in the 1960's - for the whole wide world is moving around us."", 'The next President of the United States will face problems unlike those any President ever faced before. Here at home we are only beginning to sense the impact of automation, machines replacing men, we are only beginning to feel the pressures on our schools and colleges - on the cost of medical care for the aged - on farms caught in a cost-price squeeze - in cities caught in a downward spiral of slums, high taxes, and the flight to outlying areas.', 'The world is changing, too. The old era has ended. The old ways will not do. A few years ago, most Americans had never heard of Nasser, Lumumba, Castro, or even Khrushchev. We did not know of any serious Communist problems in the Middle East, in Africa or in Latin America.', 'But now there are new leaders, new nations, new weapons of destruction. The balance of power is shifting. The gap between rich and poor is growing. And the world in which we are only a tiny minority is restless, watching and on the move.', 'There is only one area of change which this State knows better than any other - and that is the change in the military balance of power. This State knows firsthand about seapower. You know firsthand the changes in our relative power - and I mean relative to that of the Soviet Union.', 'For we are no longer assured of protection by our oceans, in an age when an ICBM can reach our shores in less than 20 minutes. We are no longer assured of time to mobilize in an age when one enemy warhead contains more explosive than all the bombs dropped in World War II put together. And we are no longer assured of being first in the world in every phase now and in the foreseeable future.', 'The people of Washington are proud of their contribution to national defense - and you are aware of its contribution to your economy. But I cannot believe that there is one person in this State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams. With careful planning for reconversion, this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war.', 'For peace is our deepest aspiration. And when peace comes, we will gladly convert, not our swords into plowshares, but our bombs into reactors and our missiles into space vehicles. ""Pursue peace,"" the Bible tells us - and we shall pursue it with every effort and energy we possess.', ""But it is an unfortunate fact that we can prepare for peace only by preparing for war. We can convince Mr. Khrushchev to bargain seriously for peace only when our strength makes clear to him that no war will ever be to his advantage - and that the balance of power is not moving his way. We cannot do that by arguing with him - and we can't do that by smiling at him. The only way we can get his agreement to disarmament is by our strength of armaments, enough to stop the next war before it starts."", 'That requires only one kind of defense policy - a policy summed up in one word - first. I do not mean first when. I do not mean first if. I do not mean first but. I mean first in military power across the land - and first in diplomacy, prestige, science, education.', 'The next President of the United States - whether he is a Democrat or a Republican, and whether he likes it or not - must be prepared to submit to the new Congress a whole new set of defense goals. It will require a reevaluation of our commitments around the world - a reevaluation of our base system - a reevaluation policy.', 'For we are moving into a new era - and the old concepts will not do. The old plans of organization will not do. The old leadership will not do. And I believe that the Democratic Party is prepared to offer the new leadership and the new ideas our Nation will need.', 'I do not say that all these decisions will be easy. They will not be popular.', 'They would not all be guaranteed to work.', 'But I would remind you that 340 years ago today a little band of men and women set out to find a new life on a new frontier. They sailed from Plymouth, England, and they called their ship the Mayflower.', ""Their course was risky and uncertain - they knew hardship and sacrifice lay ahead. But they sailed on because they were moved by man's deepest aspiration - the eternal desire to be free."", 'Now, 340 years later, the freedom those hardy Pilgrims won on a small Massachusetts beachhead is in danger again. Once again we must commit ourselves to great ends. Once again we must take uncertain risks - sail uncharted sea - explore unconquered territory.', 'I have called this challenge the New Frontier. I have made it the theme of my campaign. I do not run for the Presidency to emphasize what services this country will offer the American people under a new administration - I run emphasizing the service which the American people must offer their country. My call is not to those who believe they belong to the past - my call is to those who believe in the future.', 'Will you join me in this endeavor: Will you be pilgrims and pioneers on the New Frontier? I cannot promise you safety - I cannot even promise success. But I pledge you an administration that will get this Nation moving again, toward a new and better world where freedom is secure.']"
45,John F. Kennedy ,"September 06, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here. I want to make a statement on one matter. I talked this morning to the State Department in regard to the inquiry which I had addressed yesterday to them in response to reports in a newspaper in regard to the fueling of Russian planes in Athens. In talking to Mr. Herter's assistant, he informs me that the field is a field under the control of the Greek Government. Some planes from Russia have flown through there and have been refueled. They stated that they were on a food mission. He is going to inform me later in the day whether the flights have been continued or are continuing at the present time. But I think that the explanation that Secretary Herter's assistant gave was completely satisfactory, and obviously they were concerned about the matter and were following it closely themselves."", 'QUESTION. Senator, whom did you talk to, Bill Macomber?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, my representative talked to Mr. Krebs. We are going to talk to him later in the day about what the exact status of these flights is at the present time.', 'QUESTION. Who was your representative, sir?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Salinger talked to him.', ""QUESTION. What was your reaction in general to yesterday's campaign, Senator."", ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I thought it was an excellent day from our point of view, and I think probably one of the best that I have experienced. In addition, I thought it was very impressive from Michigan's point of view. I thought the State and the people there showed a good deal of vitality and cooperation and spirit. Therefore, I thought it was a very impressive day."", ""QUESTION. Senator, turning to today's campaigning, how important do you think the western tier of States and votes are going to be and how hard do you think it will be to gain success in these Western States?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think the Western States are important. Idaho is important - the fact that Frank Church was the keynoter for our [National]* convention. Also, if you put all the Rocky Mountain States and the coast States together, they represent a very important segment of the electoral college. It is for that reason that I have come to Pocatello and to Idaho again.', 'QUESTION. Senator, we are growing surplus crops in Idaho and we have been restricted on sugar beet growing. Yet we are importing sugar from foreign countries. What would you do if elected President on this particular situation?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would attempt to sustain the income of the sugar beet people. Of course, we are going to have to continue to import sugar from abroad. We could not possibly fulfill our domestic needs. But I do think we ought to make a balance which will sustain the income of local sugar producers and also meet the needs of the American consuming public. Actually, a good deal of agriculture has had difficulty, ranging far beyond sugar beets, and in this State.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, we here in this part of the State are interested in Burns Creek. We know that although most people are for it, it was defeated and did not even get out of the House. How do you feel about the Burns Creek and other reclamation projects?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't know enough about it to give you a comment on it."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy', 'Senator KENNEDY. It did not come to the Senate, did it?', 'QUESTION. It passed the Senate.', 'Senator KENNEDY. You will have to inform me again. It is early in the morning.', 'QUESTION. The Burns Creek bill passed the Senate. It was defeated in the House by the committee. The committee did not take it up before the House adjourned.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Frank Church and I are flying out together. I am sure he will tell me about it for the rest of the morning.', 'QUESTION. What are your farm plans for grains, sugar beets, and potatoes?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think, of course, that the other commodities I would hope to try to reach a balance on between supply and demand after making a determination of what the potential demand might be in the United States and in the markets overseas and for our surplus distributions in the United States. Any needs that we might have in order to fulfill the security requirements of the United States. And then I would attempt to provide a balance between that demand and the supply. What we are attempting to do is cut down the over-production which helps to break the price.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, especially in relation to cobalt, are you in favor of any cut in mineral import quotas?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I supported strongly the bill which was vetoed by the President, which I think was perhaps the only fair and effective solution that we would have had for the problems of the mineral industry in this State and county. The problems of the mineral industry in Idaho I think are probably more serious than they have ever been before. What is true of Idaho is true - particularly in lead and zinc and some of the other mines, cobalt - through the whole western range. I would think that that represents the most effective solution. The difficulties we are presently experiencing in the Congo are going to possibly have an effect on cobalt. But generally I would put the emphasis on the program which the President vetoed. I think if that bill had passed it would have meant relief to a good many miners and mines in this State and around the west.', 'QUESTION. Senator, in Indianapolis yesterday, former President Truman, speaking in behalf of the ticket, said of Vice President Nixon, ""While he stands at the front door proclaiming charity and tolerance, his supporters are herding the forces of racial, religious, and antiunion bigotry in by way of the back door. And no one will ever make me believe he is not smart enough to know what is going on."" Do you have any comment on that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No. I did not see the statement of the President. I think you are familiar with the fact that I did not plan to comment on Vice President Nixon or any of his actions until he is out of the hospital. Therefore, I am not participating in any way in any attack on the Vice President at this time.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, if I may ask for some information on the Democratic platform, certain proposals of the platform have been opposed in Congress by members of the Democratic Party, notably toughening amendments on the defense reorganization bill and the change in the national quota system of the McCarran-Walter Act. My question is, If you are elected, how will you go about making good on these sections of the platform which have been opposed by some members of your party in Congress?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, the platform represents the viewpoint of the majority of the Democrats speaking as representatives of the party at the party convention. I support strongly that platform. I think in my legislative career, in the matters on immigration - I am thinking of those now particularly because we have had no bills dealing with that matter before us in the special session so we are really talking about the past - but I feel committed to the platform and would do my best, if elected, to implement it, and I think that the power of the Presidency is great. We have not had control of the Presidency for 8 years, and it is very difficult for the Congress, which is a partner of the Executive, to carry out a program in opposition to the wishes of the Executive. The platform on these matters we are going to attempt to carry out if elected.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, Congressman Budge from this district is a new member of the House Rules Committee. Have you any comment on the role of the Rules Committee in this special session?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes, the Rules Committee, of course, bottled up two important bills in the House of Representatives. One was dealing with aid to education, and one dealt with the housing bill. Both of those bills would have been very important to the State of Idaho. The Republican members of the Rules Committee refused to vote any of them, to permit these bills to come to the floor of the House. From reports I have read they evidently agreed to have the House go to conference on minimum wage only because they understood that the House conferees would not budge from the House bill, which was $1.15 and hopelessly inadequate. Therefore, I feel that this was an unfortunate act because I think both of those bills are essential. I think that it is difficult for me to understand, in view of the commitments which have been made by many Republicans to housing and education bills, why at least one of them would not vote to permit those bills to come to the floor of the House. It is true that several Democrats joined the Republicans, and I disagree strongly with them. But the majority of Democrats voted in the Rules Committee to permit both of those bills to go to the floor of the House so the House could vote. The Senate had passed both of those bills.', ""QUESTION. Senator, yesterday's news releases indicate that you might be against automation."", ""Senator KENNEDY. No, I am not. But I do think it is a real problem, because we are concerned about the effect it has on employment. Automation is constantly with us. Without automation this country would not move, nor would the industrial revolution move. So I am for automation. But I am concerned that the Federal Government use its influence to lessen the impact of new machinery on men, on employment. I saw the result of it most vividly in the coal areas. I am sure you felt it in the mines here in the West, with new machinery, and of course, we have an example - well, you find it in every industry, particularly in mining. So I would think that the Federal Government should interest itself in this as a national problem in the 1960's, so that machines bring a better life and not unemployment."", 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.\n--------', '*Corrected']"
46,John F. Kennedy ,"September 06, 1960","['Senator JACKSON. Ladies and gentlemen, in the remaining 10 or 11 minutes that we have left on television and on the air, we are going to do something different in the way of a political meeting. We want to give the audience an opportunity to participate.', 'About 90 minutes ago, each person here was given an opportunity to fill out on a card the question they might like to ask Senator Kennedy. These cards have been selected. The cards have been screened by a group of distinguished Seattle Democrats. [Laughter.] There is no payola in this. [Laughter.]', 'Senator Kennedy has not seen the questions. It is not possible to let every person ask a question in the next 10 minutes, but the judges have tried to select 10 representative people to ask or propound the questions. Senator Kennedy has not seen the questions. So with that we will start with the first question.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, in your attainment of the suggested program of the new frontier, what safeguards, if any, are you proposing to avoid an unhealthy inflation or an unhealthy national debt?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Let me say that I think it is extremely important that the United States maintain to the extent possible, a sound fiscal policy and a balanced budget. There are only two reasons, in my opinion, for an unbalanced budget. One, if there is a great national emergency requiring an expenditure by the Federal Government to protect the security of the United States, or, two, if there is serious unemployment which requires action by the Federal Government. The most serious, potent peacetime deficit in the history of the United States was in 1958, when we ran a $12 billion deficit. It was not due to excessive expenditures. It was due to the recession of 1958, which was permitted to slide and which cost us over $12 billion in revenue.', 'I would hope we could avoid recessions. I would hope we could take action early enough. I would hope that our fiscal and monetary policy would have sufficient vitality to maintain the upward growth of our economy. Within that general sphere I would attempt to maintain a balanced budget and a balance between the funds that come in and the funds that go out, unless there was wide unemployment, or a threat to our security that required the defense expenditure. [Applause.]', 'Senator JACKSON. As you state your question, please give your name.', 'QUESTION. I am Bill Buskirk, and I would like to ask you how do you propose to counteract the persistent attacks leveled on you against your religion, especially in the South?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't propose really to counteract them, because I am not - what I propose to do is answer any questions that anyone might address to me on any matter of public policy, even if it involves the question of church and state. The Presidency is a very powerful office. I do not take exception at all if someone asks me my views on those matters where church and state may come close together, and if anybody wants to ask my views on aid to education or on the general question of religious freedom, I am delighted to answer."", ""I know that probably some people aren't interested in my views. They have made up their minds that regardless of what my previous history may have been, regardless of how I expressed my views or what my statements may have been, regardless of what support I give the first amendment as a matter of conviction, they will vote against me. And I am sure there is nothing I can say to them. All I can say is that this is a very dangerous time in the life of our country. There are very serious issues. I cannot believe that anyone would throw away their vote by voting for me or against me because of my religion, rather than the things for which I might stand. [Applause.]"", 'Senator JACKSON. The next question, and state your name, please.', 'QUESTION. I am Mrs. Charlotte Hoyt. Senator Kennedy, would you outline the program you propose to help solve the farm surplus problem, please?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think that the decline in farm income, which is so sharp, makes this the No.1 domestic problem. I think the No.1 overall problem which faces farmers and city dwellers alike is, of course, or relations with the Sino-Soviet bloc and the fight for peace. But within the United States, while we face many serious problems, involving segments of our economy, I do think the problem facing the farmers of the United States at the present time is the most serious one, because it really affects us all. Farmers are the No.1 market for Detroit for automobiles, and Detroit is the No.1 market for Pittsburgh for steel, and therefore, there is an interrelationship in the economy. I would say we would have to bring about a balance between the supply and the demand. I think the Government should make a determination each year in the basic commodities, how much we can consume in the market place each year in our country, how much we can sell around the world, how much we need for school lunches and for people who are on relief - and there are 5 million Americans dependent on surplus food - how much we need to help those countries who do not have enough food, whose assistance we want, and who desire to be associated with us, particularly the countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. And beyond that I think we should make a limitation on production so that we don't have surpluses which break the price. Within that production I would have a higher support price than the present administration has permitted. I think it is an extremely difficult problem, but if supply and demand are in balance, with a higher support price and more imaginative use of our surpluses, I think we can begin them on the upward turn again. Today, many farmers are as low as they have been in 20 years. [Applause.]"", 'Senator JACKSON. The next question, please, and state your name.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Bill Cavanaugh. I would like to ask you, how do you propose to effectively deal with the problem of communism from within, or indirect aggression, such as has recently been evidenced in Cuba', ""Senator KENNEDY. I agree with you, I think that is obviously the most serious kind of challenge you are going to have in the 1960's, but then it does tie in with the point I tried to make in my speech. One of the problems that we have in these countries is that many of them feel that the balance of power is shifting against us and in favor of the Communist world. If we were first in space, if our economic growth was comparable to that of the Communist world, if we maintained a vitality in the sciences and engineering and education, then many of these countries would think the future lay with us and not with the Communist world. Now, in the case of the Congo, I think the responsibility belongs to the United Nations. I think this is the great test of the United Nations. I do not believe the United Nations can possibly afford to permit the Communists, under the shield of the United Nations, to carry on subversion. The United Nations cannot force a solution in the Congo, but they can prevent Russians or Chinese Communists from infiltrating and using the present crises in the Congo as a method of securing power."", 'Secondly, in the case of Cuba, I think the basic error was made in the last stage of Batista, when we did not use our great influence which we had then to persuade Batista to permit free elections and a return to constitutional government, and let the Cuban people pick his successor, instead of letting Castro seize it in almost a palace revolution.', 'Thirdly, I think that in the problem of Cuba we have to work with the other - the Organization of the American States, and I am most concerned, not only that we isolate Cuba, but that we attempt to isolate the Cuban revolution from the rest of South America. I think that is the big danger, that from Cuba as a base they will expand their power. I think we should use our influence to prevent it.', 'Scoop Jackson is waving at me.', 'I would say if I may I think you have asked a fundamental question in foreign policy and it is extremely difficult to answer it in 1 minute. I am sorry. [Applause.]', 'I guess there are five other questions that I did not get to. I want to apologize for going on so long, but they are all matters of great importance.', 'Senator JACKSON. We have time for another question, even if we are not on TV. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I would like to hear your comments as to what your position will be relative to the development of our natural power resources in the Northwest here.', 'Senator KENNEDY. In the first place, the United States is going to have twice as many people by the year 2,000 as it does today. Therefore, the demands on all of our natural resources, power, land, water and all of these, are going to be at a far greater extent than they are today. I think that we should recognize that every time water goes down from where it begins to the sea without being used, either for power or for irrigation, it is being wasted. I take the same view that Theodore Roosevelt took 45 years ago, and there it is a source of satisfaction to me that the two Americans that did more to develop the resources of the United States were both from the State of New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt, and I would follow in that tradition. [Applause.]', 'We can have one more question. I think we are off the air, but if there is one more, I thought we might perhaps try to get through with the 10, anyway. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. I am Mrs. Ralph Closer. Senator Kennedy, what do you believe to be the most important political issue of this campaign?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think the most important issue, and it is not political in the partisan sense, but it is the issue which concerns us all, is how we can live on the same globe with the Communists, both possessing hydrogen capacity which could destroy us all, and try to live in peace and protect our security, and continue to survive. I would say that is the big challenge ahead for the United States. I am confident that we can do it. But I don't think we can afford to do it, to continue to do it, if we are on the decline here in the United States. I think that the real issue in the sense of the need for action is for us to demonstrate to people all around the world that we are an expanding society, whose high noon is still ahead, and not in the past. I think that is the real issue. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. My name is Mrs. Archie Wornecke. Senator Kennedy, I would like to ask you would you suggest a better health and welfare program for the aged people?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I could not think of a worse program, in my judgment, considering the needs, than the one that was finally passed in this session and signed by the President. [Applause.]', 'I supported an effort and Scoop Jackson and Senator Magnuson both voted the same way, which was to tie medical care for the aged to social security. The program which passed this Congress and was signed by the President is going to cost an estimated $2 billion a year, $1 billion from the States and $1 billion from the Federal Government, to provide inadequate services, when we had a great system which it could have been tied to, which was social security, which has worked so well for nearly 25 years. I think that medical care for the aged should be tied to social security, financed through the social security system, and I think we ought to do it next January, even if we did not do it last August. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. My name is J. T. Hong. Senator Kennedy, I would like to ask you, how do you plan to obtain 5 percent economic growth without raising taxes?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Let me say that I don't believe that there is an intimate relationship between raising taxes and economic growth. In fact, under the present conditions, I can imagine nothing more deflationary than to increase taxes. I don't say that it is possible immediately to provide 5 percent economic growth. The Democratic platform called for it and the Rockefeller brothers 2 years ago said it was possible. I do think, however, that we can secure a better economic growth than we have today, and we can aim for the goal of 5 percent. It is a fact that Germany, France, and England all had a growth of 5 percent or over last year. We had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. I do think that both monetary and fiscal policies combine with other programs which I think could stimulate economic activity, a redrafting of our tax laws, a ceasing of dependence on a high-interest policy which I think directly tightened up credit at the beginning of 1958 depression which led to that serious drop in our national growth. I don't think that anyone has suggested that we should increase taxes at the present time in order to stimulate growth. The only time I heard taxes discussed, and I discussed them, would be if we had a serious national emergency requiring a large appropriation for national defense at a time when our economy was booming and we suffered a serious danger of inflation. That would be, in my opinion, the time that you might have to face up to the problem of taxes. But if you are talking about economic growth, there is not an intimate relationship at the present time between a tax increase and economic In fact, in my opinion, they would be contradictory."", 'I say that mostly because we are moving into a plateau now in our economic growth, and I think it is a matter of concern to us in the winter of 1961.', 'QUESTION. My name is Chris Matthews. Senator Kennedy, I would like to ask, assuming you were President of the United States, specifically how would you react if East Germany signed a defense treaty with the Soviet Union?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would think it would be a matter of serious concern because it could well lead to a blockade by the East Germans of the entrance into West Berlin. If that happens, our commitments are extremely clear. We have to make it clear, and I don't think we will have the eventuality, if we do - we have to make it clear and mean it that our guarantees to West Berlin are going to be maintained, that we are not going to permit---[Applause]. Of course, the reason is clear. If we permitted the Soviet Union to drive us out of West Berlin, then our whole position in Western Germany and indeed in all of Western Europe, would be endangered, and since their policy since the end of World War II has been to secure control of Western Germany and Japan, and our objective has been to maintain West Germany and Japan, it is obvious that this security falls to the United States. I think we should make it extremely clear that if a peace treaty resulted in a blockade of Berlin, that it would be regarded as an extremely important act, involving the security of the United States. I think we should make it very clear, and I do as a Democrat, that I support the administration's efforts in the case of West Berlin and will continue to do so, regardless of what position I may hold. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Frank Roberts. I would like to ask what can be done to salvage our national prestige among the uncommitted nations of the world?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would say there are three or four things very quickly. In the first place, the United States has really almost ignored Latin America up to the last 6 months. In fact, the administration has proposed [applause] - the administration has proposed a program of some economic assistance to Latin America, but it is only a request for an authorization, and there will not be a request for an appropriation until the next administration takes over, 8 years later than the action should have been carried out.', 'Secondly, our intimate association in some countries with dictators at a time when a whole democratic movement was sweeping Latin America has led to some of our difficulties, not only Cuba, but in some other sections of that vital area.', 'I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa. Africa is going to be extremely important because one quarter of all the members of the General Assembly in the next 2 or 3 years will be Africans, and I can say that as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the United States has been completely blind as to what has been happening in the Congo. There are less than 12 college-educated people who hold university degrees in that country. The head of the Army was a sergeant. There were no Negro officers who were natives of the Congo. That country was wholly unprepared for the freedom and independence, and no effort was made, which at least the British in the case of India made, to build up educated men and women who could assume the responsibilities of government. We treated Africa as a dark and unknown partner, and we are reaping the harvest. I think we ought to put an effort into an exchange of students. We ought to make sure that we bring in not only students, but trade-union leaders and all the rest. We had a long debate in the month of July about 300 African students, whether they were going to get over to the United States, and the State Department had no funds. [Applause.]', ""Thirdly, I would say that the most critical area involving the so-called undeveloped world and newly emerging world is in the case of India, because 35 to 40 percent of all the people who live in the underdeveloped world live in India, and India's economic position is going to be extremely critical after the first of the year when she is going to have a great drain on her foreign exchange. I don't think the United States has ever strengthened the loan fund the way Senator Fulbright and Senator Humphrey and I hoped they would 2 years ago. In fact, the administration blocked our efforts. So for India, which looks to us for free world assistance, comes the first of the year and we are unable to provide her with the loans she is going to need, and she is in economic competition with the Communist Chinese."", ""If India fails and China succeeds, then of course the balance of power moves against us. This in the 1960's will be the great area of competition."", ""And lastly may I say, and this is the end, I want to emphasize that what we do in this country affects our position in all of these undeveloped countries. The reason that Woodrow Wilson was so successful was because he had his new freedom here which was directly related to the 14 points abroad. Franklin Roosevelt's good neighbor policy and his other policies around the world were directly related to the idealistic aspirations of the New Deal. Therefore, I think the same thing can be said of President Truman. What he tried to do here in the Fair Deal was reflected in the Marshall plan, point 4, technical assistance, and the others. If we are moving ahead here in the United States, if we are making a better society here, then that reflects itself around the world and those who stand today on the razor edge of decision desire then to be associated with a winning cause which represents the cause of freedom. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Idaho can help meet that problem this November by sending Bob McLaughlin to join Frank Church in one of the best teams any State could have in the Senate.', ""Another reason we have not been moving ahead has been the obstructionist tactics of the Republican members of the House Rules Committee - who have voted as a unit to block action on housing bills essential to Idaho's timber, education bills essential to Idaho's schools, and other matters essential to Idaho's progress. And this State can help take care of that problem, too, by electing Ralph Harding to the Congress."", 'But if we are to really move ahead in this country - if the mineral and resource potential of this State and region is to be fully realized - then a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate are necessary but not enough. The Congress can urge administrative action, the Congress can appropriate money, the Congress can pass legislation, but without Presidential leadership, Presidential initiative, and Presidential cooperation instead of vetoes, the Congress cannot do the job alone.', 'Last week in Washington we had a striking example of what I mean. Both Houses of the Congress were determined to do something to help our distressed lead and zinc industry. In the last 7 1/2 years our domestic production of lead and zinc has declined by more than one-third. Our output of zinc has never been this low since the depression. Our output of lead has never been this low in the 20th century.', 'Almost all of the small mines have been abandoned - and most of the middle-sized mines have either closed or are on the brink of closing. In Idaho alone, lead and zinc production since 1952 has been cut almost in half.', 'There was disagreement as to the solution. Many proposals were controversial. But on one bill the Congress was in agreement - the Small Mines Stabilization Act. This was a bill authorizing assistance to small lead and zinc mines to enable them to hold their heads above water at a time when imports were driving market prices down. This bill was not a final solution, but it would have helped several hundred smaller mines in Idaho and throughout the West. And it would have helped several thousand miners who have lost the only job they knew how to perform - the only means they had of supporting their families.', 'The House passed the Small Mines Stabilization Act. The Senate passed it. But last week we were told that it would be vetoed - that it would never become law - that nothing would be done to help our distressed mines and miners, their families and their communities. I was shocked - I know the people of Idaho were shocked, and we can agree on one further fact: that bill would never have been vetoed by Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, or any Democratic President.', 'Unfortunately what has happened in lead and zinc has happened in other mineral and resource areas vital to the economy of this State - in tungsten, aluminum, cobalt, lumber, uranium, and all the rest. Perhaps the most striking example was the decision to shut down the largest cobalt mine in the country, located in Lemhi County, with its $2 million payroll on which Idaho depended. The Government said this mine was no longer needed. They admitted that cobalt was essential - they admitted we needed a safe supply - but they said we would be able to get all the cobalt we needed from such friendly countries as Cuba and the Congo. They were wrong about Cuba - they were wrong about the Congo. They were wrong about cobalt - and the American people will prove them wrong next November.', 'But I do not want to dwell on the past. I want to stress the future. For the election is to decide for the future, not the past. And not far from where I speak is a place which may hold the future in its hands - the National Reactor Testing Station at Arco. Here is the key to the future of our military mobility - but here also is the key to the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This station is an important outpost for the new frontier of energy and resource development.', 'The Nation can be proud of what is going on at Arco. But the Nation should also be concerned about what is not going on at Arco. That station is doing an excellent job in testing atomic powerplants and reactors. But if we were moving ahead with more vigor and vision in this field, Arco today would be testing on an extensive scale, advanced reactor concepts for rocket propulsion, space vehicles, and civilian atomic power.', ""If this Nation were moving ahead with more aggressive research and development in this field, the benefits would be felt throughout the West. For in this region alone are three- fourths of the free world's known uranium reserves. Uranium mines which are now plagued with cutbacks and stretchouts could be tapped to their full potential."", 'But even more importantly, that kind of aggressive atomic research and development is needed if this country is to win the race for competitive atomic power - a victory which can have a more profound effect throughout the world than the Soviet sputnik or missile to the moon.', 'The hard facts of the matter are that today we do not have that kind of research and development program in atomic energy - and neither do we have them in mineral resources. The National Science Advisory Committee on Mineral Research has recommended intensive studies into new techniques of mineral discovery - to find new ways of locating and reaching the immense wealth which lies beneath a covering of sediments throughout our Western States. Our methods of exploring mineral deposits on the surface, or near the surface, are no longer sufficient - particularly if we are to compete with foreign producers working in richer deposits of high grade ore.', 'Similarly, our research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy has fallen far short of expectations. There has been too much bureaucratic redtape and too little budget - too much time between the drawing board and the production line and too little time spent on looking ahead with vision.', 'It is time for this country to move ahead in the resource and energy field - and to undertake the research necessary to move ahead - and to stay ahead.', 'We have not hesitated in the last few years to spend more than $1 million for mineral resource development in Afghanistan. I do not see how we can continue to hold back on our development here at home.', 'These are not small problems - and they will not be solved by small men with small plans. Neither will they be solved with big words. We need men who can look ahead, men who believe in the future, men who are willing to try something new, and the Democratic Party has those men. This is what this campaign is all about. That is the kind of leadership this country needs on the new frontier. I cannot promise that the future will be easy. But those who crossed the mountains to Idaho 100 years ago seeking land and gold and a new way of life - did not expect that life would be easy. Lewis and Clark did not travel this area on a mission they thought would be easy.', 'Today the frontier they explored bas been pushed aside. We stand on the edge of a new frontier - and we need more men to cross the mountains. I am here to ask for your help. I am here to ask for new pioneers. With your help, with many hands, we can make for all the Nation a living reality of this States inspiring motto: Esto Perpetua - may this State endure forever!']"
48,John F. Kennedy ,"September 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Brown Representative Whelan, Gordon Mrs. Neuberger, Mrs. Price, Mr. Sweetland, ""Scoop"" Jackson, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to George Brown and to the members of this organization for your kindness in having this dinner tonight. I think this is an important election, and I think the State of Oregon is heavily involved. You have a chance which is not given, I think, to many States, to continue in office a distinguished name, borne by two distinguished people. I refer, of course, to your next U.S. Senator, Senator Neuberger. [Applause.] And I am confident that the people of this congressional district will send back to the House of Representatives with an overwhelming majority Mrs. Green, whose perhaps least distinction has been that she has been the chairman of my campaign, but whose greatest distinction has been won in the Halls of Congress on behalf of the interests of this country. [Applause.]', 'I am delighted that we have here tonight our friends from Brazil. They inhabit a beautiful country which I visited, and I am delighted that they are coming here tonight, and traveling through the United States to see the American labor movement at work. I have served on the Labor Committees of the Congress now for 14 years, and I serve now as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate. During that time, I think it can be said that the labor movement has concerned itself not only with the interest of its members, but also with the general public interest. Labor has identified itself with the fight for aid for education, with the fight for medical care for the aged under social security, with the fight for housing, the fight for a better system of social justice in this country, and for a stronger foreign policy abroad. They have been concerned with what concerns our country. Therefore I am delighted that I have received the endorsement of the AFL-CIO in this election. [Applause.]', 'This is an important election because it comes at a most important time in the life of our country. I think the August session of the Congress offered in my opinion a very clear example of how unfortunate it would be to have 4 more years of a divided government with neither party bearing responsibility and both parties sharing power. After passing in the U.S. Senate a bill providing for $l.25 minimum wage, we failed in the conference to secure the passage of that bill. After passing in the Senate of the United States a bill for aid for education, and a bill for aid for housing, we failed to get both of those bills to the floor of the House of Representatives for a vote, and every Republican member of the Rules Committee of the House voted against them going to the floor of the House of Representatives. We failed to secure passage of a bill connected with the Forand bill, tying medical care for the aged to social security. Instead of the bill that was finally passed we received the support of one Republican Senator, Senator Case of New Jersey, and we were threatened by a Presidential veto.', 'There is not any doubt in my mind that our system of checks and balances, which I strongly support, cannot work effectively unless the House, the Senate, and the Presidency are working together for the general interest. I think that we can elect a Democratic President, a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, and I think when that is done this country can begin to move again, and we will serve not only the interest of your members, but also the interest of the public at large.', ""I came here tonight because I want your support in this campaign. I want the support of the American labor movement and the members of their families, and I want to make it very clear that I want the support of all of organized labor. I have had my disagreements with Mr. Hoffa and they continue, and I have had my disagreements with Mr. Bridges and they continue. But I want the support, if I can get it, of the members of the Teamsters Union and the Longshoremen's Union, because I believe that the things we can work for in the Congress are in the interest of the members of those unions, even though I may not agree with those that head it up. My quarrel with them may continue. But I want to make it very clear that I welcome the support of the members of those two unions."", ""Now let me say in conclusion that this is going to be a very difficult and intense election. I think there are real issues at stake here which affect the welfare of the people of this State as well as the welfare of the people of this country. You who work in organized labor are basically concerned with one great question, and that is the maintenance of full employment in the United States. If your people can find work at decent wages, then your interests are protected, and that, in my opinion, must be a basic policy for the Government and for the free enterprise system here in this country, to make sure that everyone who wants to find a job can find one. Whether they work in organized labor or whether they are teachers or doctors or nurses, whatever they may be, the chance to work at decent wages must be a basic, fundamental premise upon which our society must be based. I think this country is going to have to move ahead. Last year we had the lowest rates of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. One million five hundred thousand people will come into the labor movement every year in the 1960's and are going to have to find a job, and they come into the labor market at the very same time when automation is revolutionizing employment. You have seen it in your own city of Portland here. Therefore to find work for these people, to make sure that machines make life easier, instead of displacing men and women, I think it is going to be a basic domestic problem for the next administration, regardless of whether it is Republican or Democrat. This is a serious problem that faces us all. It affects you directly. You live with it. But only by developing economic policies which encourage the growth of the United States can we hope to maintain full employment in the United States. We had a recession in 1954, we had a recession in 1948, we have a plateau today, which may lead to some difficulties in 1961, unless we can get the economy of the United States moving at the kind of growth which we see not just in the Soviet Union, but which we see in Germany and France and England. All of those countries pretty nearly doubled the economic growth of the United States last year. So these are all matters which I think are extremely complicated."", 'In many ways they move beyond the problems which the New Deal and the Fair Deal faced in their days. They are new problems that require new solutions, and I think that the labor movement has a great role to play. So I come here tonight and ask your help. I am most grateful to Senator Morse for his wire. He and I worked closely together in the Congress in this last session to secure the passage of a bill providing $1.25 minimum wage. We failed, but I think that we have a chance in this campaign to discuss these issues, to discuss our failures and the reasons for them, and go to the people and ask them to make a decision, ask them to give us a mandate to move this country ahead on all of the great fronts which are traditional, I think, in the Democratic Party.', ""I run for office with the recognition that in this century the great Presidents in many cases have been Democratic Presidents, Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman, and I think they have demonstrated what can be done, and I think we can do it in the 1960's. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
49,John F. Kennedy ,"September 07, 1960","['(The following is a transcript of questions presented to Senator John F. Kennedy, from the floor after the dinner at the Multnomah Hotel, Portland, Oreg.)', 'FROM THE FLOOR. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the Senator, due to labor unions and labor officials being nailed to the cross and crucified over the last couple of years, I would like to get an expression from you as to your feeling toward management and what should be done there, and, more specifically, if I could get an expression from you on the Nate Shefferman deal?', ""Senator KENNEDY. On the case, as you remember, Mr. Shefferman's activities were investigated by the Rackets Committee in great detail. Nathan Shefferman had been engaged by a good many companies in the United States, some of them extremely well known, including in my own part of Massachusetts the Sears, Roebuck Co., and other companies, of course, to prevent unionization of those companies, and to prevent unionization in order to prevent raising the wages."", 'This affected particularly the retail workers, who I think are underpaid, by and large, across the Nation based on our hearings, in the Subcommittee on Minimum Wage, but affected other unions as well. Mr. Shefferman had a very profitable business going. I think his business has been liquidated but nevertheless others carry on. It is the effort to give advice in the ways by which unionism and union organization can be avoided, by organizing so-called workers committees which are directed by management in order to work against the organization of the company - all the techniques which I think are familiar to you, and which were used by Mr. Shefferman in a way which I think was against the public interest. I think that story of Nathan Shefferman was well detailed in the book, ""The Enemy Within,"" and I believe it is against the public interest.', 'One of the fights we had on the whole labor-management bill was to attempt to include in it effective labor provisions which I think we had in the Senate bill, certainly as it came out of the committee, the so-called Kennedy-Ives bill, which would have made it mandatory for employers to report all expenditures which might have been made, for whatever purpose they might have been made, in order to affect the employee working conditions, unions, and so forth. The bill that passed the House had no conditions dealing with this and made no changes in the Taft-Hartley law of 1947 in this regard. The final language was not as good as we hoped, but it still has some language in it which makes it easier to detect expenditures for the purposes of blocking unionization.', 'It is a matter of great importance, and I think it is a matter which we should continue to watch, and which I will watch wherever I may be placed next January. [Applause.]', 'FROM THE FLOOR. Senator Kennedy, I have only one question, which is a little bit loaded. We know the present administration leaves much to be desired. Rather than to criticize, what is our solution?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would say in dealing with some of the domestic matters for solution, I would think the passage of the legislation which I discussed in this session of the Congress would have been most helpful. The passage of the housing bill would have stimulated the housing industry, which I think would have benefited the people of this State as well as the people of the country. The passage of a Federal aid to education bill, I think, would have made sure that every child would have secured a better education under more favorable conditions, with teachers paid more adequate salaries, and I think aid to education and the concern over education is a basic responsibility of our society. The passage of a bill to provide $1.25 minimum wage would have affected the wages of 4 million people directly and indirectly several million more, which would have helped those at the bottom of the economic ladder which do not participate.', 'The passage of the Forand bill, or a similar bill in the Senate, would have provided security for those who are retired and would have permitted them to pay for that security during their working years.', 'I named four bills, which are very familiar, which would have measurably improved the standard of living for a good many millions of Americans.', 'QUESTION. True, you have a very fine point. Now, you were speaking of production. If I am not wrong, I think approximately 38 percent of all production in the country is exported. Now, that 38 percent just about covers what the rest of the world produces. Why are we not competitive in the world market today?', ""Senator KENNEDY. The fact of the matter is that by and large while we are not competitive in some industries we are competitive in others. The balance of payments between what the United States exports and what it imports is still, I think, this year, certainly last year, slightly in our favor. What has caused us the greatest difficulty from the point of view of our balance of payments or the gold flowing out has been our other programs, maintenance of bases overseas, payments of our troops overseas, and assistance to foreign countries and the Development Loan Fund, and all the rest. That is what has caused the balance of payments to be against us. But on the sheer export-import balance which is what we are now talking about, we sell abroad as much as we consume, and, in fact, in the last 10 years over all have sold more abroad than we have consumed. But I do think it is going to be a problem in the 1960's, particularly if the Soviet Union uses Government purchases to dump to break our price. It is a matter that the Government will have to concern itself with."", 'QUESTION. One more question. Our foreign aid - are we dumping or are we selling?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't think in our foreign aid - I hope we are not doing either. In the case of some agricultural commodities, we do distribute them. We try to avoid dumping. We try to avoid disturbing normal trade. I think the emphasis in our foreign aid should be placed in the Development Loan Fund which provides loans at low rates of interest for long periods of time to assist these countries which are underdeveloped to secure the means, the basic means of production, highways, electricity, steel production, so that they can begin to build their economies. Otherwise they see no hope for themselves and they turn in another direction. But in answer to your question, I don't think we are dumping."", 'QUESTION. In order to show a fair standard of living for everyone concerned, and increase the basic hourly wage - everybody wants to live good; is that not so?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes; it is.', 'QUESTION. In order to do so, must we not have a stabilized export and import to balance the budget? There are certain things we have to import. We lend them money. We have to buy a certain amount back so we can sell it back to them. It is a matter of exchanging the money. But how much are we giving and how much are we selling? Is that stabilizing or are we just fooling ourselves?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think what we are trying to do we are doing under great difficulties. We are selling, and we are buying. In addition, we are carrying our programs of foreign aid which are burdensome for us, but which nevertheless I think are in the long-range interests of the United States.', 'QUESTION. Thank you very much.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.', 'QUESTION. Mr. Chairman', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Ambassador. [Laughter.]', 'QUESTION. Would you support an investigation of the practice of importation of strikebreakers across State lines with a view toward legislation to abolish such practice?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Senator Morse proposed an investigation, but it was in the last days of the session. I do think it would be useful to look at the organization of the so-called importation of strikebreakers. You cannot prevent people, however, providing the passage is peaceful, from crossing one state line to another State to seek employment. What I think is a matter of concern to us however, is tied in with the first question which dealt with Mr. Shefferman, to at least explore and examine with the light of day on what the techniques are what the organizational structure is, the manner by which strikebreakers are secured and moved from one State to another. I think it would be useful to have that information made public, and I do think that would be valuable. Then when we make it public, we can make a judgment as to whether it needed legislation or not.', 'QUESTION. My question specifically concerned those activities which are engaged in a professional manner, not the passage of people seeking normal employment, but those who are recruited by professional agencies for the purpose of strikebreaking.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think it would be extremely useful to have a good deal more information on that activity. Most of it now is not known, and I think if it became known it might then be possible to make a judgment as to what would be the remedy. In fact, having it become known would perhaps be a remedy. So I quite agree with you that it would be desirable to secure information by the labor committees of the Congress on the organization of that system.', 'QUESTION. Then you would support an investigation of those practices?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would support an attempt to secure information by congressional committees on what the techniques of organization may be in this particular field. I do think you cannot pass a law to prevent people moving freely from one State to another to secure employment. What I do think would be useful to find out is, is it being organized? If so, by whom? Under what conditions and what method of payment is used and all the rest. And make sure we don't have a Shefferman case in this particular field. In order to find that out, I would support any effort which is made to gain information on it. [Applause.]"", ""QUESTION. I would like to ask a question of what the Senator's opinion was on the Monroe Doctrine, what the status of that is. Do you feel it is still alive?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the part of Monroe Doctrine which is alive and which is joined in by the association, the Organization of American States, which is that we will oppose any effort to establish a colonial rule by any Western European country or any country today over any part of Latin America. What we are concerned about now is the present Communist infiltration of Cuba. That matter is, of course, going to have to be under continual surveillance. The Monroe Doctrine in a paternalistic sense, where the United States is the policeman of the hemisphere has now become less important, perhaps, but what is of now more concern is the association of American states where they are associated in a common effort, not we becoming the policemen of the hemisphere, but we joining with them in a common front against any attempt to take over any country of Latin America. That goes particularly today against the Soviet Union and the Chinese. We are going to have to wait and see what happens in Cuba. But any action that we do take, in my opinion, should be taken in concert with the Organization of American States.', 'QUESTION. A lot of my friends are Republicans and they wanted me to ask why with a Democratic majority in both the House and Senate, with rather large ones, this last session of Congress was unable to pass this legislation which you are talking about tonight?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is why the Democrats, in large majorities, are unable to pass the legislation which we discussed tonight. I think it is a good question because it goes to the heart of the matter which I was trying to point to before. In the case of the minimum wage, we passed out of the Senate by a vote of nearly 2 to 1. That was the $1.25 minimum wage. Earlier, the House of Representatives passed a bill by, I think, nine votes against the $1.25 minimum wage, in favor of a wholly inadequate coverage under minimum wage which affected only about 1 million people. Nine more votes or a shift of five votes would have given us $1.25 in the House, and we would have then passed a bill for $1.25 and the President would have vetoed it, and we would not have been able to secure sufficient votes to override his veto. As it was, however, we did not pass it in the House. Conservative Democrats joined with Republicans and beat us by nine votes.', ""There is not any doubt, and this has been true since the earliest days of the 1930's, that there are at least some Democrats who do not support these programs. But my point is that two-thirds of the Democrats at least support them and two-thirds of the Republicans oppose them. We secured the support of seven or eight or nine Republicans on these bills. Senator Javits and others voted with us on minimum wage, housing, and aid to education. But they are only about an eighth or a seventh of the total Republican membership of the Senate. We need those votes in order to pass a bill."", 'In the case of the Forand bill, we failed by five votes in the Senate. We received the support of only one Republican. If we had gotten six Republicans, which we frequently get, we would have passed that bill. Some of the Democrats voted against us, nearly a third. But when you have two parties, especially a national party like the Democratic Party, it includes farmers, small businessmen, labor unions, northerners, southerners, easterners, and westerners, and it is extremely hard to break new ground. But we each carry two-thirds with us. The Republicans, however, oppose us with at least three-fourths of their members.', 'The second point is that in all of these bills we are threatened by a veto. In the case of the Forand bill, which I supported in the Senate when we brought it up for a vote, Senator Dirksen, the minority leader, said if this bill passes it is going to be vetoed by the President. Therefore, any Democrat who wants to make some progress would say, ""Why should I vote for a bill which is going to fail when I could vote for a bill which at least is a quarter of the job, and then perhaps come back next January with a Democratic President and get support for the bill?"" So in answer to your question, I would say that in a short session, a determined minority joined by a President who threatens a veto, joined by some of the members of our party, can block new legislation. If they can\'t block it in the Senate, they block it in the House; if they can\'t block it in the House they block it in the conference; if they can\'t block it in the House or Senate they block it in the Rules Committee.', ""Every Republican member of the Rules Committee voted against aid to education and voted against the housing bill coming to the floor of the House and they were joined by two Democrats. A majority of the Democrats in the Rules Committee voted to send those bills to the floor, but the combination was too great. So I think that the argument, really, is on our side, and that is that unless you have a Democratic President working with the Congress, you won't get anything. You won't get any action. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. BROWN. Let us let one of the Brazilian delegates ask a question. I am sorry, the Brazilian delegation is sending up a presentation.', 'FROM THE FLOOR. It is with great satisfaction to know such a great man, which is Senator Kennedy, and this satisfaction comes before he has the very same ideas that the workers from Brazil do have, and with this opportunity, in the name of all the workers from Brazil, I would like to present him with this banner which is a symbol of our friendship for him. [Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. I am very grateful to our friends from Brazil, and I think it indicates that the good neighbor policy - at least the atmosphere for recapturing the good neighbor policy is still there. [Applause.]', ""QUESTION. Mr. Senator, I am an alien citizen of your country. I have been here some 2 1/2 years. I would like to ask you a question regarding labor legislation the way I see it in your country. It is the only thing that really baffles me and confuses me. I wonder very much if you can see our point of view. I have been here in Portland for 2 years, and I have been a member of a craft union. Under the current legislation, this craft union system does appear to become somewhat antiquated. With respect to your references to Mr. Hoffa and to the gentleman who runs the Longshoremen's Union, I wonder very much if this legislation won't guide and steer the craft unions as we know them, into a form of union which to my way of thinking is not particularly unpleasant, but guide us more into the type of union of which you appear to be somewhat apprehensive under the leadership of such people as Hoffa and Harry Bridges. Does this labor legislation help us to reach aspirations or does it actually control us and hold us to such degree that we aspire to these large uncontrollable unions which labor legislation is presumably written to control?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. I must say I hope I have a normal courage as a politician and candidate for office, but I don't have quite enough courage to try to settle the dispute as to whether we should have craft unions or industrial unions. I will let you gentlemen settle that. [Laughter.]"", ""Let me say I know excellent and outstanding leaders in both the craft and industrial unions. That is not the point in my judgment at all, if I may say so. You can get good leadership under both conditions, and you get it. I spent the day in Michigan with members of the Auto Workers Union, members of the Steelworkers Union, and other unions, and they are industrial unions and have excellent leadership. I traveled with Joe Keenan, in the Electrical Workers, and on my committee which he heads are men who have come out of the Carpenters' Union and others. Labor leaders are like others; some politicians are good and some are not, and some Republicans are not. [Laughter.] It is just that I would like to have the help of both. That is all. [Laughter and applause.]""]"
50,John F. Kennedy ,"September 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mrs. Green, Mrs. Neuberger, ladies and gentlemen: I am extremely indebted for a very generous introduction, as I was for a very generous seconding speech at the Los Angeles convention, by your distinguished Member of Congress and my faithful friend, Mrs. Green. [Applause.] I am delighted to be here tonight sharing a platform with a distinguished Oregon family - the wife of a former Senator and friend and colleague of mine - and the next Senator from the State of Oregon to the U.S. Senate, Senator Neuberger to be. [Applause.]', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is an important election as Mrs. Green has suggested. I do not run for the office of the Presidency promising that if I am elected life will be easy, and that all the problems will be solved. In many ways, I think that the years will be as difficult in the 1960's as they were after the election 100 years ago of President Lincoln. In that election, Lincoln said that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free. The question for the 1960's following this election will be whether the world can exist half slave and half free. [Applause.]"", 'We are concerned with what happens in this State, and we are concerned with what happens in this country. We are concerned that we shall have vigorous executive leadership in meeting the problems that the great Republic faces here at home. But we are also concerned that the United States shall maintain the peace and maintain our security and maintain our strength and our prestige. [Applause.]', ""I do not believe that there is any American who can he satisfied with that strength and that prestige as it is reflected in events around us in the southern half of the globe. Americans wonder why it was that Africans who some years ago quoted Thomas Jefferson and Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt now quote Karl Marx in the Congo. They wonder why the nations of South America who once were engaged in a great enterprise called the good neighbor policy should now stone the Vice President of the United States. They wonder why America, which was once regarded in the 1930's with so much friendship on the island of Cuba should now be reviled and attacked by the erratic leader of that island only 90 miles from our shore. [Applause.]"", 'It seems to me, and this is most dangerous for all of us, that we are all danger of losing the respect of the people of the world, because we are in danger of losing those very qualities which once caused them to respect us.', ""First, the people of the world respect strength. In former years they were grateful to the United States for the military protection that we guaranteed them. But now they are no longer certain that America's lead will continue in the future when they see the missile gap widen, and once our atomic monopoly begins to cease, and they are uneasy about a military strategy that relies so heavily upon massive retaliation, because they are not interested in seeing their house preserved, only to see it blown up. [Applause.]"", 'Second, the people of the world respect achievement. For most of the 20th century they admired American science and American education, which was second to none. But now they are not at all certain about which way the future lies. The first vehicle in outer space was called sputnik, not Vanguard. The first country to place its national emblem on the moon was the Soviet Union, not the United States. The first canine passengers to outer space who safely returned were named Strelka and Belka, not Rover or Fido, or even Checkers. [Laughter and applause.]', 'They wonder why the Soviet Union has an economic growth of two or three times as much as the great productive country of the United States, and they wonder why it was last year that the United States had the lowest percentage of economic growth increase of any major industrial society in the world. They wonder why Russia is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are, and they are entitled to an answer.', ""Third, the peoples of the world respect sincerity. The reason the good neighbor policy was so successful was because the people of Latin America knew that here in the United States the policy of Franklin Roosevelt was marked by compassion and interest. The colored people of Africa and Asia believed in Harry Truman's point 4 because they knew that he practiced in his administration those policies without regard to race or creed for all Americans. But now they are doubtful about a party which has shown no real concern in the executive branch for civil rights, no real compassion for the underprivileged, and they do not feel that any country and any administration which does not concern itself about the problems at home will be concerned about the problems of Africa and Asia. [Applause.]"", ""Fourth, the people of the world want peace, and they sincerely wonder how much the United States wants peace. They are afraid of diplomatic policies that teeter on the brink. They are dismayed that there are only 100 Americans working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament. And they are discouraged by a philosophy that puts its faith in swapping insults with the Soviet Union, for they know it can lead in only one direction, and that would be toward mankind's final war."", 'Fifth, and finally, the people of the world respect a nation which can see beyond its own image. To us, the major issue is the fight against communism, but to them, those who live to the south of us, the fighting is against poverty and disease and illiteracy and ignorance. [Applause.]', 'Each time they feel that we seek to gain their friendship in order to secure a new recruit in a battle against the communism, and each time we dismiss anti-American agitators as tools of the Communists, or condemn neutrals out of hand, our prestige will suffer and our relations with those with whom we wish to be friends will worsen. To rebuild American prestige will not be easy. It cannot be done overnight by a new administration. But I can assure you that a new administration will make the effort. [Applause.]', 'I believe that the people of the world desire to be free, and they desire to follow the leadership of a strong and free United States. I think that we should move ahead on five fronts. We must have an administration that will rebuild our military strength until America is once again first across the board. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, we must have an administration that will revamp its goals in science and education until American science and American education are once again preeminent.', 'Third, we must have an administration that moves rapidly to shape our image here at home until it is clear to all the world that the revolution for equal rights is still an American revolution. [Applause.]', 'Fourth, we must have an administration that moves forward on the road to peace until we demonstrate to a watching world, as we sit on a most conspicuous stage, that we are willing to devote the same energies to the struggle for peace as we now do on the struggle for arms. [Applause.]', 'Fifth, and finally, we must have an administration that holds out a helping hand to all those who desire to be independent, that assists them in meeting their own problems, assists them on the road to freedom as a friend, not as a paternalistic country that desires to use them in a world war struggle. [Applause.]', 'Once we move again on these new frontiers, in foreign and domestic affairs, we can regain the trust and confidence of men and women of good will around the world. We can more comfortably wear the leadership of the free world, and we can win the fight for peace, and this country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]', ""(The following is the question and answer period following Senator Kennedy's remarks:)"", 'Senator JACKSON. Thank you, Mrs. Green.', 'Maureen Neuberger, my colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator Lusk, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen: My good neighbors and friends across the river in Oregon. Senator Kennedy is desirous of making it possible for the audience to participate in these political undertakings during the course of the campaign. He is anxious to know what is on your minds. So we have worked out for these brief remaining few minutes to let you have a chance to ask questions of him. Obviously, all of the questions that have been previously submitted prior to going on television cannot be answered in the few remaining minutes. Those questions, however, will be answered by letter from Senator Kennedy. We will start out with the first question sent up to me, Senator Kennedy.', 'Are you for the Forand bill?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was, Am I for the Forand bill? I introduced a companion bill to the Forand bill in the U.S. Senate. The Forand bill, of course, puts medical care for the aged under the social security system. We tried to pass a bill comparable to that during the last session of the Congress. We failed by five votes in the U.S. Senate.', 'I think it ought to be pointed out that we received the support of only one member of the opposition party in that effort, and I think that it is something that we should try to do again next January, and wherever I am I am going to support it. [Applause.]', 'Senator JACKSON. The next question is, What is your stand on the minimum wage problem?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, we tried to put a bill through and passed it in the Senate 2 to 1, to provide a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour and expand the coverage to over 4 million Americans who today are not covered. A good many of these Americans receive wages of 75 to 80 cents an hour. The average wage for laundry women in five large cities in this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. No American can live on that. I think we ought to do it in the next session. We failed in the Congress. I think the next time we can do it. We passed it in the Senate. I think we only failed by seven votes in the House. With a strong leadership, I think we can get it done next time, and I think we ought to do it because no American can live under that.', 'Senator JACKSON. The next question is, What can be done to improve the social security situation?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think we touched on at least one phase, which is the care for the aged. I do think we should concern ourselves with particularly the retirement age for women, and secondly, the present limitations on social security provide that those who are receiving social security may earn only $1,200 a year. As the average social security check is only about $78 a month, it means that a lot of people who are retired who could earn more money do get a short change. I think that the charge to $1,800 is most worthwhile, combined with their social security payment, outside earnings up to $1,800, and I think they could do much better than they do today.', 'Those are two changes which I think are essential. [Applause.]', 'Senator JACKSON. I am 11 years old; what is my future with Kennedy?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am afraid that if things work out well, by the time you are 21 I will be finished with my second term. [Applause.] Maybe then you can elect Senator Jackson. [Applause and laughter.]', 'Senator JACKSON. Will increased farm subsidies cause a greater surplus problem?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think that the most important thing to do is to try to bring a balance between supply and demand, to make a determination as to how much we can consume of a commodity here, how much we can usefully distribute around the world to those who are hungry and who look to us for help, and how much we should distribute to our own people. There are over 5 million of them who are dependent upon surplus food distribution. I saw over 100,000 of them in West Virginia alone, and the food distributions, I think are shocking. They are so inadequate. But those three categories need to be filled, and then we should try to place a limitation on production so we don't have these surpluses hanging over the market which break the price. In other words, there should be sufficient acreage and unit control so that we don't have a surplus, but instead have a balance between supply and demand, and a fair price at the marketplace."", 'Senator JACKSON. Do we have any questions from the audience that have not been sent up?', 'FROM THE FLOOR. Do you know how many people are not under social security?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was, Do I know how many people are not under social security? There are a good many millions of people', ""FROM THE FLOOR. I am 72, and I don't get any social security."", 'Senator KENNEDY. I understand that. In the provision of the Senate bill that was passed, and it was not as good a bill as I hoped it would be, there were funds provided for those who are already retired but who are not under social security. What we sought to do was to provide an amendment on that bill which would add protection for those covered by social security. I agree there are two problems, one which goes to those which are on social security, and entitled to social security benefits. The second problem goes to those who have no social security and therefore no income. The bill that passed the Senate met that problem to some degree; the final version is not as satisfactory, and I agree with you, does represent unfinished business for the country.', 'Senator JACKSON. We have time for about one last question on television: Can a Catholic be elected President? [Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. I must say that with all due respect, it seems to me that that question is worded wrongly. Can an American who happens to be a Catholic be elected President? [Applause.]', 'I must say that really it seems to me as one - well; there are two basic provisions in the U.S. Constitution. One is the first amendment providing separation of church and state, and the second is article 6, which provides there shall be no religious test for office. As the great struggle today is between those who believe in God and those who do not believe in God, it seems to me we should not divide ourselves in this crucial stage, but instead treat every American according to his desserts and that is make an individual judgment as to his competence to hold any office from serving in the service to President. [Applause.]', 'The standard which has just been shown is the standard which was carried by the Oregon delegation to the convention, so I am signing it. I am very pleased to see it.', 'May I thank you for coming tonight? In fact, Oregon supporting me in the convention helped nominate me. So now that you have taken me this far, I would appreciate your taking me the rest of the way. [Applause.]']"
51,John F. Kennedy ,"September 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Attorney Frye, Mr. Green, my sister Pat, Monroe Sweetland, Jebby Davidson, Democratic candidates, ladies and gentlemen, the sun shines bright today but I have been here enough times to know that the sun does not always shine in the city of Eugene. [Laughter.] But that is what makes the woods grow and that is what makes this State a rich State. I am delighted to be here in this campaign. I spent a good many days of my life in the primaries, traveling around the State of Oregon, and I am delighted as a candidate to come back to this State, which played a major role in hoping me get nominated at Los Angeles. [Applause.]', 'You may recall the writing of Henry Thoreau in Massachusetts about 100 years ago, when he said, ""Eastward I go only by force. Westward I go free. I must walk toward Oregon and not toward Europe.""', 'I have followed that advice again on this occasion.', 'Mr. Cook mentioned the participation of the university at least in Rome yesterday. They are engaged in a direct competition, representing themselves, sports, and also the United States. We are engaged in our own kind of competition. We compete not merely with the Soviet Union, but we compete with ourselves, to make this a better country, to make this a stronger country, to make sure that those who come after us enjoy the same benefits that we enjoy.', 'This is a great country, but I believe it can be a greater country, and I think it is our responsibility to join in that great effort. [Applause.] There are many areas of our national life where I think we could do better, but I am concerned today in this State, in this town, with one area which I believe to be almost the most important, and that is how can we improve our educational system so that we can train our people in those qualities of self-discipline and self-restraint and personal character which makes it possible for us to maintain a free society. A free society is the most difficult of all kinds of government to maintain, and it can only be done if we have the best educated and the best trained citizens.', 'I am proud of the fact that my own State of Massachusetts, away back in the early days of the 17th century, was the first State in the Union to establish the American public schools system, and it is a fact that settlers from New England came to this valley and participated in the establishment; of the educational system in the State of Oregon, which I think is so impressive.', ""Now the job is for us, in our own generation, to meet our own responsibilities, and you in the State have heavy responsibilities to meet. I want to make it clear that unfortunately or fortunately, we are going to have heavy responsibilities to meet in the future. For example, here in your State it will be necessary for you to build two classrooms every day if you are going to make up in the next year for the present classroom shortage. And yet you are making a greater effort nearly than any State in the Union. Compared to many States, this State pays its teachers almost better than any, but the top three or four States in the Union, and yet it is a fact that this country pays a majority of its teachers less than $4,500 a year. Many of our teachers must take two jobs in order to maintain themselves. It is also a regrettable fact that here in the richest country on earth 150,000 of our brightest students are unable to go to college every year because they cannot afford it. It is an unfortunate fact, and I don't like to keep bringing home these unpleasant facts, but that is the only way we improve ourselves, that one out of every five men failed the Selective Service mental test."", 'I think we can do a better job than that. Only one out of three of our high school and college students could identify and write theses on the American Bill of Rights. I think we are going to have to do better in this country. I think we are going to have to maintain, in a country which is going to double its population, we are going to have to maintain the best school System in the United States.', ""It was a source of regret to me that this last session of the Congress failed to pass a Federal aid to education bill; that we failed by a single vote to pass in the Senate of the United States a bill which would have provided aid for teachers' salaries; and that we failed, after passing a school construction bill in the Senate, to pass out of the House Rules Committee, and every Republican on the house Rules Committee voted against it, to send a Federal aid for school construction to the floor of the House of Representatives. This is the most important subject that we have. Unless we have a good and increasing educational system, we are not going to have a strong democratic society. I therefore suggest four proposals:"", ""First, that we launch a program of Federal aid to education for school construction and for teachers' salaries, to help the United States make up for the present classroom shortage."", ""Second, we must recognize that in our colleges and universities in this State and country in the next 10 years, to make and take care of our college population, we are going to have to build in 10 years as many dormitories and classrooms as have been built in this country since 1775. We are going to have to do that in one decade. I think that one of the most effective means are loans for college dormitories at a low rate of interest. It is an unfortunate fact that that bill which was passed last year was vetoed by the President of the United States. I think we can do this job. I think we can move ahead. This is only one of the great areas which I think disturbs the American life. I run for the office of the Presidency realizing that in the next 4 years it is going to be the most difficult years that we have ever had. In many ways, the most difficult years since the election of 1860 of Abraham Lincoln. In that election, what was at stake was the issue which he put before us, that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free. I don't think in this election we must face - I don't think the world can exist in the long run half slave and half free. The real issue before us is how we can prevent the balance of power from turning against us, how we can begin to move it in our direction, in Latin America and Africa and Asia, to impress people all over the world that we are a young and strong and vital country."", ""Mr. Khrushchev has said that while we are Democrats and believe in freedom, that our children are going to be Communists. I don't believe this. I think we represent the best system, but I think it is up to us to do the best for our system and for our country. I don't hold the view that our best day is somewhere in the past and that the future belongs to the Communists. I think the future belongs to us. But if we are going to realize that future, if we are going to cross into the new frontiers of the 1960's, then we have to recognize that things in this country now are not as good as they can be, that we can do a better job on education, on economic growth, in developing our economy, that we can strengthen our defenses, that we can present a better image to the world of vitality and strength."", ""That is the issue of this campaign. I think anyone who is satisfied with things as they are should continue the present Republican leadership. But those who share a feeling that we can do better, that we must do better, that we must move ahead, that things are not perfect the way they are, I want them to joint with us in this crusade to make this country move again. [Applause.] I don't run for the office of the Presidency promising that life is going to be easier. I think in many ways the 1960's are going to be the most difficult years of our lives. But I can promise you that if I am elected we shall proceed ahead, and I think we shall not only endure, but prevail. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

The East Indies are linked with Salem, Mass., because the people of Salem sailed out to those islands in order to bring the wealth home to Massachusetts. Just as the people of Massachusetts, just as the people of New England came west, and, therefore, Salem, Oreg., and Salem, Mass., and the Indies are all linked together by people of courage, who were not satisfied with things as they were, but thought they could do better and came to this State of the Northwest.', 'I come here today from the oldest section of the United States, and in the last 5 days I have traveled from the fairground in Maine to a fairground in Palmer, Alaska, to a fairground in Michigan, to a fairground here in this State, and in every one of those States I have seen the vitality of the American system.', ""I run for the office of the Presidency saying that this is a great State and a great country, but I also say that it can be a greater country.

I think it should move with us. I think ours is the best system. I do not agree with Mr. Khrushchev when he says he is going to bury us. I think we can demonstrate in the next 10 years, in the next 40 years, that our high noon is in the future, that our best days are ahead that our system is in keeping with the basic aspirations of the human people, all over the globe, and the Communist system is doomed to fail.

They say there are no longer any major issues between the two political parties. But I know that no one in this State would agree with that statement. For there are many major differences - many major issues - many problems of importance to this State on which the Democratic Party is willing to act more vigorously than the Republican Party - and one of those issues is education.', 'I am proud of the fact that the public school system originated in my State of Massachusetts. I am proud that it was early settlers from New England who came up the Willamette Valley and established free public schools here in Oregon. I am proud of our schools and our teachers today, and what they have done for this country. But I am also disturbed by our failure to make sure that our educational system continues to be the greatest in the world.', 'Here in Oregon, for example, it has been estimated that two new classrooms would have to be built every single day for the next year to take care of the present shortage. And yet the people of this State right fully feel that they have taxed their property and themselves to the limit to provide a good education for their children.', 'The people of Oregon have never shirked from their duty to build a good school system. They have gone all out to maintain one of the best school systems in the country. But as their population increases - as the number of children crowding into the schools increases - they cannot do the job all by themselves.', 'Compared to many States, Oregon public school teachers are well paid. But Oregon needs more teachers. The parents of Oregon school children want to attract the best teachers - and it was a serious blow to this State when the casting vote in the U.S. Senate last spring defeated that version of the school bill which would have brought this State $11,600,000.', 'What is true in Oregon is true the country over - except other States have not done as well by their children as Oregon. In a time when education is the key to our future - in a time when science, languages, and a whole host of other studies are essential to our prestige and our security - this Nation is short 50,000 teachers. This Nation is short 132,000 classrooms. This Nation requires hundreds of thousands of students to go to school on a part-time, swing-shift basis. And this Nation has found no way to enable more than 150,000 of our brightest students to go on to college when their families are not able to afford it.', 'When we neglect education, we neglect the Nation. It is difficult to realize that roughly one out of every five young men fails to pass the Selective Service mental test. It is difficult to realize that some 50 percent of our high school and college graduates, in a recent survey, could not identify the Bill of Rights - and only one out of three could list one advantage of our economic system over that of the Soviet Union.', ""It is time to realize that we are faced with New Frontiers in education. The old system of financing schools primarily from property taxes is no longer sufficient. The old attitudes toward teachers and teachers' colleges, diminishing the quality of that honored profession, can no longer prevail. The old philosophy of leaving the financing of public school education to State and local taxpayers, and the financing of college education principally to parents, is no longer sufficient."", 'It is time for action in public education - not for Federal control - not for Federal replacement of local effort - but for emergency Federal action to help halt the decline in American education.', 'First. We must launch a massive construction program for both our public schools and our colleges - to make up our present shortage, and to prepare for the coming wave of new students.', 'A recent Government survey found that one school building in five was a potential firetrap. Another one in five was a borderline case. We urgently need Federal grants to aid State construction programs.', 'On the college level, our need for new buildings in the next 10 years will equal all the structures built on all U.S. campuses since the American Revolution. By a system of loans and matching grants, not only dormitory facilities, but also classrooms, libraries, and laboratories must be provided.', ""Second. Federal aid to education should include funds for teacher's salaries."", ""Unlike those in Oregon, most of the Nation's teachers receive outrageously low pay. Nearly one-half of our teachers earn less than $4,500 a year. Beginning salaries for all teachers average $10 a day. Many are forced to take a second job even during the school year to give their families bare security."", ""The bill to which I earlier referred - which was killed after a tie vote - was the Democratic Party's answer to a substitute Republican measure which provided grants for construction but not for teachers' salaries. Their bill was like telling a man in need of a house that he could have only the second story."", ""Last month, a unanimous Republican vote in the House Rules Committee blocked the bill again. But I predict that next year, under a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, a real school bill, covering both classrooms and teachers' salaries will be enacted."", 'Third, we must create a sizable and effective scholarship program. And the place to begin is to restore the Federal-State college scholarship program that was dropped from the National Defense Education Act. That would assist at least 20,000 of our best high school students to go on to a college education they could not otherwise afford - and we as a Nation cannot afford any other policy.', 'Fourth, we must expand our support of basic research - in the Government - in the universities - in private laboratories. For only in this way can we push back the New Frontier of knowledge. We have enough gimmicks and gadgets for the present - now we need new concepts of man and matter for the future.']"
55,John F. Kennedy ,"September 07, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express regrets at being a little late. The breakfast took a little longer than I thought it would. I don't have any prepared statement but I thought there might be some questions. If any member of the local press wants to ask me any question, I will be glad to respond."", 'QUESTION. Senator, in your speech last night, you mentioned that any President would have to reassess the defense posture of the country and come up with new goals. Could you delineate a little bit more what you mean by that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I was talking in part about the question of making an analysis of the relative importance of each of our bases overseas, in view of new weapon technology and then I was talking also about - I was making a general reference, which I will detail more as the campaign goes on - about the division of weapons and the service divisions. Pretty soon, of course, there is going to be so much mixed weapons by the various services that it is going to bring into question the whole organization of the Department of Defense. General Gavin has estimated that within the next few years there will be a much greater and closer tie between the two services because of their dependence on common weapons and with a common mission. I am not sure exactly when that will take place, but that is one of the things that a new administration should consider.', 'QUESTION. Senator, our national policy, space policy, outlined by President Eisenhower, calls for exploration of space and such programs as Dynasoar and Minuteman exclusively for scientific research. If you are elected President would you shift our policy to include military programs in our space research?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would hope that it might be possible for some agreement to be entered into by the Soviet Union and the United States and other countries who are interested in space, and all countries are. It involves, in a sense, overflights of all countries, some agreement on the use of space and a control of weapons in space. Of course, we are going to go into the period of reconnaissance satellites and all the rest. I would hope that we would make a continued and determined effort to establish some agreement on regulating with United Nations inspection the use of outer space for military purposes. Quite obviously, these units have a military value as well as scientific value. If we are unable to reach that agreement with the Soviet Union, and I think that this is one area where we should continue, then, of course, all these units, particularly those that involve reconnaissance, the Dynasoar, will all have a military importance. I do think that because we are not sure of getting the agreement we should make a real national effort to maintain our position in space, because it is going to be the dominant area in the future for military strategy. But I hope before that day comes, when there is free competition in space for military superiority, that we try again, in fact try continually to get an agreement, before either side has a vested interest in it.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, you stressed defense a lot in your speeches about defense for peace. I am from a high school paper. I was wondering about stressing education for peace, which I think is just as important as defense.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I agree. It is extremely difficult in 9 minutes to try and fill in all, to discuss everything. As a matter of fact, in the next 2 or 3 days I am going to be speaking about education, and I completely agree that it involves the strength of the United States, that it affects our economic growth, it affects our ability to make the judgments which citizenship requires today. So I completely agree with you on education. But one phase of national security, of course, is strengthening our national defenses and I addressed myself to that last night. But that does not mean that these other matters are not important.', 'QUESTION. The Democratic Party platform calls for greater expenditure on defense. Do you personally believe that this is solely a question of money or is it also a question of drive, organization, and some kind of leadership in the executive branch?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Yes. I suggested, and I think earlier Mr. Morgan's question was to that point, that it really is not a question solely of additional appropriations, though I do think additional appropriations will be needed, particularly in the development of the Minuteman and certain other programs, and an airlift for our conventional forces. I think the Congo experience which in some ways was very impressive, also had some elements in it which should be of concern."", 'That was our reliance on traditional prop transport rather than jet. I do think there is going to be or should be an effort by the next administration on reorganization of the Pentagon and so on. That is a matter which I discussed with Senator Symington, and in which he has engaged himself, in attempting to suggest organizational changes in the Pentagon and suggesting more efficiency in the Pentagon. But I will try to go into some more detail in the next 6 weeks.', 'QUESTION. Senator, there has been considerable criticism of both parties being too aligned with Hollywood and Hollywood stars. Many voters feel that popularity as a dramatic star does not qualify them to advise voters. How do you feel about this?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, they have their rights to participate, like everybody else. I did not know there was too much alignment. This is the first I have heard of that. But if anyone in any profession wants to be active in politics, I welcome it. I am not aware that that could be fairly said of either the Republicans or Democrats, your criticism, but anybody in any position, sports, acting, teaching, housewives, whatever, if they want to participate and be active for either party, I think it is a good thing.', ""QUESTION. Senator, what is your response to the charge by Secretary Flemming that in Detroit you distorted the record of Richard Nixon and the Republican Party on teachers' salaries and medical care for the aged?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. I have not mentioned Richard Nixon since he went to the hospital. I made no reference to his vote on teachers' salaries. He did not vote on medical care for the aged. I don't intend to make any reference to it. The record on that matter is clear. I don't think - I talked about the Republican position on teachers' salary. The Vice President did not vote against teachers' salaries. He was the deciding vote. He may have had reasons for doing it, but I never mentioned that vote."", ""On medical care for the aged, there was opposition to tying it to social security by the Republicans. Only one Senator voted with us in the U.S. Senate, Senator Case of New Jersey, a Republican, so that record is very clear. Even though at the outset the medical care to the aged was endorsed not only by Democrats but by Governor Rockefeller. It is a fact that the Vice President voted against the establishment in Mr. Flemming's own Department, HEW, in 1951 or 1952. I am not going to get into a discussion of the Vice President until he gets out but I think we ought to straighten the record out, because Mr. Flemming is misinformed. I did not discuss the Vice President's action on the teachers' salaries or anything else. I did not talk about Mr. Nixon's position on medical care for the aged. I talked about the Republican position. But I think the facts, as long as the matter wants to be debated, I think the facts are quite clear on both of those matters and on the establishment of the HEW."", 'QUESTION. Would you assess the session of Congress just ended? How did it come about that the Democratic majority under your leadership failed to pass most of the legislation that you wanted to see put through?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, we passed in the Senate some of the legislation. Previous to the convention we had passed housing, aid to education. After the convention, we did pass a minimum wage bill of $1.25 in the Senate. We failed by five votes on medical care for the aged tied to social security. The Rules Committee of the House did not release education or housing for a vote in the House. The conference committee did not accept the $1.25. Of course, as you know, the Republicans and the administration were wholly opposed to us. It is extremely difficult to carry out any program in a short session with the parliamentary procedures which are available, when a party, an opposition party is united and has the support of the administration, with the threat of veto. The session was disappointing, but I do think it indicates that it is essential that we secure a party which will have the responsibility, a Congress of one party and an administration of the same party. To divide it between one party having control of the executive, and another party having control of the Congress, it assures you are not going to get action on any of these matters for the next 4 years. I think the American people should give the responsibility to the Republicans or the Democrats, and then let them meet the problems and any responsibility can be fairly assigned.', ""QUESTION. Senator, do you have any comment on the reports we have been getting that your crowds have not been quite up to Nixon's crowds?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. No, I think we have done very well. We had a very good day in Michigan. I thought we had a good day yesterday.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, do you plan to go into the South and if so, when?', 'Senator KENNEDY. We are going into Texas, which I guess is the Southwest. We are going into North Carolina. We have not much more scheduled yet. I am going to Florida, I believe, at the end of September. That is all we have at the present time.', 'QUESTION. Senator, do you feel that strong personalities, popular personalities such as President Eisenhower and Governor Rockefeller, campaigning against you will be perhaps a severe handicap to your campaign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No.', 'QUESTION. Why?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think that President Eisenhower is not running this year, and Governor Rockefeller was not nominated. I agree that President Eisenhower would be a very strong candidate if he was running, but he isn't running, and Governor Rockefeller was not nominated. So I think the fight now is for the future between Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and myself. The relative programs of the two parties and the candidates."", 'QUESTION. Do you feel that some of this might rub off?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't know. We will know in November how much is rubbing off."", 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.']"

The people will have made their choice and I want to emphasize that it is not merely a choice between two men. It is a choice between two parties.

And the Republican Party which we face this November is the same party we have always opposed. There is no new Republican Party - and no old Republican Party - there is only the same Republican Party which, for half a century, has opposed every single progressive measure which has been designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery."", ""This is the party which opposed the introduction of social security - and then ran a campaign to repeal it. This is the party which opposed adequate workmen's compensation - adequate minimum wages - and adequate limitations on the hours of labor. This is the party which fought against housing programs, against school programs, and against food distribution programs. This is the party that opposed REA, TVA, and farm price support. This is the party that tried to block the New Deal - that tried to halt the Fair Deal - and that is trying to keep America from crossing the New Frontier. But they have never succeeded in the past - and with help they will not succeed in 1960."", 'And if the American people needed any reminder of this history - they have received this reminder during the past 8 years. For in the past 8 years the Republican Party has not proposed one single constructive new program to increase the welfare of the American people - not one new move of benefit to all the people, or those who need it most - and they have hampered, opposed, and obstructed every Democratic effort to deal with our urgent needs.', 'Although there are 4 million unemployed workers in this country - forced to get by on an average unemployment compensation check of $31 a week - the Republican Party has blocked all Democratic efforts to modernize and extend our system of unemployment compensation.', 'Although 5 million Americans must struggle for survival on Government surplus foods consisting of less than $10 a month worth of rice, flour, cornmeal and dried eggs for a family of four - the Republicans have refused to put into operation an expanded food distribution program voted by a Democratic Congress. And in West Virginia I saw the hunger, the malnutrition, and the despair which this refusal has brought about.', 'Although we have 130,000 fewer classrooms than we need - although our teachers are underpaid and our schools understaffed - the Republicans have blocked every Democratic effort to provide the assistance that would give us the educational system worthy of a great nation.', 'Although 15 million Americans are forced to live in substandard dwellings - the Republican Party has adopted policies which have slowed down private housing - and consistently blocked Democratic efforts to enact programs to clear our slums, renew our cities, and provide decent homes for Americans of low and moderate incomes.', 'And finally, although 9 million Americans over the age of 65 receive incomes of less than $20 a week - and 3 million more receive incomes of less than $40 a week - amounts on which they cannot afford their higher medical bills - the Republican Party, only 2 weeks ago, blocked our efforts to provide medical care for the aged under social security.', 'Some people say that this last brief session of the Congress was a handicap to the Democratic Party - and it is true that the Republicans blocked our efforts on every major front. But that session was an education to the American people - it taught them that if they want to have, among other urgent items, decent medical care for our older citizens they are only going to get it under the leadership of the Democratic Party.', ""The Democratic bill embodied Democratic principles. We wanted our older citizens to receive help in meeting their staggering medical bills without making them take a pauper's oath - without forcing them to go on relief - and without requiring them to be dependent upon the annual appropriations of Congress and 50 State legislative bodies. We wanted them to receive that kind of help because they deserved it - because it was a right they had earned, not charity they were being given - and we wanted a program based on the pay-as-you-go social insurance principles of the social security system."", ""The Republicans defeated this bill. They told us about States' rights. They told us about freedom of choice, but they did not tell us what any of these things had to do with our bill - and they did not explain what they were going to do for our older citizens."", 'It is time for action, not talk. Next January we will have that action and that is why I am glad to make medical care for the aged a top priority issue in this campaign.', 'This is the Republican record - a record of neglect and indifference - the record of a party, to quote Franklin Roosevelt, that is ""frozen in the ice of its own indifference."" And this is the record which the people of Oakland - and all the people of America - are going to reject in this election.', 'For today America needs the Democratic Party. And so long as there is one child without a decent diet or a decent school - so long as there is one family without a decent home - so long as there is one able-bodied American without a decent standard of living - so long as there is one retired American without dignity and hope - then so long will America need the Democratic Party.', 'First, America needs the Democratic Party because we intend to see to it that every older American is protected against the ravages of disease and disability through a system of social security insurance.', 'But we will do more than aid our older citizens. We will also ask their aid. The New Frontier is not only for the young. If we are to meet its great challenges and opportunities we need the wisdom, the skill, an the experience of our older citizens. We need their help and their guidance in building a better America, and I will ask them for that help and that guidance.', 'Secondly, America needs the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party intends to use the full legal and moral authority of the Federal Government - including in particular the Presidency itself - to put an end to racial and religious discrimination in every area of our national life, so that every American has the same right as every other American to go to school, to get a job, to vote to buy a house, to use any public facility, and to sit down at any public lunch counter. For we believe in the right of every American to stand up for his rights - even if to do so, he has to sit down for them.', 'Third, America needs the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party intends to help the States build classrooms and pay for the teachers which are necessary if we are to have an educational system second to none. And America cannot afford schools which are second to anyone.', 'Fourth, America needs the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party intends to wipe out the slums which mar our great cities - and help provide a decent home for the millions of Americans who today are denied an adequate shelter in which to raise their families. The last two Democratic housing bills were vetoed - but the Democratic housing bill of 1961 will become the law of the land.', 'Fifth, America needs the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party intends to make sure that every able-bodied American can maintain at least a minimum standard of living while he looks for a job - through increased food surplus distribution. And we also intend to make sure that every able-bodied American has a job to look for by adopting programs to aid depressed areas, increase our economic growth, and add the new industries and the new jobs which a growing population demands.', 'Franklin Roosevelt once reminded us that ""we cannot be content - if some fraction of our people - whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth - is ill-fed, ill-clothed ill-housed, and insecure."" And despite today\'s vital needs the Republican Party has been a contented party - a satisfied party - but we Democrats are not content. Ours is a restless party, an action party, a party which is determined to begin moving - again - and to put America on the move.', 'One final word: We live in a tumultuous world, a world of change and challenge. This may be the most important election in our lifetime.', 'From Cuba to the Congo, from the Middle East to Formosa Strait, the earth is trembling.', 'Only a party that understands human needs at home can understand the rising hopes of peoples overseas - and help them peaceably to find their way to freedom. Only a party that acts on behalf of the people at home can deserve leadership around the world. Only a party that believes in the future at home can help win the hearts of people who have broken with the past.', 'That task will require vision and leadership and sacrifice. And I am here to ask such an effort of you - and to remind you of the Biblical injunction - ""Thou shalt not harden thy heart, nor shut thy hand, from thy needy brother; but thou shalt surely open thy hand unto him.""', 'We in the Democratic Party have not hardened our hearts - we will reach out a helping hand to those in need - and we will continue the struggle until poverty and injustice and hunger are wiped out from the face of this great rich land forever.']"
57,John F. Kennedy ,"September 08, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Governor. I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming down on this whistle stop tour in this county. We are carrying this campaign into the State of California. I want to make the point that this really is not merely a contest between the Vice President and myself, I think this is a contest between two political parties, between the histories of those parties, and between their promises and the record for the future. This is an important election.

I believe that we do. But I believe that if we are going to meet the future [applause] it is going to require the best of us all. I think we are going to have to meet the problems we face here at home if we are going to successfully convey an image of vitality and strength abroad.

We are going to have to put our country and our people back to work. This is a great country, but I think it can be a greater country. I ask your help in this campaign.

I follow here in 1960 the same trail Harry Truman took in 1948 when he came down this valley and carried California in the 1948 election. [Applause.] And I am delighted to come here in the shadow of Mount Shasta, and follow in the next 2 days the Central Valley all the way down to southern California, because this valley shows what can be done. It shows what we must do in the future if we are going to develop the resources of the United States.', 'I can assure you that if we are successful in this election, we will move ahead in the development of the resources of the Central Valley, and also the resources of the western United States. [Applause.]', 'I come from a State, Massachusetts, which has too much water, but I know enough about the history of the world to know that water is the key to the development of the United States, and it is a source of pride and satisfaction to me that the two Americans in this century who recognized this best both came from the State of New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] The fact is that under Franklin Roosevelt we launched the great projects which have given us industrial power, given us conservation and irrigation, given us control of our water resources: TVA, the Central Valley project, Bonneville and all the rest. Today, in a closely knit tumultuous world, the key to the future lies in water. It is the fact of the matter that this administration has failed to recognize that unless this country moves ahead today, we will not have in 1970 and 1980 the same resources which have made our own life so productive.', 'I want to make it clear that if we are successful in this election, we are going to reverse the policy of no new starts, and move ahead to make sure that those who follow in our trail have the same advantages that we have. Therefore, I suggest that we embark in January 1960 on the following programs:', 'First, that we reverse the policy of no new starts and move ahead with development of our natural resources, including the extension of the Central Valley.', ""Secondly, we must reassert the public right to the public domain. We must make sure that the so-called partnership policy does not prevent the maximum use of our country's natural resources. [Applause.] We must defend the integrity of the Tennessee Valley, the Central Valley, and the Columbia Basin, and commence the forest reclamation and antipollution programs begun by the New Deal in the 1930's."", 'Third, we must get on with reclamation and basinwide development across the United States.', ""Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that represents the public interest and not the private interest. [Applause.] Therefore, in the 1960's we need a whole new concept of resource development, so vast, so complex, and so essential are our natural resources that they cannot be parceled out piecemeal; nothing less than a comprehensive, basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley development of our natural resources to make sure that not one drop of our water goes from the wellsprings of our water to the sea without being used for a public purpose. [Applause.]"", 'And I think it would be most useful to establish for the Office of the President himself a Council of Resource and Conservation Advisers to survey the whole scope of our natural resources so that we can, as a country, not merely as a basin, develop the resources for 1970 and 1980.', 'And lastly, we must bring to bear the best minds that this country has on the development of our natural resources. We cannot possibly afford not to make a maximum effort to get fresh water from salt water, if this State and the country is going to move ahead. We have to figure out how long-range weather, controlling floods, managing watersheds, and I think we have to recognize that in other centuries, in other areas of the world, great countries which ignored their natural resources now lie buried under sand.', 'I think we can do better. The Soviet Union has set in this regard a warning bell for us all. By 1950 they were 28 years behind in the development of their hydro capacity. In 28 years from today, at their present rate of growth, with their present emphasis on power and energy, they are going to be ahead of the United States. That is how close this is. And as Khrushchev has said, the electrification of their society has been a basic aim of the Communist Party since its earlier stage. This is only one of the many problems that our country faces. But I think in this area, as in so many others, I think it is time we started to move ahead. This is a great country, but I think it can be a greater country. This State of California is a great State, but I think it can be a greater State. And I am not satisfied as an American to see us stand still while other countries move ahead. I think it is up to us to grasp the future, to recognize the responsibilities that we have in our own generation to move ahead. I can assure you that if I am elected in November, if I am successful in this election, that this great resource of ours here in this State, in the Central Valley, will carry on as it did under Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.]', 'This is an important election. I ask your help in this election. I can assure you that this is a young and vital country, but what we do here in our own country affects the security of the United States around the world. If countries in Africa and Latin America and Asia see us standing still, and the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists moving ahead, then they decide that the future belongs to them and not to us. I think the future belongs to us. But if it is going to belong to us, we have to reach forward. [Applause.]', 'So give us your help.

But they know and I know that this State will not begin to realize its potential until we have not only a Democratic Congress, but until we have a Democratic President who believes in the future of Alaska.

We got the only good night's rest on this train that we have had in this last 2 weeks. We start this campaign in this State this morning, and I think it is most appropriate that we fight this campaign in the Vice President's own State, because this is where we can win this campaign in the State of California. So we will be all over it in the next few days. We are coming back in October. I don't think anyone in this State who has lived here in the last few years, who has seen the same problems in California that the whole United States is going to face in the next 10 or 20 years, can possibly say that this election makes no difference. If we are going to move ahead, if this economy of this State and country is going to grow, if we are going to do something about education and development of our resources, if we are going to meet our problems at home and abroad, I think it is time we elected a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President.

63,John F. Kennedy ,"September 08, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mayor, Congressman Moss, Governor Brown, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your kindness in coming down here and welcoming us. This train is headed not only south, but it is headed toward Washington. I think in many ways the election of 1960 comes at a time more dangerous for our country, more trying for all of us, a period of greater responsibility for every citizen than any election since the election of 1860. In that time, as you recall, the great issue was whether this country could stay united, whether it would, in the words of Lincoln, exist half slave and half free. The issue in the election of 1960 involves not only the well-being of the people of this valley, involves not only the development of your natural resources, but as citizens of the United States and leaders of the free world, we must be concerned about such far off places as the Congo, India, and Indonesia, the security of those countries, as well as the well-being of their people.', 'I don\'t suppose that in any election before the second administration of Woodrow Wilson was there a combination of such great decisions which face the American people, which involve their own security as citizens within their own country, and also their positions as leaders of the free world. But in the administration of Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, this country began to move ahead here at home and began to occupy a position of leadership around the world. My chief disagreement with the Republican Party and its leadership is not because I criticize the country - it is because I think they have lost faith in the United States. They are the ones who don\'t think we can do better. We say we can do better because we believe that this country has unlimited resources, because we believe it has unlimited energy, and because we believe it has an unlimited potential. We don\'t criticize the United States because we think there is something wrong with the United States. We say we can do better. The Republicans say, ""This is as good as we can do."" That is the difference between us. [Applause.] Anybody who has lived in this valley since 1945 knows what can be done in the United States. You have turned since the Roosevelt administration. You have made this valley green. It shows what can be done in this country with energy and leadership. I ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.] And I can assure you that if we are successful we are going to move again in this country. We are going to assume the leadership again of the free world. We are going to move in this valley, and we are going to move again around the globe. Thank you very much for coming down. [Applause.]']"

This is a most important election in a most important time in the life of our country. I think the record of the Republican Party in this century can be written in the slogan of ""Stay Normal With Harding"" and ""Keeping Cool With Coolidge."" [Applause.] And the record of the Democratic Party and the things for which it has stood, and the things for which it has fought, have been written in the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson, the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, the Fair Deal of Harry Truman and the New America of Adlai Stevenson.

I think we face the most difficult years in our history, not only in our own country, but around the world. The great responsibility for us as Americans is to demonstrate our vitality here in this country, to move ahead here in the United States, and in so doing to demonstrate our leadership around the world. Here in this State under the administration of Governor Brown, working with a Democratic assembly and a Democratic State senate, you have shown what can be done. I hope in November you will give us in Washington a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic Chief Executive and a Democratic administration which can move ahead."", ""I think the real issue in this campaign, in this State, and around the country, is the Republicans saying that things are good as they can be. I don't agree with it. I think the real difference is that we believe things can be better. We believe this country can move ahead. We believe that we can move stronger on the road to peace, and in the establishment of our own security. I don't take the view that we have never had it so good. I take the view that this is a great country, but it can be greater. This is a great State, but it can be a greater State. I ask your help in this campaign. I think we can win, and if we win, I think it will be possible for the country to win.

They have opposed, they have stood against progress. I think their time is coming to an end. [Applause.] For the fact of the matter is that the Republican Party that we oppose is the same old party. There is no new Republican Party. There is the same old party, stretching back into history from the days of McKinley, through Coolidge and Harding and all the rest, and I think that in this great year of 1960, the American people are going to choose progress.

We think we have a great country, but we think it can be greater and we are going to make it greater.

It is a national, indeed, a worldwide problem.', 'I have seen the arid lands of the Middle East. Water is the key there to riches and poverty, to peace and war. Men and women spend a third of their working days fetching water from distant wells.', 'Even in the United States, some areas are desperately short of water - and at the same time other areas are ravaged by floods. And our forests are vanishing, our wildlife is vanishing, our streams are polluted, and so is the very air we breathe.', 'Yet America is rich in natural resources. Our impending resource crisis is not due to scarcity. It is due to underdevelopment, despoilment, and neglect.', 'Water is the key to the American future. In 1900 we Americans used 40 billion gallons of water daily. This year we will use 312 billion, enough to cover Rhode Island a foot deep. By 1975, the Commerce Department estimates, we will use 453 billion gallons a day. For we are in the midst of a population explosion. By 1975 there will be over 230 million Americans. And their needs for electric power in all-electric homes, all-electric factories, all-electric farms, will be three times as great as it is today. We consumed 144 million kilowatts of power in 1958. By 1975 we will need nearly 500 million. We must expand our generating capacity to meet the need. We have the potential - an estimated potential of 117 million kilowatts. But we have developed only 26.5 million kilowatt only a fraction of our most powerful resource.', 'Great leaders of the past understood these facts of national life. It was a great Republican leader, Gifford Pinchot, who said:', '\n  A nation deprived of liberty may win it, a nation divided may reunite, but a nation whose natural resources are destroyed must inevitably pay the penalty of poverty, degradation, and decay.\n', ""Under Franklin Roosevelt the Federal Government launched a grand endeavor to develop our river basins - TVA, Bonneville, the Central Valley project of California - models for all the world to admire - proof that a free people, acting through their own freely chosen government, can put the people's rivers to the service of the people."", 'Today, in a close-knit tumultuous world, the development of our natural resources is not only vital to the survival of our Western States and the survival of our Nation. It is vital to the survival of the entire free world. But that survival has been endangered by shortsighted Republican policies at Hells Canyon, at TVA, here at the Trinity Dam project, and across the Nation - by a policy of ""no new starts,"" a policy of do-nothing, stand-still status quo.', 'It is time to start.', 'First, we must reverse the defeatist policy of ""no new starts"" and move ahead with full development of our natural resources, including the extension of the Central Valley project.', ""Second, we must reassert the public's rights in the public domain which the so-called partnership policy has undermined; maintain the public preference clause against monopoly; defend the integrity of TVA, the Columbia Basin, and the Central Valley; and recommence the forestry, reclamation, antipollution, recreation, and public lands programs begun by the New Deal."", 'Third, we must get on with reclamation and basinwide river development across the Nation.', 'Fourth, we must appoint a Federal Power Commission that will uphold the public interest, and not serve private interests alone.', 'Fifth, we need a whole new concept of resource development. So vast, so complex, and so neglected are our resources that their wise development cannot be parceled out piecemeal. Nothing less than comprehensive basin-by-basin, valley-by-valley planning on a nationwide scale can do the job. And nothing less than leadership, Presidential leadership, can do the job. We must establish a Council of Resource and Conservation Advisers in the Office of the President himself - a council which will engage in overall resource planning - which will assess the national needs of an expanding population - and recommend national programs to meet them.', 'Sixth, we must bring to bear on our natural resource problems the best scientific brains, the best ideas, and the best modern technologies that are available. New methods of retaining snowpacks, of preventing surface evaporation of stored waters, of controlling floods and managing watersheds, of cloud seeding and long-range weather forecasting and weather control - above all a crash program of research how to convert salt water to fresh water - all these and many more tools must be summoned to the task. We have the technological know-how. What we need to do now is remove the bureaucratic and political roadblocks - and forge ahead.', 'In the long-ago dim past around the world, other great nations have wasted and devoured their priceless heritage of land and water - and their temples and palaces lie buried in the jungle and desert sand.', 'Mr. Khrushchev has said:', '\n  Electrification of the national economy has always been regarded by our party as the cardinal task.\n', 'Measured by installed capacity, the Communists were 28 years behind us in 1950 - but unless we speed up or they slow down, in less than 28 years from now they will have passed us by.', ""I don't want a second-rate America."", 'This is no time for retreat and defeat. This is a time for strength, for development, for greatness - a time for bold ideas and brave new programs.

I want to express my appreciation to all of you having come down and meeting us at the station, and I am also delighted to he in the hometown of my friend and colleague with whom I served in the U.S. Congress for 14 years - Clair Engle. [Applause.] His successor, Bizz Johnson, has been campaigning with us, and I am delighted to be accompanied across the face of California by your distinguished Governor, Pat Brown. [Applause.]', 'I campaign for the office of the Presidency in a very difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country, and I do not do that if I am elected all of the problems of California and the United States and the free world will be solved. But I do believe that it is vitally important if the security of the United States is going to be protected, if our position as a leader of the free world is going to be maintained, that we recognize the close relationships between the vitality of our own domestic economy and our position around the world. If we stand still here at home, we stand still around the world. The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were so successful in their foreign policy was because they were so successful in their domestic policy. When Franklin Roosevelt harnessed the TVA and the Central Valley, and Bonneville, he demonstrated to a watching world that this country was moving, and, therefore, they were prepared to follow his leadership in their great efforts to obtain their freedom and independence. This valley is a great natural resource, not of the State of California only, but of the United States. This belongs not to one State but to all the people, and, therefore, I think it appropriate that the United States participate in the development of the resources of the Western United States and the resources of the State of California. [Applause.]', ""I would like to make it clear that when the people put their shoulders to the development of great dams, then I think that power should be distributed in a way that benefits the people. I don't think the people should pay for irrigation and have the power distributed by a private company. I think the people should benefit. [Applause.]"", ""I come from a section of the United States that has problems entirely different from California. We have too much water. You have too little. But it is a fact that in this century the two Americans who recognized the importance of the development of natural resources to the United States were both from Eastern United States. One was a Republican, Theodore Roosevelt, and the other was a Democrat, Franklin Roosevelt. I can assure you that if we are successful in this campaign, we are going to move ahead on all fronts, on the development of our national economy, on the development of our natural resources, rebuilding our country, so that by the year 2000, when two people live in this country for every one that lives today, this will then be a strong and rich country whose security is assured. I run for the office of the Presidency in the most difficult time in the life of our country, in many ways the most difficult in a hundred years. In the election of 1860, as Abraham Lincoln said, the issue was whether this country could exist half slave and half free. I think the issue in 1960 is whether this world can exist half slave and half free. If it is going to move in the direction of freedom, if it is going to move in the direction of the things which we value, then the United States has to lead. I don't promise you an easy future, but I can promise you that if we are successful, this country will begin to move again. This country will begin to lead again. This country will go forward.

For the story of the Democratic Party is the story of human rights, from Jefferson's Statute of Religious Freedom, to Wilson's New Freedom - from Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to Harry Truman's Fair Deal. Every major step forward in the cause of human rights in this century has been the product of the leadership of the Democratic Party - and every expectation of future progress today rests with the Democratic Party."", 'For in this election we must look forward - not to the past - to future achievement, not past accomplishment. We are proud of the fact that the last two Democratic Congresses enacted the first civil rights legislation since the period following the Civil War. But we are even prouder of the fact that the Democratic Party - in its platform - has a program of future action which will insure equality of opportunity to all Americans.', 'And I am proud of our platform. I believe in our platform. And in 1961 I intend to see that its pledges are carried out.', 'But if we are to carry out these pledges - if we are to insure equal opportunity to all Americans - then all the vast and important powers of the Presidency must be enlisted in the task. For only a President willing to use all the resources of his high office can provide the leadership, the determination, and direction which are essential if we are to eliminate racial and religions discrimination from American society.', 'When our next President takes office in January he must be prepared to move forward on three broad fronts: as a legislative leader, as Chief Executive, and as a moral leader.', 'First, as a legislative leader the President must give us the legal weapons needed to enforce the constitutional rights of every American. He cannot wait for others to act. He himself must draft the programs - transmit them to the Congress - and fight for their enactment, taking his case to the people if the Congress is slow in acting.', ""And much legislation is needed. We must continue and strengthen the President's Civil Rights Commission. We must grant the Attorney General power to enforce all constitutional rights - not just the right to vote. We must wipe out discriminatory poll taxes and literacy tests, and pass effective antibombing and antilynching legislation. And we must continually strengthen the legal framework which will allow us to move toward economic, educational, and political equality."", 'Such legislation is already being prepared. I have asked Senator Clark, of Pennsylvania, and Congressman Celler, of New York, to prepare a bill embodying all of the pledges of the Democratic platform. And this bill will be among the first orders of business when a new Congress meets in January.', ""Secondly, as Chief Executive, the next President must be prepared to put an end to racial and religious discrimination in every field of Federal activity - by issuing the long-delayed Executive order putting an end to racial discrimination in federally assisted housing - by revitalizing the Vice President's Committee on Government Contracts so that those who receive contracts from the Federal Government will not be permitted to deny a job to a qualified worker because of his race or religion - and by making sure that no American is barred from the highest positions in Government because of the color of his skin."", 'Our Chief Executive must also make sure that the laws which Democratic Congresses have passed are enforced with vigor and determination - that the right to vote and other constitutional rights are not denied because of laxity or indifference in the office of the Attorney General.', 'Third, as a moral leader, the next President must play his role in interpreting the great moral issues which are involved in our crusade for human rights. He must exert the great moral and educational force of his office to help bring about equal access to public facilities from churches to lunch counters - and to support the right of every American to stand up for his rights - even if that means sitting down for them.', 'For only the President - the representative of all interests and all sections - can create the understanding and the tolerance which is necessary if we are to make an orderly transition to a completely free society. If the President does not himself wage the struggle for equal rights - if he stands above the battle - then the battle will inevitably be lost.']"

That is the great issue of this campaign. [Applause.]', 'Therefore, the issues in this campaign, in a very real sense, transcend the traditional issues which have separated our two parties. The great question now for all Americans, regardless of party, is whether they can make freedom work, whether they can make this system work in a difficult and dangerous period, whether they can demonstrate to a watching world that we represent the way to the future and the Communist system represents a system as old as Egypt. I think it does. And my chief argument with the Republican Party has been that they have not had faith in the free system.

Harding""; ""Keep Cool With Coolidge."" [Laughter.] ""Had Enough?"" ""Time for a Change."" The weakest slogans in the history of American politics. [Applause.]', 'Contrast the slogans of which we are proud: Woodrow Wilson\'s ""New Freedom""; Franklin Roosevelt\'s ""New Deal""; Harry Truman\'s [applause] - Harry Truman\'s ""Fair Deal."" [Applause.] And Adlai Stevenson\'s ""New America."" [Applause.]', 'And I will respectfully contrast the so-called slogans of the 1960 campaign: The Vice President\'s ""Send a Man To Do a Man\'s Job"" versus a slogan of a ""New Frontier"" for the United States. [Applause.] The fact of the matter is that all the issues which we discuss in this campaign are issues which we have fought out through this entire century, even though we all recognize that the great issue is the struggle for peace, the struggle for survival, the question of whether we and the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists can inhabit the same globe, defend our interests, and still live in peace with both sides having a hydrogen capacity - that is the great question that we face.', ""But everything that we do in the United States, every issue which we now discuss, every fight held in the last month of the Congress, all go to this question of our ability to survive in a difficult and dangerous world. If the United States is unable to solve its agricultural surpluses, if we waste food while people go to bed hungry every night, can you say that this is a domestic problem of no importance around the world? If the United States increases its economic growth one-third that of the Soviet Union, if we last year were the lowest of any major industrialized society in the world, can you say that is a matter of just importance to us and not to the people of Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Western Europe? If we turn out one-half as many scientists, engineers, and teachers as the Soviet Union, can we say that that is a domestic matter, that it doesn't make any difference in our fight for peace, in our fight for survival? If the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists bring thousands more students from Africa and Asia to study in Moscow and Peiping than we do in this country, when we can't even afford to bring over 300 Africans to study in our country this summer, then can we say truthfully that that is important only to us?"", 'I think this is an important election. I ask your help in this election, not just in a contest with Mr. Nixon, but in a contest for the future of this country. [Applause.]', ""And the third issue which I think has great implications around the world is the whole question of religious and racial freedom here in the United States. [Applause.] Can we honestly say that it doesn't affect our security and the fight for peace when Negroes and others are denied their full constitutional rights, when we in this country [Applause] when we in this country who are a white minority around the world, are asking for the friendship of Negroes and colored people stretching all around the globe, whose good will, whose support, whose common interest we seek to develop in the coming years? Can we say that when we deny a child the right to a decent education because of his color that it is of no importance to us in the fight for peace? [Applause.]"", 'So let us make it very clear that when the Democratic Party wrote its platform in July it meant it in September and in November and in January. [Applause.]', 'In 1961 I intend to see that those commitments are carried out. [Applause]', 'When our next President takes office in January 1961, he must be prepared to move forward in the field of human rights in three general areas: As a legislative leader, as Chief Executive, and as the center of the moral power of the United States. [Applause.]', 'First, as a legislative leader, the President must give us the legal weapons necessary to carry on and enforce the constitutional rights of every American. [Applause.] We must wipe out discriminatory poll taxes, we must provide effective antibombing and antilynching legislation - [applause] - and we must continually strengthen the legal framework which permits us all to move forward toward our full constitutional, economic, and political rights.', ""Secondly, as Chief Executive, the next President must be prepared to put an end to racial and religious discrimination in every field of Federal activity - [applause] - by issuing the long-delayed Executive order to putting an end to racial discrimination in federally subsidized and supported housing, by revitalizing and making significant the Vice President's Commission on Contracts, so that those who receive contracts from the Federal Government shall not at the same time practice discrimination in the hiring and in their employing. [Applause.]"", 'Third, as a moral leader, the next President must play his role in interpreting the great moral issues which are involved in our crusade for human rights. He must exert the great moral and educational force of his office to help bring equal access to public facilities from churches to lunch counters, and to support the right of every American to stand up for his rights, even if on occasion he must sit down for them. [Applause.] For only the President, not the Senate and not the House, and not the Supreme Court, in a real sense only the President can create the understanding and tolerance necessary as the spokesman for all the American people, as the symbol [applause] as the symbol of the moral imperative upon which any free society is based. This is a great issue which transcends in many ways many of the issues which we debate in the Congress and debate through the States. It is the question of whether we believe the precepts upon which this democracy was founded. Do we honestly believe what the Declaration of Independence said, that all men are created equal? [Applause.] That they are endowed not by the Constitution and not by the Supreme Court, they are endowed by their Creator with these rights? [Applause.]', 'The day before he died, Franklin Roosevelt wrote, ""The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."" I must say, looking at the power in this great country of ours, after having traveled in nearly every State in the last 12 months, and spending a great deal of time in some States in the primaries, I have come to have the greatest possible confidence, not only in our country, but in our system of government. I think as time goes on, that if we play our role, if we meet our responsibilities, if we measure up not only in the public sense, but in the private sense, to the opportunities that we have, if we recognize that freedom is not licensed, and that liberty calls for certain qualities of self-restraint and character which go with self-government, I am confident that the future can belong to those who believe in freedom. [Applause.]', ""I think in a very real sense what we have here really is the final flowering of the human experience. I don't think the world is moving in the direction of communism. I think in time it will move in the direction that we have followed. I think that that is particularly true if we are willing to meet our responsibilities. If we recognize that what we have now is good, but that we can do better, if we recognize that our past experience is great but that our future possibilities are even greater, if we recognize that in a very serious way all of us hold office, that it is just not merely one candidate running for office, all of you in a sense will in 1961 hold office in the great Republic, upon all of you in your own way and in your own life great responsibilities will be placed upon you. I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that life in the 1960's will be easy because I don't think it will be. I think it will be a very dangerous time for us all. But I do run for the Presidency in the 1960's having the greatest possible confidence in our country, in our system, in our ability to meet these challenges. I think of the office of the Presidency in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt thought of it and Woodrow Wilson, in the sense that they felt the chief task of the President was to set before the American people the things that they must do, the responsibilities that they must meet. [Applause.]"", 'If the President does not set those standards, if he does not set our national goals, then a Senator from Massachusetts, or a Senator from California, or the Governor of California, or a Congressman, or a newspaper editor, or a system cannot do it. Only the President speaks for the people. Therefore, the President must speak with the people and for the people in setting before them the unfinished agenda. [Applause] upon you to join me in this election on our journey to the new frontier, recognizing that what we do here will finally determine the fate of freedom around the world. Thomas Paine said in the Revolution of 1775 that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind. I say in this revolution that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. [Applause.] You will remember that Benjamin Franklin said on that occasion that ""Where liberty lives, there is my home,"" and Thomas Paine replied, ""Where liberty does not live, there is my home.""', 'I think that together this great country, fighting for a great cause, standing for great moral principles, I think that we can make a contribution to the freedom of the world and to our own security, and to the peace of the world that will cause historians at a later date to say, ""There were the great years of the American life, the 1960\'s. Give me those years."" [Applause.]', 'In 1886, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and He hates injustice."" He said, ""I see the storm coming. If He has a place and a part for me, I am ready."" Now, in 1960, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. We say, ""If He has a place and part for us, we are ready."" Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"

My friend and colleague in the Congress of the United States, Harlan Hagen, Governor Brown, Mayor Sullivan, Senator Stern, Jack Casey, Assemblyman Williams, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you very much for coming and sending us off in the airplane from Bakersfield to Los Angles. We have been working on the railroad for the last 24 hours. We have seen a great State, and I think this State is going Democratic in November. [Applause.] I think that there is one basic issue in this campaign. We can see it in this valley, we can see it in this country, and we can see it around the world. That is the long range difference between our two political parties, between a party that believes that things are as good as they can be, and a party that thinks we can do better. [Applause.]', 'In this century the Republicans have had three or four campaign slogans, ""Stand Pat With McKinley,"" ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge."" The slogans for the Democratic Party on the other hand have been the New Freedom, the New Deal, the Fair Deal, and Adlai Stevenson\'s New America.', ""I come in 1960 talking about the new frontier. The new frontier is not the things that I am promising to do for you if I am elected President. The new frontier consists of the things that we are asking all of us to do for this country in the 1960's. This is a great country, but it deserves the best that we have. I suppose 30 or 40 years ago, before the second administration of Woodrow Wilson, people who lived in this valley worried about their farms and their jobs, and now we worry about your farms and your jobs, but we worry about Cuba and the Congo and India and Indonesia, and the security of our families, and the chances for peace. I ask your help in this campaign. I run for the Office of the Presidency not saying that if I am elected life will be easy, but I can promise you that I have a deep conviction, and I know that you share it, that we can do better than we are doing. If we can be stronger than we are, we can stand far more around the world than we do today. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I can tell you that 20 and 25 years ago, African leaders quoted Lincoln, Jefferson, and Franklin Roosevelt. They don't quote anybody in America today. They look at Peking and Moscow, and wonder which road they should take. I think we have to reestablish ourselves as a vital and vigorous society, concerned with the needs of our own people and holding out a helping hand to those around the world who look to us for friendship and assistance."", 'During the American Revolution Thomas Paine said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I believe in 1960 in the great world revolutions that are sweeping us now, that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. I ask your help in this campaign, not just because it represents a change in parties, but I think it is possible for us to reestablish a different atmosphere in the United States, a desire to be first, not ""first, but,"" not ""first, when,"" but first on the road to peace and first in the world. [Applause.]', 'In the election 100 years ago, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I believe there is a God and I know He hates injustice. I see a storm coming and I know His hand is in it. If He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'We believe there is a God and we believe there is a storm coming.

[Applause.]', 'I think you understand in this State what this election is about. This is a chance for the United States to continue to move forward on the road which Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman and Stevenson urged this country to take. All they can say is what McKinley and Taft and Coolidge and Landon and Harding and the others wanted to say. This is the choice for the United States in 1960. I think this country is a great country, but I think we can do a better job. I think we can move ahead, in this State and across the United States and around the world. [Applause.]', 'I was nominated in the city of Los Angeles and you cannot possibly stop now. I ask your help in this campaign. I think the real question is what we can make this country be. Has it realized its full potential? Has our day in the sun passed? Have we set into a decline instead of a growth in the United States? Mr. Khrushchev is going to bury us. But that is not what is as alarming as the fact that all over the world, as in Latin America and Asia and Africa, people who used to look to Franklin Roosevelt for leadership now turn to Moscow and Peking and wonder if the future belongs to them. I think the future belongs to us. [Applause.] Not to the United States in that sense, but to those who believe in the cause of freedom, and we are the great hope for freedom. If we fail in this country, the cause of freedom fails. If we succeed, if we make this a better country, if we make this a better place for everyone to live in, if we build more homes and more schools, if we protect our people better, if we end discrimination in the United States, if we move our economic growth forward, then we strengthen the United States, and we strengthen the cause of freedom. That is our chance and that is our opportunity, and I ask your help. [Applause.]', 'The new frontier is not an easy road, but I think it represents our hope for the future. I ask your help in this country. I think we can win it. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
72,John F. Kennedy ,"September 09, 1960","['One hundred and ten years ago today, President Millard Fillmore signed the historic document that admitted California to the Union. There was very little celebration here on that day - for those early Californians had not yet heard the news. It was several weeks before the good ship Oregon came around the Horn to bring word that California had become the 31st State.', 'But the people of California in 1850 were too busy to celebrate anything. They were busy subduing stubborn earth, wild rivers and rugged mountains. They conquered forests and deserts and hazards of every kind to build a peaceful and prosperous State, on what was then regarded to be the last frontier.', 'But now we stand on the edge of a New Frontier. We are faced with a range of challenges and a host of burdens no less dangerous and no less difficult than those of 1850. And the New Frontier will require of every American the same kind of courage and dedication, the same kind of hard work and sacrifice, that gave this State of California its start 110 years ago today.', 'The problems of that New Frontier are felt around the world - and they are felt right here in this valley. Some of the problems are old - the problems of old age and sickness and unemployment. Some of the problems are new - the problems of automation, expanding populations and the missile gap - problems of fair treatment for our farmers and fair distribution of our water.', 'But there is one challenge on the New Frontier which cuts across all other challenges - one problem which overshadows all other problems - and that challenge is the challenge of peace.', 'We are not satisfied with a so-called peace that is merely an interval between two wars. And we are unwilling to accept a peace of slavery, imposed upon us by foreign rulers. Neither do we want the peace of the prison or the grave.', 'We want a peace in which the world is not teetering constantly on the brink of war. We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive forces of armaments may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament - into great multi-Nation efforts to eradicate disease, harness rivers, eliminate illiteracy, and exploit the frontiers of space. We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares, our bombs into reactors, and our rockets into vehicles for exploring outer space.', 'Surely peace is man\'s deepest aspiration. Surely peace is the underlying issue of 1960. But not in the sense that any one political party has a monopoly on the desire for peace. There is no one ""party of peace"" in this country - just as there is no ""war party"" or ""party of appeasement."" The sooner we get these artificial labels out of the way, the sooner we can get down to discussing the real issues.', 'For, while both parties talk about peace, peace is not going to be won by merely talking about it. It requires action - and the Democratic Party believes in action.', 'First, peace requires an American defense posture strong enough to convince any potential aggressor that war would be a mistake - his mistake. This means we must have a military force which is second to none - now and in the future - and which is invulnerable to a surprise attack. It is not enough to say that we are more powerful than we were in 1952 - it is not enough to say that we have the power to destroy any enemy - it is not even enough to say that we are militarily the strongest nation on earth today. For this Nation will never be an aggressor. And our task therefore is to make certain that every would - be aggressor is convinced that - even after he has attacked us - we would still retain a retaliatory power capable of penetrating his defenses, and making his venture a losing one.', 'The most constant threat to the peace, moreover is not one great atomic war - but a series of little brush-fire wars. And unless we can modernize our conventional forces, and give them the mobility and firepower they need, we are in danger of seeing our strength and security gradually nibbled away, by wars too limited to justify atomic retaliation.', 'The peace requires that we have these adequate defenses - I know this Nation can afford them - and you know this Nation cannot afford to be without them.', 'Secondly, peace requires an America that is planning, preparing, and striving for disarmament and other steps toward peace. Disarmament today is just as complicated as armaments - involving complex problems of surveillance, reconnaissance, seismography, atmospheric sampling and testing stations. A successful blueprint for a safe disarmament is as difficult to devise as a successful blueprint for modern war.', 'But the hard facts of the matter are that we have fewer than 100 people in the entire Federal Government working on these problems. And the result has been that this country has not been prepared for any disarmament, arms control or atomic testing conference that has taken place since the end of the Korean war. I have proposed in the Congress the establishment of a National Peace Agency - an Arms Control Research Institute - and the next President of the United States must take this step to pave the way for peace.', 'Third, the peace requires an America standing shoulder to shoulder with other free nations, united by close ties of friendship, commerce, and mutual respect. In the last 7 1/2 years, the uncertainty of our NATO alliance, the collapse of the Baghdad Pact and the limited value of our other pacts have all demonstrated that a common fear of communism is not a sufficient base for unity. If we are to have peace, America cannot stand alone in a hostile world - without friends and allies, without sources of supply and markets, without an international effort to stem aggression from any source. But if we want others to stand with us, we must earn their friendship and respect. We must consider their problems as well as ours. And we must promote those ties of trade, travel and student exchange which bring peoples as well as governments closer together.', 'Fourth, peace requires a massive American effort, joined by other free nations of the West, to strengthen the political and economic independence of those nations newly emerging on the bottom half of the globe - to prevent in those countries the chaos and despair on which Communist expansion feeds. I know that to many Americans the troubles of India, the Congo and even Cuba seem remote and none of our affair. We would rather devote our attention and our resources to rebuilding our own Nation. But if communism should obtain a permanent foothold in Latin America - if a new Soviet satellite should be successfully established in Africa - if Communist China should win her race with India for the political and economic leadership of Asia - then the balance of power would move heavily against us - and peace would be even more insecure.', 'Fifth, peace requires positive American leadership in a more effective United Nations, working toward the establishment of a worldwide peace under law, enforced by worldwide sanctions of justice. The United Nations has demonstrated in the Congo as elsewhere that it can move alertly and effectively - and in a manner far preferable to unilateral action by this or any other country - to stem disorder and disruptions of the peace in areas of potential danger. But the United Nations can be no stronger and no more imaginative than the nations which make it up - and of these, the United States is one of the most important.', 'Unless we are willing to exercise initiative in that body, rather than awaiting its thoughts and decisions - unless we are willing to channel our positive programs through the United Nations as well as giving it all of our negative problems - and unless we are willing, as a nation proud of its sovereign power, to join with other unions, large and small, in delegating to the United Nations enough power to make it a truly effective body - then we may expect to see that one last hope for peace swallowed up in the oceans of hate.', 'Sixth and finally, peace requires an America that stands as a model of harmonious relations to all the world - a nation whose leadership is convincing be cause we practice what we preach. We can better arouse world opinion against Soviet exploitation of the satellites when we have eliminated unconscionable exploitation of human beings in this country. We can better urge a settlement of those disputes surrounding the great rivers and waterways of the earth when we have success fully settled our own disputes over the distribution of water and other resources. And we can better unite the free world in an aggressive battle against poverty and disease and illiteracy when we have successfully eliminated those same features from our own system - when we have demonstrated that we are on the move in this country - when we have demonstrated that we are capable of leadership at home as well as abroad.', 'These are six pathways to peace. Not one of them is easy. Not one of them can be done overnight. Not one of them can be accomplished without a break with the past, without a change in attitudes and a change in administration.', 'I am a candidate for the office of the Presidency. And I realize that this means I am asking you to place primarily in my hands this arduous responsibility. I cannot guarantee success. I cannot flatly promise the attainment of these goals. But I can promise to conduct that office in pursuit of the example set by another great son of Massachusetts - John Adams, who kept this infant Nation alive by keeping the peace with France, clearing the way for the Louisiana Purchase but leading to his own defeat at the poll - and later writing in his declining years: ""I desire no other inscription over my gravestone than this: \'Here lies John Adams, who took upon himself the responsibility of peace with France.""\'', 'I am willing to take upon myself, in the coming years, the hazardous responsibility of peace with all the world - and I ask your help in that endeavor.']"

This State can go Democratic in November [Applause.] This is the State to win this election. I am delighted to be here today. This train is headed toward Los Angeles, but it is also headed toward Washington, D.C. [Applause.]', ""This valley and this State have many problems. We traveled today from Sacramento, down through the rain. If that rain continues, there is a chance that the farmers of this valley who grow raisins could lose in 1 day $50 million. It indicates as nothing else does why I think it is important that this country concern itself with what I conceive to be the No.1 domestic problem that the United States faces, and that is the decline in agricultural income. But whether we are farmers or whether we live in the cities or whether we live in Massachusetts or whether we live in California, there is one problem that faces us all. That is the question of whether it is going to be possible in the 1960's for this country to live at peace, whether we can live in the same world as the Soviet Union and live in peace, whether we can both possess a hydrogen capacity and live in peace."", ""I want to say that I think there are some things that we can do I don't think that there is a war party and a peace party, a party appeasement and a party that desires to be tough with the Russians. I think all Americans, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, share a common desire, to live at peace and protect the security of the United States. [Applause.]"", 'There are several things that I think we can do. First, if we desire to live at peace, with the Russians and the Chinese, the United States must be strong; not ""Strong, if,"" not ""Strong, when,"" not ""Strong enough, but,"" but ""Strong first,"" first in the fight for survival, first in building our defenses. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, I think if we can achieve a level of parity with the Communists, then we will be able to talk about disarmament. Winston Churchill said 10 years ago, ""We arm to parley."" It is impossible for us to provide for the disarmament of outer space, the disarmament of nuclear weapons, unless we are in a position of parity with the Soviet Union.', 'This administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament. I think we can do a better job than that. [Applause.]', 'Third, I think it is essential on the pathway to peace that the United States associate itself with other countries who also desire to live in peace. We cannot protect the security of the free world by ourselves. We have to join with others in NATO, in SEATO, in Latin America, in Africa and Asia, as leaders of the free world, not dominating it but joining it together in a common interest in a desire to be free and independent and live in peace. [Applause.]', 'Fourth, the great struggle in foreign policy in the next decade will not take place in Western Europe, and will not be directly between the Soviet Union and the United States. The great test will be which system travels better, which system solves the problems of the people of Latin America and Africa and Asia. Does our system have freedom or does the Communist system? It is only if the United States demonstrates that it is ready to hold out a helping hand to the countries of Latin America, to Africa and Asia, it is only by that means that we can persuade those people to travel the same road that we are traveling. They stand today on the razoredge of decision. They look to Moscow and Peking and they look to us. I think we must demonstrate sufficient vigor, sufficient friendship for them, that they will follow the road that we follow, the road of peace. [Applause.]', ""And finally, I want to emphasize, and I say this as chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee, that the great hope for peace I think in the 1960's is going to be not only our own strength but also the United Nations. This is a great forum which if given the attention and prestige and support that it needs can serve as a great clearinghouse for peace, not just summit meetings where the Soviet Union and the United States sit down, but the General Assembly of the United Nations, where all nations sit, and will all speak their will, where they share a common aspiration to be free and independent."", 'This is a great country, but I think we can make it a greater country. The great struggle of 1960 is not merely between the Republicans and Democrats. The great struggle, I think, is between those Americans who think we can do better than we are doing, who desire that the United States shall stand as it stood in other years, in the days of Roosevelt and Wilson, as a hope for people around the world, and not as a matter of indifference to them.', 'A Gallup poll taken some months ago in 10 countries around the world, when they were asked which country they thought would be first, militarily and scientifically in 1970, the United States or the Soviet Union, a majority in all those countries said the Soviet Union.', ""What has happened to this country that we have lost our image? They don't quote Lincoln or Jefferson or Roosevelt or Stevenson today. They look to the East. I think they should look to us again.

80,John F. Kennedy ,"September 09, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to Governor Brown for being here. We just concluded a two-day tour in the valley which I think was a most impressive tour, and I think was very helpful in the campaign. We will speak here tonight. I would be delighted to answer any questions that anyone might have.', 'QUESTION. Senator, since the day after your nomination you have been talking about the sacrifices that you will ask of the American people. Can you tell us what sacrifices you have in mind?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think what I have been talking about is a national atmosphere, which does not accept what we are doing now in the United States as good enough. In addition, I think the United States will have to make a bigger effort in the field of national defense than it is generally prepared to make today. Therefore, those are burdens that we will have to assume. There may be other burdens in the 1960's that we will have to assume to maintain our freedom. What I am really concerned about is a question of atmosphere and recognition that the United States can do more than it is doing. I remember a story in a national magazine at the time the President returned from India which reported a discussion in the Cabinet about whether the United States could play a better role in the development of the economy of the Indians, and I think there was a dispute between the Cabinet members and the President as to whether we should, and I think they finally concluded that we could not."", ""I don't accept that view, because I think that those things which must be done can be done by this country. When I talk about a future which is going to be a very testing one, I am talking about the national mood and atmosphere, which takes a broader view of the capacity of the United States to effect events."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, Correspondent Merriman Smith predicted today that you and Mr. Nixon would try to outdo each other in attacking Mr. Khrushchev in his visit. Do you agree that you and Mr. Nixon should agree on a common posture during this period?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't know. I have not talked to Mr. Smith. I am not running against Mr. Khrushchev. I think that I will be talking about foreign policy when Mr. Khrushchev is here, because it is a great issue, not only our relations with the Communist world, but also with the underdeveloped world, so I could not comment on the story because I don't know what the foundation is."", 'QUESTION. Also, today Mr. Harry Truman said this is going to be a very rough campaign. Do you agree?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, he is a vigorous exponent of a very hard-hitting, hard-working Democratic philosophy. I think the campaign is going to be hard-hitting in the sense that we are going to try to bring home what I consider to be a very clear contrast between the record of the Democratic Party and the record of the Republican Party and what I consider to be a very clear contrast in their promise of the future. In that way it is going to be hardhitting, but I don't think it is going to be hardhitting in a personal sense. I have not discussed Mr. Nixon for some days. I am discussing the party difference."", 'QUESTION. Senator, several days ago Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and about 150 Protestant ministers and laymen joined in a statement in which they said, quoting them, that you would be ""under extreme pressure from the hierarchy,"" and I am quoting there, ""of your Church to bring American foreign policy into line with Vatican objectives.""', 'They said that while you have stated you wouldn\'t be influenced by Church pressures, quoting again ""his Church insists that he is duty bound to submit to its direction.""', 'And they also said ""this unresolved conflict leaves doubt in the minds of millions of our citizens.""', 'I am wondering if you would have any comment on this statement and also on the fact that the statement was issued?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I wouldn't respond to Dr. Peale."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy ---', ""Senator KENNEDY. I have made my position very clear on this question. I am a member of my Church and I know my responsibilities as a citizen of the United States and the support of the Constitution. I have been in the Congress for 14 years and have met those responsibilities. I wouldn't attempt to reply to Dr. Peale or to anyone who questions my loyalty to the United States. I am delighted to respond to those who want to ask what my position is. But for those who are not interested in my position and prefer to state it themselves, it really is very difficult to state it by me and give any answer which would satisfy them."", 'QUESTION. Senator, am I correct that you believe Dr. Peale has questioned your loyalty?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would think that he has questioned my ability to fulfill my constitutional oath, because he states I would be unable to fulfill it because my Church would place pressure on me which I would succumb to. I don't accept the view that my Church would place pressure upon me. I don't think there is any evidence of that in the United States. The Constitution is very clear on the separation of church and state. I have been clear and precise in my commitments to that Constitution, not merely because I take the oath which is taken to God, but also because I believe that it represents the happiest arrangement for the organization of a society."", ""Therefore, I believe in that theory strongly, just as strongly as Dr. Peale or anyone else. I don't know what I can do other than state that as my conviction, state that as my record, and state that that is the philosophy which would guide me in the Presidency. Beyond that, then it just becomes a question as to whether in 1960 we are going to carry out the Constitution which says there shall be no religious tests for office, or whether we are going to decide because I was born a Catholic and lived a Catholic that for some reason I am unfit to hold office. That is the question."", 'QUESTION. Senator, when you describe the separation of church and state as the happiest arrangement for good, free society---', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is correct.', 'QUESTION (continued). Did you also mean the wisest and best arrangement?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Yes, I think it is. In many countries in Europe and in tradition there has not been a separation of church and state. They work out their solutions to suit themselves. There isn't in England, in some of the Scandinavian countries, but that does not mean that Americans who happen to be members of those same faiths - and in some countries where Catholics are a majority - that there isn't a separation. Lutherans in the United States believe in separation of church and state, so do Catholics, so do Jews. We have been able to work this out in our society. But why should something be raised when I run for the Presidency? That is what I cannot understand. It wasn't raised when I ran for the House or the Senate. I know that the Presidency has a great influence, but why should I be questioned in my running for the Presidency of the United States."", 'QUESTION. Do you plan to start talking about this in your campaign speeches as you did in West Virginia?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Not unless I am asked.', 'QUESTION. Do you believe that Senator Nixon has rejected the support of religious bigots?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Nixon has been very clear in that regard. I would not disagree with him.', 'QUESTION. Due to the fact that your wife is going to have a baby and you are certain that it is going to be a boy, there are a lot of expectant fathers who would like to know your secret of knowing that it is going to be a boy.', 'Senator KENNEDY. She told me. You would have to ask her. [Laughter.]', 'QUESTION. Senator, in your sacrificing for the welfare of the United States, how do you feel about the draft? How does this fit in?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think it ought to continue at the present time.', 'QUESTION. More or less?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I hope that we would be able to strengthen conventional forces. I think it is possible to secure that strengthening through present draft laws or present mixed and volunteers or draftees, but I don't think it will be possible until the whole weapon technology changes and the needs for conventional forces change."", ""QUESTION. You don't think this weakens the morale of the young men?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. No, I don't at all. The morale would have to be awfully weak, serving in the service, to weaken it still further. I would think that the chance to serve would help morale."", 'QUESTION. Senator, Governor Brown today issued a very optimistic statement because he was so dated at the rally at Oakland last night. Yet the field poll shows Nixon running ahead 49 to 44, subject to the percent undecided, and this is the first time he has led it for three consecutive showings of the poll. Which of these two experts do you believe?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I believe Governor Brown. [Laughter.] I think it is difficult to make a prediction. I have seen another poll in California that showed us doing better than the field poll, but this campaign has some time to go and I would say that any poll today is, based on my experience with polls - whether it showed me ahead or behind - I would not be certain of it. I think we have a good chance in California, but I think it is going to be very close. In fact, I think that a good many of these industrial States are going to be close.', ""QUESTION. Senator, do you plan to discuss Vice President Nixon's record as you go along in this campaign?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes. I think as it illuminates a position which he might take for the future, I think it perhaps would be useful to have his record illuminated, but only as it deals with issues.', ""QUESTION. Senator, when does the moratorium end on Nixon's hospitalization and your ability to attack him?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I said I would not mention him unless I could praise him until he got out of the hospital, and I have not mentioned him. [Laughter.] I am not planning any attack on Mr. Nixon at the present time, unless it happens to come up on an issue dealing with medical care or some other where we have a different viewpoint. I think it would be useful to then try to state the difference between our viewpoints.', 'QUESTION. Is it your intention to avoid personal attack on the Vice President as a Senator throughout the campaign?', 'Senator KENNEDY. My intention is to do so; yes, sir. I hope to do so.', 'QUESTION. Senator, in your speech tonight you say that the Republican administration has failed to take one constructive step toward guaranteeing equal opportunities to Americans. How do you regard the civil rights proposals that they advanced in 1957 and again in 1959?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think they are inadequate. The administration opposed title III in 1957 and in 1960. The voting provisions are useful, but I don't recall that any bill on civil rights came to the floor of the Congress in 1953 and 1954 when the Republicans had control of the Congress and the administration. The President did not support title III in the Senate when it came to a close vote in 1957 and did not support several of the provisions in 1960 other than the voting provision. On the voting provision there was general unanimity. The struggle was over the other measures."", ""Secondly, I don't think that the President has used his executive powers fully in the fight for equal rights and I do not think that this administration has been particularly vigorous in setting a moral atmosphere for the implementation of the Supreme Court decisions."", ""I do not recall an original administration proposal in the field of social welfare in the last 8 years that was not in response to a previous Democratic provision. I would include in that general category the administration provision on aid to the aged. It was not until the Forand bill was put forward and secured wide support that an alternative was proposed. As you will recall, the administration did not give the endorsement to Mr. Javits' bill until a day before it was due to be voted. So I feel that their proposals have been in response, as a compromise, really, to proposals that we have made, and I think that has been true of this century."", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, in developing your line about your new frontier, you have warned your audiences that it might involve sacrifices but you have not specified what those sacrifices might be. Do you intend and could you suggest that it might fall in the line of taxes, or of what sort of sacrifices?', ""Senator KENNEDY. My answer I tried to respond to Mr. Ritter with was I stated in the field of national security I thought the United States would have to make a bigger effort. Now depending on the condition of the economy would depend on what method that bigger effort would be financed. I think that the problem in the winter of 1961 is going to be a deflationary problem and not an inflationary problem, and, therefore, I think it would be a mistake at the present time until we know a little better about what is going to happen next winter to make any predictions on what the appropriate tax level will be. All I am suggesting is that in the 1960's which are going to be a difficult time, I would hope that people will understand that I do not run merely stating what we are going to do, but they should also realize that in a difficult time the United States must make a greater effort. I cannot be more specific than that, because I do not know whether it would be wise or not to finance additional expenditures, and those involving national defenses I cannot predict."", 'QUESTION. You used the word ""deflationary."" Are you suggesting a recession?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; but I do say we are in a plateau, and I am concerned. I hope that we are going to move ahead after the pickup which we should have this fall. But I do say that I am not sufficiently, nor is anybody sufficiently, precise about what the economy is going to do in the winter of 1961 to make a judgment on what the tax situation will be. I will not predict a recession in any sense. But I would say that the matter of economy and employment in 1961 - I think the Department of Labor has put out some figures on unemployment, which is up to about 5.69 percent of our working force. But I would not make a prediction about it.', 'QUESTION. Why was your visit to San Diego scheduled tomorrow? Why was it canceled? Was it on your advice? Was it on the advice of your doctor?', ""Senator KENNEDY. No; it was on my advice. I thought I should take at least 1 day a week off in this campaign. I don't want to have any trouble with my knee, or any other part of my anatomy, so, therefore, except for the breakfast tomorrow morning, we are going to take at least the 1 day off, and, therefore, I thought it best to go to Texas Sunday afternoon. We have been going now about 12,000 miles in the last several days, and in addition I came from 5 or 6 days in the Congress direct."", 'QUESTION. Thank you, Senator.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.']"

82,John F. Kennedy ,"September 11, 1960","['San Diego - perhaps better than any other city in this country - illustrates the failures of the Republican Party - its failure to meet our urgent needs at home, and its failure to maintain our position abroad.', 'For here, as throughout the Nation, there are able-bodied and skilled men - men who can work and want to work - but who are unable to find work. And here - as throughout the Nation - the idleness of these men has meant a decline in American vitality and American strength.', 'For the unemployed in San Diego do not merely represent individual hardship, and poverty, and despair. They also represent a loss to the Nation, a loss of skills, and effort, and a loss of effective and valuable production teams. When these skilled production workers scatter to other jobs and other locations, our national security is the loser.', ""It is paradoxical that at a time when America's relative military strength is declining - when we lack the capacity to airlift more than a single division to trouble spots throughout the world - when we lack the invulnerable retaliatory capacity necessary to insure successful deterrence of growing Soviet strength - when our country faces its greatest military peril since Valley Forge - it is paradoxical and it is tragic that at such a time our aircraft plants are operating at less than full capacity - that expert production teams are being broken up - and that men who have the skills which America needs to rebuild its strength are unable to find jobs."", 'And that strength needs rebuilding. For today a Russian missile, armed with the power to destroy a city, can reach our shores in less than 20 minutes. Today our proud fleet of bombers - the Strategic Air Command - is threatened with destruction before it can even leave the ground. Today our ground forces - our only protection against the threat of limited war - lacks the airlift necessary to bring effective force to the many corners of the world where Communist aggression is a real and immediate threat.', ""And, in the 1960's, our danger will grow greater as the Soviet Union - which already possesses vast and well - trained armies - builds up its lead in missile striking power. It is true that we cannot be sure that America will ever be attacked - that the Russians will ever use their missiles and their armies against us and that those of us who call for a greater defense effort are not taking a chance on making an unnecessary expense."", 'But those who oppose such an effort - those who blandly reassure us that we are already strong enough - are taking a chance on our national survival. And today the only real question is which chance do we take - our money or our survival.', 'To that question there can be only one answer - and that is the answer of the Democratic Party: America must have a military strength second to none - strength which can guarantee survival.', 'The people of the State of California are proud of the contributions they have already made to our national strength - and they are confident of their capacity to maintain and increase that strength. But I know that there is not one person in the State or Nation who would not like to see the arms race ended - the threat of war recede - and the billions now spent on weapons of destruction turned to schools and hospitals and homes and dams. And with imaginative and painstaking planning for reconversion this State would enjoy a greater boom under disarmament than it ever enjoyed in the cold war.', 'For peace is our deepest aspiration. And then peace comes, we will gladly convert - not our swords into plowshares - but our bombs into reactors and our missiles into space vehicles. ""Pursue peace"" - the Bible tells us - and we shall pursue it with all the energy and effort which we possess.', 'But it is an unfortunate fact that we can pursue peace only by remaining strong. We can convince Mr. Khrushchev to bargain seriously for peace only when our strength makes it clear to him that the balance of power is not shifting his way - that were he to start a war it would be a mistake - his mistake. And we cannot convince Mr. Khrushchev by smiling at him - or by exchanging insults - for he is a man who deals in reality - and he will only be convinced of our strength when we are truly strong.', 'That requires only one kind of defense policy - not a policy of ceilings and limitations - not a policy set by narrowminded men in the Budget Bureau - not a policy which places a balanced budget ahead of a balance of power - but a policy which will keep America the strongest country in the world.', 'That is the policy of the Democratic Party - and that is the policy we will begin to pursue this January.', 'San Diego, and all of California, will contribute greatly to those goals. For you build the airlift planes which can remold our Armed Forces into mobile striking units ready to meet aggression wherever it may occur. You build the bombers which can remake our Strategic Air Command into a swift and powerful weapons system, with its planes always in the air, invulnerable to Soviet attack. You build the missiles which will reshape our whole concept of warfare - providing us with the ultimate and impregnable defense we need for peace.', ""I call upon this administration to take prompt action to put the untapped skills of your men, and the unused capacities of your aircraft plants into a new and expanded effort to build our Nation's defenses."", 'America needs San Diego.

Senator Fisher, Congressman-to-be Wencke, Mr. Chairman, our National Vice Chairman, Mrs. Price, my old friend and colleague from the Congress, Clint McKinnon, my sister Pat, my old nurse - she is here [laughter] - ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for having been kind enough to come together on a short notice of 48 hours. I think if we had given you about 2 weeks we could really run a rally down here after a look at this. [Applause.]', 'In coming back, I was going to come yesterday, but I only have one voice left in this campaign, so we decided to come today.', 'This port, this city has been a great launching site for ships, missiles, planes, and you are about to launch me into orbit over Texas later this afternoon. [Laughter.] I come to this city because I think that this State is a key State in the coming election. I think that in many ways the issues are clearer here than they may be in any other part of the United States. I say that because in a very real sense the State of California in the last decade has experienced the same problems which the United States will experience over a period of 50 years, tremendous growth, tremendous economic change, development of your natural resources, the effect of a war economy and a peace economy on this State, the necessity of building new schools, of educating our children here in California, the necessity of meeting the needs of our older citizens, particularly in the field of medical care. I think in a very real sense California has had the problems of the country forced upon them in a concentrated period of time. You have done an extraordinary job under a distinguished Governor, a Democratic legislature, and a Democratic senate. But even the problems that California faces, the problems that my own State of Massachusetts faces, cannot be solved on a State level. They really depend upon national policy.', 'Here in San Diego, which is particularly dependent upon those industries which serve our national defense, you have seen the effect of a governmental policy which I consider to be shortsighted, and that is a policy which takes risks, I believe unnecessarily, with our national security. I think the United States should be second to none. [Applause.] I say it should be second to none both because it provides for our own security and the security of those who look to us for protection, but also it represents the road to peace. If the United States is strong, then the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communists will not feel that the balance of power is moving in their direction but instead will make a determination that while other kinds of competition will go on, they will not be tempted to take a shortcut road to world domination.', 'I think we are going to have to have a stronger national defense. The United States will never attack first. We always have to judge our defenses by what they would look like after the Soviet Union had made the initial attack. Would we have the capacity then to defend ourselves, to retaliate? If we have that capacity, then we have taken not a step toward war, but a step toward peace, and that is our objective. [Applause.]', 'I visited 2 weeks ago the SAC headquarters at Omaha. While I was there the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Seaton, arrived. He was asked if the Vice President ever visited SAC and he said, ""No; the Vice President did not need that kind of briefing, because he was briefed in Washington."" Well, I did need that kind of briefing, and I think it would be valuable to any American whether he is the Vice President of the United States, or whether he is a citizen, to have an opportunity to see there the center point of the great shield of freedom around the world. But from my trip on that occasion and from my information as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it seems to me that there are three areas where the United States should strengthen itself, and I think this city has a particular role to play in that strengthening. If you have unemployment here, it is not only citizens who want a job who can\'t find work; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated. Therefore, I think the United States should make a greater effort in the field of missiles, first; secondly, it should do a greater job and a better job in the field of developing an airlift capacity - nearly all the planes that took the U.N. forces to the Congo were American planes, but most of them were planes which are becoming obsolete and they contrasted in some cases to the jets which the Russians and the British used for transportation of U.N. personnel - and thirdly, I think that we should strengthen our retaliatory capacity, the traditional manned bomber, unless the United States is prepared to give up the lead in this vital form of national defense and national security.', 'I talk about a matter which is not a pleasant matter, but I think the President of the United States, who has many responsibilities, also has the responsibility of being Commander in Chief. He must under his oath of office provide for the common defense. One of the areas is in the field of national security. I think we can do more, and having known, we can do more, I think we should not do less.', ""This city has a great future and a great role to play. This election will be decided on many issues. Which candidate and which party can provide for our security, can give vigor to our foreign policy, and provide a shine and a fresh force to our image as a friend of freedom around the world, meet the problems of economic growth, developing our natural resources, educating our children, caring for the aged. In that contest on those issues I don't think there is a contest. The Democratic record and history is one that I think the American people will endorse in the election of 1960. [Applause.]"", 'I hope that the incumbent Congressman, Mr. Wilson, and I hope the one who is going to be the Congressman, will debate these issues. I think it will be illuminating. The Vice President and I shall do so on several occasions. But even aside from the debate, the records of the parties are written on the statute books of the United States, on the bills that become law, on the bills that the Republicans prevented from becoming law. I am coming back here to San Diego, but I ask your help in the intervening period to carry our message that the future is unlimited for the United States, and that the help of all citizens is needed. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
84,John F. Kennedy ,"September 11, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Fisher, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to express my thanks to all of you for taking Sunday off and coming to the airport to greet us. This is the beginning of this campaign in the State of California, and across the Nation. I think here in California in this community of San Diego, I think we can win the presidential election with your support. [Applause.]', 'The basic issue which separates the Republicans and Democrats is this campaign is whether we are doing as well as we can do. We hold the view that while this is a great country, we can do better; while this is a great State, we can do better; while this is a powerful country, it can be stronger. And I think here in San Diego, which has been one of the boiler points for the building of American strength and American force and American vitality, I think here in San Diego we can lead the Democratic tide.

You remember the very old story about a citizen of Boston who heard a Texan talking about the glories of Bowie, Travis, Crockett, and all the rest, and finally said, ""Haven\'t you heard of Paul Revere?"" The Texan said, ""Well, he is the man who ran for help."" [Laughter.]', 'I am down here in Texas running for help. [Applause.] And I must say we are getting it. [Applause.] Lyndon was up in Massachusetts last week and they turned out 10,000 people. I never got more than 1,000. Today we had 30,000 people in San Antonio, and he said he had never done that well. So I think in spite of all the people who have been burying the Democratic Party as a national party, it is still strong, in Texas and in Massachusetts and across the country. [Applause.]', ""I am delighted to be in this city named after a great Texan and a great American. Some years ago when I was out of the Senate for nearly a year, I wrote a book on eight Senators who I thought had shown unusual courage in serving not their private interest but the public interest. One of those Senators was the Senator from Texas, Senator Sam Houston. I did not select Senator Houston because of his bravery at the Battle of San Jacinto. I selected Senator Houston because in the 1850's, in the days before the Civil War, he had fought for the closer ties between Texas and the Union, in spite of the strong wave that was sweeping across Texas in support of the Confederacy. I did not make a judgment as to whether Senator Houston was right or wrong, but I did make a judgment that he demonstrated the kind of service to what he thought was right that I thought entitled him to a place of honor as a Senator of the United States, as well as a Senator from Texas. [Applause.]"", ""It has been that kind of spirit - from my own State of Massachusetts, Senator Webster, Senator Clay of Kentucky, and the others, who stood powerfully for this country as a united party. I don't think that it is any inaccuracy that before this country broke up in 1861 the Democratic Party first broken up in Charleston, S.C., in 1860. I am a great believer in a national Democratic Party which includes in it [applause] - a Vice President from Texas and a President from Massachusetts [applause] - or I am happy to say in 1956 when the State of Texas under the leadership of Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson was generous enough to reach across the country and support me for the office of Vice President of the United States. [Applause.]"", ""I was impressed by what Sam Rayburn said. I don't think there is any man in this century who has written more significant legislation of benefit to the people than Speaker Rayburn. He does it. He secures the support of the Members of the House of Representatives from all States of the Union. He secures the undeviating loyalty of the majority leader from Massachusetts, John McCormack, his strong right arm, because they know that he speaks not only for Bonham, Tex.; he speaks for the United States. [Applause.] And Lyndon Johnson, unanimously chosen on three different occasions by every Senator of the United States in the Democratic Party to be the majority leader, was chosen because he was not only a Senator from Texas, but a Senator of the United States."", 'I come today as a candidate for the office of the Presidency, who lives in Massachusetts, who is a Senator from Massachusetts, but who runs as a candidate for a united national Democratic Party. [Applause.] I know no North and South, East or West. I believe in a party which stretches from Texas to Maine, from Florida to Washington, which stretches all the way across the country, representing all groups, speaking for the people. That is the kind of party which I believe in and that is the kind of party which can lead this country. [Applause.]', 'Texas has sent two distinguished Senators, Ralph Yarborough, with whom I sit on the Labor Committee [applause] and 21 Democrats out of the 22 that represent the State of Texas. Can you tell me any reason why Texas should not elect a Democratic Governor, 21 Democratic Congressmen, 2 Democratic Senators, a Lieutenant Governor and an attorney general, and then turn around and reverse the whole procedure and elect a Republican President?\n(Response from the floor.)', ""James Madison and John Quincy Adams and Benjamin Franklin wrote sufficient checks and balances into the American constitutional system without adding another one of a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. Everyone who wants to stand still, everyone who wants to look back, everyone who feels that everything that could be done has been done, that the best government is that which does not govern, they should vote for a system like that. But we think differently. We want to move ahead. We want to serve the great Republic. [Applause.] This is not a contest between Vice President Nixon and myself, between Henry Cabot Lodge and Lyndon Johnson. This is a contest between two great parties and the character and quality growing out of those two parties is written in the history books of the United States. It is written in the political slogans which they have carried in their campaigns. Listen to the Republican ones in this century, to stand pat with McKinley, to keep cool with Coolidge, to return to normalcy with Harding, a chicken in every pot with Herbert Hoover. Had enough, and no new starts. Look at the Democratic slogans of which we are proud. Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom; Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal; Harry Truman's Fair Deal.

This is a most dangerous and hazardous time for us all, because what we do here, the kind of record we make in the United States the kind of vitality and leadership which we shown in our own country and around the world really can affect greatly the survival or the destruction of the cause of freedom. When the United States moves ahead at one-third of the rate of economic growth of the Soviet Union, when we graduate one-half as many scientists or engineers, when we find billions of dollars of food rotting in surplus cellars while hundreds of millions of people go hungry, when we see the Communists spreading their influence in Cuba, the Congo, and Laos, then it is not merely our people who suffer or our country; it is the cause of freedom. Thomas Paine said it in the Revolution of 1776. ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. I think it is our obligation. [Applause.] It is our obligation and our privilege to be the defenders of the gate in a time of maximum danger, to be the only hope for freedom. If we fail, all fail. If we succeed, all succeed. Has any people since the time of ancient Athens ever had a comparable opportunity, a comparable responsibility? I ask your help in this election. On behalf of the election of a Democratic administration which has the greatest possible faith in this country, which chief argument with the Republicans has been that they lack faith, that they have in the Prophet Isaiah, look backward that they have not grasped the future, realized the potential of this country, that they have not been willing as Franklin Roosevelt was, to look the future in the face and set before the American people the unfinished business of our society. We ask your help in this election. We do not promise that we can do everything overnight, but we do promise that if we are successful, this country will being to move again. In 1789 in Hartford, Conn., the skies at noon turned one day from blue to gray, and by midafternoon the city had darkened over so that in that religious age men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session, and many of the members clamored for an immediate adjournment. The speaker of the house, one Colonel Davenport, came to his feet, and he silenced the din with these words: ""The Day of Judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles be brought.""

From Houston's Rice Hotel, Senator John Kennedy is about to address a special meeting of the Greater Houston Ministerial Association to which he has been invited. During this telecast, Senator Kennedy will participate in an informal question and answer period. The telecast of this meeting is sponsored by the Kennedy-Johnson Texas Campaign Committee, and is being seen throughout Texas on a special 22-station network. The audience you are seeing is composed of clergymen of the Houston area who have been invited by the association."", 'Rev. Herbert Meza will introduce the Democratic presidential candidate. The meeting is about to be called to order by the president, Rev. George Reck.', 'Mr. RECK. May I call this special meeting of the Association of Ministers of Greater Houston to order. Let us stand for prayer.', 'God be merciful unto us and bless us and cause His face to shine upon us, that Thy way may be known upon earth. Thy saving health among all nations. God shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall praise Him. With these words of the psalmist, we stand before Thee, O God, as our only Sovereign Lord. Forgive us, Good Lord, and show us Thy mercy. Let Thy grace rest upon our Nation and do not take our Gospel life from us, incline our ears to Thee and to Thy will and show us always the truth that makes and keeps men free, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray, amen.', 'We are very happy that so many of you ministers are present at this meeting. The treasurer of our association, Pastor E. S. Harrison, has wondered to me if some of you would not like to pay your dues for this time, this year which begins with September. I am sure that he will be in the lobby after this session, ready to shake your hands. [Laughter.]', 'We are very happy to see so many of you ministers present, and we want this to be a true meeting of the association, under the policy of your executive committee this year, we wish to have as guests for regular and special meetings as many personalities of note and reputation as possible. The purpose, of course, is to provide not only a good program, but to give knowledge and enlightenment to the spiritual leaders of our community. Thus, a similar invitation was extended by the association to Mr. Nixon. Please understand that this is not a political rally. This is a meeting of the association of ministers, and we rely upon your sense for good order, proper respect for the nominee to the highest office of our land, and good Christian behavior generally.', 'Our little mouse has grown into a lion of significance. This has not been our original intention, but things happen these ways. Nevertheless, the atmosphere will be informal here, an informal gathering of ministers, and may such atmosphere be maintained.', 'May I speak a welcome to all of you. I recognize at this time the Reverend Herbert Meza, vice president of the association, and our program chairman.', 'Mr. MEZA. This program this evening does not constitute an endorsement of either the speaker or the party which he represents. The program has been motivated by the religious issues in this campaign, issues that are not modern. There are some who insist that nothing has changed within the Roman Catholic Church and there are others who insist that nothing should change. The problem is not to deny the religious issue or to brand as intolerant those who raise it. The problem is to place it in proper perspective and to determine where the candidate stands in relationship to that perspective. The extremists on both sides have tended to dominate the debate.', 'Contrary to common propaganda, the South is not a hotbed of religious or racial intolerance. There are many honest minds that are raising honest questions. Many Catholics differ with us on many questions that are relevant to the welfare of our country.', 'The fact that the Senator is with us is to concede that a religious issue does exist. It is because that there are many serious minds decently raising questions that we have invited the speaker of the evening, and it is for that same reason that we have allowed this meeting to be broadcast to that end.', 'I should like to introduce, at this time, the Senator from Massachusetts and the candidate for President of the United States, Senator John F. Kennedy.', ""Senator KENNEDY. Reverend Meza, Reverend Reck, I'm grateful for your generous invitation to speak my views."", 'While the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight, I want to emphasize from the outset that we have far more critical issues to face in the 1960 election; the spread of Communist influence, until it now festers 90 miles off the coast of Florida - the humiliating treatment of our President and Vice President by those who no longer respect our power - the hungry children I saw in West Virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctor bills, the families forced to give up their farms - an America with too many slums, with too few schools, and too late to the moon and outer space.', 'These are the real issues which should decide this campaign. And they are not religious issues - for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barriers.', 'But because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected President, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured - perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this. So it is apparently necessary for me to state once again - not what kind of church I believe in, for that should be important only to me - but what kind of America I believe in.', 'I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute - where no Catholic prelate would tell the President (should he be Catholic) how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote - where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference - and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him.', 'I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish - where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source - where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials - and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.', ""For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been, and may someday be again, a Jew - or a Quaker - or a Unitarian - or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's statute of religious freedom. Today I may be the victim - but tomorrow it may be you - until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national peril."", 'Finally, I believe in an America where religious intolerance will someday end - where all men and all churches are treated as equal - where every man has the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice - where there is no Catholic vote, no anti-Catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind - and where Catholics, Protestants and Jews, at both the lay and pastoral level, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the American ideal of brotherhood.', 'That is the kind of America in which I believe. And it represents the kind of Presidency in which I believe - a great office that must neither be humbled by making it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding its occupancy from the members of any one religious group. I believe in a President whose religious views are his own private affair, neither imposed by him upon the Nation or imposed by the Nation upon him as a condition to holding that office.', ""I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the first amendment's guarantees of religious liberty. Nor would, our system of checks and balances permit him to do so - and neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test - even by indirection - for it. If they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly working to repeal it."", 'I want a Chief Executive whose public acts are responsible to all groups and obligated to none - who can attend any ceremony, service, or dinner his office may appropriately require of him - and whose fulfillment of his Presidential oath is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath, ritual, or obligation.', 'This is the kind of America I believe in - and this is the kind I fought for in the South Pacific, and the kind my brother died for in Europe. No one suggested then that we might have a ""divided loyalty,"" that we did ""not believe in liberty"" or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the ""freedoms for which our forefathers died.""', 'And in fact this is the kind of America for which our forefathers died - when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches - when they fought for the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom - and when they fought at the shrine I visited today, the Alamo. For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died McCafferty and Bailey and Carey - but no one knows whether they were Catholics or not. For there was no religious test at the Alamo.', 'I ask you tonight to follow in that tradition - to judge me on the basis of my record of 14 years in Congress - on my declared stands against an Ambassador to the Vatican, against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools, and against any boycott of the public schools (which I have attended myself) - instead of judging me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of Catholic church leaders, usually in other countries, frequently in other centuries, and always omitting, of course, the statement of the American Bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed church-state separation, and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every American Catholic.', 'I do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts - why should you? But let me say, with respect to other countries, that I am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group, Catholic or Protestant, to compel, prohibit, or persecute the free exercise of any other religion. And I hope that you and I condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their Presidency to Protestants and those which deny it to Catholics. And rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ, I would cite the record of the Catholic Church in such nations as Ireland and France - and the independence of such statesmen as Adenauer and De Gaulle.', ""But let me stress again that these are my views - for, contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters - and the Church does not speak for me."", 'Whatever issue may come before me as President - in birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject - I will make my decision in accordance with these views, in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressures or dictates. And no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise.', 'But if the time should ever come - and I do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible - when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then I would resign the office; and I hope any conscientious public servant would do the same.', 'But I do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either Catholic or Protestant faith - nor do I intend to disavow either my views or my Church in order to win this election.', 'If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole Nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.', 'But if, on the other hand, I should win the election, then I shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency - practically identical, I might add, to the oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress. For, without reservation, I can ""solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution * * * so help me God.""']"
87,John F. Kennedy ,"September 12, 1960","['Mr. MEZA. Due to the press of time we should begin immediately with the question and answer period. You know the ground rules; are there any questions?', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Glenn Norman, Pastor of Second Baptist Church in Corpus Christi. I think I speak for many that do not in any sense discount or in any sense discount your loyalty and your love to this Nation, or your position, which is in accord with your position, in regard to the separation of church and state. But can I bring it down to where we stand tonight, as two men nearly equal in age, facing each other. If this meeting tonight were held in the sanctuary of my church, it is the policy of my city, that has many fine Catholics in it, it is the policy of the Catholic leadership to forbid them to attend a Protestant service. If we tonight were in the sanctuary of my church, as we are, could you and would you attend, as you have here?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes; I could. As I said in my statement, I would attend any service in the interest - that has any connection with my public office, or, in the case of a private ceremony, weddings, funerals and so on, of course I would participate and have participated. I think the only question would be whether I could participate as a participant, a believer in your faith, and maintain my membership in my church. That, it seems to me, comes within the private beliefs that a Catholic might have. But as far as whether I could attend this sort of a function in your church, whether I as Senator or President could attend a function in your service connected with my position of office, then I could attend and would attend.', 'QUESTION. Closely allied to it was the position with regard to the Chapel of the Chaplains that was dedicated and which I believe you once had accepted the invitation to attend, and then the press said, I believe, that Cardinal Dougherty brought pressure and you refused to attend.', ""Senator KENNEDY. I will be delighted to explain. That seems to be a matter of great interest. I was invited in 1947, after my election to the Congress, by Dr. Poling to attend a dinner to raise funds for an interfaith chapel in honor of the four chaplains that went down on the Dorchester, 14 years ago. I was delighted to accept, because I thought it was a useful and worthwhile cause. A few days before I was due to accept, I learned through my administrative assistant, who had friends in Philadelphia - well, first, two things, first that I was listed, and this is in Dr. Poling's book which he describes the incident, as the spokesman for the Catholic faith at the dinner. Charles Taft, Senator Taft's brother, was to be the spokesman for the Protestant faith, and Senator Lehman for the Jewish faith. The second thing I learned was that the chapel, instead of being located as I thought it was as an interfaith chapel, was located in the basement of another church. It was not in that sense an interfaith chapel, and for the 14 years since that chapel was built there has never been a service of my church because of the physical location. I, therefore, informed Dr. Poling that while I would be glad to come as a citizen, in fact, many Catholics did go to the dinner, I did not feel I had very good credentials to attend as the spokesman for the Catholic faith at that dinner to raise funds when the whole Catholic church group in Philadelphia was not participating and because the chapel has never been blessed or consecrated."", 'I want to make it clear that my grounds for not going were private. I had no credentials to speak for the Catholic faith at a dinner for a chapel in which no Catholic service has ever been held. To this day, unfortunately, no service has been at the present time. But I think if I may separate this, if this were a public matter, I would be glad to go as an individual; but I could not go as a spokesman.', 'QUESTION. I am Canon Rutenbahr of Christ Church, Houston. I have read the platform and the planks in it with great interest, specially in the realms of freedom, and I note that in the educational section the right of education for each person is guaranteed or offered for a guarantee, and it also says that there shall be equal opportunity for employment, and in another section it says there shall be equal rights to housing and recreation. All of these speak, I think, in a wonderful sense to the freedom that we want to keep here in America. Yet, on the other hand, there is in another place in the platform these words: ""We will repeal the authorization for right-to-work laws.""', ""Now, it seems to me that in this aspect here, and I feel that these are much more important than any religious issue - here you are abolishing an open shop, you are taking away the freedom of the individual worker, whether he wants to work and wants to belong to this union or not. Isn't this double talk, guaranteeing freedom on one hand and taking away on the other?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. No, I don't agree with that."", 'QUESTION. I think there is an economy--', ""Senator KENNEDY. That provision has been in the platform since 1948, and I am sure there is a difference of opinion between us on that matter, and between many Democrats on that matter. But I think that it is a decision which goes to the economic and political views. I don't think it involves a constitutional guarantee of freedom. In other words, under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley law, a State was permitted to prohibit a union shop. But it was not permitted to guarantee a closed shop. My own judgment is that uniformity in interstate commerce is valuable, and, therefore, I hold with the view that it is better to have uniform laws and not a law which is in interstate commerce - and this is not intrastate but interstate commerce - which permits one condition in one State and another in another. This is not a new provision. It has been in for the last three platforms."", 'QUESTION. I am Max Dalcke, president of the Gulf Coast Bible College, and pastor of the First Church of God here in Houston, and I am a member of the Houston Association of Ministers.', 'Mr. Kennedy, you very clearly stated your position tonight in regard to the propagation of the gospel by all religious groups in other countries. I appreciated that much because we Protestants are a missionary people. However, the question I have to ask is this: If you are elected President, will you use your influence to get the Roman Catholic countries of South America and Spain to stop persecuting Protestant missionaries and to propagate their faith as the United States gives to the Roman Catholics or any other group?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would use my influence as President of the United States to permit, to encourage the development of freedom all over the world. One of the rights which I consider to be important is the right of free speech, the right of assembly, the right of free religious practice, and I would hope that the United States and the President would stand for those rights all around the globe without regard to geography, religion or--- [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, this is F. H. Westmoreland, president of the South Bay Baptist Church, Houston. I have received today a copy of a resolution passed by the Baptist Pastors Conference of St. Louis, and they are going to confront you with this tomorrow night. I would like you to answer to the Houston crowd before you get to St. Louis. This is the resolution:', ""\n  With deep sincerity and in Christian grace, we plead with Senator John F. Kennedy as the person presently concerned in this matter to appeal to Cardinal Cushing, Mr. Kennedy's own hierarchical superior in Boston, to present to the Vatican Senator Kennedy's statement relative to the separation of church and state in the United States and religious freedom as separated in the Constitution of the United States, in order that the Vatican may officially authorize such a belief for all Roman Catholics in the United States.\n"", '[Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. May I just say that as I do not accept the right of any, as I said, ecclesiastical official, to tell me what I shall do in the sphere of my public responsibility as an elected official, I do not propose also to ask Cardinal Cushing to ask the Vatican to take some action. I do not propose to interfere with their free right to do exactly what they want. There is no doubt in my mind that the viewpoints that I have expressed - [applause] - there is no doubt in my mind that the viewpoint that I have expressed tonight publicly represents the opinion of the overwhelming majority of American Catholics, and I think that my view I have no doubt is known to Catholics around the world. So I am just hopeful that by my stating it quite precisely, and I believe I stated it in the tradition of the American Catholics, away back all the way to Bishop John Carroll, I hope this will clarify it without my having to take the rather circuitous route. This is the position I take with the American Catholic Church in the United States with which I am associated.', 'QUESTION. We appreciate your forthright statement. May I say we have great admiration for you. But until we know this is the position of your church, because there will be many Catholics who will be appointed if you are elected President, we would like to know that they, too, are free to make such statements as you have been so courageous to make. [Applause.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. Let me say that anyone that I would appoint to my office as a Senator or as a President, would, I hope, hold the same view, of necessity, of their living up to not only the letter of the Constitution but the spirit. If I may say so, I am a Catholic. I have stated my view very clearly. I don't find any difficulty in stating that view. In my judgment, it is the view of American Catholics from one end of the country to the other. Because I can state it in a way which I hope is satisfactory to you, why do you possibly doubt that I think that I represent a viewpoint which is hostile to the Catholic Church in the United States. I believe I am stating the viewpoint that Catholics in this country hold to the happy relationship which exists between church and state."", 'QUESTION. Do you state it with the approval of the Vatican?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't have to have approval in that sense. [Applause.] I have not submitted my statement before I read it to the Vatican. I did not submit it to Cardinal Cushing. But my judgment is that Cardinal Cushing, who is the Cardinal of the diocese of which I am a member, would approve of this statement, in the same way that he approved of the 1948 statement of the Bishop. In my judgment, and I am not a student of theology, I am stating what I believe to be the position of my personal position and also the position of the great majority of Catholics across the United States. I hope that other countries may some day enjoy the same happy relationship of a separation of church and state, whether they are in Catholic countries or non-Catholic countries. It seems to me that I am the one that is running for the office of the Presidency and not Cardinal Cushing and not anyone else. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am K. O. White, pastor of Houston\'s Downtown First Baptist Church and former pastor of Metropolitan Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. Let me return for a moment to the matter of the Chaplain\'s Chapel because there will be some questions raised, I am sure, and we would like to have just a little further statement from you. Today I had a telephone conversation with Dr. Poling and received this telegram from him. I am sure you would like to clear this matter up. Let me read briefly from his telegram: ""The Memorandum on Religion as an Election Issue,"" prepared by Senator Kennedy\'s associates has a section on the Poling incident. This section contains serious factual errors. I believe the Senator will wish to correct the errors or he will wish to withdraw that section. The original draft of the program on the interfaith dinner held in the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, on December 15, 1947, identified Mr. Kennedy, then Congressman from Massachusetts, as Hon. John F. Kennedy, Congressman from Massachusetts. Mr. Kennedy was never invited as an official representative of a religious organization nor indeed as the spokesman for the Catholic faith. No speaker on that occasion, Catholic, Jew, or Protestant, was identified by his faith. When 2 days before the dinner occasion Mr. Kennedy canceled his engagement, expressed his regret and stated that since his Eminence, the Cardinal, requested him not to come, he as a loyal son of the church had no other alternative. Therefore, it was necessary to destroy this first program and reprint it.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I will state again that the words I used are a quotation from the Rev. Poling\'s book, ""Spokesman for the Catholic Faith,"" a book produced about a year ago which first discussed this incident.', ""Secondly, my memory of the incident is quite clear in fact as good as Rev. Poling's. When the matter was first discussed he stated it took place in 1950 and it is only in the last 2 months that it came forward that the incident took place in 1947. I never discussed the matter with the Cardinal in my life. I first learned of this through Mr. Reardon, my administrative assistant, through Mr. Doyle of the Catholic Welfare Council, who stated that there was a good deal of concern among many of the church people in Philadelphia, because of the location of the chapel and because no service would ever be held in it because it was located in the basement of another church. It was an entirely different situation than the one I had confronted when I first happily accepted. There were three speakers. Kennedy was one of them, Taft was the second, and Senator Lehman was the third. I don't think I misstated that one was supposed to speak for the Catholic faith, as a spokesman, Mr. Poling, one for the Protestant faith, and one for the Catholic faith, and one for the Jewish faith, I was glad to accept the invitation. I did not clear the invitation with anyone. It was only when I was informed that I was speaking, and I was invited obviously as a serviceman because I came from a prominent Catholic family, that I was informed that I was there really in a sense without any credentials. The chapel as I said has never had a Catholic service. It is not an interfaith chapel. Therefore, for me to participate as a spokesman in that sense for the Catholic faith I think would have given an erroneous impression. I have been there 14 years. This took place in 1947. I had been in politics probably 2 months and was relatively inexperienced. I should have inquired before getting into the incident. Is this the best that can be done after 14 years? Is this the only incident that can be charged? [Applause.]"", ""This was a private dinner, not a public dinner, which did not involve my responsibilities as a public official. My judgment was bad only in accepting it without having all the facts, which I wouldn't have done at a later date. But I do want to say I have been there for 14 years. I have voted on hundreds of matters, probably thousands of matters, which involve all kinds of public questions, some of which border on the relationship between church and state. Quite obviously that record must be reasonably good or we wouldn't keep hearing about the Poling incident."", ""I don't mean to be disrespectful to Reverend Poling. I have a high regard for Dr. Poling. I don't mean to be in a debate about it. But I must say in looking back I think it was imprudent of me in accepting it, but I don't think it shows unfitness for holding public office."", 'QUESTION. The reason we are concerned is the fact that your church has stated that it has the right, the privilege, and responsibility to direct its members in various areas of life, including the political realm. We believe that history and observation indicate that it has done so. We raise the question because we would like to know if you are elected President and your church elects to use that privilege and obligation, what your response will be under those circumstances.', 'Senator KENNEDY. If my church attempted to influence me in a way which was improper or which affected adversely my responsibilities as a public servant, sworn to uphold the Constitution, then I would reply to them that this was an improper action on their part, that it was one to which I could not subscribe, that I was opposed to it, and that it would be an unfortunate breach, an interference, with the American political system.', 'I am confident that there would be no such interference. We have had two Chief Justices of the Supreme Court who were Catholics. We have had two Prime Ministers of Canada who were Catholics. I mentioned De Gaulle and Adenauer. I have already mentioned that [inaudible] as exposed to the pressures which whirl around us, that he will be extremely diligent in his protection of the constitutional separation.', 'QUESTION. We would be most happy to have such a statement from the Vatican.', ""Mr. MEZA. Because of the briefness of the time, let's cut out the applause."", 'QUESTION. B. E. Howard, minister of the Church of Christ. First of all I should like to quote some authoritative quotations from Catholic sources and then propose a question. ""So that a false statement knowingly made to one who has not a right to the truth will not be a lie."" Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 10, page 696. ""However, we are also under an obligation to keep secrets faithfully and sometimes the easiest way of fulfilling duty is to say that is false or tell a lie."" Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 10, page 195. ""When mental reservation is permissible, it is lawful to corroborate one\'s utterances by an oath if there be an adequate cause."" Article on perjury, Catholic Encyclopedia, volume 11, page 696. ""The truth we proclaim under oath is relative and not absolute."" ""Explanation of Catholic Morale,"" page 130.', 'Just recently from the Vatican in Rome this news release was given from the official Vatican newspaper, and I am quoting that of May 19, 1960, Thursday. Stated that the Roman Catholic hierarchy had the right and duty to intervene in the political field to guide its philosophy. The newspaper rejected what is termed the absurd split of conscience between the believer and the citizen. However, Observatore Romano made it clear that its stern pronouncement was valid for Roman Catholic laymen everywhere. It deplored the great confusion of ideas that is spreading especially between Catholic doctrine and social and political activities and between the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the late faithful in the civil field. Pope John recently gave this statement according to the St. Louis Review, dated December 12, 1958: ""Catholics may unite their strength toward the common aid of the Catholic""--', 'FROM THE FLOOR. I object to this. The time is running out.', 'QUESTION. This is the question: Do you subscribe to the doctrine of mental reservation which I have quoted from the Catholic authorities? Do you submit to the authority of the present Pope which I have quoted from these quotations?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Let me say in the first place I have not read the Catholic Encyclopedia and I don't know all the quotation you are giving me. I don't agree with the statement. I find no difficulty in saying so. But I do think probably I could make a better comment if I had the entire quotation before me."", ""But in any case I have not read it before. If the quotation is meant to imply that when you take an oath you don't mean it or it is proper for you to make oaths and then break them, it is proper for you to lie, if that is what this states, and I don't know whether that is what it states unless I read it all in context, then, of course, I would not agree with it."", ""Secondly, on the question of the Observatore Romano article, once again I don't have that in full. I read the statement of last December which was directed to a situation in Sicily where one of the Catholics were active in the Communist Party. But I am not familiar with the one of May 1960 which you mentioned. In any case the Observatore Romano has no standing, so far as binding me. Thirdly, the quotation of Pope John of 1958, I didn't catch all of that, and if you will read that again I will tell you whether I support that or not."", 'QUESTION. Pope John XXIII only recently stated according to the St. Louis Review, date of December 12, 1958, ""Catholics must unite their strength toward the common aid and the Catholic hierarchy has the right and duty of guiding them."" Do you subscribe to that?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I could not describe - guiding them in what area? You are talking about in the area of faith and morals, in the constructions of the church. I would think any Baptist minister or Congregational minister has the right and duty to try and guide his flock. If you mean by that statement that the Pope or anyone else could bind me in the fulfillment, by a statement in the fulfillment, of my public duties, I say no. If that statement is intended to mean, and it is very difficult to comment on a sentence taken out of an article which I have not read, but if that is intended to imply that the hierarchy has some obligation or has an obligation to attempt to guide the members of the Catholic Church, then that may be proper. But it all depends on the previous language of what you mean by ""guide."" If you mean direct or instruct on matters dealing with the organization of the faith, the details of the faith, then, of course, they have that obligation. If you mean under that he could guide me or anyone could guide or direct me in fulfilling my public duty, then I do not agree.', 'QUESTION. Thank you, sir. Then you do not agree with the Pope in that statement?', 'Senator KENNEDY. You see, that is why I wanted to be careful, because that statement, it seems to me, is taking out of context what you just made to me. I could not tell you what the Pope meant unless I had the entire article. I would be glad to state to you that no one can direct me in the fulfillment of my duties as a public official under the U.S. Constitution. That I am directed to do to the people of the United States, sworn to do, took an oath to God. That is my flat statement. I would not want to go into details on a sentence which you read to me which I may not understand completely.', 'Mr. MEZA. Gentlemen, we have time for one more question, if it can be handled briefly.', 'QUESTION. I am Robert McLaren, from the Westminster Presbyterian Church, Houston. You have been quite clear and I think laudably so on the matter of separation of church and state and have answered my questions that have come up around it. There is one question, it seems to me, that is quite relevant. This relates to your statement that if you found by some remote possibility a real conflict between your office as President, that you would resign that office if it were in conflict with your church.', 'Senator KENNEDY. No, I said with my conscience.', 'QUESTION. In the solace of errors of Pope Leo XIX, which the Catholic Encyclopedia states is still binding, although from a different century, still binding on all Catholics, there are three specific things which are denounced including the separation of state and church, the freedom of religions other than Catholic to propagate themselves, and the freedom of conscience. Do you still feel these being binding on you, that you hold your oath of office above your allegiance to the Pope on these issues.', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, let us go through the issues because I don't think there is a conflict on these three issues. The first issue as I understand it was on the relationship between the Catholics and the state and other faiths."", 'QUESTION. No, the separation of church and state, explicitly--', 'Senator KENNEDY. I support that, and in my judgment the American Bishops statement of 1948 clearly supported it. That in my judgment is the view held by Catholics in this country. They support the constitutional separation of church and state and are not in error in that regard.', 'QUESTION. The second was the right of religions other than the Roman Catholic to propagate themselves.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think they should be permitted to propagate themselves, any faith, without any limitation by the power of the state, or encouragement by the power of the state. What is the third one?', 'QUESTION. The third was the freedom of conscience in matters of religion, and also in point 46, I believe it is, it extends to freedom of mind in the realms of science.', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I believe in freedom of conscience. Let me just - I guess our time is coming to an end, but let me say finally that I am delighted to come here today. I don't want anyone to think because they interrogate me on this very important question, that I regard that as unfair questioning or unreasonable or somebody who is concerned about the matter is prejudiced or bigoted. I think this fight for religious freedom is basic in the establishment of the American system, and therefore any candidate for the office, I think, should submit himself to the questions of any reasonable man. [Applause.]"", ""My only objection would be - my only limit to that would be if somebody said regardless of Senator Kennedy's position, regardless of how much evidence he has given that what he says he means, I still would not vote for him because he is a member of that church I would consider that unreasonable. What I would consider to be reasonable in an exercise of free will and free choice is to ask the candidate to state his views as broadly as possible, investigate his record to see whether what he states he believes and then to make an independent rational judgment, as to whether he could be entrusted with this highly important position. I want you to know that I am grateful to you for inviting me tonight. I am sure I have made no converts to my church. [Laughter.] But I do hope that at least my view, which I believe to be the view of my fellow Catholics, who hold office, I hope it may be of some value in at least assisting you to make a careful judgment. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

When the Texans died for Texan independence, there were not only native born Texans in the Alamo; there were not only citizens of Tennessee and North Carolina, but there was a citizen from Massachusetts, William Lynn, who came here to shed his blood with the other people in the Alamo. [Applause]. And it is a source of pride to me that my friend, Vivian Scribner, who served with me on a PT boat, who I have not seen since 1944, drove up the Rio Grande Valley 250 miles to be with us on this platform. [Applause.] And Bert Thompson, from your own city of San Antonio, I am delighted to be here today.', ""It is also a source of satisfaction to me that when my brother's plane was lost, his copilot was Lieutenant Willey from Fort Worth, Tex."", ""I come here today in a campaign for the office of the Presidency. I don't run for the office of the Presidency in this difficult and dangerous period saying that if I am going to be elected that life will be easy and the problems of Texas and the United States will be solved. Lyndon Johnson and I run for the office of President and Vice President recognizing that this is a difficult and trying time for us all, that it calls for the best in the American Republic, the best spirit, the best determination, the feeling that the future can belong to us, that the Republicans have been willing to stand still, but that we have the greatest possible confidence in the future of our country, in the future of the American people. [Applause.] If we are elected, we are going to build an American security and an American defense second to none. [Applause] If we are elected, every American, man or woman, who seeks to work will find it in a growing and expanding economy. [Applause.] And if we are elected, every American, regardless of his race or his creed or his color will be given his full constitutional rights. [Applause.]"", 'We honor the independence of Texas today, but it is a fact that 150 years ago this week, Father Hidalgo in Mexico raised his famous plea, ""Will you have freedom?"" And the people of Mexico responded. They are responding today. They are responding today all over Latin America. Seven years ago there were 15 strong men in Latin America dominating the life of their countries. Today there are only five. Three years from now there won\'t be any. Latin America will be free. [Applause.]', ""But the fact of the matter is that while the people of Latin America upon whom our security depends, just as upon our freedom their security depends, have turned increasingly away from the good neighbor policy which once was a source of comfort and satisfaction both to the North and to the South. The United States failed to recognize under this administration the necessity of holding out a hand of friendship until Castro's actions forced us to do so. [Applause.]"", ""Franklin Roosevelt held out the hand of friendship and the good neighbor policy not because he had to do it, but because he wanted to do it, because he thought it was the right policy for the United States and for Latin America. I don't want to see the United States do anything in Latin America at the point of Castro's pistol. I want us to do it because we believe in it. [Applause.]"", 'Regardless of all problems we are going to move ahead. [Applause.] They are not going to be able, regardless of how many plugs are pulled or how many mikes, to stop us from moving ahead. [Laughter and applause.]', 'I mentioned Latin America because it is only one of the great areas of unfinished business for our country. I think the future is unlimited for us. But I think if we are going to move ahead, it requires the best from us all.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. Give Lyndon Johnson and us a great vote of confidence in the State of Texas. [Applause.] Texas, through Lyndon, and Speaker Rayburn, has led the Democratic Party into positions of responsibility in the last 6 years in the Congress. I think it is important that in addition to controlling the Congress, that the Democratic Party also speak with a strong voice in the administration. This is what we ask for. [Applause.]', 'The new frontier of which I speak does not consist of the things which we promise we will do for you. It consists of the things which you can do for your country, the opportunity for service, the opportunity to help this country realize its great potential, here and around the world. In the American Revolution, Thomas Paine said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. [Applause.] If we succeed here, if we are strong in this country, if we are carrying out policies of assistance to our people, if we hold out the hand of friendship abroad, if we present an image of vitality and strength, then the people around the world will determine that the future belongs to freedom. But if we stand still, if we look back, if we mark time while the Communists move ahead, then people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, will determine that the future belongs to the East and not to the West. This is an important election. In many ways it is more important than the election of 1932, for what was at stake in 1932 was the preservation of freedom here in the United States. What is at stake in the election of 1960 is the preservation of freedom all over the globe. It is to that great responsibility that we dedicate ourselves.', 'I ask you to join us in this great effort, and I can assure you that if we are successful, this country will begin to move again.

89,John F. Kennedy ,"September 12, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. I was just relaxing to hear Lyndon Johnson make a 15- or 20- minute speech here this morning. [Laughter.] I can see it will be a hard day for me. [Laughter.]', 'Senator Johnson, Speaker Rayburn, Mrs. Price, Mr. Mayor, Senator Yarborough, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express our thanks to you, both for the breakfast this morning and for the reception last night at the airport. This really starts an important experience for Senator Johnson and myself traveling through the State of Texas. I felt that I was most fortunate at the Democratic Convention, as I said last night, that he would agree to run, because if the Democratic Party has a great national function, which I think it does, I think more than anything it is due to two things: First, that it is the oldest political party in history, and, therefore, it has its roots deep in American history, stretching all the way back to Jefferson and Jackson, and also it is the only national party in the United States, and therefore includes within its ranks Texas and Massachusetts, Florida, and Oregon and Washington, and the Middle West. I think that the Democratic Party can continue to function if it looks not only to the past, but to the future, and if it looks to all sections of the United States for support. When we do that, in other words, we speak not just for one section or one interest; we speak for all sections and all interests.', 'The Democratic Party is a multi-interest party. It includes ranchers and farmers from Texas, it includes textile workers from Massachusetts, it includes businessmen in California. Therefore, in the Congress, and we hope in the executive branch of the Government, we can speak for all the people, and I think it is most appropriate that we begin this very significant part of our campaign in the State of Texas, and that we come into Texas through El Paso, the pass of the North.', 'This city is also the pass to the South. This happy combination of geography and experience make El Paso an admirable link not only with the western United States, but also with the countries to the south of us. I can think of no assignment more important for a new administration than to try to reestablish the atmosphere which was so happily established in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, the Good Neighbor Policy. [Applause.]', ""Times and the problems since the Good Neighbor Policy have changed, but the thing that was most important about Roosevelt's administration was the atmosphere that was established, the feeling of interest and support he gave to the people of Latin America, the feeling of sharing in this country their aspirations for their own country. I think this administration until the last 6 months has almost ignored Latin America. They have forgotten that here is the bulwark of American security, the bulwark of American stability, and carrying on as we do in a great tradition, I think that this would be an opportunity early in the administration of the Democratic President, to go and stretch his hand out once again to the south of us, to build strong those chains and then look to the rest of the world for action to protect our mutual security. I start in this campaign in this State, in this city. I am grateful to all of you. I am grateful to the mayor. I think it bodes as a happy omen that Texas and Massachusetts and the Democratic Party are once again on the move together. Thank you.""]"
90,John F. Kennedy ,"September 12, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Yarborough, Senator Johnson, Mrs. Johnson, my sister, Pat, Speaker Rayburn, Congressman Rutherford, ladies and gentlemen: There is a story about a Texan who went to New York and told the New Yorker that he could jump off the Empire State Building and live. The easterner said, ""Well, that would be an accident."" He said, ""Suppose I did it twice?"" The easterner said ""That would be an accident, too."" ""Suppose I did it three times?"" And the easterner said, ""That would be a habit."" [Laughter.]', 'Texas twice, in 1952 and 1956, jumped off the Democratic band wagon. We are down here to see it is not going to be a habit [applause]. We had Lyndon up in Massachusetts last week and we turned out a pretty good crowd in a small town of Boston, but I think El Paso has it stopped. I want to express my thanks to all of you. This is not only the gateway to the North, the pass to the North; it is the pass to the South, the East, and the West [applause]. I wanted Senator Johnson to run on this ticket for two reasons. First, because I thought it vitally important that we maintain the Democratic Party as the national party, speaking for all the people, in Texas and Massachusetts, in California and New York, speaking for a powerful and great country as it has through the greatest crises of our history. Secondly, I serve with him in the Senate. He has on three separate occasions been chosen unanimously by Senators from all sections of the United States to be their leader. Texas has led the Democratic Party in the Congress. It is, therefore, appropriate that Texas play a role in leading the country in the next Democratic administration. [Applause.]', 'Texas has a Democratic Governor. It has two Democratic Senators. It has 21 Democratic Congressmen. What reason would you want a Republican President for. [Applause.] That is like getting in a car, stepping on the accelerator, and turning it in reverse. [Applause.] For everything that the Congress does, everything that the Democratic Party stands for, the Republican Party is opposed to. Now, if you have confidence in a Governor, and confidence in your Senators and confidence in the speaker and confidence in Congressman Rutherford, why do you say for the key office of the Presidency and the Vice Presidency for the great powers which the President and the Vice President have, the power to veto, the power to represent the United States in foreign policy, the power to speak for the United States - why do you then say, ""We don\'t want to move with the Democratic tide. We want to go against it.""', 'I see no sense in it. I am confident that this State of Texas, as it did in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, when John Garner associated himself with that administration, I am confident that in 1960 Massachusetts and Texas, the United States and the Democratic Party, will be associated in a great national effort. [Applause.]', 'Texas looks north and Texas looks south, Texas is a bridge. I think that there is no problem which should occupy the attention of the next administration in foreign policy more immediately than reestablishing the harmonious relations which existed in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. The administration of Franklin Roosevelt looked south. They held out the hand of friendship to Mexico, to the Argentine, to Peru, to Brazil. They recognized that there was no security for the United States unless there was a happy atmosphere existing, a good neighbor policy existing between Latin America and the United States. And it is an unfortunate fact that this administration has waited to the last month, when their time is running out, when their days are on the yellow leaf, before they have looked south, before they have held out the hand of friendship to the people of Latin America. We together with Latin America are one. [Applause.] When the United States moves in a different direction from Latin America, we adversely affect the security of every American. I ask you to join up with us in this effort. The Democratic Party has a great past, but I believe the Democratic Party has a greater future [applause]. The Democratic Party belongs to all the people. It has spoken for the people in the great moments of crisis which our country has faced, Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman, and spoken on behalf of the men and women of this State and the men and women of this country. I ask you to join us now, to join in establishing once again the kind of progressive administration which has served this country so well in the past. In the American Constitutional Convention there was a painting behind the desk of George Washington of the sun low in the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising sun or a setting sun. At the conclusion, Benjamin Franklin stood up. He said, ""We have now signed the Constitution. We now know looking at that picture that it is a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I think in 1960 if we do our job, if we meet our responsibilities, if we recognize our obligation to serve our country in a hazardous and dangerous period, we can look out and see not a setting sun, but a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I come with Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, and George Mahon, and I travel this State of Texas asking you to once again put your confidence in the Democratic Party and put your confidence in the leadership which Texas has given that party. [Applause.]', ""Some years ago when I was out of the Senate in the hospital, I wrote a book on eight U.S. Senators who I thought had set a standard for public service, who had served the public and not always their own private careers. One of those eight Senators, and I selected them from all sections of the United States, was a distinguished Texan, Sam Houston, and the reason I selected Sam Houston was because though he was a faithful son of Texas, he was also a faithful son of the United States and even though he strongly believed and helped found the Texas Republic, he journeyed to Tennessee to tell Andrew Jackson that he was leading Texas into the U.S. Union. Even in the end of the 1850's, when forces were dividing Texas from the Union, Sam Houston to the end of his career, even though his son finally was wounded at Shiloh, he fought for Texas as part of the United States."", 'I come today not as a citizen of Massachusetts, but as a fellow American. You know yourselves that in spite of your great pride in Texas, you have sent to Washington men like George Mahon, who leads the U.S. House of Representatives in a fight for a strong national defense. You have sent from Texas Sam Rayburn, who every Member of the House of Representatives for the last two decades has chosen to speak for them as the leader of the House of Representatives [applause]. You have sent to the U.S. Senate Lyndon Johnson, who every Member of the U.S. Senate, not just those from Texas or from Georgia, but from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and California have voted to have him lead the U.S. Senate [applause]. In other words, the distinguishing characteristic of Texas leadership has been that they have concerned themselves with the interests of Texas and have also concerned themselves with the interests of the United States. That is why we have confidence in them. That is why I come here today asking your help. That is why I wanted Lyndon Johnson to serve with me as a partner in the powerful, influential position of the American Presidency in the executive branch, not because I thought we could do it by ourselves in Massachusetts, but because I wanted Massachusetts, Texas, and the United States and a national Democratic Party to join together and defend the interests of the people of this country.', 'You have powerful resources in Texas. You grow cotton and grains in this congressional district, but every cotton farmer and every grain farmer in this district knows that he is successful or unsuccessful, depending upon the policies of the U.S. Government. [Applause.] One-eighth of all the national defense projects of the United States are located in Texas. But you know in Texas that you live or die, that you are at war or at peace, that you are secure or in danger, not based upon the policies of one district or one State, but based upon the policies of the United States.', 'I am asking Texas to join as it has so many years in the past, to join again with the Democratic Party on this occasion. The Democratic Party and Texas have been joined throughout our history. You play a powerful role in it. You lead the Democratic Party. You supported me, the Texas delegation, in the 1956 campaign. You supported Lyndon Johnson on this occasion. Lyndon Johnson and I are united now, leading a national Democratic Party on the road of progress, not the road of standing still, not the road of second best, not the road of diminishing prestige, not ""first, if,"" not ""first, but,"" not ""first, when,"" but ""first."" [Applause.]', ""I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy, but I do assure you that if we are elected we will cause this country to move again. The Republican Party, since its earliest inception, has been a party which has stood still. I was in Havana, Cuba, 3 years ago, and I was informed that the American Ambassador was the second most powerful man in Cuba. Today the Soviet Ambassador is. In 1952; the United States was the most powerful military country in the world. If this administration continues in office, we will be, in 1961, 1962, and 1963, in a position of being second best."", 'I ask your help in this campaign. I think together, Texas and Massachusetts and the United States, can begin to move again. Give me your help. Give us your voice. Work with us and we will carry this country. [Applause.]']"

For like the ice on that rink, it is artificial."", ""Luckily, I've been having some help. My sister and sister-in-law came here 2 weeks ago with Lady Bird Johnson. And I want to thank all of you, and especially all you women, for the kind reception they were given here in Houston."", 'Long before they came here, I was being helped by one of the greatest leaders in all American history. I mean Sam Houston.', 'When Sam Houston first sat down to draw the boundaries of Texas, he extended them west to the sources of the Rio Grande, and north as far as Wyoming. That may seem a little ambitious. But it symbolizes the tie that links Texas and the Democratic Party. That tie is growth-thrusting, venturesome, forward-looking, ambitious growth.', 'There was growth in everything that Sam Houston did, and there has been growth in everything about the city that bears his name.', 'When Spindletop opened up the oil fields and the 20th century - that was growth. When Jesse Jones insisted on the canal to Galveston - that was growth. When your magnificent skyline started building - that was growth. When petro-chemicals came, that was growth. When your great port became one of the busiest in the world, that was growth. When, last year, Houston cracked into the circle of the 10 biggest American cities - that was growth too.', 'And the future holds out promise of even more growth. There is growth, and maybe a whole new industry, in the water desalination station opened up only the other day in Freeport. There is enormous growth potential in the mammoth project for a coastal canal that will bring new, fresh water supplies to every city along the Golden Crescent.', 'The initiative for all this growth is local. I give full marks to Texas enterprise and Texas drive and Texas vision and Texas boldness. But enterprise, drive, vision, and boldness thrive only in the night climate - in the climate of growth. And right there lies one of the great issues in this campaign - an issue that divides the parties and the candidates.', 'The Republicans, in Isaiah\'s words, are ""gone away backward."" They\'re against growth. They have slowed growth by the policy of no new starts on river development projects. They have throttled growth by high interest rates.', 'Under their regime, this country has grown at a rate that is one-third of the rate of Russian advance. We have lagged behind nearly every other industrial country in the world - Britain, Japan, France, Germany as well as Russia. And still the Vice President makes sport of the whole thing. He calls it ""growthmanship.""', ""What's more, the Republicans have always been against growth. There are men in this audience whose daddies and granddaddies told them they'd never fare well under the Republicans. They knew, because they'd heard, year after year, the same tired Republican slogans. Just listen to them:"", 'There was ""Stand pat with McKinley."" There was ""Back to normalcy"" with Harding."" There was ""Keep cool with Coolidge."" There was ""Had enough?"" with Dewey. And this year, it\'s ""Experience."" The Republicans are still looking backward.', ""We Democrats haven't had enough. We don't think the American people had enough. We're not smug and we're not satisfied, and we never have been. Our slogans proclaim our attitude. Listen to them."", 'There was the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson. There was the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt. There was the Fair Deal of Harry Truman. There was the New America of Adlai Stevenson. And now we stand on the New Frontier.', 'With your help, we will open the way to growth once again. We will flash the green light for river basin development. We will release the brake of high interest. And then we shall once more start down the high road to a strong America and a peaceful world.', 'I am not satisfied to see Khrushchev daring to affront us on our own soil. I am not satisfied to see communism gaining a foothold in the Congo, and in Cuba. I am not satisfied to see your defense line at Key West instead of across the ocean. I am not satisfied with an America that is first maybe, first perhaps, first if. I want an America that is first, period.', 'Reaching that goal will not be easy. I do not run for the Presidency because it is an easy job. I do not come among you offering the unbought ease of life- presents, gifts, favors. I come among you asking hard work for the future. I say, give me your vote, give me your hand, and together we will build a better America.', 'And though the task ahead is not easy, it is exciting. For our cause is a sacred cause. Our fight is the fight of God-fearing men against godless communism. Our business is the unfinished business - not of Houston alone, not of Harris County alone, not of America alone. It is the unfinished business of the world. It is the business of making peace.', 'For the making of peace is the noblest work of God-fearing man. It is the righteous way. And righteousness exalteth a nation.', 'Thank you.']"
93,John F. Kennedy ,"September 13, 1960","['I stand at the spot where Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett crossed the Red River into Texas. More than a hundred years ago, they crossed the old frontier and initiated a new burst of growth and development. Today, the Red River Valley stands on what I have called the New Frontier. Like Jim Bowie and Davey Crockett, we Democrats want to cross the frontier and initiate, once again, a new burst of growth and development.', ""You all know what development can mean. You have seen it in the Red River Valley. You have seen it in irrigation for your farms. You have seen it in low cost loans. But you haven't seen it in the last 8 years."", ""Instead, you've seen nondevelopment. You've seen Bensonism. You've seen restrictive allotments, and low farm prices, and high mortgage costs. You've seen a Department of Agriculture with no voice for local people. You've seen this area become what is officially classed as a low-income region."", 'The issue of development versus Bensonism is one of the great issues of this campaign. It sets the two parties apart. It sets the two candidates apart.', 'The Republicans stand for Benson and Bensonism. Nothing in the Constitution said he had to be Secretary of Agriculture. The House of Representatives, where Mr. Rayburn sits and Mr. Patman and Mr. Harris never said so. The Senate where I sit never said so. But the Republicans kept him there from 1952 on, and you know what happened.', 'In 1952 it took 864 bushels of corn to buy a half-ton truck. Now it costs 1,864.', 'In 1952, it took under 10 bales of cotton to buy that same truck. Now it costs nearly 15 bales.', 'In 1952, it cost 1,500 hundredweight of grain sorghum to buy that truck. Now it costs over 3,000 hundredweight.', 'The Republicans are proud of that record. They\'re so proud of it, they won\'t even let the Democrats move to convert depressed agricultural areas into more prosperous manufacturing regions. Twice the Democratic Congress has passed depressed area bills to help prepare programs for development of hard-pressed regions. Twice the Republicans killed those bills with the veto. One veto message called conversion ""incongruous and unnecessary.""', 'We Democrats believe that development is congruous and is necessary. We will put at the top level of the Agriculture Department men familiar with local commodities and their problems. We shall get back on the job of extending soil and water conservation to every acre of farmland. We shall help with the difficult adjustment from the farm to the town. We will stimulate the balanced growth of the at natural economic regions of the country - including the gulf Southwest.', 'For we Democrats have always looked forward with development, not backward with Bensonism. We looked forward with the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson. We looked forward with the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt. We looked forward with the Fair Deal of Harry Truman. And today we look forward with the New Frontier.', 'With your help, we will open the way to development once again. We will flash the green light for development of the Red River Valley.

94,John F. Kennedy ,"September 13, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Patman, Governor, Members of the Congress, Speaker Rayburn, Mrs. Price, national committee man and woman, ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to have accepted the invitation of your distinguished Congressman, Wright Patman, to attend this fair and come to these two States on this occasion. Arkansas Senator Fulbright is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on which I serve. Senator McClellan, of Arkansas, is the chairman of the Rackets Committee on which I served for 3 years. Members of the House and Senate from both of these States have been my companions and colleagues in the House and the Senate for the past 14 years, and I am delighted to be here on this occasion. [Applause.]', 'Massachusetts and Texas are several thousand miles apart, but Boston, Tex., and Boston, Mass., are only a few inches apart in their common devotion to the principles of this country. [Applause.] I have been taken from the Pass of the North, El Paso, on Sunday night, across the great State of Texas to the eastern borders of Texas and Arkansas-Louisiana. I come to this State on this occasion as the Democratic standard bearer, representing not Massachusetts, but representing a national Democratic Party which has its roots in Texas as well as in my own State. [Applause.] Yesterday I was shown the Alamo, and I was informed of all the brave deeds of all the Texans, of Bowie and Crockett and all the rest. So I said last night, ""Haven\'t you heard of Paul Revere"" They said, ""Yes, he is the one who ran for help."" [Laughter.]', 'Well, I have come down here to Texas to ask your help on this occasion in this election to rebuild our State and country. [Applause.] This is a contest not merely between the Vice President of the United States and myself. This is a contest between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, between all that the Democratic Party has done to rebuild the economy of this section of the West, all that the Democratic Party has done through the administrations of Jefferson and Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, and all that the Republican Party has not done under Coolidge, McKinley, Taft, Dewey, Landon, Nixon, and the others. [Applause.]', 'For progress for the people, I put the New Freedom of Wilson, the New Deal of Roosevelt, the Fair Deal of Truman - I put that against the ""Stand Pat With McKinley,"" ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge,"" ""A Chicken in Every Pot,"" and ""Had Enough?"" I think that the Democratic Party is best equipped in a time of a anger here in Texas and Arkansas, and in a time of danger around the world. There is not a single farmer in this State of Texas, there is not a farmer in the State of Arkansas, whose income has not deteriorated under the administration of Benson and Nixon and the others. There is not a citizen in the United States who looks around the world, who feels he is secure as he was 10 years ago, who feels that the strength and prestige of the United States in comparison to that of the Communist world is increasing or decreasing. Is our prestige in Latin America and Asia and Africa is our military strength in comparison to that of the Communist bloc? Is our position in outer space compared to the Communist position as strong as it was some years ago? I don\'t think it is. I don\'t think we have done enough. I think we can do better. I ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.] I think all those who feel that everything that is being done is being done right now, all those who are satisfied to stand still, all those who wish to look back and not forward all those who have enough the way they are, all those who are satisfied to fall into a position of relative weakness - I hope that they will support the Republican Party.', ""But all those who want to move forward, all those who believe in the Democratic Party, who believe in what Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson and Ralph Yarborough and Wright Patman and Oren Harris and others have done for the Democratic Party since its earliest beginnings, I come in a great tradition, now down to 1960. Lyndon Johnson and I seek to represent the United States in a difficult and dangerous period. We do not run for the Presidency and the Vice Presidency promising that if we are elected life will be easy, but we do promise that if we are elected this country will begin to move again, this country will move forward, this country will stand strong, this country's brightest days will be ahead."", 'I ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.]', 'One hundred years ago a great American President wrote a friend, ""I see the storm coming. I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. If He has a part and a place for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now in 1960 we know there is a God. We know He hates injustice. And we see the storm coming.

This is a long and hard campaign but I think it comes at a most important part of the life of our country. The purpose of this campaign, of course, is for the American people to be given alternatives by both the Republican and Democratic parties, and then make a choice which direction the country wants to go. I'll make it very clear and precise which way we go in the Democratic party. We want to go forward the same way that Wilson went forward in his time, and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman."", ""We want a defense second to none. The Democrats every year since 1953 in the Congress have made an attempt to secure the appropriation of more funds, to provide for the national defense. Unless the United States is second to none, this country's survival is in danger and so is the cause of freedom around the world."", ""We want a country moving ahead here at home. Last year the Soviet Union exceeded the economical growth of this country by three times. Last year we had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. We've got a million and a half people coming into the market every year seeking jobs. Unless this country moves ahead, unless we continue to grow, unless our defenses are strong, unless we're educating our children, unless we are showing in every way, in science, in space, and here in Texas, that this country is first, not to follow when or where, but first - and that's what the Democratic party wants to do in the 1960's."", 'We ask your help in this campaign.

Governor Daniel, Senator Johnson, Congressman Thornberry, Lieutenant Governor, General Wilson, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen I want to express my warm appreciation to your distinguished governor for his generous welcome this morning. The U.S. Senate is filled with Governors that wanted to get to the Senate. He is the only one I know in the Senate who wanted to come back here and be Governor of a great State. I can understand why. [Laughter and applause.]', 'We have been traveling since the night before last, when we came into the Pass of the North, from El Paso down through San Antonio, Houston, and today in Austin. One of the things that has impressed me most about Texas, which I regard as a forward looking and progressive State has been the care and attention which the people of Texas have given to the past. Yesterday we visited the Alamo. Coming into the city of Austin last night, the Governor pointed with pride to a building which has been developed under his administration, which will house the Archives of Texas, which will house, as said, the letter which Travis wrote from the Alamo, which will house the documents which Houston wrote, which will house the documents which have helped build the State of Texas. Why would a State like Texas, which lives on a frontier, which has had a record of progress, look to the past? The reason is simple. We look to the past so we will know where we are going in the future. We look to the past because it tells us what we have been able to do. We look to the past because it gives us confidence that this country has been built by men of courage, men of character, men who are willing to risk all to develop the State of Texas and the United States. We look today to the past, both as Democrats and as Americans, because it is the past that tells us most about what the future can be.', 'I look to the past of the Democratic Party as the standard bearer of that party. I look to the record of Lyndon Johnson as the Vice Presidential candidate of this party because I think that record has been a good one for Texas and the United States. [Applause.]', 'The resources of this district were developed in part by the initiative of Lyndon Johnson, followed by a distinguished Congressman, Homer Thornberry. The resources of this State were developed in part under the leadership of Sam Rayburn. The Democratic Party and history, the Democratic Party and Texas, have been jointed intimately together. Therefore, I consider it a source of strength to the party nationally as well as in the State of Texas, as well as in the State of Massachusetts, as well as in the State of Florida, as well as in the State of Washington, that the Democratic Party on this occasion presents a united national front to the country. We are able to serve the people because the people belong to the Democratic Party. We include Yankees from the North and Texans from the South. We include farmers from Lubbock, we include rangers from California. We include citrus growers from Oregon. We include all of the people. And because we include every interest and every group we speak for the people, in the Congress and in the executive branch. [Applause.]', 'Texas has sent 21 Democratic Congressmen to the Congress, and 1 Republican, a fair proportion, a good average. [Laughter and applause.] You have elected two Democratic Senators, Senator Johnson and Senator Ralph Yarborough, with whom I serve on the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. You have elected a man who is the Speaker of the House. You have elected a Senator who leads the Democratic Party, both unanimously, both chosen by Democrats in all parts of the United States to lead them in the House and Senate and speak for them.', 'Now, if the Democratic Party and Texas have been so intimately joined, it seems to me that you can place your confidence in the Democratic Party in the future. We seek to lead not merely one section of the United States or one interest. We see, Senator Johnson and I seek to lead the United States in a difficult and dangerous time. We do not do so saying that if we are elected the problems of Texas will be over, the problems of the United States will be solved, because they will not be solved in our generation or our time. But we do promise that if we are elected that this country will be strong, and this country will present an image to the world of vitality and energy, that we will represent to the world not only our own interests, but also extend a hand to all those who wish to associate with us, in the great fight for freedom and independence. The Democratic Presidents in this century have been successful here in the United States: Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman. They have been successful around the world because they were successful here, because they moved this country ahead, because they demonstrated that here in this country we were still revolutionaries, that we still believed in the doctrines which are far more progressive and vigorous than the doctrines of the Communists. Mr. Khrushchev came to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he predicted that our children would be Communists. He went to China after a visit to the United States and said that he capitalistic system is a sick and dying and faltering horse that is about to collapse to the ground.', 'I do not agree with him. I think our brightest days are ahead. [Applause.] I think it is incumbent upon us to demonstrate that this system of ours can work, that it can work in a period of danger, that it can work at a time when it is being challenged all over the globe, that we can hold out a hand of friendship to those to the south of us, to those in Africa, those in Asia, that we represent the way to the future, and that the Communist system is as old as Egypt.', 'I ask your support in this election not merely for the State of Texas, but also for the United States; not merely for the United States, but for all those who desire to join us in a great effort to maintain their freedom. The hard, tough question for the next decade, for this or any other group of Americans, is whether a free society can maintain itself, whether we can demonstrate to a watching world as we sit on a most conspicuous stage, that the future and the United States are one.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in turning this State and this country back on the road of progress. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Thank you.', 'Speaker Rayburn, Senator Lyndon Johnson, Lieutenant Governor, Senator Yarborough, General Phinney, Members of the Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for a generous endorsement and statement by a great Democrat, Sam Rayburn, in the city of Dallas. [Applause.] Twenty-four hours ago a well-known American, the Vice President of the United States, made a speech in this same auditorium. In that speech he raised some question of whether Lyndon Johnson and I were members of the party of Jefferson and Jackson. Let me make it very clear that we are in a great tradition, stretching all the way back to the beginning of this country, and that tradition includes Jefferson and Jackson and Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman and Stevenson and Johnson and Kennedy. [Applause.] And let me make it very clear that there is no question that the Vice President is in the tradition of the Republican Party: Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, Landon, and all the others. No one will doubt where he stands. No one will doubt there he stands. No one will doubt the party for which he speaks. No one will doubt the interests which the Republican Party defends as they have ever since their party began after the death of Lincoln.', ""This is a very clear question which divides us today, whether we in the United States wish to stand still, whether we wish to develop a policy of no new starts, or whether we will carry on the great tradition of the Democratic Party of looking forward, of breaking new ground, of starting in the 1960's to revitalize the great boiler which is the United States. That is the mission of the Democratic Party, since its earliest beginnings. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were not popular with the Nixons of their day, and many of them lived in my own State of Massachusetts. Woodrow Wilson was regarded as a dangerous man. Franklin Roosevelt was hated. Harry Truman was despised, and yet today those men are regarded as the great ground breakers of the Democratic Party, and of the United States. [Applause.]"", 'Our credentials in the Democratic Party go back a long way. Lyndon Johnson has been on Capitol Hill for 30 years, as a Democrat. My grandfather was the only Democrat from New England in the administration of Grover Cleveland. We believe in the Democratic Party. We grew up in it. We support it. We run with it. We carry its standards, because we believe the Democratic Party, representing all interests and all sections, has a great role to play as it has in the past, to speak for the people in a dangerous time. [Applause.]', 'Lieutenant Governor Ramsey put the issue to us. The question is, Which party and which candidates can best build a stronger America? Which party and which candidates can revitalize our country so once again it serves as an inspiration and a comfort to those who look to us for safety at a time of maximum danger? In a few days our shores will be visited by the grand master of the Communist Party, Mr. Khrushchev and his satellites.', '(Response from the audience.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. They will come to the United Nations, but his eyes will be fixed upon the United States. What kind of a nation must Mr. Khrushchev see? What kind of a nation do we want him to see? What will impress him? What will cause him to halt on his headlong rush toward world conquest?', 'Some say it will be arguments, arguments in the kitchen, debates in the United Nations, that those that we must select to lead us should be those most skilled in the last 8 years from arguing against the Communist advance. But I suggest to you that there are more impressive things that we can do that will impress Mr. Khrushchev. He has engaged in his life in many arguments. He has engaged as a member of the Communist Party in many debates. He has exchanged threats and insults with the best of them and the worst of them. But he continues to move ahead, to probe the weaknesses of the West, to exploit chaos and disorder, to strengthen and expand the influence of the Communist system. Aided by Chinese Reds he expands his power. Others say that our propaganda will deter Mr. Khrushchev. If we keep saying that we are assured of a continued military leadership, if we keep saying that our economic growth is superior, if we keep saying that we are first in space and first in research, then according to this view, Mr. Khrushchev and the world will believe us.', 'If the skeptics and the critics and the Democrats only keep quiet, it will be obvious that our system, not theirs, represents the way of the future. But I suggest to you that saying does not make it so. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Khrushchev and the world know that the first space satellite was called Sputnik, not Vanguard. The first country to place its national emblem on the moon was not the United States but the Soviet Union. The first passengers to return safely from a trip to outer space were named Strelka and Belka, not Rover or Fido or Checkers. [Laughter and applause.] They know that Russia has an economic growth twice as much as ours. They know that Russia is turning out scientists and engineers twice as fast as we do. And if they know it, the people of America are entitled to know it. [Applause.]', 'The facts of the matter are that arguments are not enough and propaganda is not enough and self-contentment is not sufficient. The only thing that will deter Mr. Khrushchev from loosing his hounds on us will be a strong America. [Applause.]', 'What do I mean by a strong America? First of all I believe a strong America is a united America, uniting all parts of the country and all groups in a common effort to build a better society here at home. We have that kind of unity here in the Democratic Party. We can have that kind of unity, uniting all parts and all races and all creeds in an effort to demonstrate to the world that here in the United States we live up to the principles of the democratic ideal. [Applause.]', 'The Democratic Party is not preaching disunity, Mr. Khrushchev. Our program is not one that will please you. The Democratic Party wants to win this election, not to preside over the liquidation of the free world, or the destruction of mankind, but to achieve peace and regain our security by rebuilding our country. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, I believe a strong America is a militarily secure America secure enough to convince any present or future enemy that an act aggression would be a mistake - his mistake- and to obtain that kind of strength requires two things: an invulnerable atomic striking force strong enough to persuade any aggressor that our force could survive in sufficient numbers and capable of penetrating his defense and retaliating on his country. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, a modern conventional force of sufficient strength, firepower, and mobility to intervene quickly and effectively before any brush fire war causes a holocaust. Only when both of these objectives are attained, so secure that our enemies know it and respect our strength, can we talk successfully with Mr. Khrushchev about peace. [Applause.]', 'Third, I believe a strong America is one that leads the free world, not just because we are the richest or the strongest or the most powerful, but because we exert that leadership for the cause of freedom around the globe. Because we act as well as react, because we propose as well as oppose, and because we have earned the respect of our friends as well as the respect of our enemies, and because we are moving on the road to peace. [Applause.]', 'Fourth and finally, I believe a strong America is a growing America, a nation that is developing all of its resources to the fullest possible potential, human, scientific, economic, and natural, and developing these resources under a free enterprise system that looses the energy of our people. The splendor of this city is proof of what can be done. The vitality of this State is proof of what can be done. This country can move ahead, and it is that great object that we are dedicating ourselves to in this campaign. [Applause.]', 'But that requires a country that looks to the future, that makes the best possible use of its soil and water and natural resources, and it requires an atmosphere in which that kind of energy can flourish, an atmosphere of fair competition, available credit, low interest rates, expanding markets, and increased purchasing power for our people. [Applause.]', 'The Texas Constitution says that monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free people. And ever since the day of Jim Hogg, Texans have been found not on the side of monopolies but on the side of free people. [Applause.]', 'I come here today from the oldest section of the United States, the State of Massachusetts, and I come here to the last frontier in the State of Texas. I come here joining with my running mate from this State, demonstrating that the Democratic Party still has vitality, still, in spite of its long history, stretching back 160 years, looks ahead, still looks into the future. We ask your help in this campaign. Give us your voice, give us your help. Join with us in this effort to move this country ahead. [Applause.]', 'Lyndon Johnson and I do not promise a life of ease. We cannot promise a solution to the problems which disturb our lives, but we can promise that if we are successful we can move with vigor and vitality on the problems which disturb us here and around the world. [Applause.]', 'Thomas Paine, in the Revolution of 1776, said that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind. I think in the revolution of 1966, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America, and as we move ahead, we think not only of the city of Dallas and the city of Boston, the State of Massachusetts and the State of Texas, the United States; we think of all those who wish to join us in a great effort around the world to maintain their freedom and maintain the peace. [Applause.] And we take as our message the words which are written in a plaque behind the desk of Speaker Rayburn in the House of Representatives, which I read nearly every day during the 6 years when when I was in the House. They are from a speech given by a distinguished Senator from my own State of Massachusetts, Daniel Webster. In that speech he said, ""Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its power, build up all its institutions, and see whether we in our day and generation may not perform something to be remembered."" Thank you.', '[Standing ovation.]']"
98,John F. Kennedy ,"September 13, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Congressman Wright; my running mate, Lyndon Johnson; Speaker Rayburn; Senator Yarborough; Lieutenant Governor and the Governor of Texas; ladies and gentlemen:', 'I want to express my thanks to you for your generous welcome today. I hope the Vice President of the United States will not confine his visits to Texas to the city of Dallas, but, instead, will drive the 30 miles to Fort Worth and see a great Texas city. [Applause.] Texas and Massachusetts are 2,000 miles apart, but they are sisters under the skin. It is a source of satisfaction to me that Mrs. Willey is here today.', 'My brother flew for many months over the Bay of Biscay in the winter of 1943-44 in a Liberator, a B24, built in this city, so I am honored to come here today.', 'This city of Fort Worth was built as an armed camp for the defense of this part of Texas during the days of the Indian wars. The city of Fort Worth, Tex., serves today as a defense, not for the Indian wars in the State of Texas, but for the security of the entire free world, all over the free world. [Applause.] For the planes and the missiles built in Fort Worth serve as a shield for the United States. I saw, over the SAC base, in Omaha, Nebr., 3 weeks ago, a B-58, built in this city, refueled. It is capable of flying to the opposite ends of the earth in defense of the United States. Those planes, those pilots serve as our shield, Fort Worth and Massachusetts, Boston and Texas. [Applause.] And we are united today because Massachusetts and Texas, Lyndon Johnson and myself, serve as the standard bearers for a great Democratic Party, a party which rose in the South, which grew in the North, which developed in the West, and is strong in the East - the only national party in the United States today. [Applause.]', 'The Vice President, speaking in Dallas yesterday, said that the party of Kennedy and Johnson is not the party of Jefferson and Jackson. When Woodrow Wilson ran for the Presidency in 1912, they said Woodrow Wilson was not part of the party of Jefferson and Jackson. And when Franklin Roosevelt ran in 1932, they said that Franklin Roosevelt was not part of the party of Jefferson, and Jackson, and Wilson. And when Truman ran in 1948, they said he was not in the tradition of Wilson, or Roosevelt, or Jefferson or Jackson. We do not need members of the Republican Party to tell us for what the Democratic Party stands. [Applause.] I have been endorsed by the 21 members of the congressional delegation who are Democrats. I have not been endorsed by the one member of the Texas delegation who is a Republican. [Applause.] I wanted Lyndon Johnson, of Texas, to join me in this fight because I believe that here in this State a great progressive, vigorous Democratic Party was existing, had led the party under Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson in the House and Senate, had sent distinguished Governors and Senators to represent this State. This State belongs to the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party belong to it. [Applause.] We ask your help in this campaign. The Democratic Party has, in my opinion, as great an opportunity for service in the future as it ever has been in the past - a strong country, a country second to none, a national security position which is first, not ""first, but""; not ""first, if""; not ""first, when""; but first. That\'s what we want in this country. [Applause.] So we ask you to join us on the New Frontier, not saying that if we\'re elected, life will be easy. But promising you that, if we are elected, if the Democratic Party once more in the great tradition controls the executive branch of the Government, that this party will lead, and this country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
99,John F. Kennedy ,"September 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Hayes, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to come to this convention to join my colleagues in the Congress, Congressman Sullivan, Congressman Karsten, Congressman Mel Price, and it is an honor and a pleasure to be before this Machinists Union. I come here this morning not only to salute you in the work that you have done for the members of your union, but I also salute you for the work that you have done for labor as a whole and for the general public. This union has had a long and laudable history. Its leaders, like M Hayes, Alvin Walker, and Roy C. Miller, have served this country in important positions in war and peace, during World War II and during the Korean war. Therefore, as a member of the Labor Committee of the Congress for the past 14 years, I am honored to be here this morning. [Applause.]', ""I come here this morning to ask you to join me on the great task which lies before the American people, and that is the task of responsibility of rebuilding the strength, vitality, and the energy of the great Republic of the United States. The effort to which I summon you will not be easy. The road ahead for America is perilous. But I believe that with your help and with the help of all Americans, we will find that our real greatness and our finest years lie ahead in the 1960's."", 'My campaign for the Presidency is founded on a single assumption, the assumption that the American people are tired of the drift in our national course, that they are weary of the continual decline in our national prestige, a decline which has led to economic injustice at home and peril abroad, and that they are ready to move again. [Applause.]', 'This is the central issue in this campaign, the willingness of the American people to accept the great challenges which now confront them, and to rise to those challenges with effort and dedication. I believe that the guide that the American people will have to the choice that they must make in November can be found in the history of the two political parties. Mr. Nixon and I, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, have not been collected in amber nor frozen in ice or suddenly emerged on the political scene. Our parties are like two histories, two rivers, which flow back through our history, and you can judge the force, the power, and the direction of those rivers by studying where they rose, where they flow, and the course of those rivers throughout the history of the United States. There is no better guide to the history of our two political parties than to study their campaign slogans in the 20th Century - ""Stand Pat With McKinley,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge,"" ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""A Chicken in Every Pot With Hoover,"" ""Time for a Change."" [Laughter and applause.]', 'These are the weakest and least constructive slogans in the history of American political thought. Contrast those slogans with the slogans which we Democrats are proud of: Woodrow Wilson\'s ""New Freedom,"" Franklin Roosevelt\'s ""New Deal"" [applause], Harry Truman\'s ""Fair Deal,"" and Adlai Stevenson\'s ""New America"" [applause]. And you can contrast the slogans of this campaign, the Republican slogan, ""You Never Had It So Good,"" with the Democratic slogan of ""The New Frontier."" [Applause.]', 'We are not talking just about political slogans. We are talking about the spirit behind those slogans, what they represent for our country, what actions were taken under them, what they meant to the future of the American people.', 'The history of the Democratic Party is founded in progress in this century, from the beginning until today, but the story of the Republican Party is a different story. There is no new Republican Party, no old Republican Party. There is only the same Republican Party which for a half century has opposed every major piece of social legislation passed by the Congress and approved by Democratic administrations. [Applause.] A party which opposed social security, which tried to repeal it, a party which opposed minimum wage and tried to repeal it, a party which has opposed our efforts to pass in this Congress medical care for the aged to the social security. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt put it to us in 1936, when before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, Philadelphia, he accepted his second Presidential nomination, and in that speech he said, ""Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference."" [Applause.]', 'I think in the last 8 years we have had a Government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. Where Franklin Roosevelt set before our country its unfinished business the agenda of our people, this administration has set ceilings and limitations. I think it is time we started to move again. I think it is time that the Democratic Party reasserted its full vigor and vitality. [Applause.]', 'As long as there are 15 million Americans who live in substandard housing, 5 million American families which lack plumbing of any kind who live in our cities, as long as 9 million of our older citizens receive an income of less than $20 a week, as long as there are millions of Americans who lack the protection of even an inadequate minimum wage of $1, as long as there are millions of Americans who lack an opportunity to develop their full resources, as long as there are 100,000-odd families in the State of West Virginia receiving inadequate surplus food packages, so long as there is need for us to recognize there is unfinished business in our society, in our generation, in our day. [Applause.]', 'I think with the help of the American people we can return to the spirit of the Full Employment Act of 1946. We can make our economy not the lowest in percentage of economic growth, which it was last year, of any major industrialized society in the world, but instead we can unleash its energy and start this country on the upward climb. We can meet the problems which face the United States at home and abroad by strengthening our economy, by assisting those who are old to meet their problems, by educating our children, by moving this country ahead here at home, we shall move this country at home and abroad. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Harry Truman were successful in their foreign policy was because they were successful here in the United States. [Applause.]. Because they held out a sympathetic hand to the people of this country, because their country had a sense of direction and purpose, then people around the world wanted to be associated with a vital and progressive country. But now people of Latin America, Africa, and Asia, who stand today on the razor edge of decision, they look at us and they look at the vitality of the Communist system, and they wonder which way the future lies. I think the future lies with us, but we must help that future we must work for it, we must not say we have never had it so good. We must say we can do better. [Applause.]', 'I don\'t run for the office of the Presidency in these difficult times saying that if I am elected life will be easy. I think for Americans life will be more difficult and challenging in the 1960\'s than it has ever been in the past. But I do say that if we are successful that I think it is possible for this country to regain its sense of national purpose. We are the great defenders of freedom, not only here in the United States, but all around the world. During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think today that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. [Applause.] And I don\'t think that there is any American who would not be willing to bear burdens and meet his responsibilities if he can insure the freedom of his own country and the success of freedom around the world. That, in my opinion, is the great issue of the 1960 election - which party and which candidates can build a stronger America and in building a stronger America can advance the cause of freedom. [Applause.]', 'I call upon all of you to join us in a journey to the new frontier. The voyage is a long and hazardous one, but we are all partners in a great and historic journey. I think in many ways that the brightest days of this country can be ahead. In the election of 1860, Lincoln said, ""This Nation cannot exist half slave and half free."" I don\'t think the world can exist indefinitely half slave and half free. I think it is going to move by the end of this century in the direction of freedom or in the direction of slavery. I think it is up to us to determine which way it will go. I think it is up to the American people. [Applause.] During that same election 100 years ago, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for me, I am ready."" In 1960, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if he has a place and a part for us, I believe we are ready. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
100,John F. Kennedy ,"September 14, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mrs. Guggenheim, Mayor Wagner, Mrs. Price, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Daniels, Governor Ribicoff, my wife, Mrs. Wagner, ladies and gentlemen: I have come back from a 2-day trip through America's last frontier, from El Paso to Texarkana, and it is a pleasure to come back to New York and the newest frontier of America, which I think New York is. [Applause.] In traveling around the United States from Maine to Alaska and from Texas to New York, there is no doubt in my mind that the major issue which this country faces and which the people of the United States are most concerned about is how we can protect our security and how we can maintain our peace. I think that this matter will be in our minds even more in the next week for while we meet today only a few blocks from the United Nations, I think in the next 7 days the attention of the world as well as the United States will be on what happens at the United Nations. We have been successful in limiting Mr. Khrushchev to New York, but we have not been successful in limiting his influence in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. At its best or at its worst, the United Nations remains a symbol of all that we hope, of all that we believe, of all that we look forward to."", 'Our aspiration is for peace, not merely a peace which lasts between wars, not merely a peace which hangs on the brink of war, not merely a peace of the death, but a peace enforced and controlled by the United Nations against the universal danger of common destruction. We want a peace in which the funds now poured into the destructive implements of war may be channeled into the constructive results of disarmament, in a great multinational effort to harness our rivers, eradicate disease, take care of our children, care for the aged. We want a peace in which we can truly beat our swords into plowshares, and our hydrogen bombs into atomic reactors.', ""We are a great distance from that kind of peace today, and the distance is growing greater every day. We do not have that kind of peace when one-half of our national budget is devoted to the purposes of war, and the purposes of national defense, and when the Soviet Union's leader boasts that our children will grow up to be Communists, we are on the contrary engaged in a great struggle. But we ought to know by now that it is a struggle that will not be won by words. It is not a struggle that can be won by debates or by arguments, in or out of kitchens, for words are not a substitute for action, and committee appointments are not a substitute for decision. [Applause.]"", 'I know no single issue that is of greater concern to all the American people, men or women, Republican or Democrats, than the issue of peace. No political party has a monopoly on that policy. There is no party of peace in this country, just as there is no party of war or party of appeasement. The sooner we get away from these artificial labels, the sooner we can get down to discussing the real issues and the real decisions that face us for there are real issues and there are real differences in approach. I want to talk briefly about those differences today, the differences and the steps which must be taken by the United States if it is to move forward on the road to peace. First, peace requires, unfortunately, an American defense posture strong enough to convince any potential aggressor that a war would be a mistake - his mistake. A Democratic administration can never and will never negotiate with the Russians in a position of weakness. Over 11 years ago, Winston Churchill said it succinctly: ""We arm to parley."" We must do what is necessary and spend what is necessary to convince the men in the Kremlin that the balance of power is not shifting in their direction. [Applause.]', 'We must have, in other words, an invulnerable, retaliatory force, and sufficient strength in our conventional forces to make sure that any brushfire war would not quickly become a holocaust. Only when both of these objectives are secured, so secure that our enemies know it and respect our strength, can we talk successfully with Mr. Khrushchev about peace, and the Democratic Party is dedicated to securing that kind of defense for our Nation. [Applause.]', 'Second, peace requires an America that is planning and preparing and striving for disarmament. Under this administration, less than 100 people have been working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament, a subject deeply complicated and in some ways requiring more modern scientific experiments than the preparation of instruments of war. After all these years, the present administration is now talking of establishing a special arms control agency in the executive branch. But the hour has grown late. The weapons are more deadly. Atomic know-how has spread, and the next administration must devote the same effort to the struggle for peace, the same resources and energies, that we now put into the preparation for war. [Applause.]', 'Third, peace requires an America standing shoulder to shoulder with other free nations, united by close ties of commerce, friendship, and mutual respect. Americans cannot stand alone as a tiny minority in a hostile world, without friends and allies, without international effort to stem aggression from any source. But if we want the support and cooperation of others, we must earn that friendship and respect. We must consider their problems as well as ours, and joined by other free nations of the West whom we helped so greatly at the end of the Second World War, we must help strengthen the political, economic, and social independence of those countries in the bottom half of the globe who are now emerging on the road to independence, to prevent those countries from succumbing to the chaos and despair which comes with poverty, with no hope of release. If communism should obtain a permanent foothold in Latin America - and it was not until our relations with Castro had become strained to the breaking point that this administration proposed to the Congress a program for Latin America 8 years too late [applause] - if a new Soviet satellite should be established in Africa, if Communist China should win her race with India for the political and economic leadership of all of Asia, then the balance of power would move against us and peace would be even more insecure.', 'Our purpose is not to buy friends or hire allies. Our purpose is to defeat poverty. [Applause.] Our primary weapons must be long-term loans, technical assistance, and regional development plans, and our goal is to again influence history instead of merely observing it.', 'Fourth, peace requires positive American leadership in a more effective United Nations, working toward the establishment of a worldwide system of law, enforced by worldwide sanctions of justice. In this age of jets and atoms, we can no longer put our faith in war as a method of settling international disputes. We can no longer tolerate a world which is like a frontier town, without a sheriff or a magistrate. But the United Nations can be no stronger and more effective or more imaginative than the nations which make it up. Unless we are willing to take the leadership in the United States, next week as well as next year, unless we are willing to channel more of our ideas and our programs and delegate power to that body in the fight for peace, then we may expect to see the last great hope of peace swallowed up in the oceans of indifference and hate.', 'Fifth, and finally, peace requires an America that stands as the model of harmonious relations all around the world. The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were so effective in their foreign policy was because they were effective in their domestic policy, because they were building a better country here. [Applause.]', 'If a country is moving ahead, if the government and the people are engaged together in great enterprises, if the government and the people are associating themselves together in securing equal opportunity for all their citizens, then quite obviously this spills over, this has its influence in those countries which stand today on the razor edge of decision and attempt to make a judgment which way history is moving.', 'If we are moving ahead, if we are demonstrating the vitality of our society, if the Communist system, which is as old as Egypt, looks as if it is moving ahead, and we look like we are standing still, then quite obviously those people will decide that the future belongs to them and not to us.', 'I think the future belongs to us, but we must work for that future. [Applause.] This is a bipartisan effort, and I think it is incumbent upon the next President of the United States, whoever he may be, in January 1961, to use people in both parties, to use the national assets that we now have, to use the great image which President Truman has abroad and President Eisenhower has abroad in the fight for peace. That is the responsibility of the next President, to use the men in both parties, whose vision, whose energy, whose resources are such that their influence has spread beyond their own country. The President of the United States, President Eisenhower, is a man of peace, and there is no doubt that that has had its effect abroad, and so was President Truman, and so is Mr. Stevenson, Senator Lehman, Mrs. Roosevelt, and the others. Those are the assets that we have in this country. [Applause.]', 'I would hope who ever was President in this great cause would use every man and woman in this country who seeks to serve, who seeks to play a part, who seeks to contribute in the great fight for peace.', ""This is a difficult and dangerous time. I don't run for the office of the Presidency thinking that if we are elected life will be easy or the problems all solved, but I do say that if we are successful, I think it is possible for the United States to regain its position as a vigorous and vital society."", 'I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee. Few Africans today are quoting modern American statesmen. They used to quote 20 years ago Roosevelt, Jefferson, Lincoln, and others. But now the United States has fallen away as a vigorous and progressive force in their fight for national independence and economic self sufficiency. We have to reestablish that image. We are a great revolutionary power, a great modern revolutionary country, which believes in the most progressive concepts which any country has ever been able to develop. Why should we look pallid and tired, while the Soviet Union, whose system of government is hostile to all the aspirations of human personality should look progressive, and new and attract the intelligentsia and the students?', 'It is our fault. It is our fault that we are missing our chance in this great watershed of history. I can assure you that if we are successful, we are, going, to begin to move again. This country will move and our position will be known around the world. [Applause.]', 'One hundred years ago, during the presidential campaign of 1860, President Lincoln to be, wrote a friend, ""I know there is a God and He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for me I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
101,John F. Kennedy ,"September 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Governor Lehman, my wife, ladies, and gentlemen, I personally have lived through 10 presidential campaigns, but I must say the 11th makes me feel like I lived through 25. [Laughter.] We age fast in this business of running for the greatest office in the country, the greatest office in the free world. I remember reading when I was at school, when Governor Lehman was running for his third term as Governor that the rally in Madison Square Garden, when President Roosevelt was running for a second term, that some garment workers unfolded a great sign that said, ""We love him for the enemies he has made."" Well, I have been making some good enemies lately. [Applause.] I find it a rather agreeable experience. [Laughter.] But I am also rather pleased in this case with the friends that I have and that I have made, and I am most honored that one of them, stretching back all the way through 14 years of congressional service, has been Senator Lehman. I am most indebted to him. [Applause.]', 'I do not recall in my service in the Congress a man who was more consistent and single minded in his pursuit of what he thought was right, and, therefore, his endorsement and his support means more to us in this campaign than I can possibly say. [Applause.]', ""Someone was kind enough, though I don't know whether he meant it kindly, to say the other night that in my campaign in California I sounded like a Truman with a Harvard accent. [Laughter.] I don't know whether that is accurate or not, but I appreciate it, because in some ways this campaign does resemble the campaign of 1948, and I hope it will on November 8. [Applause.]"", 'In going around the country, we have a tendency in the Democratic Party and as candidates, and in fact politicians in general, and we are frequently accused of it, of oversimplifying the issues, and particularly as a Democratic candidate I do find myself talking about many issues which have been with us for many years, but which I still consider to be important. They are issues which were alive in some cases in the administration of Woodrow Wilson. They were other issues which came to fruition in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. I am talking about the traditional Democratic issue with which I have been associated in my 14 years in the Congress and with which I believe the Democratic Party must continue to be associated: housing, care for the aged, education for our children, equality of opportunity, civil rights, and all the rest. I associate myself strongly with those issues in this campaign because I think in our time and in our own generation we have the same rendezvous with destiny that Franklin Roosevelt spoke about 25 years ago. We have still unfinished business in our society. [Applause.] And anyone who thinks that all of the responsibilities that we may have in this field were met satisfactorily and completely during the administration of Roosevelt and Truman is wrong. Problems change, populations increase, economies change, and the problems continue. So I can assure you that in addition to concerning ourselves with the new challenges, which I see ahead in the 1960\'s, the Democratic Party must be faithful and I as the Democratic candidate and standardbearer will be faithful to the traditional task of government, caring for those who cannot meet their own problems, joining as a people together in solving problems that face us across the Nation. But these, as I have said, are problems which are traditional. I think in many ways the next President of the United States is going to have to meet problems which are entirely new, for which we have no precedent, which were only clouds the size of a man\'s hand when Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman took office. I am thinking of the problem of economic growth, which has come upon us in an entirely different form than it came upon Franklin Roosevelt, or Harry Truman. How is it going to be possible for a free society, based on a free economy, to successfully stimulate its economy so that it is able to put to work a million and a half people who come every year into the labor market, at a time when machines are coming in which dislocate men and put them out of work, and maintain our economy at a comparable rate of growth, if not to the Soviet Union, at least to Western Germany, France, and England, and last year, as you know, ours was the lowest rate of economic growth of any modern industrialized society. How is it possible for us to maintain full employment at a time and in a decade when automation will become a by word? I lived with it for a month in West Virginia. I spent some time in McDowell County, W. Va., which mines more coal than it ever did in history more coal than any county in the United States, and has more people getting surplus packages from our Government than any county in the United States. What is true of McDowell County and true of the coal industry will be true of other industries stretching across the United States. This is going to be a problem for the next President of the United States. These problems which I now discuss and mention, the problem of an abundant agriculture and an inability to distribute it effectively, all of these problems are so-called domestic problems, and the Vice President of the United States has said, ""I am a risk taker abroad and a conservative at home.""', 'Well, I am not a conservative at home and I am not a risk taker abroad. [Applause.] The point of the matter is you cannot possibly separate our domestic policy from our foreign policy as the Republicans seek to do. [Applause.] One is bound to another; as one succeeds, the other will succeed, as one fails, the other will fail. The reason that Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman had impact abroad was because they were having impact at home; because Franklin Roosevelt worked on behalf of his people here in the United States, the people of Latin America were prepared to accept him as a good neighbor. [Applause.] Because Woodrow Wilson worked as the apostle of the new freedom in the United States, it was logical extension of his domestic policy when he put forward the 14 points and stood for the League of Nations.', 'I think that the Democratic Party can be a successful party here at home. I think it has the kind of quality and courage and initiative and energy and vigor and has people in its ranks of sufficient vitality, both physical and intellectual, that it can begin to move the United States here in this country. I think as we move here at home, our success will be reflected in policies around the world.', ""I don't think any Democratic administration would have waited 8 years, as the years of Franklin Roosevelt, to hold out a hand of friendship to Latin America [applause] and then do so only, I am afraid, because our relations with Castro had so soured that we felt we must rebuild our position in the rest of Latin America. [Applause.]"", 'I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I can tell you that no modern American statesman is quoted today in Africa. They are not impressed by what is happening here in our own country. They are not impressed by the vigor with which we expand equal rights in the United States. They are not impressed that we are on the move. They feel that we are a society which may have seen its high noon, and that its brightest days were in the past, and now some of them look in other directions. Students come here with difficulty. Labor union officials come here in slender numbers, and many of them come to see me in Washington with a handful, one month and then another. There is no steady flow back and forth between the countries of Africa which will, in the next 2 or 3 years, number one-quarter of all the nations of the General Assembly.', 'The day when the United States could summon up great numbers of votes in the General Assembly is passing from the scene. It is going to be more difficult, and I do not necessarily object to that. But it will require reason and identification and a close, working partnership with those countries on the problems that they face as well as our own problems before they will associate themselves with us in great enterprises.', 'This is an important election. I think it is an election that can be won. I think it can be done in New York State. I do not accept the view that there are no differences between the candidates or the parties. I think there are. I think that we have seen them in the last 8 years, and will see them in the next 4 years. [Applause.]', 'Finally, may I say that we pass on. I go through some tunnel tomorrow morning and I am in New Jersey. But you stay here. I hope that in the coming 6 weeks you can associate with us not because the Democratic candidates, I hope, promise that if they are elected life will be easy and the problems all solved. I think to be an American in the next decade will be a hazardous experience. We will live on the edge of danger. But I do believe that if this country begins to move forward again, that we can once again regain our position as a great revolutionary country which believes in doctrines with which all people will wish to be associated. It is to this great effort that I think we should dedicate our cause. It is to this great effort that I think we can make it possible for all of us in the 1960\'s to move forward to the new frontiers. We say, ""Yes"" to the next decade. The Republicans say ""No,"" and I think on November 8 the American people are going to say, ""Yes"" with us. [Applause.]']"
102,John F. Kennedy ,"September 14, 1960","[""Dr. Niebuhr, Professor Hayes, Governor Stevenson, Mr. Meany, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I accept your nomination, and I am proud of it. [Applause.] I am proud to be the only candidate in 1960 with the nomination of two political parties, although I'm not certain how many tickets are now headed in how many States by Senator Goldwater. [Laughter.]"", 'We had an interesting convention at Los Angeles, and we ended with a strong Democratic platform which we called the rights of man. The Republican platform has also been presented. I do not know its title, but it has been referred to as the power of positive thinking. [Laughter and applause.] I do not regard the title of liberal as an honorary degree; I regard it as a license to preach the gospel of liberalism across this country. [Applause.] But I think you know why this title could be conferred on my candidacy. Just before you met, a weekly news magazine with wide circulation, featured a section entitled, ""Kennedy\'s Liberal Promises,"" and described me, and I quote, ""as the farthest-out liberal Democrat around,"" unquote. While I am not certain of the ""beatnik"" definition of ""farthest-out,"" I am certain that this was not intended as a compliment. [Laughter.] And last week, as further proof of my credentials, a noted American clergyman was quoted as saying that our society may survive in the event of my election, but it certainly won\'t be what it was. I would like to think he was complimenting me, but I\'m not sure he was. [Laughter and applause.] But a more serious challenge to my credentials, this time as a Democrat, was issued in Dallas, Tex. In his address to a large gathering of Texas Republicans, and there are no purer breed anyplace in the United States [laughter], Mr. Nixon complained that what he called the party of Schlesinger, Galbraith, and Bowles was not the party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Wilson. I do not agree, but I have no intention of issuing a similar challenge to my opponent\'s credentials; for I know full well that the party of Nixon, Dirksen, and Goldwater is the party of Hoover, Harding, Coolidge, McKinley, and the rest. [Applause.]', ""The final proof is the old political adage that you can tell a friend by the enemies that he makes; and by this standard, you and I are the closest of friends. For Mr. Nixon and Mr. Dirksen and Mr. Mundt and Mr. Goldwater don't like my liberal policies, I'm glad to say, any more than they do yours. They are fighting a rear guard action against the 20th century, and they fear that our time is coming and theirs is going. I do not mean to say that the fight is wholly between the Democratic and the Republican Parties. Those of you who are here tonight are proof of the fact that some of the best friends that the Democrats have are not in the Democratic Party. [Applause.] I think in November that some of them may be in the Republican Party, but I hold out no hope at all for the vast and impressive number of Republicans who suddenly, just before election time - those who are running for office - suddenly begin to sound like true Lincolns."", 'Eight years ago on this occasion, Adlai Stevenson called this quadrennial outburst of affection ""that pause in the real Republican occupation known as the \'Liberal Hour.\'"" And he added, ""It should never be confused,"" and he was right, ""with any period when Congress is in session."" [Laughter and applause.]', 'What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label, ""Liberal""? If by ""Liberal"" they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer\'s dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of ""Liberal."" But, if by a ""Liberal,"" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties - someone who believes that we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ""Liberal,"" then I\'m proud to say that I\'m a ""Liberal."" [Applause.]', 'But first, I would like to say what I understand the word, ""Liberal,"" to mean and explain in the process why I consider myself to be a ""Liberal,"" and what it means in the presidential election of 1960.', 'In short, having set forth my views - I hope for all time - 2 nights ago in Houston, on the proper relationship between church and state, I want to take this opportunity to set forth my views on the proper relationship between the state and the citizen. This is my political credo:', ""I believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose, in human liberty as the source of national action, and the human heart as the source of national compassion, and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas. It is, I believe, this faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith, for liberalism is not so much a party creed or a set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart, a faith in man's ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of Justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves. [Applause.]"", 'I believe also in the United States of America, in the promise that it contains and has contained throughout our history of producing a society so abundant and creative and so free and responsible that it cannot only fulfill the aspirations of its citizens, but serve equally well as a beacon for all mankind. I do not believe in a super state. I see no magic to tax dollars which are sent to Washington and then returned. I abhor the waste and incompetence of large-scale Federal bureaucracies in this administration, as well as in others. I do not favor state compulsion when voluntary individual effort can do the job and do it well. But I believe in a government which acts, which exercises its full powers and its full responsibilities. Government is an art and a precious obligation; and when it has a job to do, I believe it should do it. And this requires not only great ends but that we propose concrete means of achieving them.', 'Our responsibility is not discharged by an announcement of virtuous ends. Our responsibility is to achieve these objectives with social invention, with political skill, and executive vigor. I believe for these reasons, that liberalism is our best and our only hope in the world today. [Applause.] For the liberal society is a free society, and it is at the same time and for that reason a strong society. Its strength is drawn from the will of free people committed to great ends and peacefully striving to meet them. Only liberalism, in short, can repair our national power, restore our national purpose, and liberate our national energies. And the only basic issue in the 1960 presidential campaign is whether our Government will fall in a conservative rut and die there, or whether we will move ahead in the liberal spirit of daring, of breaking new ground, of doing in our generation what Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson did in their time of influence and responsibility. [Applause.]', ""Our liberalism has its roots in our diverse origins. Most of us are descended from that segment of the American population which was once called an immigrant minority. Today, along with our children and grandchildren, we do not feel minor. We feel proud of our origins and we are not second to any group in our sense of national purpose. For many years New York represented the new frontier to all those who came from the ends of the earth to find new opportunity and new freedom, generations of men and women who fled from the despotism of the czars, the horrors of the Nazis, the tyranny of hunger, who came here to the new frontier in the State of New York. These men and women, a living cross section of American history, indeed, a cross section of the entire world's history of pain and hope, made of this city and only a new world of opportunity, but a new world of the spirit as well."", 'Tonight we salute Governor and Senator Herbert Lehman as a symbol of that spirit [applause] and as a reminder that the fight for full constitutional rights for all Americans is a fight that must be carried on in 1961 [applause].', ""Many of these same immigrant families produced the pioneers and builders of the American labor movement. They are the men who sweated in our shops, who struggled to create a union, who were driven by longing for education for their children and for their children's development. They went to night schools; they built their own future, their union's future, and their country's future, brick by brick, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, and now in their children's time, suburb by suburb."", ""Tonight we salute George Meany as a symbol of that struggle [applause] and as a reminder that the fight to eliminate poverty and human exploitation is a fight that goes on in our own day. But in 1960 the cause of liberalism cannot content itself with carrying on the fight for human justice and economic liberalism here at home. For here and around the world the fear of war hangs over us every morning and every night. It lies, expressed or silent, in the minds of every American. We cannot banish it by repeating that we are economically first or that we are militarily first, for saying so doesn't make it so. More will be needed than good will missions or talking back to Soviet politicians or increasing the tempo of the arms race. More will be needed than good intentions, for we know where that paving leads."", 'In Winston Churchill\'s words, ""We cannot escape our dangers by recoiling from them. We dare not pretend such dangers do not exist.""', 'And tonight we salute Adlai Stevenson as an eloquent spokesman for the effort to achieve an intelligent foreign policy. [Applause.] Our opponents would like the people to believe that in the time of danger it would be hazardous to change the administration that has brought us to this time of danger. I think it would be hazardous not to change. I think it would be hazardous to continue 4 more years of stagnation and indifference at home and abroad, of starving the underpinnings of our national power, including not only our defense but our image abroad as a friend.', 'This is an important election. This is an important election - in many ways as important as any in this century - and I think that the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party here in New York, and those who believe in progress all over the United States, should be associated with us in this great effort.', 'The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson had influence abroad, and the United States in their time had it, was because they moved this country here at home, because they stood for something here in the United States, of expanding the benefits of our society to our own people, and the people around the world looked to us as a symbol of hope. [Applause.]', 'I think it is our task to recreate that same atmosphere in our own time. Our national elections have often proved to be the turning point in the course of our country. I am proposing that 1960 be another turning point in the history of the great Republic.', ""Some pundits are saying that it's 1928 all over again. I say it's 1932 all over again. [Applause.] I say it is the great opportunity that we will have in our time to move our people and this country and the people of the free world beyond the new frontiers of the 1960's. Thank you.""]"

This is a long struggle. [Applause.] This is a long struggle; the struggle to tie medical care for the aged to social security began in the administration of Harry Truman. He was defeated. We were defeated in this summer. But we have come closer. Every defeat in the long run in a cause like this is a victory. We are going to win that fight next year, because it must be won in the same way that Bob Wagner and Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930\'s won their fight for social security. [Applause.] And it is not just social security. Franklin Roosevelt said, ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny,"" and so does this one, so does this one 25 years later.

Those are common responsibilities which any administration must face, but which some administrations have turned a deaf ear to. I think that this job can be done. I think the brightest days of this country in a sense of a country on the move and energetically still lie ahead of us, and the important thing to recognize as we look to the problems that face us abroad is that they are interconnected. It is a country that is moving at home that moves abroad. A distinguished Republican said some time ago, ""I am a liberal abroad and a conservative at home."" Well, I am not. I don\'t think you can be successful abroad unless you are successful in the United States. Unless you are a liberal here, you can\'t be a liberal abroad.

105,John F. Kennedy ,"September 15, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, Colonel Rice, Governor Leader, ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my appreciation to all of you and to the people of Pennsylvania. If it had not been for the write-in vote that I secured in the Democratic Pennsylvania primary I would not have come to the Los Angeles Convention in any position of strength. And if it had not been for the support that Governor Lawrence and the Pennsylvania delegation gave me at the convention I would not have been nominated. [Applause.]', 'But my appreciation to your distinguished Governor goes beyond that. He was unfailing in the counsel and support and advice he gave me during the convention and the support he has given me since the convention. I therefore feel a sense of warm appreciation to all of you and to him and I am delighted to be here in Pennsylvania tonight. [Applause]', 'In addition, I am glad to be here because I feel a sense of kinship with the Pittsburgh Pirates. [Applause.] Like my candidacy, they were not given much chance in the spring. [Laughter.] But fighting youth is winning out in the fall and neither of us is going to settle for second place. [Applause.]', 'This city escaped Hurricane Donna. It looks like you will have no trouble from Hurricane Ethel. But next November 8, Hurricane Democrat is going to sweep the State of Pennsylvania. [Applause.]', 'I was interested to have Colonel Rice tell something of the difficulties of divided government in Pennsylvania. We have been talking about the same thing in Washington, and now the Congo is providing an example for us all. I think we need a united government in the United States and in the State of Pennsylvania, if we are going to carry out action, if we are going to carry out the commitments of a great democratic platform to which we are all pledged. Our platform is called the rights of man. I am not sure what the Republicans are calling theirs, but some have suggested that it might be called the power of positive thinking. [Laughter and applause.]', 'In any case, I stand here tonight as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party, and I therefore stand in succession not only to great Democrats of the far past, Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland, and the others, but I also stand here in succession to three great Democratic Presidents of the 20th century, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. [Applause.]', 'I run for the Presidency in probably the most difficult time in the history of this country. Certainly the most difficult in the past 100 years. Because while the election of 1932 of Franklin Roosevelt meant that we would preserve freedom here in the United States, the great stakes in the election of 1960, I truly believe, is the preservation of freedom around the world. [Applause.]', ""I do not therefore run for the Presidency under any expectation that life will be easy for Americans if we are successful. I think to be an American citizen in the 1960's will be a hazardous and dangerous occupation, but I do think we bear great responsibility and I think we have great opportunities to meet those responsibilities as the chief defender of freedom in a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe. The challenge that faces this generation of Americans is as great as the challenge that faced that generation of Americans, who in 1932, Franklin Roosevelt informed that they had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe that our generation of Americans also has a rendezvous with destiny which we are prepared to meet. [Applause.]"", 'Across the face of the globe freedom and communism are locked in a deadly embrace. At this moment and during the past few months and years, the Communist expansion has been on the move. We see it beginning to move. We see it beginning to penetrate in Asia. We have seen it recently in the chaos of Africa, and we have seen Communists which this administration promised in the 1952 campaign to roll back in eastern Europe while they unleashed Chiang Kai-shek in Asia. We have seen that same communism expand to within 90 miles of the coast of the United States, 8 minutes by jet from the coast of Florida. I was in Havana 3 years ago. The American Ambassador informed me on that occasion that he was the second most powerful and influential man in Cuba. Today the American Ambassador is not. He does not see the President, the Prime Minister or the Foreign Minister. The Soviet Ambassador is the second most powerful man in Cuba today. That is the record that we have seen of an administration which committed itself to the liberation of eastern Europe and now finds an old and traditional friend, Cuba, under the domination of the Communists, while their power begins to express to all of Latin America. It is up to our generation of Americans to check this advance. My campaign for the Presidency, therefore, is an effort to mobilize the great strength which is in the great American Republic, and mobilize the resources of the most powerful and rich country which I believe our country is, to mobilize those resources for the great struggle There is only one thing that will impress the Russians and the Chinese, and that is not debates, and that is not conferences and those are not words. It is a strong America, not strong if, not strong but, not strong when, but strong first. [Applause.] And the fact of the matter is that the United States cannot be strong in its foreign policy unless it is also strong domestically. The reason that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were influential and stood as great world leaders was because they led the United States here at home, because they concerned themselves with the position and plight of their fellow citizens. Because they held out their hands to their fellow Americans, the people of the world wanted to grasp the same hand. [Applause.]', 'The people of the world want to know that freedom can bring the good life, that if they follow the road that we have marked, that their life will be productive, their people will be working, they will be solving their problems at home, and therefore when the Republican candidate states that he is a liberal abroad and a conservative at home, I could not disagree more. Unless we are progressive and liberal and forward looking here at home, we cannot possibly be progressive and forward looking and liberal abroad. The two are tied together. [Applause.] Therefore, a liberal foreign policy marked by leadership and strength must be marked by a domestic policy here in the State of Pennsylvania and around the country that moves. We will not win the greatest contest in our history if our economy limps along at the lowest rate of growth of any major industrialized society in the world, last year, behind not only the Russians, and it was one-half to one-third of that of the Soviet Union, but lower than Germany, France, or England - countries who we helped 10 years ago to rebuild their economies.', ""The resources that we need for the great contest of the 1960's to demonstrate that we are the most vital society are lost when we do not use our hands, when men are out of work and cannot find work, and when we have a lack of economic growth. This is the reason that I think that those people of Pennsylvania and the United States who desire to see our country move ahead, who desire us to be successful in our world policy, also should recognize that the Democratic Party in its long history, especially in the 20th century, has been successful here at home and has been successful abroad. [Applause.]"", 'Franklin Roosevelt, speaking before 100,000 people at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, in accepting the second Presidential nomination, put the choice and the alternatives before us clearly. In that speech he said: ""Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that divine justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference."" That is what we have had in the last 8 years. [Applause.] And no State in the Union has learned that hard lesson more than the State of Pennsylvania, where 335,000 men and women were unemployed last month, 1 out of every 14 people actively seeking a job and unable to find it.', 'The Vice President\'s slogan is ""You Never Had It So Good."" Well, they have never had it worse, those people who want to work and can\'t work, at a time when we are enjoying prosperity in certain sections of the country. I know we can do better. This is not 1932. We are not moving back. I cannot believe that a country which is faced by so many challenges at home and abroad cannot meet the problem of full employment so that our people can find work when they want it. [Applause.]', 'I lived with this problem for a month in the State of West Virginia the same problem that hundreds of thousands of people in this State are faced with, and in southern Illinois, and in Kentucky and in my own State of Massachusetts, where hundreds of thousands of families wait every month for a surplus food package from the Government which consists of rice, grain, or dry or powdered eggs, and this summer they announced that they are going to add lard.', 'I think we can do better than that. I think we must do better than that. I am not satisfied at all as a citizen of the United States with a country with the richest agricultural production in the world, to be distributing the kind of surplus food that we are distributing which lack, in my opinion, the essential requirements which any American should have to sustain himself and his family. [Applause.]', 'But this is not all. During the last session of the Congress in August, we attempted to pass through the U.S. Senate a bill which would have provided medical care or our aged on social security. We received the support of 45 Democrats and 1 Republican. We were threatened with a veto if we had passed it. We failed by five votes. I can assure you that if we are successful in this election that is going to be at the top of our agenda. [Applause.]', 'We attempted to pass in the Senate of the United States a bill providing $1.25 minimum wage. The average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States, and many of them are Negroes, is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. I think we can do better.', 'I think this administration has been frozen in the ice of its own indifference. I think the fundamental responsibility of all of us who wish to survive, who wish to live our lives in peace, who wish to see the influence of the United States extend around the world as a vital and vigorous society, whose brightest days are ahead, whose economic growth is increasing, whose devotion to the public interest is being maintained, I think it is essential that we go out of here and win this election and demonstrate as Franklin Roosevelt did in his day, and Wilson in his day, and Truman in his day, that a government and the people can work together. [Applause.]', 'I said at the beginning that I thought that the problems facing the United States and the problems facing the next President of the United States were more difficult than they had been since the time of Lincoln. During the 1860 campaign, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and He hates injustice. I see the storm coming. If He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, in a comparable period in the national history, we know there is a God, and we know there is a storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. [Applause.] Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"

It cannot work.', 'We cannot be strong abroad if we are weak at home.', 'The new, emerging nations of the world are looking to us to show them what freedom means - they want to know if freedom can also bring the good life.', 'We must show them that our free system, our free economy, works and works for people.', 'We must show them that it means opportunity for the young - and dignity and comfort for the old.', 'We must show them that it means an opportunity for a job, at decent wages, for all who want to work.', 'We will never convince Africans or Asians that we are concerned with their welfare if we fail to show concern for Americans who are out of work, or living in poverty, or in need of medical care.', 'The reason that the people of the world believed in the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt was that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor here at home.', 'A liberal foreign policy must be supported by a liberal domestic policy. Otherwise it will fail.', 'That is one reason I have been talking - and will continue to talk - about the crucial importance of economic growth.', 'We will not win the greatest contest in our history if our economy limps along at far less than full capacity. The resources we need for that contest are being lost today through idle manpower, idle factories, and lack of economic growth.', 'But even if there were not Communists - no competition in world affairs - we should still see to it that everybody who wants to work in America has the opportunity to work, and at decent wages. We should still see to it that people are able to eat well - and live in decent houses - and are able to send their children to good schools and on to college. That is reason enough for our Democratic Party to be devoted to a national goal of full employment, Communist threat or no Communist threat.', 'Full employment was conceived by Democrats.', 'Full employment was written into law by Democrats.', 'Full employment was the cornerstone of our economic policy under a Democratic President - under Harry Truman.', 'And full employment has become a dead letter under the Republicans.', 'In this State alone, 335,000 men and women were unemployed last month - 1 out of every 14 persons actively seeking a job. Almost 400,000 people were receiving surplus food.', 'Steel in the Pittsburgh district is now at 44 percent of capacity.', 'Two-day weeks, three-day weeks, furloughs - these are the common story.', 'And behind the statistics are people. I have seen in West Virginia and Pennsylvania what unemployment means. It means hungry children - families unable to afford decent clothes or a decent home to live in.', 'Let us face facts: We will not have full employment and rapid economic growth in America without positive policies to get it.', 'The Republicans deny the need for positive action by the Federal Government. They like to say, ""Keep the Government out of it.""', 'That is a fallacy. The Government is never out of it. It never can be out of it.', 'The Government - for better or worse - always has a monetary policy. It always has a fiscal policy. It always has a public investment and public works policy. It always has a tax policy. And these policies always have a determining influence on the growth and prosperity of our private economy.', 'We Democrats say, ""Let\'s admit that what the Government does - or does not do - has a decisive effect on whether we have prosperity or recession, inflation or stability. And that being so, let\'s choose the right policies, which will bring us an economy of stable prices, full employment, and rapid economic growth.""', 'In this Commonwealth alone, in the next 10 years, we must create more than a million new jobs if we are to put to work the young people who will he getting out of school.', 'To provide these jobs, our economy must grow much more rapidly - for today under Republican policies which stop growth we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation.', 'And it is significant that our prestige all over the world has been declining at the same time that the American economy has been almost stagnant with industries operating at half capacity and unemployment going up and up.', 'Now, how can Government policy help create the jobs we need and provide full employment?', 'First, we must reverse the tight-money and high-interest-rate policies which have choked off investment and kept the small businessman and farmer from getting the capital they need to survive and expand.', 'Second, we must make the public investments which provide a sound foundation for the private investment which is the key to our free enterprise system. American business cannot survive unless it has power and water to drive the factories, adequate transportation to take goods to distant markets, and decent homes for its workers. Yet the Republicans have vetoed program after program designed to meet the basic public needs which would allow our private industry to grow and expand, providing new wealth for America and new jobs for our workers.', 'Third, we need to provide special assistance to areas hard hit by automation of declining markets - areas like the coal regions of Pennsylvania and West Virginia or the textile towns of Massachusetts where large numbers of men cannot find work and where thousands of families struggle for survival on a health-destroying diet of Government surplus foods. We Democrats have such a bill - the Area Redevelopment Act, which provides long-term loans and technical assistance to depressed areas. Yet this bill has twice been vetoed by a Republican administration indifferent to the urgent needs of the poor and the jobless and to the growth of our economy. In 1961 a Democratic President will sign this bill into law and help will be on its way.', 'Fourth, we must act immediately to meet the crisis in our education. All over the country children are going to study in overcrowded and obsolete classrooms under ill-paid and inexperienced teachers. Yet we must depend on our schools for the constant flow of skills and thought which keeps our economy going and provides the ideas and invention essential to future progress. Yet the Republicans have opposed every Democratic effort to aid our hard-pressed schools, and it was Mr. Nixon himself who cast the deciding vote against a program to help raise the salaries of our underpaid teachers. The Russians are putting twice the proportion of their national income into education as we are. In 1961 the Democratic Party will make sure that America has an educational system second to none.', ""Fifth, we must make sure that every American - of every race, religion, and age - has equal opportunity to find a job. Discrimination is not only contrary to the ideals of American democracy but it is a senseless and cruel waste of badly needed human skill to deny a man a job because his hair is gray or because his skin is black. And by denying opportunity to our colored minorities we incur the distrust of the world's colored majority."", 'This is a program for economic growth - a program which can start our economy moving again and put men back to work. But this program alone will not be enough without a change in attitude - unless we realize that unemployment, poverty, slums, hunger, and rundown schools are all man made, and they can be eliminated by man. It has been that attitude which has made this country great and we will restore it to the conduct of Government in 1961.', 'With this spirit we can spread our faith in freedom and its opportunities to all people of the globe. With this spirit we can build a stronger America, an America which can meet all its commitments abroad and serve as a beacon of hope to all the nations of the world. With this spirit we can build an America with the resources necessary to move toward a secure and lasting peace.']"

I am not talking about world politics. I am talking about peace - our future - and our children's future."", ""Everywhere I go in this campaign, I find people asking: What's the matter with America? Why are we slipping, why are we losing friends around the world? Why are we losing the lead to Russia? Why aren't we meeting the Communist challenge - from Cuba to the Congo, from India to Indonesia?"", 'Four years ago the cold war was being carried on thousands of miles away. This year it spread to within 90 miles of Florida to Cuba. And next week when Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro arrive in New York they will bring the cold war to within 12 miles of the Bergen Mall.', 'And yet the administration has told us that all is well.', ""In the 1930's, while England slept, Hitler armed."", 'Today, while we stand still, Khrushchev moves.', ""We must learn to face the truth about our situation. You can't stand still in a hurricane. And hurricane winds of change are sweeping the world."", 'It is tempting to try to hide in the storm shelter - or the bomb shelter - tempting to try to escape the winds of change. But it cannot be done. We have to act - and to act along new lines. Francis Bacon tells us, ""He that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils, for time is the greatest innovator.""', 'How can we reverse direction? How can we move ahead?', 'First, we must set our own house in order. A nation that intends to lead the world must live a creative national life at home. We must reestablish and extend the rights of man - the right of workingmen and businessmen to earn a decent living; the right of children to a decent education in the American tradition; the right of older people to an old age free of the cost of chronic ill health; the right of immigrants to enter our land; the right of all of us to think as we please, whether to schools or jobs or lunch counters.', 'Second, we must stop deluding ourselves about our situation abroad. The collapse of the summit, the fiasco in Japan, the hostile mobs around the world - these are not diplomatic triumphs for America, they are diplomatic disasters, and we may as well face the unpleasant unpopular truth. For as Demosthenes said, ""if you analyze it correctly, you will conclude that our critical situation is chiefly due to men who try to please the citizens rather than to tell them what they need to hear."" I think the American people want to hear the truth.', 'Third, we must rebuild our defenses on land and sea, in air and space. The Russians understand strength. It is not a question of quarreling with Mr. Khrushchev. It is a question of making ourselves stronger than Russia. Talk is cheap.', ""Fourth, we must help the rising peoples in the underdeveloped regions of the world to find their way to free self-government. We must range ourselves on the side of freedom, not on the side of dictatorship.

That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men.\n', 'Fifth, on a broad front ranging around the world we must seize the initiative in the cold war with bold imaginative programs launched with good will and launched from strength. We need to launch missiles, yes; but we also need to launch programs for freedom and justice and peace.', 'When Woodrow Wilson was pleading the cause of the League of Nations in 1920, he said, ""my clients are the children; my clients are the next generation.""', ""It is for our children, for peace in our children's world, that I plead in this campaign."", 'It is up to us to win it.']"
110,John F. Kennedy ,"September 15, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Governor Meyner, Daniel Amster, mayors, the next U.S. Senator, Thorn Lord [applause] - why don't you stand up, Thorn - the next two Congressmen, Congressman Dobbins to be and Congressman McKenna to be [applause], ladies and gentlemen:"", ""I want to express my thanks to all of you for being kind enough to come out to a rally at 10 o'clock in the morning. I have been campaigning in the last 10 days all the way from Maine to Alaska, through California and Texas, the State of Idaho, and Michigan, and now in the State of New Jersey. I really say the same thing in a sense every place, because I think it is the basic issue before the United States at this very difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country, and that is which candidate and which party and what action can best insure a stronger America, a freer world and the peace of the United States. It is to those great problems that we address ourselves as Americans in the campaign of 1960."", ""I think this campaign can serve a useful purpose if it gives the American people clear alternatives, a clear choice of action, so they can determine what they want their country to be in the 1960's, and what they want their lives to be. My own feeling is that in the last few years, the influence, the power and the prestige of the United States in relationship to the Communist world has begun to decline, relatively. We are still moving ahead but we are not moving ahead fast enough. We are still strong, but we are not strong enough. We are still meeting our traditional responsibilities, but we are not doing it with traditional vigor and traditional energy. In other words, I don't think that there is any man or woman here today who feels that the position of his family and the position of his country is as secure as it was 10 or 15 years ago. [Applause.] Partly I think it is because we have not recognized that in a difficult world it is necessary for us to to to work here in the United States to build our strength here in the United States if we are going to build our strength around the world. If the U.S economy is moving ahead at a rate one-half that of the Soviet Union or Western Europe or Germany or France or England, that is not really just a domestic problem. That is not a problem just to us in New Jersey or Massachusetts or California. It affects our position around the world. It affects our ability to do the things that must be done. If Americans here in this country are producing one-half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union, don't you think that is going to affect our relative power in 1970 or 1986? If we waste food in this country, if we store billions of dollars and are not able to distribute it effectively, that is not a domestic problem. That is a problem which stares us in the face all over the globe, in Africa, in Asia. I think the basic issue which separates us at this time in the two parties, at least in their leadership, which separates Mr. Nixon and myself, is not because we don't both desire the best for our country, but I think that the leadership of the Republicans on this occasion say we never had it so good, and I say we can do better. I say we are going to have to move ahead. [Applause.]"", 'I don\'t run for the office of the Presidency in these dangerous days saying that if I am elected life will be easy and the problems all solved, because I think to be an American in the next decade is to bear heavy responsibilities and great burdens. But I do say that if we are successful, if I am elected, if the Democratic leadership is successful, then I think we can begin to move in this country on all of the problems that now face us, and by so moving here we strengthen ourselves around the world. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in this great effort, not merely for the success of a political party, but because I think our best days in many ways are to be ahead. Thomas Paine in the Revolution of 1776 said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960 that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we meet our responsibility in this time as we did in the days of Wilson and Roosevelt, I think we can meet our responsibilities to ourselves in this State, to ourselves in this country, and to the cause of freedom around the world. I ask your help in that effort. Thank you.', 'During the American Constitutional Convention there was a painting of a sun behind George Washington\'s desk, very low on the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun. At the conclusion Benjamin Franklin stood up. He said, ""We now know. We have made our judgment. It is a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day."" I think in 1960 it can be for the United States and the free world a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

You name it. Social security - they voted against it. Minimum wage, housing, unemployment compensation, and in the last session of the Congress in August, when we brought up a bill for medical care for the aged, we received 45 Democrats and 1 Republican who supported it, and we were told it would be vetoed if it passed.

Governor, Members of Congress, Mr. Chairman, national committeeman, national committeewoman, ladies, and gentlemen, I first of all want to express my appreciation to you and to the people of Maryland for their generous support to me in May which made it possible for me to win the nomination and made it possible for me to be here tonight. [Applause.]', 'I would like to set aside on this occasion my role as Democratic nominee, and speak tonight as a citizen of the United States. I would like to set aside on this occasion those issues that divide us, and speak instead of what unites us, and I would like to address my remarks not only to the people of Maryland and America, but also to the ruler of the Soviet Union.', 'I know something about Mr. Khrushchev, whom I met a year ago in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and I know something about the nature and history of his country which I visited in 1939, Mr. Khrushchev himself, it is said, told the story a few years ago about the Russian who began to run through the Kremlin, shouting, ""Khrushchev is a fool. Khrushchev is a fool."" He was sentenced, the Premier said, to 23 years in prison, ""3 for insulting the party secretary, and 20 for revealing a state secret."" [Laughter.]', 'But Mr. Khrushchev is not a fool and we ought to realize that before he comes. He is shrewd, he is vigorous, he is informed, and he is competent. He is not putting on an act when he talks about the inevitable triumph of the Communist system, for this is what he believes, and this is what he is determined to achieve, and this is what we in this Nation are equally determined to prevent. [Applause.]', ""We would not and could not prevent Mr. Khrushchev coming here at the head of the Soviet delegation. We did not invite you, but I think most Americans would agree that we would rather meet at the U.N. than in nuclear combat. But nevertheless, the American people are wondering, Mr. Khrushchev, why you decided to come. At your last chance to discuss with us the world's drift toward war, you not only sabotaged the summit conference, but insulted the President of the United States as well, and Americans of all parties regard an insult to the President as an insult to every citizen. [Applause.]"", 'Surely you do not believe that you can use the United Nations as a forum for your discourtesies, nor can you believe that this country would ever be intimidated by your threats. That is not our tradition. During the American Revolution and just before, Samuel Adams, from my own State of Massachusetts, following the Boston Massacre, went to call on the British Governor. The Governor warned of mass arrests. Samuel Adams warned of the American Revolution. It was then he wrote in his diary that ""I saw his knees tremble."" But Samuel Adams\' knees did not tremble and our knees do not tremble today before the threat of rockets or mass intimidation.', 'Why, then, Mr. Khrushchev, have you decided to come? It has been suggested that there are four possible reasons for your visit to the United States. First, it has been suggested that it is your objective to pose as a champion of disarmament. You are said to be bringing new disarmament proposals with you. If they are at all constructive and negotiable, I hope we in this country will stand ready to consider them. But the Bible, the one book with which you may not be familiar, warns us against those of whom it may be said, ""The words of his mouth were as smooth as butter, but war was in his heart."" For the cold war, the Korean war, the Indochina war, and ever-present threat of new war, have all been initiated by the Communists and not by the West.', 'Today you are threatening and encouraging further disorders in Latin America, Africa, southeast Asia, Germany, and the Middle East. You have defied and hamstrung the United Nations in the Congo. Yet you now come talking of disarmament. Under the old English legal maxim, ""He who seeks equity must come with clean hands,"" and you do not come to the United States, Mr. Khrushchev, with clean hands. [Applause.]', 'I believe that this country can do more for peace than it has done. I am not satisfied to have only 100 experts scattered through the U.S. Government working on the sensitive and complex issue of disarmament. I regret that our negotiators at previous disarmament conferences too often have been ill prepared, ill advised, and ill staffed. We sincerely desire to live at peace with our neighbors. We abhor the idea of conquest, while you and your Chinese friends in particular talk of peace only while you work to undermine it.', 'Second, it has been suggested that you are coming to the United Nations to talk of colonialism. There will be controversial issues on this question, questions on which the West is not wholly prepared or united. The Algerian problem, in particular, has been allowed to fester too long without a solution, until now the commitments and bitterness on both sides have made any settlement difficult. But the record of the West, especially in recent years, the French and British in Africa and Asia, in encouraging the political and economic independence of their own colonies, is in sharp contrast with the Soviet record as the most ruthless colonial power in the history of the world. [Applause.]', ""To rail against colonialism while holding an iron empire in your grasp, all the way from East Berlin to Vietnam in the half circle, is to achieve new heights of hypocrisy. To bring with you your puppet rulers of your satellite states only indicates to us that while there may be satellite rulers, there are never satellite peoples. And any U.N. debate on the subject of colonialism should bring out the subject of the Soviet Union's butchery in Budapest. [Applause.]"", 'Perhaps in the coming year by probing new areas you will be able to add to your satellites in Cuba and possibly in the Congo. But I cannot believe, particularly if we win to this country again all those friends who used to support the United States abroad because they admired our example here at home - I cannot believe that in the long run the people of these two nations will not be willing to accept your type of dictatorship instead of the road to freedom which we offer them. [Applause.]', 'Third, Mr. Khrushchev, it has been suggested that you come to the United Nations in order to flaunt the supposed advantages of your system over ours. Without doubt, if you succeed in putting a man into outer space and bringing him back alive, you will have scored another impressive triumph. It would confirm your lead in rocket thrust, and there are many of us who are deeply concerned about it. We are concerned, too, that your economy is growing at a faster rate than ours, and we are concerned that you are producing scientists and engineers at twice the rate of the United States, and you may be tempted to make the most of these differences. But this country is still far from fitting your description of a senile capitalistic system that is about to collapse into the ground, for while you may be an expert on Karl Marx, Karl Marx was not an expert on the United States. [Applause.]', 'I think the United States is still capable of achieving greater heights than we have ever achieved in the past. It is still capable of building all the defenses that we need, and all the schools and hospitals that our people require, and help stabilize the non-Communist world at the same time. [Applause.]', 'We have our share of low-paid workers and poor housing, but ours is the exception and yours is the rule. And our teachers and other citizens who may on occasion complain would not for the world change our system to yours. Whatever propaganda value you may seek in enticing two defectors across your borders in recent weeks, the fact of the matter is since the end of World War II the steady flow has been from the Communist world to freedom across the Iron Curtain. [Applause.] For people around the world know, Mr. Khrushchev, that while you may learn on occasion to bring a man back from outer space alive, you rarely bring them back from Siberia.', 'In short, Mr. Khrushchev, it is not your system that is making progress toward the future - it is our system. You must still maintain your political monopoly through secret police and the threat of concentration camps, and the people of the world, including your own, want more than economic progress. They want peace and freedom, which is ultimately why we are going to prevail.', 'Fourth and finally, Mr. Khrushchev, it has been suggested that your objective is to divide our country in the middle of an election. Let me say as emphatically as I can those tactics will not work. You may try to praise or condemn one candidate or another. You may try to express, directly or indirectly, your preferences or your doubts, but the American people are not going to be influenced in this election by what the Kremlin does or says or does not say. [Applause.]', 'You may not be familiar with our free elections, Mr. Khrushchev, because you do not know what free elections are. So perhaps you have been misled into believing that we are a divided country, or that one side favors appeasement, or that the humiliation of our President would be pleasing to his political opponents. Nothing could be further from the truth. For Democrats and Republicans and independents alike are united, in our opposition to your system and everything it stands for, in our hatred for war, in our stand for peace, and in our refusal to tolerate appeasement. [Applause.]', ""You may hear us inquiring into our lost prestige, our shaky defenses, our lack of leadership, but do not be deceived. The Democratic Party is not preaching disunity. Our program is not one that will please you. The Democratic Party wants to win this election, not to preside over the liquidation of the free world or the destruction of mankind, but to achieve peace and regain our security and rebuild America's strength. [Applause.]"", 'Once we are as strong as we need to be and can be, militarily, economically, scientifically, and politically, I think then you will want to talk more sensibly with us. You will want to talk peace with us. I think then you will want to avoid the catastrophe of an arms race, the spread of war, and the spread of nuclear weapons. I think then that you may want the benefits of a world truly at peace, with a greater flow of goods and ideas and people between our two nations. But until we can achieve that balance, our task here is to remain strong and alert and moving ahead. A great poet once wrote:', '\n  ""The world is large when its weary leagues\n  Two loving hearts divide;\n  But the world is small when your enemy\n  Is loose on the other side.""\n', 'Tonight we know that our world grows smaller every day, that our enemy is loose, that he is coming now even to our side of the world, but we shall neither be deceived nor dismayed, neither shall we retreat for while there may be fearless men in both of our countries, Mr. Khrushchev, this is not only the home of the brave - it is also the home of the free, and in the long run, Mr. Khrushchev, that will make the difference. Thank you. [Applause, standing ovation.]']"
116,John F. Kennedy ,"September 16, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Mr. Rice, ladies, and gentlemen, I heard this was the strongest Democratic town in this part of Pennsylvania. [Applause.] My message is a simple one. There have been three Democratic Presidents in this century, Woodrow Wilson, who stood for the New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt, who stood for the New Deal, Harry Truman, who stood for the Fair Deal. There have been a number of Republican Presidents - McKinley, whose motto was ""Stand Pat\'; Harding, whose motto was ""Return to Normalcy""; Coolidge, whose motto was ""Keep Cool With Coolidge""; Hoover, whose motto was ""A Chicken in Every Pot""; Landon, Dewey, and the others. [Laughter.]', ""These slogans, I think, indicate a whole state of mind, and that is the Republican policy which, in my opinion, has prevented the passage or has attempted to block the passage of every single piece of progressive legislation from Wilson's Federal Reserve Board, to our attempt to provide medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress. Can you tell me one piece of new legislation which benefits our people that has been passed in the last 8 years? I can't name one."", 'The point is that we pay for that. Every time the President vetoes a housing bill, every time a Republican Member votes against the $1.25 minimum wage, every time we are unable to get any support on our bill to tie medical care for the aged to social security, it is not the Congress that suffers, it is not the administration; it is the people of the United States who require, in my opinion, a progressive, forward-looking government if this country is going to move forward.', 'It is no accident that 400,000 people in a rich State like Pennsylvania wait every month for surplus food packages from the Federal Government. It is no wonder, with the policies which are restrictive, which fail to look ahead, that the steel mills of this State work 50 percent of capacity.', ""I think we can do better than that, and I think when this country moves ahead here at home, when oar people are working, when our economy is moving, then our power and influence increases around the world. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor to Latin America because he was a good neighbor of the United States. You cannot separate a strong foreign policy from a strong vigorous domestic economy. So I ask your help in this campaign. I served for 14 years in the Congress, and I can say after that long time that I think this country is powerful, I think it is great, but I think it can be more powerful and I think it can be greater. I am not satisfied to see Mr. Castro and Mr. Khrushchev quarantined in Manhattan and moving around the world. [Applause.] I ask your help in this campaign, I think it is time we recognized that there are new frontiers to cross in the 1960's and we can cross them. Thank you for your help. I can assure you that if we are successful we are going to move in the 1960's. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
117,John F. Kennedy ,"September 16, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Mayor, Governor, Senator Clark, Mayor Dilworth, fellow candidates on the Democratic ticket, Mrs. Price, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to the mayor and to the Governor, Senator Clark, and to all of you, for coming out this morning and giving us a warm welcome. I run for the office of the Presidency in a very difficult time in the life of our country. I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that if we are elected life will be easy and the problems all solved. I think the 1960's are going to be difficult for us all. But I do think that the contribution which the Democratic Party can make on this occasion is in many ways comparable to the contribution it made during the lifetime of three great Presidents in this century; Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. [Applause.] And I think the common denominator of all their servies, the common threat that ran through the administrations of these three Americans during the 20th century was their faith in this country, their faith in its unlimited capacity to meet our problems here at home and lead the free world all over the globe. I think that can still be done."", 'My argument with the Republicans is not because I do not believe that they share our aspirations for this country. My argument is that they have been content with too little, they have been content with an economy which has expanded too little. We, in this State of Pennsylvania, know better than almost any State in the Union that we are not realizing our potential. When half of the steel mill capacity in this State is unused and, therefore, half of the steelworkers in this State do not find a good job, then you know that a basic asset which distinguishes us from our adversaries, the productive capacity of the United States is not being used.', ""When the prestige and power of the United States around the globe deteriorates in relation to that of the Communist power, then we know we are not meeting our responsibilities, because if the United States is not the great defender of freedom, no other country is. If we fail, the cause of freedom fails; if we succeed, the cause of freedom succeeds. And I don't think there is any American, regardless of party, who can possibly feel as secure as he did 5, 6, or 7 years ago. All over the globe the Communists have been on the move. It is not merely Cuba. It is through other sections of Latin America, Africa, and Asia. This question is not going to be solved in 1960, but I don't want a historian in 1970 to write that it was during these years of our responsibility that the tide began to go out for freedom, that the influence of the United States as a great world power began to fade, and that the future began to move in the direction of the Communists."", 'This is a great country, but I think we can make it a greater country, and it is a powerful country, but I think we can make it a more powerful country. I ask your help in this election. Mostly because I believe that while the future may be hazardous for us all, I do think we can move ahead. I think we can play our traditional role, and I think if we do not do it, we fail ourselves, and the cause of freedom. I ask your help in this election. I think here in the State of Pennsylvania this election may well be decided. I ask your assistance, not merely for my own candidacy, but because I believe that we have a great opportunity to serve freedom around the world and in so doing serve ourselves. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
118,John F. Kennedy ,"September 16, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Senator Clark, my friends and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for being kind enough to come out and welcome a candidate for the Democratic nomination. I run for the Democratic nomination at a very difficult time, but I don't think that there is anyone in this city who feels that there are no longer any major issues between the two parties. I think there are just as many issues today as there were in the 1930's or the 1940's or there were during the administration of Woodrow Wilson. The fact of the matter is that I cannot think of a single piece of progressive legislation recommended initially by this administration during the past 8 years. [Applause.] During the last session of the Congress in August we attempted to pass a bill which I considered to be vitally needed, which is to provide medical protection for the aged under social security. We received the support of 44 Democratic Senators and 1 Republican Senator, and we were warned that there would be a veto. When we tried to pass a bill to provide $1.25 minimum wage, which is $50 a week for our workers, we passed it in the Senate, and we were warned that if we passed it in the conference, it would be vetoed."", 'The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party in this century has said ""No"" to progress and the Democrats have said ""Yes.""', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I think that what we must do is not only rebuild the strength of the United States in foreign policy, but I think if the United States is going to be strong abroad, it must also be strong at home. You cannot live in the State of Pennsylvania, which is one of the great industrial States of this country, and have only 50 percent of the steel capacity of the United States working. If the Soviet Union destroyed one-half of our steel capacity, we would think we had been ruined. And yet by the economic policies followed by this administration, our steel mills are working 44 percent of capacity. I think we can do better. I think we must do better.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. This is an important election. The issues which divide the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are the issues which have divided us in this century. Woodrow Wilson\'s New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt\'s New Deal, Harry Truman\'s Fair Deal - all were programs on behalf of the American people, and they were opposed in their day as we are in our day by a Republican Party whose motto has been ""No new starts"", ""No new starts any place in the United States."" As a result, the strength, the power, the influence, and the prestige of the United States has deteriorated relative to that of the Communists around the world. When we are strong, when we are moving ahead in the United States, then we are moving ahead abroad. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was that he was a good neighbor to the American people. [Applause.]', ""I ask your help in this campaign, not saying that if we are elected life will be easy, but saying that if we are elected, we are going to move ahead on education and housing, and care for the aged, on all the programs which face us in the 1960's, to make a strong and vital country, equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or their religion. This is the great challenge of the new frontier. [Applause.]"", 'During the American Constitutional Convention there was a painting in the State of Pennsylvania, in the city of Philadelphia. There was a painting of a sun low on the horizon, behind the desk of General Washington, and at the conclusion, many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun. At the end, Benjamin Franklin stood up and said, ""Because of what we have done here today, we now know it is a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day.""', ""I think in the revolutions of the 1960's, if we take the path of progress, if we look forward, not backward, it can be for the United States and the free world a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Governor Tawes, Mr. Kaul, Mayor Grady, Mrs. Otenesek, Mr. Birmingham, Mr. Goldstone, Senator Goodman, Attorney General, ladies, and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to both the Governor of your State, to my friend and colleague in the Congress, your Congressman, whom I hope you are going to return, not only for the benefit of this district, but also for the country, Congressman Danny Brewster, who has been our host today [applause] and also my appreciation to you for two things: First, because you are kind enough to stand up and listen at the end of a long day, and also because it was my success in the Maryland primary that helped make it possible for me to win the nomination and secure the support of the Maryland delegation at the convention. [Applause.]', ""So having gotten me halfway around the track, I would like to have you push me the rest of the way home. [Applause.] I run for the office of the Presidency in probably the most difficult and dangerous time in the life our country. I heard President Eisenhower speaking at a dinner some months ago saying that while he had a personal preference for President, he could predict that after the first week of commitment, which the next President would have, that the Chiefs of Staff would come some afternoon and say that the United States is faced with a difficult and dangerous situation someplace in the world and what did he, the President, think they should do. I don't think that there is any doubt that during the next 4 years the task of the President, the burdens that will be placed upon him, the responsibilities which all Americans must meet, will be heavier than they have been any time since the administration of Abraham Lincoln. So I do not run for the Presidency feeling it is a ceremonial or caretaker's office. I run for the Presidency because I feel strongly that the United States has a great role to fulfill in the world to maintain its own freedom, and to serve as the chief defender of freedom around the world. I don't think that there is any American who has lived through the past few years who can possibly feel that the balance of power is moving in our direction. I think this is a great country, but I think we can make it a greater country, and I think it is a powerful country, but I think we can make it more powerful. All over Africa and Asia and Latin America I think the prestige and influence and the image of the United States as a revolutionary and free country is diminished."", 'I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee. Twenty years ago African nationalists quoted Roosevelt, Lincoln, and Jefferson. But today thousands of young students, thousands of their trade unionists, and those who will be leaders go to school in Moscow or Czechoslovakia or Eastern Germany or Peking, and come back because they believe that we are tired and that the Communist system represents the way to the future. I think we represent the way to the future. But the reason that Franklin Roosevelt was able to be a good neighbor to Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States, because we were on the move here in America. The reason that Woodrow Wilson was able to extend his 14 points was because they were a logical extension of his new freedom, which carried the day here in this country.', 'The same is true of the Truman Fair Deal which had its partnership in the Marshall plan abroad.', ""I speak of the 1960's as a new frontier, and I don't speak of the 1960's or my own candidacy in the sense of promising that life will be easy if I am elected. The new frontier of which I speak is the opportunity for all of us to be of service to the great Republic in a difficult and dangerous time."", 'During the campaign of 1860, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I know His hand is in it. If He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now 100 years later, we know there is a God and that He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if he has a place and a part for us, I believe we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
120,John F. Kennedy ,"September 16, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. I want to express my great appreciation for a very nice introduction by a distinguished son of the great State of Pennsylvania, former Governor Leader. I appreciate that very much, indeed.', 'I am delighted to be here with Governor Lawrence, who has traveled with me through this State today. I must say that the Pennsylvania Dutch have been very generous since early morning.', 'I come as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party which is, as you know, the oldest political party in the history of this country, dating back all the way to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Our roots are deep in the soil of the United States. We represent the only national party in this country. We represent farmers in Maine, steelworkers in Pennsylvania, and farmers in Pennsylvania. We represent farmers and pioneers in the State of Alaska and ranchers in Texas. I think the great contribution which the Democratic Party has made since its earliest inception has been its sense of looking forward to the new, of breaking new ground. Jefferson did it. Jackson did it. Cleveland did it. Woodrow Wilson stood for the New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt for the New Deal, Harry Truman for the Fair Deal, Adlai Stevenson for the New America, and now I run on a platform which I call the New Frontier. [Applause.]', 'No Democratic President in this century has run on a plank or a platform or a program which can be entitled as McKinley\'s was, ""Stand Pat With McKinley."" No Democratic President kept cool with Coolidge or returned to normalcy with Harding or had enough in 1946 or today, ""You never had it so good."" I think this country has not had it so good. I am not pleased as an American, nor do I feel secure as a citizen of the free world, to see the power and prestige and the influence from the United States declining in relation to that of the Communist world, because there are no second chances in this life; there are no chances that we can turn to other powers to defend our interests, as in World War I and World War II when other countries turned to help us. We stand as the last thin line between the spread of communism and a free world. If we fail here, if we don\'t fulfill our potential, if our society is not expanding and developing, then we fail not only ourselves but we fail the cause of freedom.', ""I don't think since the time of Athens, 2,000 years ago, has any people had placed upon them the same burden of responsibilities that we have placed here. Until we build a strong country here, until we have full employment in the United States, until our economy is expanding, until there is a sense of vitality here in this country in our life, then our influence will spread, or if it does not it won't spread."", ""Latin America, Africa, and Asia stand today on a thin line of decision, attempting to determine which way the future lies. Does it lie with Khrushchev and Peking or does it lie with us? I think it lies with us, but I think it must be made to lie with us by our own efforts and our own exertions. I don't run for the office of the Presidency promising an easy life, and I don't run for the office of the Presidency promising that if I am elected the problems of this country will be over. They won't be over. I think our life will be hazardous in the 1960's and 1970's. But I think if we remain strong here, if we have a defense second to none, if our economy is expanding, then I think the world will determine that the future lies with us. If we ever stayed second to the Soviet Union or the Chinese, if our economy is on a plateau, if we are not moving ahead in this country, then we won't move ahead around the world."", 'In the next 10 years the United States is going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week if we are going to maintain full employment for our population. I don\'t think the Republican Party in the last 8 years or in this century has been willing to take this country and move it forward as Franklin Roosevelt and Wilson did in their day. I think we have a great opportunity for service. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join with me in a journey into the 1960\'s, whereby we will mold our strength and become first again, not ""first, if,"" not ""first, but,"" and not ""first, when,"" but ""first."" And I want the people of the world to wake up and wonder not what Mr. Khrushchev is doing or what the Chinese Communists are doing, but I want them to wonder what the United States is doing.

Nor can you believe that this country would ever be intimidated by your threats. That is not our tradition. We do not weaken in the face of tyranny. Samuel Adams, of Massachusetts, following the Boston Massacre, confronted the British Colonial Governor in his office. The Governor warned of mass arrests. Sam Adams warned of an American revolution; and ""it was then,"" he wrote in his diary, ""that I thought I saw his knees tremble.""

And you do not come to the United Nations, Mr. Khrushchev, with clean hands to talk of peace.', 'I believe this country can do more for peace than it has done. I regret that we have had fewer than 100 scattered specialists working on the complex problems of arms control. I regret that our negotiators at previous conferences have been so ill-staffed and ill-prepared. But there is a big difference. We sincerely desire to live at peace with all our neighbors - we have no dreams of conquest - while you, and your Communist Chinese friends in particular, talk of peace only while working to undermine it.', 'Secondly, it has been suggested that your objective in the U.N. is to exploit the bitter colonialism. There will be controversial questions in this area - questions on which the West is not wholly prepared or united. The Algerian problem, in particular, has been allowed to fester too long without a final solution, until now the bitterness and commitments on both sides make any settlement difficult.', 'But the records of the West in encouraging the political and economic independence of former colonies stands in sharp contrast with the Soviet record as the most ruthless colonial power on earth. To rail against colonialism while holding in strictest bondage a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietminh is to achieve new heights of hypocrisy. To bring with you the puppet rulers of your captive states only reminds us that there may be satellite governments but there are not satellite peoples. And any U.N. debate on the subject of colonial rule should refer to the U.N. report on the butchery of Budapest.', 'Perhaps, probing our soft spots, you will be successful this year in establishing new satellites, new colonies, in Cuba and the Congo. But I cannot believe - particularly if we in this country can once again win friends to our cause by our example - that in the long run the people of those two nations will be willing to accept this new type of dictatorship as a substitute for their old type of repression.', 'Third, Mr. Khrushchev, it has been suggested that your objective in coming here is to flaunt the supposed advantages of your system over ours. Without doubt, if you succeed in putting a man into space and bringing him back alive, you will have scored another impressive triumph. It would confirm your lead in the thrust of your rocket engines - and there are many of us deeply concerned about it. We are concerned, too, about how much faster your economy is growing than ours, and how many more scientists and engineers you are producing - and you may be tempted to make the most of these differences too.', 'But this country is still far from fitting your description of a ""senile capitalist system - (an) exhausted, limping and stumbling * * * horse."" For while you may be an expert on Karl Marx, Karl Marx was not an expert on modern American capitalism, with its unique combination of public effort and private competition, dynamic, progressive, and still evolving. It may, from time to time, pause or show weakness. But it is still capable of reaching greater heights than any you have ever seen or imagined. It is still capable of building all the defenses we need, and all the schools and homes and public works - and help stabilize the non-Communist world at the same time.', 'We have our share of low-paid workers and our share of poor housing - but you have more. And ours is the exception while yours is the rule. Whatever complaints may be voiced by our farmers, our teachers, and our scientists, they know that they are free - and they would not change places with your farmers, your teachers, and your scientists for anything in the world. Can you say the same for yours? Whatever propaganda value you may see in enticing two American defectors of uncertain stability, the fact remains that the great flow across the Iron Curtain is almost all one way- this way - to freedom.', 'For people around the world know, Mr. Khrushchev, that while you may learn to bring a man back alive from outer space, you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia.', 'In short, it is not our system but yours that is becoming obsolete. Capitalism was evolved - our monopolies are largely gone - but you must still maintain your political monopoly through secret police and concentration camps. And the peoples of the world - including your own - want more now than economic progress. They want peace and freedom as well.', 'Fourth and finally, Mr. Khrushchev, it has been suggested that your objective is to divide our country in the midst of our election. Let me say as emphatically as I can: Those tactics will not work.', 'You may try to praise or condemn one candidate more than another - you may try to express your preferences or doubt - but the American people are not going to be influenced in this election by what The Kremlin does or does not say.', 'You may not be familiar with our campaigns, Mr. Khrushchev; for you are not familiar with free elections. So perhaps you have been misled into believing that we are a divided country, or that one side favors appeasement, or that the humiliation of our President would be pleasing to his political opponents. Nothing could be further from the truth. For Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike are united in our opposition to your system and everything it means, in our stand for peace, in our hatred of war, and in our refusal to tolerate appeasement.', ""You may hear us inquiring into our lost prestige, our shaky defenses, our lack of leadership. But do not be deceived. The Democratic Party is not preaching disunity. Our program is not one that will please you. The Democratic Party wants to win this election - not to preside over the liquidation of the free world, or the destruction of mankind - but to achieve peace, and regain our security, by rebuilding America's strength."", 'Once we are as strong as need be - militarily, economically, scientifically, and politically - I think then you will want to a more sensibly with us. I think then you will want to avoid the catastrophe of war, the drain of the arms race, and the spread of nuclear weapons. I think then you will want the benefits of a world truly at peace - with a greater flow of goods, ideas, and people between our two nations.', 'But, until we can achieve the balance that will make such talks possible, our task here is to remain strong, and alert, and moving ahead.', 'A great poet once wrote:', '\n  ""The world is large when its weary leagues\n  Two loving hearts divide;\n  But the world is small when your enemy\n  Is loose on the other side.""\n', 'Tonight we know that our world grows smaller every day, that our enemy is loose, and that he is coming even now to our side of the world. But we shall be neither deceived nor dismayed. Neither shall we retreat. For while there may be fearless men in both our countries, this is not only the home of the brave, Mr. Khrushchev; it is also the land of the free. And, in the long run, that is going to make the difference.']"

But the scientists have not told us what to do to relieve the miseries and burdens of old age.', 'Right here in Pennsylvania you have more than a million people over 65 years of age. You have done much to provide for them through your local facilities and your churches. But because the magnitude of this problem is increasing, it has reached a point where Government help is needed - and needed badly.', ""In the last session of Congress we Democrats tried to enact a bill to provide for decent medical care for our older citizens under social security. It was a moderate bill. We wanted our older citizens to receive help in meeting their staggering medical bills without making them take a pauper's oath. We wanted them to receive that help because they deserved it, because it was a right they had earned, not charity they were being given. And we wanted it to be based soundly on the pay-as-you-go insurance principles of the social security system. For old people do not want a handout: they want insurance, and they will pay for it as they go."", ""The Republican Party defeated this bill. They supported a wholly inadequate bill requiring a pauper's oath."", ""The Republican Party was against social security when it was first proposed. It has taken the Republicans more than 20 years to come around to believing in it. If you depend on them you'll have to wait 20 more years to get decent medical care for the aged under social security."", 'I am glad, Governor Lawrence, that you called a conference on the problems of aging. I am glad that Pennsylvania will take prompt advantage of what benefits exist under the new Federal legislation.', 'And I can tell all of you that next January a Democratic Congress working with a Democratic administration, will push through a bill providing for adequate - and honorable - medical care for the aged.', 'Let us, then, declare our program to help our older people help themselves.', 'First, we must provide them with decent medical care under social security.', ""Second, we must provide more opportunities for older workers to find useful employment in today's world. Too many of our older people feel the awful loneliness and uselessness of age - and it need not be. And we need their wisdom to guide us."", 'Third we must improve our hospitals and our medical education.', 'Fourth, we must provide not only care but rehabilitative services for those who need the shelter of institutions.', 'Fifth, we must step up our medical research in geriatrics - the problem of aging in all its aspects, including mental health.', 'We must move ahead in our conquest of disease - its causes, prevention, and treatment.', 'Seventh, and we must recognize that older people have a right to decent food, clothing, housing; a right to a decent income; a right, earned by a lifetime of useful service, to live out their lives in useful satisfying continued service to their world and to those who love them.', 'In the richest country in the world, this is not too much to ask - for those who made it rich.']"
123,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Chairman Roberts, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to be in this city and to be accompanied by distinguished Democrats who have served the interest of North Carolina, and of the United States. I refer to your distinguished Governor who has been kind enough to assist us closely in the organization of our business and professional men's committee, whom I lean on for counsel, and who, if elected, I hope would continue to advise and counsel with me in an administration, Governor Hodges. [Applause.]"", 'I am delighted to be here with Senator Ervin, with whom I served in the Senate and with whom I served on the Rackets Committee for 3 years, protecting the interests of honest labor and management alike. [Applause.] And with Senator Jordan, who runs this year, and I would grab his coattails, who has spoken powerfully for the interest of the textile industry in this State, and also for our country. [Applause.] And with your next Governor, I hope, Terry Sanford [applause], who seeks to build in this State a new day as we do in the country a new frontier. [Applause.] And Dave Clark. [Applause.]', 'Every 4 years, the Republican candidate or his supporters comes down to North Carolina, Texas, or some other Southern State, and warns the Democrats in this section of the United States that they have been abandoned by the national party, and they should put their confidence and hope in the Republicans.', 'Mr. Nixon suggested the other day in Dallas that Senator Johnson and I were not in the Jefferson and Jackson tradition. This State of North Carolina has contributed three Presidents to the United States. [Applause.] One of them was Andrew Jackson, a distinguished President who helped form the modern Democratic Party. The only thing is that the Whig Party, which was the intellectual forefather of the Republican Party, provided that Andrew Jackson should be the only U.S. President who was ever officially censured by the U.S. Senate. Evidently, Andrew Jackson was not of the party of Thomas Jefferson.', 'Another President from this State was James Polk. The other President was Andrew Johnson, who was a Republican, but because he opposed the attempt to liquidate the South after the Civil War, the radical Republicans impeached him in the House and came within one vote of impeaching him in the U.S. Senate. In other words, when Jackson ran, he was not of the party of Jefferson; when Wilson ran he was not of the party of Jefferson and Jackson; when Roosevelt ran he was not the party of Jefferson or Jackson or Wilson and when Harry Truman ran, he certainly was not of the party of Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, or Roosevelt, and now when we run, we are not in the tradition of Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, Roosevelt, or Truman, and I suppose and I hope that 20 years from now a Democratic candidate will come down here in 1980, and perhaps - and just perhaps - they might say be is not of the tradition of Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, and I hope Kennedy. [Applause.]', 'I hope North Carolina, which has put its trust in the Democratic Party in nearly every presidential election in the last 100 years, will put its trust in us again. [Applause.] The Democratic Party is all North Carolina. You elect Democratic Congressmen, you elect two Democratic Senators, you elect a Democratic Governor. What is it that makes anyone think that the Democratic Party nationally is not part of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and the party of Massachusetts, and the party of California? The fact of the matter is that our strength is there, we are a national party, we are not a sectional party. We have farmers from Maine and farmers from North Carolina and textile workers in Massachusetts and textile workers in North Carolina, and peachgrowers in California, and salmon fishermen in Washington and ranchers in Texas. We are a party of all interests, and therefore we belong to the people and our success has been in the past that we have associated ourselves with progressive programs on behalf of our country, and that is what we seek to do in 1960. [Applause.]', 'The Democratic Party was founded as a national party, when Thomas Jefferson moved north on the expedition up the Hudson River with James Madison to hunt butterflies and fish. Traveling down the river they stopped in New York and formed the alliance between the rural South and the industrial North which has been maintained to this day.', ""Now, I have not come to North Carolina hunting butterflies, but I have come here asking your support in a difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. I run as a Senator from Massachusetts, and Lyndon Johnson as a Senator from Texas. But we also run as candidates for a great national party in a trying time in the life of our States and our country. I don't think the Democratic ticket runs - I am sure they don't - promising that if they are elected life will be easy. I think to be an America citizen is going to be a heavy and burdensome task in the 1960's. But I do think that we can move ahead. Can you tell me in this century, let alone the last 8 years, one single piece of new progressive legislation on behalf of the people of this State or country which has been initiated by a Republican President or a Republican Congress? (Response from the audience.)"", 'No Democratic President ever ran in this section on a slogan of ""Stand Pat With McKinley,"" or ""Keep Cool with Coolidge,"" or ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" or ""Had Enough"" or ""Time for a Change"" or ""You Never Had It So Good."" The Democratic Presidents in this century have looked to the future, the New Freedom, the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the New America, and now I hope the New Frontier. [Applause.]', 'There is only one great issue before the American people in 1969, and wrapped up in that one issue are all the other issues, and that is which party and which candidates can in this trying time build a stronger country, build a country which is more firmly associated with the cause of freedom, maintain the peace and exist in a world with dangerous adversaries who are spreading their influence all over the globe. Which party, which candidates can best revitalize the great American Republic? That is the great issue before us, not the traditional ones over which the parties have argued in past years. I think that the Democratic Party which looks to the future, which has during the administrations of three Democratic Presidents in this century built a strong country here, is best able to build a strong country around the world. [Applause.]', 'The reason that Woodrow Wilson was able to be the great defender of freedom in Europe after the end of World War I, the reason that his 14 points had such impact, was because Wilson in his domestic policy has been associated with the great program of the new freedom. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was accepted as a friend of freedom and a spokesman for freedom in Africa, in Asia, and in Latin America, was because he stood for progress and freedom here in the United States. And the reason that Harry Truman had such powerful influence in Europe at the end of the war, the Marshall plan, NATO, and all the rest, was because they flowed from his domestic policy of progress.', 'You cannot be, as the Vice President said some time ago, a liberal in foreign policy and a conservative in the United States, if by being a conservative means you stand still. I think that this country needs to look forward. I think we want to build a better life for our people. In the last 8 years, the United States has had an annual increase in growth of about 2.5 percent. Under the last 8 years of Harry Truman, this country had an economic growth of 4.5 percent. Last year the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. If the United States, which is the productive power of the world, is not able to use that power in an affirmative way, then our influence drops, our prestige goes down, and Communist leaders and Nationalist leaders and young men of ambition in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, begin to look to Peiping and Moscow for the future. I think this is going to be a difficult time because to be the defender of freedom is a hazardous occupation but it has been thrust upon us. Because only the United States stands between the Communists and world domination. Therefore, we must be prepared to bear our burdens.', 'I am not satisfied to see the United States second in space. I am not satisfied to see the United States turning out one-half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. I am not satisfied to see the U.S. annual rate of economic growth increasing at only one-third the rate of the Soviet Union, and lower than Western Germany or France or England. I am not satisfied to see us stand still. I want us to move. [Applause.]', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I think it is a crucial election. In many ways, it is the most crucial election of this century, even more crucial than the election of 1932 - for in that year, or the election of Roosevelt, the great issue was the preservation of freedom here in the United States. Now, I think the great issue that faces us is the preservation of freedom all over the globe. I see no reason why men of brains and talent, young students who live in Latin America or Africa or Asia, who will be leaders of the future, why they should possibly feel that we are a society that is standing still, and the Communist society is moving ahead. Why should we be connected with indifference? Why should the Communist system give the appearance of vitality? I think the reason is because we do not have a sense of national purpose in the United States.', 'I think that only the President of the United States can set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, the goals that we must attempt to achieve over the next 10 years, militarily, economically, scientifically, educationally, and then a free people can do the job. We have the best economic system, the best structure of government, the most vitality in our system. I think what we need is a sense of purpose, a sense of leadership. [Applause.]', 'It is for that great cause that the Democratic Party has traditionally been connected. I hope North Carolina this year will stay with the Democratic Party as we look forward, both in this State and around the country. [Applause.] We do not seek election in order to preside over the liquidation of the free world. We seek election in order to build this country, stimulate its economy, provide employment for our people, and cause people all over the world to wake up in the morning and wonder not what Mr. Khrushchev has done, or not what Peking has done, but wonder what the United States is doing each day. [Applause.]', 'During the American Constitutional Convention, just before the convention, there was in Hartford, Conn., one day a storm which overcast the United States, and in that religious day men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session and many of the members clamored for immediate adjournment. The speaker of the house, one Colonel Davenport, came to his feet and he silenced the din with these words: ""The day of judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought.""', ""I hope in a dark and uncertain period in our own country that we, too, may bring candles to help light our country's way. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
124,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","[""Here in North Carolina - in 1585 - 108 brave men established the first English-speaking colony of the New World. When the next settlers arrived that colony had disappeared. But the daring of those men - the spirit which conquered America's first frontier - has never disappeared from North Carolina or from America. And I come here today to summon those same qualities of courage and strength and determination to the conquest of America's new frontier - the frontier of the sixties."", 'The pioneering of America\'s first settlers - from Roanoke Island in North Carolina to Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts - forms a historic link between your State and mine - between North and South. But there is another tie that binds us together just as firmly - and that is the Democratic Party. For it was two Great Southerners, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who in 1791 sailed up the Hudson River in what they described as a ""botanical expedition"" - to find new plants and catch butterflies - and there they met with New York political leaders, and founded the most enduring, the most progressive, and most effective political alliance in American history - the alliance of men of faith and foresight from the urban industrial North and the rural South - the alliance which was to become the only truly national party in our history - the Democratic Party. And I am not here to catch butterflies either - but to reaffirm that historic alliance and lead it to a great victory in 1961.', 'But I am not in search of victory alone. For, as Woodrow Wilson reminded us, ""The success of a party means little except when the Nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose."" Today, in 1960, I believe that the Democratic Party has such a purpose.', 'I believe that our success in November will mean the fulfillment of that purpose. And I believe that all America - North, South, East, and West - can unite to carry out that purpose. For we intend to build a strong and growing and prosperous America which can be the protector of freedom for all the world. That is the goal of the Democratic Party - that is the goal of North Carolina - and that is why we are going to have a Democrat in the White House in 1960.', 'And America needs a Democratic victory. We are a great and strong country - perhaps the greatest and strongest in the history of the world. But greatness and strength are not our natural right. They are not gifts which are automatically ours forever. It took toil and courage and determination to build this country - and it will take those same qualities if we are to maintain it. For, although a country may stand still, history never stands still.', 'Thus, if we do not soon begin to move forward again, we will inevitably be left behind. And I know that Americans today are tired of standing still - and that we do not intend to be left behind.', 'But effort and courage are not enough without purpose and direction. For, as Socrates told us, ""If a man does not know to what port he is sailing, no wind is favorable."" But today we Democrats know to what port we are sailing - we have mapped our destination and we know what kind of America we want the sixties to bring.', 'First, we want an America which is using all its resources - the natural wealth and skills of every region - to stimulate our free enterprise economy to new heights of production and abundance. Today our economy is growing more slowly than that of almost any other industrial nation in the world. We have more than 4 million unemployed - small businesses are failing at a record rate - and there is poverty and distress on our farms. These are failures of the Republican Party - a party which lacks faith in our capacity to grow - and which has adopted policies designed to protect what we have rather than to add to our abundance. These failures must and will be reversed.', 'And America can find the model for its future growth here in the South. For the most dramatic economic advance of the past decade has been the steady expansion of the modern, vigorous South - the growth of industry - and the steady rise in your standard of living. Today the South is determined to continue that advance - to add to its industry - and restore prosperity to its farms. That is why the South has such a great stake in our desire to build a growing America - for if America grows, the South will also grow - and our programs for developing natural resources, low interest rates, expanding markets, expanding purchasing power, and all the rest are programs which will bring new prosperity, new jobs, and new income to the South, as well as to all America.', ""Secondly, we want an America whose ability to meet its responsibilities at home makes it a model for all the nations of the world. Today our slowed down economy, our overcrowded schools, our poor and our unemployed, our spreading slums and our thousands of abandoned farms are visible, tangible evidence of our failure to meet those responsibilities. And those failures are defeats for the cause of freedom. For today the Communists are determined to convince the emerging and developing nations of Asia and Africa and Latin America that only communism will eliminate their poverty and hunger and disease - that the Communist road is the only road to a better life. We know that this is not true - for our own greatness is living proof that the road to abundance is freedom's road. And we intend to build a still greater America where every man has a chance to work, a decent house to live in, and decent schools for his children because we believe in a decent life for all our citizens - and because we who first lit man's hope for the good life are determined that freedom shall continue to show the way to progress."", 'Third, we want an America which has a military strength second to none - strength sufficient to convince any enemy that an attack would bring disaster. To do this we need two things: an invulnerable atomic striking force which can survive an enemy attack and still remain in possession of its ability to retaliate, and a modern conventional force of sufficient strength, firepower, and mobility to intervene quickly and effectively to halt Communist aggression in any quarter of the globe. Only when we attain both of these objectives - and our enemies know and respect our strength - can we hope to talk successfully with Mr. Khrushchev about peace.', 'Fourth, we want an America whose qualities of initiative and leadership have earned the respect of the entire free world - not merely because of our size or strength, but because we stand for freedom and progress and the pursuit of peace. This means that we must help the developing and newly emerging nations of the world to achieve the economic progress on which their political freedom depends. We must be sure that they are strong and stable enough to resist the steady and ruthless infiltration of Communist subversion. We must be ready with bold and imaginative new programs to help eliminate poverty and hunger throughout the world.', ""We must also be ready to reassume the initiative in the conduct of our foreign affairs - or act to spread freedom as well as to react against the spread of communism. We must propose new and workable programs for disarmament, for banning nuclear testing, for reducing tensions in the many trouble spots around the world from Berlin to the Formosa Straits. For only an America which is applying its full resources of imagination and thought and strength to the resolution of the world's great problems - only such an America will be able to maintain its position as the champion of peace and the protector of freedom everywhere."", 'These are our goals for America - this is the large and definitive purpose toward which our victory is directed. And if we pursue these goals with energy and determination then the next decade will see a still greater America - an America whose strength is unchallenged.', 'And only a stronger America can hope to maintain its freedom and the freedom of the world. We are faced with an enemy which now commands a vast empire from the Formosa Straits to Berlin - an enemy whose agents of subversion are penetrating into Africa, into Asia, and now stand only 90 miles from our shores in Cuba - an enemy which is convinced of its ultimate victory - which believes, to quote Mr. Khrushchev, ""that the old and the rotten will always fight with the newly emerged, but it is a law of history that the new will always win."" But it is freedom that is new, and despotism and tyranny that is as old as civilization is - and it is freedom that will win - not because of any law of history - but because we will have the strength and the determination that will bring the victory.', 'But to do so we must begin moving again. We must reverse the drift and complacency which has slowed down our growth at home and permitted our prestige and our strength to decline abroad. We must reverse the failures of imagination which have allowed the Russians to be the first on the moon - and the first to return passengers safely from outer space. We must reverse the policies which have confined Mr. Khrushchev to Manhattan - but which have not kept him from moving in Africa and Asia and Latin America.', ""And we cannot do this by trading insults with Mr. Khrushchev or by arguing against his policies - or by talking tough. We talked tough when the people of Hungary revolted - but he crushed the revolt. We talked tough when communism began to grow in Cuba - but Cuba is a Communist satellite today. We have talked tough about the need for disarmament - but the arms race is more intense than ever. We have a magnificent record of talking tough - but we do not have a magnificent record of halting the advance of communism and strengthening the spread of freedom. That will be done through the strength which alone can answer Mr. Khrushchev's threats and ambitions."", 'I come here to North Carolina to set before you the goals for America and to ask you to join with me in rebuilding our strength in leading America across its new frontier. For, as a New Englander, I recognize that the South is still the land of Washington, who made our Nation - of Jefferson, who shaped its direction - and of Robert E. Lee who, after gallant failure, urged those who had followed him in bravery to reunite America in purpose and courage.', 'I cannot assure you that the road ahead is an easy one - because I know it will not be easy, and our journey will require effort and sacrifice. But I believe that the people of this State - and the people of all America - are ready to work together so that America can again begin its forward march. For I believe that we all share the faith of a great son of North Carolina, Thomas Wolfe, when he wrote:', 'I think the true discovery of America is before us.\n', 'I think the true fulfillment of our spirit, of our people, of our mighty and immortal land, is yet to come.']"
125,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","['Mr. SANFORD. Earlier this evening, as the audience in the coliseum knows, question blanks were given out to anyone who wanted to ask a question of Senator Kennedy. In the limited time we have available left for television, you can understand that Senator Kennedy cannot answer all of these questions. As a result, we are going to start asking those questions which were asked most frequently by the audience. In a moment, we will get those questions directly from the audience.', ""But first, Jack, I would like to ask a question: I have traveled all over North Carolina since the Los Angeles convention, and I am convinced of all the things on the people's minds today in North Carolina, that foremost, the dominant issue, the dominant question, is the sinking prestige of America in the world. I would like to ask you as a national view what is your opinion of the dominant issue of your campaign."", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would say, as I suggested in the speech, that I think the basic problem facing the United States is to maintain the peace, maintain our vital interest in our national security, serve as the leader of the cause of freedom around the globe, and attempt to develop in this country sufficient forward motion so that we catch again the imagination of the world as a power and a system of government that represents the kind of government which all people want to endorse, the kind of government under which all people want to live. In other words, if we do well here, we enhance the prestige and power and influence of the cause of freedom around the world. If we fail, the cause of freedom fails. If we succeed, the cause of freedom succeeds. Our responsibility is to throw light and luster around that great cause, around the globe. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. My question is, Do you think Russia will ever act peaceably toward the United States regarding nuclear warfare?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Will act peaceably?', 'QUESTION. Yes, sir.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I hope that the United States maintains its military position which would include the ability after the Soviet Union might have initiated its first attack to retaliate and therefore, destroy the Soviet Union. If we have that kind of force which requires, as at the present time, both SAC and I think an increased production of missiles, then I think the Soviet Union would be extremely slow to resort to nuclear weapons. I think they will continue their struggle against us, but it will take the form of economic competition, subversion, and perhaps brush-fire wars. For that reason, I think we should maintain our conventional forces. I think we should strengthen the kind of forces that you have at SAC here in North Carolina, increase our airlift and be prepared to fight a kind of limited war. If we are prepared to fight, we may not have to. Winston Churchill said 10 years ago ""We arm to parley."" If we are strong, then I think we can maintain the peace. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. I am Don Gilmore, a young Democrat for Kennedy. Senator, do you think your religion will be a handicap in this campaign?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't think - I would hope that it would not be a factor in the campaign. It seems to be that in 1960 the issues which I tried to discuss tonight, the future of this State, the future of the country, the security of the United States, the peace of the world, I would think that they would be of far greater interest to the people of North Carolina than where I am going to go to church tomorrow morning. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. I am Barbara Wright from Raleigh, N.C. Senator Kennedy, what is your policy for labor unions?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I served on the Labor Committees for 14 years in the house and Senate. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor as well as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I feel that labor unions honestly led and I think the great majority are, serve a useful function in protecting the interests of their members and building their wage level. Unless we have a strong wage level in the United States, who is going to buy all the goods we produce? We can't sell them abroad. [Applause.]"", 'My own feeling is that the Jimmy Hoffas and the others and the Bridges who we investigated at some length during the Rackets Committee hearings, are a minority. My own feeling is that I will not be satisfied as long as Jimmy Hoffa remains at the head of the Teamsters Union. [Applause.] And I think it would be extremely helpful to have a Department of Justice which pursued and administered present laws with vigor involving Mr. Hoffa. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Bill Gear, Democratic chairman of the fifth precinct of Chapel Hill, N.C. You must know, after this day of warm welcome in North Carolina, how much we like you in the South. [Applause.] I want you to tell this audience, I want you to tell us, what do you like about the South. [Applause.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. What I like about the South is first its sense of history and its identification with the history of the United States. Second, I think it has had in its history a strong internationalist viewpoint. It has stood for the defense of our country, its strength and prestige around the world. It has been willing to bear arms in war, and it has had a strong sense of public service in time of peace. Thirdly, or fourthly, I guess, it is a growing section. I think the Franklin Roosevelt administration probably meant more to the development of the South than it did to any other section of the United States. [Applause.] I hope that in the 1960's the South will continue to move ahead, and let me say that I would like, perhaps to say first, the fact that the South has maintained in good times and bad the Democratic Party. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Mr. McDonald, of Raleigh, N.C., and I have a pressing question. In 1956 the American people were told by the present administration in Washington that the cost of living had leveled off, and that the situation was well under control. However, we are faced today with the highest cost per necessity in the history of this country. This is a pressing problem to families and to all of us. What is your approach to the present high cost of living?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't think that the high interest rate policy followed by this administration as an anti-inflationary policy has been particularly successful. We had a recession in 1954, we had the worst peacetime recession since the 1930's that we ever had in 1958. We ended up the year with a $12 billion deficit, which is the largest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States, and now we are moving into another area where we are certainly on the plateau and not on the rise. I said in my speech we were only using 44 percent of the steel capacity of the United States. I think with a lot of people out of work, with a good deal of unused capacity in the United States, that a more progressive economic policy, more flexible use of our fiscal and monetary tools which we have available, I think would provide a greater stimulation for our economy and therefore a greater production, and if we maintain vigorously the antitrust laws, sufficient competition to keep our wage level and our income level abreast or ahead of the rise in the price level. Historically since the beginning of time you have had a gradual increase in your price level, but I think what we are concerned about is that we maintain a purchasing power which stays at least equal and maybe ahead, we hope ahead."", 'Second, I would protect those who are on fixed incomes. I am thinking particularly of those on social security. That is why I think medical care for the aged is a matter which should be on the conscience of the United States - and others who are dependent upon a fixed source of income. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Bill Connor from Durham, N.C. I would like to know how your proposed policies for national growth are going to benefit the southern sector of the United States.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, because the southern sector of the United States need economic growth - the South lost 3 million people in the last 10 years by outmigration. On the other hand, you had great areas of great prosperity in the South. I believe that a rising tide lifts all the boats. If the economy of the United States is moving ahead, the economy of the South moves ahead. You are a great agricultural section in this State of North Carolina; you are also a great textile center. So are we in Massachusetts. When the economy is at a low level, marginal industries, of which textiles is almost one, particularly suffer. So if the economy of the country is moving ahead, with the resources, with more effective transportation, the South will move ahead, too. If the country is slowing down, then the South will slow down. So may I say that the fate of the North and the South and the East and the West are inextricably bound together. If one moves ahead, they all move ahead. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. My name is Miriam Bloch. I live in Raleigh. The newspapers say that both parties are moving toward a similar foreign policy. Would you explain whether this is true and what the major differences are?', 'Senator KENNEDY. A similar foreign policy?', 'QUESTION. Yes.', ""Senator KENNEDY. I would say that these criticisms of the present administration's foreign policy therefore would suggest alternatives. In the first place, the United States almost ignored completely the problems that we have now in Latin America. The United States gave more aid to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than we have to all of Latin America altogether."", 'No.2, until our relations with Cuba became so sour that we broke off the sugar quota, the United States almost ignored the needs of Latin America for long-term capital. The authorization which Congress passed in August for the benefit of Latin America was directly tied, unfortunately, in the minds of many Latin Americans as well as in the minds of many Americans, to our troubles with Cuba. Therefore, you have people in Latin America as I said earlier today, running for office, as they are in Brazil, and their platforms are un-American. One of the candidates running in Brazil runs on the platform of making legal the Communist Party and reestablishing the relations with the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists.', ""So you quarantine Mr. Castro in Manhattan but you don't quarantine the influence of Castroism all through Latin America, which has caught the attention of the young, ambitious students, intelligentsia. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa. I can tell you that Africa has been known as the dark continent in the United States until the difficulties beginning in the Congo. We are bringing very few students from there. We have shown very little interest in their health, welfare, and economic problems."", 'Third, I think the United States should put greater emphasis on disarmament.', ""Fourth, I think it has been the greatest blow we have had in the 1950's or since World War II, when the United States was second in space. Because the Soviet Union was regarded as a backward country and we were a forward country, when they beat us into the newest kind of scientific accomplishment, it made it appear that time was running out for us. So I would say stronger defenses, a more concentrated interest in the problems of newly emerging countries, and expanding economy here at home which carries out its influence around the world - I would say that they could begin to move us forward in a very difficult time. I would think the 1960's would be more difficult than the 1950's. But to carry on the same administration whose experience has been, in my opinion, deteriorating the United States, to reward that record I think is a great mistake. So that is why we are running. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Maude Kaplan, of Raleigh. I feel the question I am asking concerns the people of my age the most. I would like to know how you expect to improve our educational - what our educational policies are doing today? I would like to know how you expect to improve our school systems mainly in the sciences and maths?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Let me say that I would say the improvement of the school system, the training of the teachers, the quality of the teachers, your ability to study and your desire to study depends on the people of North Carolina and the people of this city and town. There is nothing that the President of the United States or the Government can do in the final analysis to provide good schools and good teachers except play a marginal role. I think the Federal Government ought to aid over a 4-year period during this particular hump with a tremendous increase in our population, the number of children, we should provide Federal aid for school construction.', 'Second, we have to recognize, and this is a problem for you in North Carolina as well as in the country, that in the next decade we are going to have to build more college buildings than have been built since the beginning of this country in 1775. In a 10-year period we are going to have to do as much as we have done in 175 years. One of the programs that the Government could help with I think is loans for college dormitories and college rooms. It was in the housing bill last year, and the President vetoed it. I think loans at 2-percent rate of interest are the most satisfactory kind of assistance to colleges and universities.', 'Third, I think we should continue the Defense Education Act, which provides scholarships and loans, particularly loans, which have not been used nearly as generally as I think they could be used to help bright young boys and girls to go to college. [Applause.]', 'In the final analysis, as far as studying sciences and mathematics, I don\'t think we want to overstress it, but I think that is up to your mother and father, but I do hope that in the final analysis you will study. I think John Adams once said, ""I study mathematics and war so that my son may study English and history, so that his son may study poetry and literature."" I don\'t think we all want to be scientists and mathematicians. [Applause.]', ""QUESTION. My name is Tim Tuttler, from the University of North Carolina, at Chapel Hill. [Response from the floor.] I would like to ask what your attitude to Mr. Khrushchev's breaking of diplomatic formalities by coming to the United States with apparent propaganda motives only, and would you meet him on equal ground at the U.N.?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, let me say that in the first place I think his purpose in coming here could be manifold. First, he may have some new proposals on disarmament which he hopes to capture the attention of the world with.', 'Second I think he thinks that the General Assembly of the United Nations is going to be increasingly influential and powerful. One quarter of all of the nations of the General Assembly by 1965 will be newly independent nations of Africa. Therefore, I think he hopes to extend his influence through Africa, Asia, and Latin America in the General Assembly to see if the day can come when he can gain a majority.', 'Third, he hopes to embarrass the United States by bringing all of his satellite leaders with him, by bringing Nasser and Castro and others, and hopes to demonstrate that he is the aggressive figure, that he is the world leader, that we respond to his initiative rather than ours - rather than his responding to our initiative. So I would think that he feels that this will spotlight once again the attention of the world on the Soviet Union.', ""The second question, Would I met him on equal ground? I said before that if he requested to see Mr. Nixon and myself, both of us, separately or whatever way, that I would certainly be willing to attempt to meet him. I don't think that either one of us should meet him unless we both do. This is really a matter for the President of the United States. President Eisenhower has been entrusted with the conduct of foreign policy in this country until the end of his term and, therefore, I think that this decision and the reaction of the United States to Mr. Khrushchev's visit should be guided by the good judgment of the President, and he is the President of all of us. So I will stick with his opinion on that matter. [Applause.]"", 'I want to again express my thanks to all of you. I must say I thought the questions were very helpful and I hope - I want you to know that we have had a great day in North Carolina. I came to North Carolina with some concern, but I should have known that they grow Democrats deep down here. Thank you very much. [Standing ovation.]']"
126,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I am grateful for my generous introduction of my friend and colleague in the Senate, Senator Jordan. I am here today, unfortunateTy not there, with Terry Sanford, your candidate for Governor, and who is, I believe, going to be the kind of leader in this State which we hope to try to be in the United States as a whole, and with Gov. Luther Hodges and Senator Ervin. I am particularly sorry not to have a chance to visit your part of North Carolina, and I do hope that before the campaign is over, we will have a chance to come back again.', 'The western part of North Carolina has been, through the history of your State, the great frontier area, which is now opening up, which is now developing its own industry, which is developing the resources of the western part of the State, and, therefore, becoming one of the most productive and fastest growing parts of the South.', 'I run today as a candidate for the Democratic Party for the Presidency of the United States. As the candidate for the Presidency, I stand in succession to a good many distinguished Democrats who have served this country well, in times of crisis, have strengthened the economy of our country, and built us a position of respect around the world. I refer particularly to three Presidents in this century, Woodrow Wilson, the apostle of the New Freedom; Franklin D. Roosevelt, with the New Deal, which meant so much to the country and which helped rebuild the economy of the South; and Harry Truman and the Fair Deal.', 'I think we stand on the threshold of a new burst of energy for our country, which will strengthen our economy and also make us second to none around the world. That is our ambition as Americans, to see our country prosper, to see it live at peace, to see the kind of freedom which we have developed in this country become a path for people all around the globe.', 'My own feeling is that we cannot possibly be strong around the world, we cannot possibly be secure, unless we are moving ahead here at home. You cannot stand still in the United States and lead in Latin America. You cannot be a source of inspiration to the people of Latin America and Asia unless you are meeting and solving your own problems in your own country, providing full employment, using your resources well, making full use of the talent of your people, developing a strong and vigorous educational system, and matching in every way and surpassing the accomplishments of any other country', ""I think the great responsibility for us as Americans is to realize that if we fail, if we don't measure up to our potential, we not only betray our great system, but we also betray the cause of freedom, because if we fail, the cause of freedom fails. If we succeed, the cause of freedom succeeds. Therefore, I run for the Presidency not promising that if I am elected life will be easy, but promising that if I am elected this country will maintain its position, develop its resources and begin to move again."", 'A strong America second to none is our object, secure and respected overseas, and vital and energetic here at home. I ask your help in this campaign. It would be difficult to win this election without the support of North Carolina, and States like it. I think together North Carolina, which has played such a great role in the developing of our party in the past - I think we can all begin to move ahead. Thank you for the chance to be with you by telephone, and I hope it will be possible to be with you in person hefore the next 6 weeks have passed. Many thanks, indeed.']"

[Applause.]', ""I don't know what is locked up in Greensboro or High Point, but obviously it is something much bigger - I am sure it is not better, but it is bigger in High Point - since we have the key to unlock it."", 'I am here today as the Democratic nominee for the Presidency. I am reminded somewhat of the celebrated speech which the most celebrated Senator from my own State of Massachusetts gave during the great debate which led to the Compromise of 1860. In that famous speech, Daniel Webster began his talk by saying, ""I speak today not as a Massachusetts man and not as a Northerner. I speak today as an American merely for my cause.""', 'I speak today not as a Massachusetts man and not as a Northerner and not just as an American. I speak today in North Carolina as the standard bearer for the oldest political party in the world, the Democratic Party. [Applause.] And I am especially proud to be in good company today, to be traveling the State of North Carolina with your distinguished Governor, Luther Hodges, who was generous enough to support me for the Vice Presidency in 1956, as did a majority of the North Carolina delegates, and who now serves as the chairman of our business and professional committee in the United States. I hope that he will be able, if we are successful, to help us do in the country what he has done in rebuilding the economic vitality in the past year. [Applause.]', ""I am proud to be traveling also with my friend who I hope will be the Governor of this State, who, if we are both successful, will be working with me for a new day in North Carolina, while we work for a new frontier in the United States. And members of your senatorial delegation, Sam Ervin, with whom I served on the Rackets Committee for the United States, and for honest labor and management for 3 years; Senator Jordan, who has spoken for North Carolina and the country in the United States. Members of your congressional delegation, Carl Durham, who was in the Congress when I came there in 1947, and who is being succeeded this year by a man who is able to follow in Carl Durham's footsteps, your next Congressman from this district, Horace Kornegay. [Applause.] And my friend and former colleague, Charlie Deane, who has been my friend in other years and who is my friend this year."", 'I am delighted to be here today, and I come as I say, as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party. I am sure the people of North Carolina who have paid steadfast allegiance to our party since earliest beginnings now come to the election of 1960, and they are sure that they will make a careful judgment as to which way they shall go.', 'I think they should go with the Democrats, and I think they should go for this reason, that every time we have had a crisis in our history, and we have had many, in my judgment, the Democratic Party, beginning in the days of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland, and in this century in the days of Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman, have come down on the side of progress, have come down on the side of the people, have moved this country forward, have not stood still, and have made the name of the United States not only a powerful image to our citizens here in this country, but all around the world. The New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson was the domestic application of his 14 points. The New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt fitted in with his whole aspirations for the four freedoms around the world, and the Fair Deal of Harry Truman had its counterpart in world politics in the Marshall plan. Because they led here in the United States, they led around the world. I am not satisfied as an American to live in the most powerful country, the greatest country in the world, and see the balance of power begin to move away from us and in the direction of our adversaries.', 'I don\'t want some historian, 5 or 10 years from now, to look at 1950 and 1955 and 1960 and say, ""In those years the balance of power began to ebb, the tide began to run out on the United States."" I think our brightest days are ahead. But I don\'t think we are going to grasp the future unless we are willing to work for it. I think the chief task of a President of the United States is to set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, the things we have to do. I speak for Massachusetts in the Senate. Senator Jordan speaks for North Carolina. But the President of the United States speaks for Massachusetts, North Carolina, and the country, and unless he speaks, no one speaks for him, no Senator, no Congressman, no Governor. Only the President can do what Franklin Roosevelt did, and that is put before us what we must do to maintain our power and our influence, to build the economy of this State. [Applause]', ""It is a source of satisfaction to me that every 4 years the Republican candidates run on the Democratic platform. I am glad that they do. [Applause and laughter.] But what I would like to see them do is put it into effect for the next 4 years. Mr. Benson, who has been the Secretary of Agriculture for 8 years, is in Mr. Nixon's own words, the most remarkable Secretary of Agriculture in history. And the reason is that he has spent more money than any Secretary of Agriculture, he has been 8 years in office, he has high surpluses and a lower farm income in 20 years, and still says it is the Democrats' farm. Mr. Nixon, in Iowa yesterday, tried to cut Mr. Benson out of the herd. But I think that there is always going to be an equivalent of Mr. Benson as there was in the 1920's, as there has been in the 1950's, and as there was in the twenties and forties, in the opposition to the program which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman put forward. By their works ye shall know them. In 1930, 1940, and 1950, I cannot recall a single piece of new and progressive legislation at home or abroad put forward by the Republican Party. [Applause.]"", ""I don't say that if we win life will be easy. I think life will be difficult in the 1960's and 1970's. But this is a great country. I think its capacity is unlimited. Why should we be second best in the 1960's, militarily? Why should the Soviet Union produce twice as many scientists and engineers as we do? Why should young intellectuals and students and union leaders in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, why should they look to Peking for hope for the future instead of the United States? Why should both candidates in the presidential election in Brazil be running on an anti-American platform when we were in the 1930's a good neighbor? I think the United States has lost its image as a revolutionary, forward looking country. We celebrate today the anniversary of the Constitution Day. I hold the view that the Constitution is the most revolutionary document with the Declaration of Independence, ever written, and it should to the new countries serve as a source of stimulation and enterprise to them. We hold the view that the people will come first, not the government. We hold the view that every American, regardless of his religion or his race is entitled to his constitutional rights. [Applause.]"", ""We hold the view that the people make the best judgment in the long run. That is a revolutionary document. I don't hold Mr. Khrushchev's view that the United States is a sick and faltering horse, but I do realize that though we may quarantine him in Manhattan next week, and though we may do the same to Mr. Castro, we have not quarantined Castro in Latin America or Mr. Khrushchev in Africa. They move steadily outward. I therefore ask your support. I ask your support to rally around again, as North Carolina has on so many occasions, a Democratic Party which has produced men in this century like Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, and more importantly has produced a party and popular support which has permitted them to move this country ahead."", 'If we win this election, I can assure you that the Democratic Party will lead again, and this country will move.

128,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","['In 1584 Sir Walter Raleigh sent two ships to the New World to survey sites for a new colony.

Recently of course, Mr. Nixon has been trying to cut Mr. Benson out of the herd. But herds have a way of sticking together and in any Republican herd there will always be a Benson. And that's not what the American farmer wants."", 'What he does want is a Democratic Secretary of Agriculture a man who has the basic qualifications for the job.', 'First, he must believe that farming is a way of life as well as a way to make a living.', 'Second, he must be determined to achieve a balance between supply and demand, reduce farm surpluses, and insure the farmer a fair price in the market.', 'Third, he must be ready to work for the allround development of rural areas by increasing programs for soil and water conservation flood and drainage control, balanced development of forests and fisheries and transport, and local industries for the benefit of whole areas.', 'Fourth, the new Democratic Secretary of Agriculture must be a man who knows that the farmer is an important part of our society, that the farm is an important part of our economy, that the farm family must be brought back into the mainstream of American life to share, and share equitably, in the growth of the whole economy. And that means relief from the cost-price squeeze.', 'Only the Democratic Party can provide a Secretary of Agriculture with these qualifications for only the Democratic Party has proven that it cares for the farmer.', ""Franklin Roosevelt proved it in the 1930's with a whole program of legislation that saved the American farmer from Republican ruin."", ""Harry Truman proved it in the 1940's when he beat down Republican attempts to wreck those programs."", ""And the next Democratic administration will prove it again with a new program to bring prosperity back to our Nation's farms."", 'The Democratic program for tobacco, began under Franklin Roosevelt, saved the North Carolina tobacco farmer from ruin.', 'And today that tobacco program is the most successful program yet devised for keeping the production of a major crop in reasonable balance with demand and to insure a stable price from the grower. It has cost the country almost nothing and it has prevented the accumulation of surpluses. Programs for other farm commodities could well be modeled on it - for it proves that farmers can work together to manage their supplies and stabilize their industry.', ""And today, in the heart of America's tobacco land, I pledge myself to the continuation of the tobacco program - to be alert to opportunities to improve it - and to work to expand tobacco markets overseas. In fulfilling this pledge I will work with Congressman Harold Cooley and your two Senators, who have been my close consultants since my nomination."", 'I have discussed the problem of our rural areas with your next Governor - Terry Sanford. I like his approach. We see eye to eye on his ""positive program"" for better research, for better roads, for better cooperation between farmer and businessman and Government to bring the processing plants and other light industries into rural areas for balanced growth.', ""I am going to look to Terry Sanford for further advice in working out a sound program for Federal-State cooperation to reverse the disgraceful neglect of our rural population under 8 years of Ezra Taft Benson.

[Applause.] I am very grateful to be the guest of Eastern Carolina College. [Applause.] I understand that they have had a most rapid growth and now wish to play in the Southern Conference. [Applause.] I am scheduled in the Southern Conference, too, and find it with some difficulty, and I hope you have success and that I do, also. [Laughter and applause.]', 'I come here today as the nominee of the Democratic Party and, therefore, I stand in succession to a number of distinguished Americans who have borne the banner of the Democratic Party in good times and bad, but they have borne it high for the benefit of the United States of America.', 'North Carolina helped create the Democratic Party - the State of Virginia founded it, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison - and our party was given its modern form as the party of the people by a great citizen of this State, Andrew Jackson. I, therefore, come here today to ask your support in a difficult and trying time in the life of our country.', ""I do not run for the office of the President saying that if I am elected life will be easy. I think to be an American citizen in the 1960's will be a difficult and hazardous occupation. I believe that this is a great country, but I do believe that it can be a greater country. This is a powerful country, but I think it can be a more powerful country."", 'My chief disagreement with the Republicans in this campaign is that they have had too little faith in the development of this country. I think we can do better. [Applause.] Their campaign motto has been, ""You never had it so good."" Well, I think as a citizen of the United States, as well as a Democrat, that it is our obligation to do better, to build the economy of the State of North Carolina, to build the economy of the United States, and in so doing build the strength of the United States as a great and free country.', 'I think what Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman recognized was that this country cannot be strong and powerful in its world position unless it is strong and powerful here in the United States. I think that there is a direct relationship between the deterioration of our relative standing in the world in the last few years and the fact that we have not moved ahead here at home fast enough. Last year the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world, and when we grow at home here slowly, our prestige and power and influence around the world begins to diminish. Here we are, the richest country on earth, and yet in a hungry world we find ourselves unable to use in an imaginative and affirmative way the great surpluses that the Lord gave us.', 'Here today in the richest and most productive tobacco country in the United States, I come as the Democratic standard bearer, affirming the confidence and faith of the Democratic Party in a strong agricultural program. [Applause.] It is a source of satisfaction to me that for 2 months every 4 years the Republican candidate for the Presidency, whoever he may be, comes out strongly for an affirmative agricultural program. But day-by-day, month-by-month, year-by-year in the Congress, the burden has been carried by Congressman Cooley, the Democratic Senators from this State, Democratic Congressmen and Senators from the South and the Midwest. We believe, as Franklin Roosevelt believed, in his day, in an agricultural program that lifts the farmer up, that does not liquidate him, that does not catch him in a cost-price squeeze that liquidates his profits and drives him into the urban centers of the United States.', 'I stand in direct succession in a great tradition which I think has meant a good deal to North Carolina, and to my own State of Massachusetts and to the United States. I ask your support in this election, not merely as the Democratic standard bearer, but as one who has the greatest possible confidence and faith in the future of this country. Thomas Paine during the American Revolution said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960, and in the next decade, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. Our responsibility is to be the chief defender of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe. The future will not be easy, but I do think that if we meet our responsibilities here, here in the State of North Carolina, here in the United States, if we build a better life for our citizens here, whether they live in the cities of the North or the South, or whether they live on the farms of this country upon which our economy has traditionally depended, I think as we grow strong here, we hold out an inspiration to all those who wish to follow our example. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor to Latin America was because he was a good neighbor to the people of this country. [Applause.]', 'Today we celebrate Constitution Day, which is the day at the end of the Constitutional Convention when George Washington sent the Constitution to be ratified by the States. I stand to say that as the supporter of the American Constitution as the best and most happy way for the organization of our life, and I think our great ambition is to see the blessings of freedom spread, riot only in our own country, but around the world. A strong America, believing in freedom for all our citizens I think offers the best hope of freedom to all those who look to us with confidence and hope. [Applause.]', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I ask your help and I can assure you that if we are successful it will be my daily task to care for the needs and the hopes of our citizens and also to defend the United States in a time of great danger.', 'During the Constitutional Convention there was behind the desk of General Washington a painting of a sun low on the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered during the debate whether it was a rising or a setting sun. At the conclusion, Benjamin Franklin stood up. He said, ""Because of what we have done here, we now know that it is a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I think in 1960, it can be for the United States a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
130,John F. Kennedy ,"September 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I want to thank all of you. I understand this was a special day, and I want to thank you for coming in very much. It added to my education. Let me just say that I appreciate the plaque. That plaque describes the farm program which I think the Democratic Party stands for, and which I stand for. [Applause.]', 'I am glad to say that this is not a commitment which is made at election time, but a commitment which has been made and kept by Harold Cooley, the Senators from this State, the Congressmen from this State, Congressman Bonner, and the rest.', 'As the standard bearer of the Democratic Party it is to that program that I commit the party on this occasion, and if elected, in January, 1961. Thank you. [Applause]']"
131,John F. Kennedy ,"September 19, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you; Senator Byrd, Hewlitt Smith, ladies and gentlemen: I am grateful for the generous introduction of your distinguished U.S. Senator who has given Lyndon Johnson and myself unstinting support since the Democratic convention, and I appreciate what he said here tonight. Thank you very much. [Applause.] And I am delighted to be here on this platform with my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, who has spoken powerfully for the interests of West Virginia and also for the United States, Senator Jennings Randolph and your next U.S. Senator. [Applause.]', 'This State needs leadership if it is going to move forward. There is a Federal responsibility and a State responsibility, and I think that State responsibility can be met by electing your attorney general, your Governor, Wally Barron. [Applause.]', 'I am here tonight with Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark and members of your congressional delegation, and people from nine States, who have come to this conference in Charleston in order to talk about new jobs and new growth. I come back here to this State where I started last spring to express my appreciation for the support you gave me on that occasion [applause] - and now in view of the fact that West Virginia made it possible for me to be nominated, I am just asking you to help me along for another 6 weeks and get us elected. [Applause.]', 'I think it can be safely said that I am the only presidential candidate who does not need a guide to show him the road from Charleston to Beckley. [Applause.] I am the only presidential candidate who knows that you spell Mullens, W. Va., M-u-l-l-e-n-s. [Applause.] I have seen the industrial resources of the Kanawha Valley and the Ohio Valley, and I have traveled in counties in this State that desperately need the attention and the assistance of a government which looks forward and does not stand still. This conference here today on new jobs and new growth is part of the commitment which I made to the people of West Virginia in the primary, that 60 days after my election if I am elected, I will send to the Congress of the United States a program to assist West Virginia to move forward. [Applause.] And what I said last fall and what I say tonight I mean. I think this State has a great future. I took my case to the people of West Virginia last spring, but I have taken the case for West Virginia all over the United States [applause] because I think what I have seen in West Virginia, a State which has fought for this country in wartime, where the spirit runs strong in peacetime, which wants a chance to move ahead - I think West Virginia and parts of Pennsylvania and parts of Kentucky and southern Illinois, and parts of Indiana and parts of Ohio, and parts of Maryland - I think those sections of the United States which have been forgotten under this administration are only symptomatic of the lack of leadership which this country has had for the last 8 years. [Applause.]', 'The Republican candidate for the Presidency is running on a platform that you never had it so good. I would like them to tell that to the families in McDowell County and Logan and Mingo. I would like them to tell that to those Americans who see our prestige fading around the world, who see the Communists who now stride across the stage of the United Nations, who may be quarantined as Mr. Khrushchev and Castro are in Manhattan but are not quarantined as they spread their influence across Asia, and Latin America and Africa. I think we can do better. [Applause.] I think we can do better. I think we are a great country, but we can be a greater country, and I think we are a powerful country, but I think we can be more powerful, and the Democratic Party says of the sixties, ""Yes, we want to move forward,"" and the Republican Party has said in the last 8 years as it has said in every administration in this century, it has said no to progress, it has vetoed progress, it has had a program of no new starts, and on education and housing and distressed areas, and employment, this country has been standing still.', ""I spoke this afternoon to the United Steel Workers convention. We are using today only 50 percent of our capacity, and when we don't make steel, they don't mine coal in West Virginia, and when you don't make autos in Detroit, you don't make steel and you don't mine coal and you don't make chemicals and you stand still. I think we are going to have to do better. We are going to have to find 25,000 jobs every week for the next 10 years if we are going to keep our people working. [Applause.]"", 'Let me make it clear that I have come to this conference as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party, and I commit our party to a policy of full employment, as Franklin Roosevelt committed it in his generation during his administration. [Applause.] And on Inauguration Day next January, I pledge my administration to this policy, and I will send to the Congress specific programs designed to carry out the following objectives:', 'First, we will develop the resources of this country, clean our rivers, build our roads, put our workers to work in companies arid businesses which have the resources to use the great wealth which the Lord gave us in this State and around the country. [Applause.]', ""Secondly, we will stimulate private investment in a growing America by eliminating the artificial restrictions which this administration's high interest rate - tight money policy has placed on the growth of our economy. We spend $4 billion a year on interest on our debt more than we did 10 years ago, and every family that buys a car, a television set, an automobile, or a house pays interest on that additional debt. I think we should unleash the economy rather than attempting to restrict it if we are going to put our people back to work. [Applause.]"", ""Third, this administration has talked about Federal aid to education and they have talked about the desirability of having assistance for teachers' salaries. But in the last 8 years no bill has passed. The future of West Virginia and the future of the United States is tied up in our obtaining the best possible educational system for our children. The Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers and technicians as we are. If we are going to absorb the new technology, we are going to have to have the best trained people in the world, and they are going to come out of this State and the other 49 States. Therefore, we will suggest a program of Federal aid to education and for teachers' salaries to make sure that they are well trained and well paid. [Applause.]"", 'Fourth, we must recognize that the problem of automation is not a problem for a family or even for a company, or even for an industry. The problem of automation is a national problem, and I think it is incumbent on the next administration to call a national conference of representatives of our basic industries of labor unions, of working people, and the Government to try to bring better relief to our people, so that new machinery means better life rather than people out of work.', 'McDowell County, W. Va., mines more coal than it ever mined before, and there are more people receiving surplus food packages in McDowell County than in any other county of the United States. Automation did it, and automation will do it in the steel industry and the auto industry and the chemical industry and the glass industry of this State, unless the Federal Government turns its attention to it. I do not recall that this administration has concerned itself in the slightest with a problem which is entirely new, which can mean great blessings to us, but which can also mean great dangers to the American working men and women who need a job. [Applause.] And we will enact a bill which has passed the U.S. Senate twice, which has been vetoed twice, which provides assistance to those who live in distressed areas, which will help send Government contracts, which will provide loans for businessmen, which will provide vocational retraining, which will provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits, so that in these distressed areas where unemployment is 8, 9, and 10 percent, we can help these places move again. This is a national problem, not a problem for a county in West Virginia or a county in my own State of Massachusetts. This is a problem which faces the United States. It crosses into 9,10, or 11 States, and these are not people who live in India or Latin America. These are fellow Americans, and if I got any benefit out of my experience in West Virginia, it was because I saw what men and women and children in a rich country like the United States have passed through because of the indifference of this administration. [Applause.]', ""Let me say that this is not a problem just for West Virginia. This is a problem for the country, because if we are moving ahead here in the United States, if we are strengthening ourselves here, then the power and prestige of the United States increases. If we are standing still, if we give the impression that the future belongs to the Communists and not to us, if we are not able to meet our own problems, then we affect ourselves and our position and our children's position in the future. I ask your help in this campaign. I think this country is a great country, and I think it requires the dedicated effort of all of us. I think this country should move again I can assure you that I stand here tonight as the standard bearer of a party which has been led in other years by great Americans in this century, like Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and I pledge to you that what they tried to do [applause] what they tried to do in their day and in their generation, we are going to do again. If we win this election [applause] the Democratic Party will lead, and the United States will move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"
132,John F. Kennedy ,"September 19, 1960","['Senator RANDOLPH. May we have the quiet which I am sure you would desire that the next President of the United States will have the opportunity to answer the questions, the 10 best questions, which have been chosen by a committee for answering here tonight.', 'I want to emphasize what Hewlitt Smith said. These questions are to be asked of Jack Kennedy, and Jack Kennedy has no knowledge whatsoever of the questions which shall be asked him. All of those persons who ask the questions will receive personal answers by Senator Kennedy, but those 10 questions which have been chosen for tonight will be answered by Senator Kennedy at this time.', 'May we have the first question?', 'QUESTION. My question to Senator Kennedy was, Do you think our defense system has been adequate?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was whether our defenses have been adequate. I would say that the United States today is in a position of equality with the Soviet Union. What I think is of concern is that the relative rate of growth, the relative rate of increase in strength in the Soviet Union in comparison to that of the United States, or rather the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists, may be greater in the early sixties, not only in missiles, but also in conventional forces. I think we should particularly strengthen our missiles, our conventional forces, and our airlift. I would say that the next President of the United States in early 1961 should send a message to the Congress recommending that.', 'Senator RANDOLPH. And the next question.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am for you, but what can I say when people say they will not vote for you because of your religion?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would say to them that I think that West Virginia gave a good answer in the primary. I would say that there are many serious problems facing the United States. I have given every assurance which a man could give that I am as interested in maintaining religious liberty in the United States, and in fact around the world, as I could possibly give. I take an oath to sustain the Constitution, which I would do if I am elected. If I am not elected, I will continue to do it in the U.S. Senate. [Applause.] But I would hate to think after 14 years in the Congress, and after 18 years of service to this country, that all the problems which are before the State of West Virginia and all the problems which are before the United States in the most crucial time in the life of our country - I do not believe that anyone should be so unwise as to vote for me or against me because of my religion. [Applause.]', 'Senator RANDOLPH. And the third question.', 'QUESTION. I am for Mr. Kennedy. And may I visit you when you are the President of the United States in the White House? I have tried three times and cannot get in. [Laughter.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. Let's meet outside and we will get it all set. [Laughter]."", 'Senator RANDOLPH. The next question.', 'QUESTION. Hon. Senator Kennedy - Charles Rowe, Nicholas County, Summerville - I would like to ask this question: What is your viewpoint on organized labor?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I served on the Labor Committee for 14 years by choice. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor. I have been endorsed by the AFL-CIO nationally. I am against the racketeers wherever they may live. But I do believe that organized labor has permitted men and women to raise their standard of living to consume what we produce in this country, and I think that the labor unions of this country contribute to the general welfare and I am proud to have their endorsement. [Applause.]', 'Senator RANDOLPH. And the next question.', ""QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I would would like to know are you going to change West Virginia's diet from beans to strawberries?"", 'Senator RANDOLPH. Would you speak slowly?', 'Senator KENNEDY. You are talking to a Yankee now. I suppose that is what my accent sounds like down here. But what was that again?', ""QUESTION. Are you going to change West Virginia's diet from beans to strawberries. [Laughter.]"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, the question is whether we are going to [laughter and applause] - I am told you raise the finest strawberries in the world, so I am for it. We will send a few cranberries down from Massachusetts.', 'QUESTION. My name is John Alieo. I live at Smithers, W. Va. I would like to know why the minimum wage bill was not passed, your bill?', ""Senator KENNEDY. The bill for $1.25 passed the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1. It failed in the House of Representatives by 12 votes. We went to conference in the House and Senate to try to get an adjustment. We were informed in the conference that if we passed $1.25 an hour, it would be vetoed. When we tried to pass, and Jennings Randolph was on the conference, the very program that President Eisenhower had recommended to the conference of $1.15 an hour, and the coverage was 3 million, 6 out of 7 voted against it. Anyone that thinks you ought not receive in a business that has $1 million worth of income, and that was our standard, that somebody should not receive $1.25 an hour for a 40-hour week, if you think that paying 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week is sufficient, I would vote Republican. I don't think it is enough. [Applause.]"", 'Senator RANDOLPH. Senator Kennedy, the next President of the United States, do you favor the old international policy of Teddy Roosevelt, ""Walk lightly but carry a big stick""?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would certainly say that it ought to be our prescription in the sixties. What I object to about some of the fifties has been that we have talked louder and louder and our stick is getting smaller and smaller compared to our commitments. I think Theodore Roosevelt was right. [Applause.]', ""Well, let me just express my thanks to all of you. I guess we are off television. What I said in my speech I meant. I would not have gotten nominated if I had not won in West Virginia. Everybody in West Virginia was being polled, and we thought we were going to maybe not win. But we won by a large margin, and there isn't any doubt in my mind that West Virginia really nominated the Democratic Presidential candidate. So I am most indebted to you. [Applause.]"", 'May I say that the donkey has a long memory as well as the elephant. So I take the commitments which I have made in this State very seriously. You have been extremely generous to me and I hope, if we are successful, that it will be possible, because I think it is in the national interest. We will concern ourselves immediately about the opportunities which are in this State, which is a rich State in resources and rich in people. Thank you very much. [Applause; standing ovation.]']"

President McDonald, Secretary Treasurer Abel, Vice President Hague, delegates to the 10th Constitutional Convention of the United Steel workers of America and their friends, this is the third time in 4 years that I have been the guest of the United Steelworkers, and I am proud to be here today. [Applause.]', 'We have met together in Los Angeles, in Atlantic City, and we are going to meet together in a discussion of the problems that face this country in the coming years. [Applause.] Let me say first that I am proud to have the endorsement of the United Steel Workers for the office of the President of the United States. I accept that endorsement. [Applause.]', ""Last week at the machinists' convention, Mr. Nixon criticized me and misquoted me for identifying myself too closely with the aims of organized labor. He took out of context a speech that I made at Detroit on Labor Day, in which I said that I know that organized labor wants the things that I want for the United States, they want better schools and better hospitals, and they want this country to move forward, and I said on that occasion that organized labor opposes lethargy and economic standstill and weakness at home and weakness abroad. I think the working men and women of this country want what everyone else wants. They want this country to be second to none. They want this country to move. [Applause.]"", 'I would remind Mr. Nixon of what another American said on an earlier occasion: ""All that serves labor serves the Nation. All that harms labor is treason to America. No line can be drawn between the two."" That was not Harry Truman and it was not Franklin Roosevelt. It was Abraham Lincoln. [Applause.]', 'We come and meet at this convention in a difficult and trying time in the life of our country, and as the standard bearer for the oldest political party on earth, I bear, and I think my party bears, a great responsibility. The United States moves in a period of danger.', 'We are anxious that from this campaign the United States shall gather renewed strength. It is our obligation during the coming 6 or 7 weeks to present to the American people an alternative course of action so that they shall have the opportunity, the American people, to make a choice as to which way they want to go. I think the choice is very clear, and I think the choice has been placed before us not only by the Democrats and by myself, but it has been placed before us by Mr. Nixon and the members of the Republican Party who speak for him. Mr. Nixon has gone through the country saying that we cry ""doom and gloom."" He has gone through the country saying we have never had it so good. I go through the country saying that this is a great and rich country, but I think it can be a greater country and a richer country and a more powerful country. [Applause.]', ""I do not believe that the period of the 1960's is a period in which we can conserve, in which we stand still, in which we gather ourselves for renewed effort. We have done that in the 1950's. I think the 1960's are the time for new effort. This election is not 1900. This election is 1912 and 1932 and 1948. This is a time for new go-ahead for this country and the American people. [Applause.] And I shall continue during the coming 6 weeks to present the alternative to the present course of action to the American people."", ""And what is that alternative? I think the alternative is written in the record of the two parties in this history. I did not suddenly spring up after the Democratic Convention. The Democratic Party was not invented in the last 6 weeks, nor was the Republican Party. Mr. Nixon's record and my record are not both statements we have made in the last few days of the campaign. The record which I have written, the record which I have written for 14 years in the Congress and the record which the Democratic Party has written through 160 years of service to the Nation, are well known to the American people. [Applause.]"", 'And I put the challenge to them in a few words; can you tell me, not in the last 8 years, but in the last century, since the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, can you tell me a single piece of domestic social legislation that served the people that has been initially proposed by the Republican Party? [Response from the floor.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. Social security, minimum wage, civil rights legislation in the Congress - the Republicans dominated the country and the Congress for years, for nearly a century after the Civil War. Can you tell me when the Congress ever passed a single piece of legislation giving equal rights to our citizens in all that period of time? Did they in 1953 and 1954 when the Congress was dominated by the Republican Party pass a single piece of legislation protecting the rights of our citizens?', '[Response from the floor.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. Was a single piece of legislation passed in those years that increased the minimum wage of our people, that increased their social security, that increased public housing, that increased private housing? Can you tell me what the position was of the Republican Party in the August session of the Congress on minimum wage? It was opposition to the $1.25 an hour, and it was opposition, wholehearted opposition, to providing medical care for our elder citizens. One Republican voted for it and 44 Democrats voted for it. That is the record which is before the American people. I think the choice is very clear. To those Americans who want to stand still, who look back, I say they should vote for the Republican Party. To those Americans who are not satisfied, who may feel that we are ahead, as Mr. Nixon said to Mr. Khrushchev, in color television, I am not satisfied, while he was ahead in rockets. I am not satisfied. I can look at color television and have rockets. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon, speaking in Portland, Oreg., said: ""There are those who are going around the country crying \'doom and gloom,\' but we just built the largest shopping center in the world.""', 'I am not satisfied to have the largest shopping center as long as the Soviet Union is moving in Latin America, Asia, and Cuba. I think we can do better; that is the question before us in 1960. [Applause.]', 'Now, if there is any group in the United States who recognizes the need to do better it is the men and women who are here at this convention. The production of steel is the hallmark of an industrial society. If the Soviet Union overnight should knock out 50 percent of our steel capacity we would feel we were ruined. And yet the economic policies of this administration have contributed to one-half of our steel capacity being unused, 100,000 of our steelworkers out of work, other thousands working part time. Who can say that they have never had it so good? They have had it better and they are going to have it better. [Applause.]', ""Are we going to slip and slide through the 1960's? Are we going to have a recession in 1954 and 1958 and a slowdown in 1960, and the future bringing we don't know what in 1961? Are we going to have economic policies and leadership which provides a stifling of the American economy when we need schools and hospitals and roads and private investment? Are we going to stand still and become as we were last year, the lowest country or economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world? Or are we going to go ahead? Are we going to move again? [Response from the floor.]"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I think this is a serious election, and I think we offer a clear alternative to the American people. This union has seen good times and bad times. This union went through a strike of over 6 months, during the last year. That strike came in part because the steel companies in 1957 had their last great year when their productive capacity was used to the full. Steel settlements come from two factors, first from both the union and the company, recognizing their public obligation, and secondly, when the economy is moving along so that there is an incentive on both the company and the union to get together, to make a contract, to go back to work. But if the steel companies find that one-half of their capacity produces as much steel as the market is consuming, or if they feel that they can produce in 6 months what the market consumes in a year, then they would just as soon face up and say, ""Let\'s settle this matter right now, let us rewrite our working standards, let\'s stand still, let them strike. We will use up our inventory, use up our backlog, and 6 months from now we can go back to work and our profits will still be up.""', 'You get an agreement when there is a need for steel, you get an agreement when the economy is moving ahead, you get an agreement when there is incentive on both sides to sign a contract and get back to work. So the difficulties of last year were not only tied up with the inequities of the Taft-Hartley Act emergency section, but they were also tied up with the fact that 1959 was not a boom year. As long as you have a slowdown in our economy, so long will you find it difficult to work out satisfactory collective bargaining procedures.', 'Dave McDonald, who has been a friend of mine and supporter for many months and years, has put forward a suggestion that the only way to meet the problem of overabundance is to have a 32-hour week. [Applause.] My own feeling is I would prefer a different solution. I would prefer the solution of this economy going ahead at such full blast that in 40 hours a week we barely produce what we can consume, that at the time when we have a productive race with the Soviet Union, at a time when we need all the steel we can get to take care of a population which is increasing and which will double in 40 years, I would like to see economic and fiscal policies by this Government will be directed toward stimulating the economy so that the steel industry works full time and so your people go back to work.', 'I respect his suggestion, and we are friends enough so that we can disagree. Our objective is the same; full time work for our people, enough leisure to enjoy themselves. [Applause.] But I feel before we move to 32 hours that we should try an administration which is dedicated to full economic growth, which wants our people and our country working, which wants our steel pouring out, which wants us to grow comparable to that of Western Germany and France and England, which doubled the economic growth of the United States last year.', 'I come here today as a man who has served on that Committee on Labor for 14 years, and I come here today as the candidate for the Democratic Party, and more important than that, I come here as the standard bearer for a party in direct line of succession with three great Presidents of this country in this century, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.] I think the theme for our party and country was said by Franklin Roosevelt when he came before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, Philadelphia, in 1936, to accept the second Presidential nomination. In that speech he said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'I think for the last 8 years we have had a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. As long as there are 15 million Americans living in substandard housing, as long as the average unemployment compensation check for workers thrown out of work in this country is $32 a week, as long as there are millions of Americans who do not even receive the inadequate $1 an hour minimum wage, as long as the average check for laundry women in five large cities of this country is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week, as long as there are 4 million families receiving a food surplus package from our Government every month, so long is there need for the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', ""What I have been saying to you today affects the security of the United States, and it affects our security around the world. If the United States is strong and moving here at home, then we will be moving around the world. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor to Latin America was because he was a good neighbor to the Americans. [Applause.] If we are moving at home, if we have full employment in this country, if our automobile and steel and oil and coal is working and putting our people to work and producing, then our future is secure, because we set up here in the United States not only the kind of society under which we want to live, but we set up the kind of society which people all over the world will want to follow. I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy. I think the 1960's will be difficult. But I do run for the office of the Presidency saying that we can do better, and that we must do better."", 'This is the great issue. Those who want to stay and those who want to go, those who say ""Yes"" to the 1960\'s, and those who say ""No,"" those who look to the past and those who look to the future, I think the alternative is clear before us, and I join with those who in this country during the last century have moved ahead, have broken new ground.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join me. Give me your help, your hand, your voice, and we can move this country ahead. Thank you. [Applause.]', ""I will give you one more thought before I leave this happy hall. [Applause.] Let me just say that in this election I am reminded 100 years later, and I think all of us are interested in our families, in their security and our country's security, and we are also interested in what happens to the United States around the world. I think whoever is going to be the next President of the United States must recognize that it will be a task more burdensome, more heavy, with decisions which involve us all more deeply than ever before in this country's history. But this is not a race merely between Mr. Nixon and myself. And in a very real sense it is not a race just between the members of two political parties. I think it is the kind of decision which is comparable to the decision which the United States made in 1932. In 1932 the United States, I think, took a decision which preserved freedom here in the United States. I think the great issue in 1960 is for us to take the kind of decisions which will preserve freedom around the world."", ""Thomas Paine said in the Revolution of 1776 that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind. I think in 1960 the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we fail, I think the case of freedom fails, not only in the United States, but every place. If we succeed, if we meet our responsibilities, if we bear our burdens, than I think freedom succeeds here and also it succeeds around the world. Mr. Khrushchev has said that our children will be Communists. I don't accept that view. I think if we do what we have to do, if we start this country boiling again, then I think there is every prospect that his children will be Communists."", 'I am reminded in the fact of the election of 1860 that Lincoln, hard pressed, wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and I see His hand in it. If He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you.

President Truman told me the other night that his campaign train ran out of funds three times in 1948 and they had to come and get him. [Laughter.] We are trying to keep going."", 'We are in shape for the next week or l0 days, but we have to have some help. So I want to express my appreciation to you. I know you have a good many other problems and responsibilities, but this kind of assistance you are giving us is the kind of assistance that will permit us to carry our message through this State and through the United States. We have many obstacles, many responsibilities in this campaign, but I do feel, after having been on the road now for more than 2 weeks, I do feel that if we can keep this campaign moving for the next 6 weeks, if we can keep the campaign presented to the American people, if we can go on radio and television, if we can do all the things that need to be done to get our message across, I think in 1960 the people of this State and the people of this country are going to choose to move forward with the Democratic Party once again. [Applause.] I think you are all coming to the auditorium where we are going to go through a lot of this again. I did want to come down today specifically to thank you, because this is the kind of thing which makes it possible for us to carry this campaign and I am most appreciative. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
135,John F. Kennedy ,"September 19, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Officers of the Chemical Workers, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today, and I am delighted to be in the company of my colleague in the Congress of the United States, my colleague on the Labor Committee, your next speaker Congressman James Roosevelt [applause] and with the distinguished Governor of the State of New Jersey, Robert Meyner [applause].', 'I come here today not only as the candidate of the Democratic Party in this most vital election, but I come here as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate, after having served for over 14 years on the Labor Committees of the Congress. The United States is faced today with a difficult and dangerous period of history and I think that in the coming week or two, the greatest sense of responsibility, the greatest restraint will be placed upon all of us, those of us who conduct the campaigns in this difficult time, upon the President of the United States, upon the Secretary of State. So that when the present period of tension which now exists at the United Nations shall be over, we shall find, I hope, the United States in a stronger position rather than in a weaker position. Therefore, what I say to you today is devoted to what we can do in our own area of competence in order to strengthen the United States.', ""I think that those of you who are members of this important union recognize that the 1960's are going to bring you union problems because it is going to bring the United States many industrial changes, and many problems which will affect your union, and also affect the men and women who work in the chemical industry."", 'In your paper, the Chemical Workers, which is distributed here and which I was just looking at, there is an article on page 9 which I would like to see the next President of the United States study very carefully, whoever he may be, and that is the article which says, ""Automation turns from blue to white."" [Applause.]', 'I have traveled in the last 2 years to every State in the United States. I spent a month in West Virginia, and I saw not only the coal mines of West Virginia and the coal miners who had been displaced - I spent some days in McDowell County, W. Va., which mines more coal than it ever has in history and has more families receiving more surplus food packages than any county of the United States. But I also traveled in the Ohio Valley, and in the Kanawha Valley, which has two great industrial complexes which particularly feature chemical production, and there we would drive for yard after yard or walk yard after yard and every 100 yards we would see one worker or two workers and this tremendous industrial complex, administered by relatively few men when I am sure 15 or 20 years ago in a comparable output we would have seen dozens and hundreds of men and women working in those plants.', 'The task which faces you as a union is to adjust yourselves to these tremendous industrial changes which are going to bring white-collar workers where blue-collar workers once dominated. The problem for us as citizens of the United States, the problem for us, those of us who serve in the Government, in the Congress or in the executive branch, is how we can maintain full employment, how we can absorb the production of our industries, how we can provide for the orderly transition from present production methods into new production methods without displacing our workers, how we can in short in the steel industry, in the chemical industry, in the oil industry, in the newspaper industry, how we can provide labor-saving machinery at the same time maintaining full employment, at the same time making sure that those machines produce a better life rather than a life of unemployment for so many of our citizens. [Applause.]', ""I consider that to be in agriculture and industry the No.1 domestic problem which the next President of the United States is going to have to face. I don't think this administration really has thought about it at all. I do not recall except occasional speeches, spaced months apart, where this Government has turned its attention to the problems of automation, to the problems of employment, to the problems of maintaining full employment in a technological revolution here at home as well as around the world."", ""I would think that one of the first things that the next President of the United States must do is to call a conference of the Federal Government of the basic industries, the managers of the basic industries, the leaders of organized labor in the basic industries, to consider what steps can be taken to provide for the orderly transition of new machinery into our Government, into our industry; in other words, to address ourselves as a national problem, not as an industry problem, not as a company problem, but as a national problem to the problem of automation in the early 1960's. I think it is an entirely new problem, it is a problem which did not disturb the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman. It is a problem which is now on the horizon no bigger than a man's hand. But it is a problem which will disturb the lives of all of us in the next decade unless we move to it at once. I can assure you that if I am elected to the office of the Presidency, or if I maintain my position as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, that I think it is a problem to which we must address ourselves early in 1961. We will require the cooperation of the members of the Chemical Union. We will require the cooperation of the leadership of this union - the kind of studies which you are undertaking today, in cooperation with management in these companies, and in other industries stretching across the United States."", 'It is the kind of new problem which I think our party, which I am a member of, the Democratic Party, is best equipped to meet. [Applause.]', 'If there is one contribution or one quality for which the Democratic Party has been noted since its earliest beginnings, since the time of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson, stretching through the administrations of Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, it has been its willingness to break new ground, to look ahead, not to stand still. No Democrat has ever run for the Presidency with a motto, ""You Never Had It So Good."" Every Democratic President who has served this country in times of crisis has looked to the future. The slogans of our party in this century tell the story of our party; Woodrow Wilson\'s New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt\'s New Deal, Harry Truman\'s Fair Deal, Adlai Stevenson\'s New America, and now I talk today in 1960 about the New Frontiers of the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', ""No Democrat has ever run for the Presidency standing pat with McKinley or returning to normalcy with Harding, or keeping cool with Coolidge. [Applause.] Those who are satisfied with things as they are, those who wish to stand still, those who look back to the good old days, I don't think they should come with us in the 1960's. [Applause.] But those who want to move this country, those who think we can do better, those who think that there are better days still ahead, those who think that it is time that the Government and the people devoted themselves to the great unfinished business of our society - as Franklin Roosevelt did in his administration, and Woodrow Wilson in his, and Harry Truman in his - I hope they will come with us. [Applause.)"", ""We don't promise any easy future at home and abroad because there is no easy life for a citizen of the United States who bears his responsibilities in 1960. But we can say to you that the Democratic Party, as it has so often in the past, is prepared to lead; and if we are successful this country will move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"
136,John F. Kennedy ,"September 19, 1960","['I am glad to be back in West Virginia. I owe much to this State and its people. For you proved that the experts had underrated you that they had underrated the American people. You proved that they were concerned with real problems and important issues, with economic stagnation at home and declining prestige abroad - and that they would vote for the leadership they thought would best meet those problems.', 'I have traveled a long way since the people of West Virginia put me on the road to the Democratic presidential nomination. My campaign plane has taken me from Texas to Alaska, from Maine to California. And everywhere I have gone I have seen what I saw in West Virginia.', 'I have seen an America deeply concerned over the failures of the past 8 years - an America alarmed at the drift and complacency which grip the great Republic - an America looking for new leadership - and turning for that leadership to the Democratic Party.', ""I return here to tell you that, just as I took my case for the nomination to the people of West Virginia in the spring, I am taking your case to the people of the United States this fall. Everywhere I have gone across this great land I have told your story of courage - about the State that refused to die - about the towns that refused to give up - and about the men who can't find jobs but keep looking - of the hungry families, the poverty-stricken mining towns, the stricken industries that keep hoping."", 'I have told them the story of a State with courageous and determined people - a State rich in resources and the skills of its workers, but a State which is being denied its rightful share in American abundance by the indifference and neglect of the Republican Party. And the people of America have listened. I have repeated to them my pledge to West Virginia - the pledge of a New Deal for your State. And I believe that, in November, the American people are going to elect a President willing to carry out that pledge.', 'But the problems of unemployment and poverty are not confined to West Virginia. This conference proves that. For in each of the States represented here there are men out of work and industries in distress. Throughout the entire Nation men and women - almost 4 million of them - are looking for jobs.', 'Economists tell us that an unemployment rate of 6 percent is the danger signal. When a community passes that point it is officially regarded as an area of ""substantial labor surplus."" If it remains there it is entitled to special Government help through defense procurement and other programs. But today the unemployment rate for the entire Nation is nearly 6 percent. The whole United States is rapidly becoming an area of substantial labor surplus.', 'Yet the Republican candidate for President is boasting that this is ""the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed.""', 'I challenge Mr. Nixon to tell that to the people of West Virginia, or Pennsylvania, or Kentucky. I challenge him to tell that to the 4 million people who are out of work, or to the 3 million more who are forced to work only part time - to the 1 out of every 10 Americans who, in the richest country in the history of the world, are forced to get by on a partial paycheck or none at all.', 'And these figures do not tell the full hardship of looking for work week after week. For in 1959 it took the average unemployed worker longer to find a job than at any period since the last time the Republicans were in power - in the days of the great depression. And in both 1958 and 1959, an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 weeks - the highest number since before the war.', 'These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans forced to live on an unhealthy tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy.', 'What, then, does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work, the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right.', ""But Mr. Nixon forgets that when people aren't working they spend less for food, and the farmers suffer."", ""They don't buy cars and the automobile industry suffers."", ""They don't shop as often or buy as much - and every storekeeper and shopkeeper suffers."", ""They can't buy houses, and homebuilders suffer."", 'The are kept from contributing their labor and skills to America - and all America suffers.', 'Mr. Nixon does not understand - just as Republicans have never understood - that America is not truly prosperous unless every American is permitted to share in the prosperity. Franklin Roosevelt once reminded us that ""we cannot be content * * * if some fraction of our people - whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth - is ill fed, ill clothed, ill housed, and insecure."" But Mr. Nixon and the party he leads say they are content, just as they have always been content, in the face of poverty and unemployment and an America with its most urgent needs unmet.', 'The Republican Party which Mr. Nixon leads today is the same Republican Party which for half a century has opposed every single progressive measure which the Democrats have designed to improve human welfare and reduce human misery - the party which fought against the New Deal and tried to block the Fair Deal - the party which, in the past 8 years has voted aid to areas of unemployment, blocked efforts to improve unemployment compensation, opposed raising the minimum wage, refused to expand the distribution of surplus food to the hungry, and failed to offer one single program to increase the welfare of the American people.', ""But Americans will not forget Mr. Nixon's party this November - and they will return the Democrats to leadership so that all Americans can share in American abundance."", ""In the long run, there is only one way to put men back to work - by stimulating the growth of our economy. Today America's economy is growing more slowly than that of nearly every other industrial nation in the world. It is growing one-third as fast as the Soviet Union and little more than one-half of our own rate of growth under the administration of Harry Truman. A growing economy will mean more industry, greater production and more jobs - but a stagnant economy means idle plants and idle men."", 'I have come to this conference here in West Virginia to commit our party once again to the policy of full employment. And on Inauguration Day, next January, I will pledge my administration to that policy - and I will send to the Congress specific programs designed to carry it out.', 'First we will develop great public resources which make it possible for private enterprise to grow and prosper. Industry needs transportation, and power, and natural resources, and decent homes for its workers if it is to increase production and create new jobs. These are programs which only the Government can carry out - they can be carried out without inflation or deficits - but they are programs which the Republicans have failed to carry out.', 'Second, we will stimulate private investment in a growing America by eliminating artificial, Republican restrictions on the supply of money - restrictions which have made it difficult for existing business to get funds for expansion - and for new businesses to get started.', 'Third, we will permit every American child to receive the kind of education which will produce the skills and creativity which a growing America desperately needs. Today our schools are overcrowded and our teachers ill-paid. Yet our advanced technological society depends on the resources of the mind for scientific advances, the development of new industries and increased productivity This problem is a national problem - and the National Government must act to meet it.', 'Fourth we must move immediately to meet the growing crisis of automation - the replacement of men by machines. You have felt the impact of automation in your coal mines and steel mills - and the impact is spreading. Yet the Republicans have done nothing to harness the benefits of modern technology for all America, while insuring that displaced men can find new uses for their skills. This problem can be solved - through a nationwide conference of industry and labor to map a strategy for putting displaced men back to work - through technical assistance to plants which want to adjust to modern machinery without undue hardship on their workers - through programs of retraining displaced workers - and through expanding the employment services of the U.S. Government so that men can find new job opportunities.', ""Fifth, we must give special assistance to help hard-hit areas catch up. Twice a Democratic Congress has passed a bill to aid areas where men have long been out of work - and twice the Republicans have vetoed this bill. Last week the Republican candidate for Vice President said that the Republicans were considering a program to help distressed areas. But they weren't considering West Virginia's problems when they vetoed these bills - or when they opposed every other effort to help. The Republicans consider your problems only at election time - and they forget them immediately thereafter. We Democrats will not forget - and a bill to help distressed areas will be signed into law by a Democratic President next year."", 'Much more needs to be done. We must give special attention to industries like coal which have been especially hard hit. A growing America needs growing supplies of energy - and coal can help supply that energy if we engage in a broad, dynamic program of coal research to find new uses for coal, and if we strive to expand and diversify existing markets.', 'But in our effort to create a growing America - an America which will someday provide a job for every man who wants to work - we must not forget about those who are out of work today.', 'We need to enact Federal standards of unemployment compensation so that jobless men can receive benefits adequate to allow them to obtain at least the basic rudiments of existence.', 'We need to offer a richer and more varied diet to those forced to live on surplus foods.', 'We need to help unemployed young people, and aid our resource development, through the creation of a Youth Conservation Corps.', 'These are the specifics of a Democratic program for growth and full employment. But this is not an entirely new program - nor are the problems it seeks to meet, new problems. For this spring I spent more than a month in West Virginia. I traveled from Slab Fork to Wheeling, from Huntington to Charleston. I met your people, and learned more about your problems than any other candidate for President since 1924 when a West Virginian was a candidate, more than Mr. Nixon can ever learn in the 1 day or 2 he expects to spend here.', 'During your primary I pledged that within 60 days of my election I would send to the Congress a complete program to restore and revive the economy of West Virginia - to bring new industry and new jobs to your State, and all the other neglected areas of our country. Today, I reaffirm that pledge. And, with your help, I will carry it out this January.', 'By providing work for our people - by stimulating the growth of our economy - we not only meet our needs here at home, we strengthen the cause of freedom all over the world.', 'In every part of our globe people are striving to eliminate the hunger and poverty and misery which now blanket so much of the earth. They are looking for leadership in this great undertaking. The great question of our time is whether they will look to Moscow to find this leadership whether they will look to America.', ""Only if America is growing - only if it is caring for the needs of its own people - only then will other nations know that the road of progress is freedom's road - and only then will the cause of freedom triumph.""]"

138,John F. Kennedy ,"September 20, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governors and Senators, fellow Democrats, ladies and gentlemen: 100 years ago this year, the American people were engaged in a great Presidential campaign. One of the nominees, Abraham Lincoln, put the issue to the country as to whether the country could exist half slave and half free. Today, 100 years later, we are now engaged in another presidential campaign, and the great question confronting the country today is can the world exist half slave and half free. Will it begin to move in the direction of freedom [applause] - will it move in the direction of freedom in the next half decade? Will it move in the direction of slavery? Or will the world be destroyed in another nuclear war? That is the question which faces our generation, and it is the most solemn question that this Nation or the world has ever faced. On my way to visit Russia in 1939, I passed through Poland and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia and Hungary. They were free and independent nations, while the Soviet Union was isolated in its tyranny. But in 1955, I saw the people of Eastern Europe again. Their freedom was gone and in its place was the most cruel change that one nation ever had applied to another. No man could speak his mind. No home was safe and there was no freedom of religious worship. Mr. Khrushchev is in our country now, as he was a year ago, confident that all is going his way, smug in his recent successes, and piously talking about peace, colonialism, and disarmament.', 'But how can you talk of peace, Mr. Khrushchev, when you and your Chinese Communist friends are undermining the peace every day, creating disorder and danger wherever you move? How can you talk of colonialism when you are surrounded by your puppet dictators and when you hold in an iron grip a great empire stretching from East Berlin to Vietnam? How can you talk of the achievements of your system, even if you beat us again by putting a man into outer space? For we know that while you may bring a man back from outer space, you rarely bring one back alive from Siberia. [Applause.] And that is why this Nation and the next President must dedicate every effort of mind and spirit to the fight for peace and freedom.', 'Shaking our finger at Mr. Khrushchev is not enough. Debating him at the United Nations is not enough. Restricting him to Manhattan Island this week is not enough [applause] because this does not confine him in Asia, Africa, or Latin America. [Applause.]', 'This is no ordinary enemy and this is no ordinary struggle. Extraordinary efforts are called for by every American who knows the value of freedom and who believes that this country still has its greatest contributions to make to that cause. Some people say it is wrong to say that we could be stronger, it is dangerous to say that we could be more secure. But in times such as these, I say it is wrong and dangerous for any American to keep silent about our future if he is not satisfied with what is being done to preserve that future. [Applause.] For I am not satisfied when the President of the United States is insulted by a dictator in Paris, or by a mob in Tokyo. I am not satisfied to be second in outer space and second to the moon. I have heard all the excuses, but I believe not in an America that is ""First, but,"" ""First, if,"" or ""First, when,"" but ""First,"" period. [Applause.]', 'Finally I am not satisfied to have the hand of the Communists move 3,000 miles from East Berlin to our former good neighbor in Cuba, only 90 miles from the coast of Florida, only 8 minutes by jet. [Applause.] Three years ago when I was in Cuba, the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba. Today the Soviet Ambassador is.', 'These are not problems to be set aside in a neat compartment called foreign policy. My opponent says that he is a risk taker abroad and a conservative at home. I am neither. I am not a risk taker abroad and I am not a conservative at home [applause] if by being a conservative means that we say ""No"" to the next decade, if it means we look back instead of ahead, if it means we lack the passion for our own people and lack vigor in our policies. When we waste food in this country, when we condemn millions of our older citizens to live out their lives without security and without medical care, when we condemn millions of our children to live in inadequate housing or go to schools part time, taught by teachers inadequately paid, when we fail to make full use of our steel and our coal and our lead and our zinc, when we permit racial or religious discrimination in any part of our country, what effect does that have on the rest of the world where we are a small minority? This Nation, if it is not to stand alone, has to earn the trust and respect of others.', 'The reason why Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were successful in their policies around the world, the reason that Franklin Roosevelt was greeted as a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. [Applause.] And because the world knew that they practiced at home what they preached abroad. [Applause.]', 'But today the Communists stir up their troubles, their anti-American resentment that festers in too many countries, particularly among the people who are hungry, sick, and poor, and almost every area of crisis in the last years has been in countries where the people are poor, Laos and Cuba and the Congo and Algeria and Iraq and Guatemala and all the rest. These nations know that we are against communism, but they want to know are we also for the people. They judge us abroad by what we do here at home, by what our two great parties stand for here in the United States. A party that opposes decent medical care for our older citizens, that opposes building classrooms for our children, that says though it is the richest and most prosperous country in the world that it cannot afford the best educational system, that it opposes paying a minimum wage to women who work long hours in some of our stores, we cannot on that basis appeal to people in less fortunate countries that grew up reading Lincoln and Wilson and Roosevelt. [Applause.]', ""They were the Presidents of the United States who led, and I think in the next 8 years the United States is going to have to lead again. We cannot be bound by the last 8 years. We cannot be committed by a party of the past. We cannot wait for Mr. Khrushchev's words, for the Communists are not satisfied with their gains of the last months, with their lead in missiles and space, and their foothold in Cuba, and half of Indochina, and their new influence in Laos and Africa and Asia. They will keep on driving and expanding and gaining without regard to all the kitchen debates and without regard to what goes on in the United Nations unless we have a President and a country in the 1960's that acts first and acts fast. [Applause.]"", ""Much can be done in the next 4 years, but the administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt show that the first 90 days of the next President's administration will be the crucial days. [Applause.] Therefore, I think the next President of the United States must assert leadership on three fronts:"", ""First, on the military front. The next President must promptly send to the Congress a special message requesting the funds and the authority necessary to give us a nuclear capacity second to none, making us invulnerable to any attack, and have conventional forces so strong and so mobile that they can stamp out a brush fire war before it spreads. Only then can we get Mr. Khrushchev and the Chinese Communists to talk about disarmament, because having the second best defensive hand in the 1960's will be like having the second best poker hand. [Applause.]"", 'Second, on the nonmilitary front, the next President must promptly request our more prosperous NATO allies, and I hope Japan and others, to join with us in approaching each underdeveloped nation of the world, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, to request the establishment, either multilaterally, bilaterally, or through the United Nations, of regional development plans, coordinating and stimulating the flow of those are as of long-term public and private capital, surplus foods and technical assistance, with special emphasis on assisting those countries to educate their citizens so that they can be prepared for self-government. [Applause.]', 'Third, the next President of the United States must be prepared in the first 3 months of his office to send to the Congress messages that will deal with wiping out poverty here in the United States, which will deal with the problems of full employment, of a higher minimum wage, of better social security for our older citizens, more slum clearance, and aid to depressed areas, more help for the marginal farmer and the sharecropper, a concentrated drive on illiteracy, improved distribution of surplus foods because over 4 million Americans wait every month for those surplus food packages, and a better economic break for all Americans regardless of where they live and regardless of their economic status. [Applause.]', 'The effect of an economic drive on poverty here in the United States, of going to work in this country, of moving our country again, can have the greatest possible repercussions abroad in the security of the United States. [Applause.]', 'These are, of course, only three items on a long agenda that will face the country and the President and the next Congress in January 1961, and I do not pretend that we in the Democratic Party have all the answers to most difficult questions. Senator Johnson and I do not run for the Office of the Presidency and Vice Presidency promising that life is going to be easy in the future. We do not campaign stressing what our country is going to do for us as a people. We stress what we can do for the country, all of us. [Applause.] We stress the point that if we meet our public and our private responsibilities and obligations, if we recognize that self-government requires qualities of self-denial and restraint, then future historians will be able to say, ""These were the great years of the American Republic, these were the years when America began to move again.""', 'But there is very little time. The enemy is lean and hungry and the United States is the only strong sentinel at the gate. This is no time to say that we can outtalk or outshout Mr. Khrushchev. I want to outdo him, to outproduce him. [Applause.]', 'I think we must prove to a watching world that we are the way of the future and that the Communist system is as old as the Pharaoes. I think this Nation will rise to the test, and when we do, Mr. Khrushchev will know that a new generation of Americans is taking over this country, a generation that did not fight for world freedom at Anzio or the Solomons in order to see it ripped away. [Applause.] And he will know that America is once more on the move.', 'In 1780 in Hartford, Conn., the skies at noon turned one day from blue to gray, and by midafternoon the city had darked over so densely that in that religious age men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session, and many of the members clamored for immediate adjournment. The speaker of the house, one Colonel Davenport, came to his feet, and he silenced the din with these words: ""The day of judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought.""', ""I hope that all of us in a difficult and somber time in our country's history may also bring candles to help illuminate our country's way."", 'Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
139,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Ellington, Senator Gore, Members of the Congress, visitors from three States, ladies and gentlemen, it is my understanding that the last candidate for the Presidency to visit this community in a presidential year was Herbert Hoover in 1928. [Response from the crowd.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. President Hoover initiated on the occasion of his visit the slogan ""Two chickens for every pot,"" and it is no accident that no presidential candidate has ever dared come back to this community since. [Applause and laughter.] But we are here today because we begin in Tennessee today a campaign for the Office of the Presidency in this State, and we ask your support. I think it is most appropriate that we should begin in this community with visitors from three States, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, because it was Virginia which produced Thomas Jefferson who founded the Democratic Party. [Applause.] And it was North Carolina and Tennessee that produced and brought to fruition Andrew Jackson, who built the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', ""I run for the Office of the Presidency in a difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. Senator Johnson and I do not run for President and Vice President promising that if we are elected life will be easy. I think to be an American in the 1960's will be a responsible and difficult and hazardous occupation. Yesterday Mr. Nixon suggested that during the time that the United Nations was in session that we should diminish our campaign, that we should support the President, that we should rally around the United States. I support the President. I did not need to be reminded of that yesterday. And so does every American here, Republican or Democrat. [Applause.] And we support the United States. But I am concerned about the future of our country, and I think it would be far more hazardous and far more dangerous for any American who is concerned about the future of our country, to stay still, to say nothing, to keep his peace."", 'We settle in the next 6 weeks, we make a decision in the coming days, which way this country will move, not from now to January, but for the next 4 years, and possibly the next 8 years, and I will not miss a single occasion to see what is on my side, and that is that this is a great country, but it can be a greater country; it is a powerful country, but it can be a more powerful country.', 'Mr. Khrushchev is not impressed by words, nor is Mr. Castro, nor are the satellite leaders. They are not impressed by speeches. They are not impressed by debates. They are impressed by power. They are impressed by strength. They are impressed by the determination of the American people. They are impressed by our vitality as a free society. And it is my responsibility as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party in this election to speak the truth, to say what we think. [Applause.]', 'The Democratic Party does not run on a program in this election which will give any satisfaction at all to Mr. Khrushchev. If we are successful, our objective will be to rebuild our country, to strengthen our country, and strengthen its position around the world, to strengthen its defenses, to rebuild the economy of this United States. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Woodrow Wilson were successful in their day around the world was because they were successful here in the United States. [Applause.]', 'The 14 points of Woodrow Wilson were greeted with such significance in Europe, were the logical extension of the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson here in the United States, and the hand of friendship which Franklin Roosevelt held out to people around the world, was the same hand he held out to the people of Tennessee in the Tennessee Valley, and the people of the United States. [Applause.] And the Marshall plan and NATO and the Truman doctrine had their counterpart in the Fair Deal here in the United States.', 'I come as the standard bearer for the oldest political party on earth. I think the people of Tennessee and Virginia and North Carolina and Kentucky can make a clear judgment in this campaign, and that is on the record of the two parties. Which party is good for the people? Which party has fought for the interest of this part of the United States? Which party has concerned itself with education and the position of our older citizens and full employment for our people, and party income for our farmers? Which party has fought for the American people? Which party has said ""Yes"" to the future and which party has stood still, and which party has looked back?', ""I think that this can be not a period of gloom for us. I have confidence in this country. I don't downgrade the United States. I say we can do better. I have more confidence in the United States and its potential than our adversaries who say what we are doing now is as much as we can do. I know we can do better, this valley and this State included. [Applause.]"", 'In 1932 and 1933, and 1934 and 1935, there were those who saw no future for Tennessee, or parts of North Carolina or Virginia. But Franklin Roosevelt saw it and Harry Truman in his day saw it and Woodrow Wilson in his day saw it.', 'I run as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, and I ask your support. I don\'t say that life will be easy, but I say this country and this State and this area can move. I think our brightest days as the defender of freedom around the world are still ahead. I think the 1960\'s can be days which historians will say, ""This is when the country moved."" I ask your help in this campaign, as we move across the new frontiers of the 1960\'s, not resting on our oars, not saying what other Presidents in other times have done, not saying that previous generations had a rendezvous with destiny, but saying our generation does, our generation does. [Applause.]', 'During the election of 1860 one of the candidates, Lincoln, wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, in 1960, we know there is a God and we know that He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming.

140,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I would just as soon sit and listen to Albert some more. [Laughter.] I want to thank my friend, Albert Gore, for his generous words today in his own State and also for his friendship stretching back over 14 years in the House and the Senate. He speaks for Tennessee in the Senate and he also speaks for the United States. [Applause.] I am proud to be here today with your distinguished Governor, Buford Ellington, who has devoted himself [applause], who was a strong supporter of Senator Johnson for the Presidency before the convention, has shown the same friendship and the same support for the ticket of Johnson and Kennedy after the convention [applause].', 'I stand here as the Democratic nominee for the office of the Presidency. I think the State of Tennessee knows something about the job of President, because you have sent from this State three distinguished Presidents of the United States. One was James Polk, who in character and accomplishment, I think resembles Harry Truman, one of the great unknown Presidents of the United States [applause], and you sent two other Presidents to the United States Capital, to Washington. One was Andrew Jackson, who is the only president of the United States whom the Senate has officially censured, and the other was Andrew Johnson, who is the only president of the United States whom the House of Representatives ever impeached.', 'Why did they impeach Johnson and why did they impeach Jackson? They impeached them for doing their duty, regardless of the popular pressures. [Applause.] They censured Jackson because he fought against the bank at Philadelphia, which was trying to strangle the economic life of this country. They impeached Andrew Johnson because he would not liquidate the South after the Civil War. They recognized that the obligation of the President is not please the people but to serve them. That is the recognition which Tennessee has given to this country in the past and gives it today.', 'I stand here in this State, and I come from 1,500 miles away. I support the Tennessee Valley not because Massachusetts gained, but because the country gained, because it was in the national interest. [Applause.] The Tennessee Valley was conceived originally and developed by two men, one from Nebraska and the other from New York. One was George Norris and the other was Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] And they recognized that a rising tide lifts all the boats. If this country moves ahead, if the Tennessee Valley moves ahead, Massachusetts and Nebraska and the United States move ahead. [Applause.]', 'If I am elected President, or if I stay in the Senate, I will fight and give you three guarantees. First, that the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley in spite of all the rumors spread by distinguished newspapers, will stay here in this State. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, I will never call the Tennessee Valley creeping socialism. [Applause.]', 'Thirdly, I think the Tennessee Valley has been a source of strength, not only to the Tennessee Valley and not only to the United States, but the Tennessee Valley typifies, in my opinion, the kind of domestic program which has far reaching implications around the world. [Applause].', 'One of the great influences of the Tennessee Valley has been that it has been the best ambassador that the United States has ever had in the Middle East and Africa and Asia. [Applause]. If we want people to follow up, we have to lead. If we want the newly emerging countries of Africa and Asia and Latin America to want to associate with us, they have to feel that there is something in our lives and in our experience that is common to them. The reason that Mr. Lilienthal works in Iran today is because he worked in the Tennessee Valley. When they talk about damming the Jordan River, they talk about making another Tennessee Valley in the Middle East.', 'In the days of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, we carried on great agricultural experiments, great progress in the damming of our rivers and cleaning them. And therefore people in their own countries, newly independent, newly emerging, wanting to make a better life for their citizens, came to this part of the United States, because they saw an area that was desolate and hopeless 25 years ago that is now one of the richest parts of the country. They know what we did here by the initiative of the people in this part of the United States, joined by a Government which saw the necessity of cooperation. They know what we did, they can do; what we have done in the past, they can do; what we will do in the future they can do. That is the great lesson, that is the great experience I think that the United States has. That is the best hope for peace, not by trying to buy allies, not by trying to pour out sums of money suddenly when a crisis comes along. [Applause.] But by doing things in our country, using our natural resources, using our food surpluses imaginatively, building a better life for our people, solving our urban problems, moving ahead here in this country, so that people around the world look at us and say, ""The future belongs to them, not to the Communists."" [Applause.]', ""I campaign in this campaign and have spoken around the country, and yesterday the Vice President said that during this period of crisis at the United Nations we should cease all talk about the United States being weak. I don't say the United States is weak. I say it is a strong country but I say it could be stronger. [Applause.] I would much rather Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro, while they are visiting the United States, should hear the voice of the opposition which does not want appeasement, which wants to see our country grow, which wants to see freedom expand, which wants to see a strong military defense, which wants to see a brighter life for our people. That is the voice of the United States I want Mr. Khrushchev to hear. [Applause.]"", ""I don't want him to hear uniformity. I don't want him to hear silence. I want him to know that this is a vital country, that we are a strong people, that we believe our best days are ahead, and that we believe [applause] - and that we believe that the Democratic Party can lead and that if we are successful in January this country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
141,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['The Democratic Party has always looked forward. It looked forward with the TVA which did so much to bring industry to the South. It looked forward with farm programs that have increased cotton and tobacco yield many times over. It looked forward with the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson and the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, and the Fair Deal of Harry Truman. And now we stand at the New Frontier.', 'There is much to be done.', 'First we must rebuild an America strong and shining. We must put beyond any question our ability to deter an aggressor and to fight limited wars. For only by achieving undoubted strength can we keep the peace. And only by achieving undoubted strength can we finally bring the Communists to hard negotiatAons on the hard issues that divide us.', 'Second, as part of our program for a strong America, we must reverse the policy of no new starts in development of our natural resources. Our rivers and our streams, as the TVA experience demonstrates, are a prime source of national strength. They mean cheaper power, more jobs, better business, and richer recreation possibilities. They can provide, as at Oak Ridge and the university medical center, sinews of peace and of health. Not to make maximum use of these outapped resources is to play fast and loose with the destiny of the American people.', 'Third, as part of our program for a Strong America, the brake of high interest must be removed from the wheels of economic progress. High interest puts a drag on the farmer who has to pay more for his notes. It puts a drag on the small businessman without easy access to the money markets. It puts a drag on homebuilders and homeowners - a key feature of our economy and free enterprise system. And in our struggle against communism we cannot afford any drag on the American people.', 'Fifth, as part of our program for a stronger America we must assure the future of the small farmer - a mainstay of our social and economic system. There must be no squeeze through shrinkage of cotton allotments. There must be no wrecking of the textile industry through competition for labor paid substandard wages. There must be far more action on the distribution of our products to needy people abroad.']"

James Elder, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to Albert Gore, who has traveled with me through Tennessee today and traveled with me a great many legislative battles over the past 14 years, to your distinguished Governor who has shown us constant support and friendship to both Senator Johnson and myself during the days since the end of the convention and in the days to come until the election, and to your mayor, who was a shipmate of mine during World War II, and to Reverend Elder, all of whom have held out the hand of friendship to me in Tennessee today. I want you to know I am most grateful. I hope though I come from a State which is over 2,000 miles from Tennessee, the State of Massachusetts, that I do not come as a stranger, because I come as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party and Tennessee is the State that was the native home of one of the two founders of the Democratic Party, Andrew Jackson. [Applause.]', 'Nearly 75 years ago a great southerner, Henry Grady, used to tell a story about a poor Arkansas farmer who died across the river in our neighboring State. When they buried him, Mr. Grady said, his tombstone was made of Vermont marble, his coffin was made of wood from Oregon, the nails were of iron from Pittsburgh, he wore shoes from Boston, he wore a shirt from Cincinnati, and his suit came from New York, and all the South contributed, Mr. Grady said, was the hole in the ground.', 'Those days are gone forever. [Applause.] Those days when the needs of the South were ignored, those days before the administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt who helped rebuild the South and the country.', 'I come to you today as a candidate for the Democratic Party and in the next 6 weeks the people of Tennessee and of Arkansas and of the entire United States must make a judgment between Mr. Nixon and myself. We have both emerged on the scene as the standard bearers for our two parties. But Mr. Nixon and I did not commence in the last 6 weeks. The story of this campaign did not commence 14 years ago when we both came to Congress. The position of the candidates and their story and the viewpoint they hold for the future can best be determined by the record of the two parties during the years of their existence. It is on that basis the Democratic Party and the Republican Party which have flowed like two rivers through the history of the United States and by their fruits you shall know them. I put the record of the Democratic Party before the people of Tennessee and the people of Arkansas and I ask you what has the Republican Party ever done for the people of these two States? [Applause.]', 'The Tennessee Valley was built by the work of the people of this valley and by the vision of Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] This administration has substituted that policy, the policy of no new starts, and the contract that is so famous in the city of Memphis for which you are paying and the American people are paying, Dixon-Yates.', 'I think the decision is very clear, because I think in many ways that we begin in the sixties and particularly in 1960, another great milestone in the story of American development. In some ways this is 1932 and 1912 and 1948. I think that in the 1960\'s this country is going to have to begin a great new movement forward. I don\'t think we can live off the accomplishments of past generations. Franklin Roosevelt said in his first inaugural, ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" I think this generation in 1960 also has a rendezvous with destiny, a rendezvous far more trying, far more hazardous, far more fraught with danger for us all, but also filled with opportunity, than any rendezvous this group of Americans or any group of Americans has ever faced.', ""We stand today as the only sentinel at the gate in the great struggle for freedom, freedom here in the United States and freedom around the world. I see an America which will reestablish itself as a great symbol in the battle for men's minds, in the battle for freedom, all over the globe."", ""Mr. Khrushchev, after his visit to the United States, said that the United States is a sick and dying and faltering horse that is about to collapse into the ground. I don't hold that view at all. I think our brightest days are ahead. I think our high noon can be in the future, not in the past."", ""Yesterday, speaking in Michigan, Mr. Nixon suggested that those who were going around the country saying the United States is second, and that we are weak, are giving aid and comfort to Mr. Khrushchev. I do not say we are second, and I do not say we are weak. I say we are a great country that can be greater. We are a powerful country. [Applause.] We are a powerful country that can be more powerful. I don't think that there is anything that we have said or that we will say that gives any comfort at all to Mr. Khrushchev because our program is a simple one: To strengthen the United States, to make it more powerful, here at home and around the world, to check the advance of the Communists, to have a defense second to none, and to reestablish ourselves in the imagination of people all over the world. I want Mr. Khrushchev to hear that message. I want him to know that there is a free election in the United States, and that the Democratic Party, the party of Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman, wants to move forward, that we are not a sick and dying and faltering horse, but, instead, a country which is on the move again. [Applause.]"", 'We do not fool Mr. Khrushchev. We confine him to Manhattan and we confine Mr. Castro there, but they know that they are on the move. I am not satisfied, and I think this is the basic question which the American people must decide - are they satisfied with the position of the United States today? Do they feel that the relative power and strength and prestige of the United States is growing in comparison to that of the Communist world? Do they think that the position of the United States in Latin America is stronger than it was 10 or 20 years ago. Do they think the people of Africa who used to quote Franklin Roosevelt and Jefferson and Lincoln - do they think they quote American leaders today? Do you think the people of Asia who stand on the razor edge of decision, do they look to us or do they look to the Communist world? If you feel that what we are doing now is right, that we can do no better, I suggest you vote for an administration whose motto has been ""No New Starts."" But if you feel we can do better, if you feel that this is a great country, which deserves the united effort of all of us, if you feel that we can move in the sixties, that we can bring a better life for our people, that we can provide security for the farmers of Tennessee and Arkansas, that we can develop our resources, that we can use our steel capacity instead of 50 percent of it, that we can provide for a more secure life for our older citizens, that we can provide the best educational system in the world, that we can move, I want you to join with us. I want you to help us. [Applause.]', ""I want to see an America which is free for everyone, which develops the constitutional rights of all Americans, which will serve as our own symbol, our own identification, with the cause of freedom. The hard, tough question for the next decade, for this or any other group of Americans, is whether a free society with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives, can meet the single-minded advance of the Communists. Can a nation organized and governed such as ours endure? Can we carry through at an age where never before we will witness not only new development of weapons not only of destruction, but also a race for mastery of the sky and the rain, the ocean and the tides, the far side of space, and the inside of men's minds. We and the Russians now have the power to destroy at one blow, one-quarter of the earth's population, a feat not accomplished since Cain slew Abel. We need leadership better equipped than any we have had in 100 years, if the United States is not only going to survive but prevail. It is to that great cause that I ask your help. It is to the future that I ask you to give ourselves. It is to this campaign that I ask your assistance. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
143,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Ellington, Senator Gore, Members of Congress, ladies, and gentlemen, I want to express my great appreciation to you all and to the Governor for the generous invitation to come today. This fair is an evidence of the traditional desire of Americans to improve themselves and improve their work. In the past 2 weeks, I have been in the fairgrounds in Portland, Maine, in Palmer, Alaska, and in the States of Oregon and California. In every fair we see Americans collecting themselves together and preparing themselves for a better future. I am particularly glad to come to this fair on Farmers Day. I have been in the Congress for 14 years and I come from a section of the United States which does not directly depend on agriculture. But if the economy and experience of our country has told us anything, if the lesson of the twenties and the lesson of the fifties has any meaning for us today, it is that we cannot be prosperous as a nation unless agriculture is prosperous also. [Applause.]', 'I must say that I wholly disagree with the programs put forward by this administration for the support of American agriculture, because it has brought the dairy farmer of this country to an average income across the Nation that he had between 1939 and 1941. The only program which has worked well in recent years has been the program on tobacco, and the reason has been because we have had a high support price and an effective balance between supply and demand. [Applause.] My judgment is that a new administration must put forward an agricultural program which has two basic ingredients: First, a balance between supply and demand. A determination must be made as to how much we can usefully consume here in the United States, how much we need for our surplus foods to take care of our own people, and how much we can usefully distribute in the cause of peace around the world. And then we should put a limit on the production. Five percent surplus production in milk or in cheese or butter or tobacco or wheat or corn breaks the market price 15 or 20 percent. I think effective control with a high support price is the common denominator which must affect all agricultural programs across the United States, if we are going to have security for the American farmer. [Applause.]', 'Therefore, though I come from a section which is not agricultural, I know enough about the experience of our country to know that if our agriculture is prosperous, we will be prosperous in our cities. If our cities are prosperous, we will be prosperous, we will be prosperous in our country. A rising tide lifts all the boats, and I preach the doctrine of the interdependence of the American economy: A strong America from one shore to the other, north and south, east and west, in which all Americans share their prosperity. I want to express my appreciation. I come as the Democratic nominee for the office of the President, and I come to this area of Tennessee which was the home of Andrew Jackson, who helped found the party which I now lead. I therefore am honored to come to this State, and I am grateful to you all for the courtesy in permitting me to say hello. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
144,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you, to my friend Mr. Green from Nebraska, who I understand spoke for 2 hours and 45 minutes tonight and filled in most of the program, and to all of you for being willing to wait so long. We were in Tennessee all day by way of Washington, and, therefore, we were on a good cause. I want to express my appreciation at your coming to this hall tonight and filling it for a Democratic rally. [Applause.] I want to express my appreciation for the generous introduction of your distinguished Governor, Governor Loveless. I think that there is every prospect that I would not be here tonight, that I would not be the standard bearer of the Democratic Party, that I would not have the opportunity to present the issues on behalf of the Democratic Party this year, if it had not been for the support given to me at the convention by your distinguished Governor and the members of the Iowa delegation. [Applause.]', 'So I am here tonight to express my appreciation to him and to all of you, and in addition he has been kind enough to serve as chairman of our Advisory Committee on Agricultural Policy. I must say that if we are successful, and if he is advising, the American farmer I think will get a better deal than they will get from being advised by the advisers that Mr. Nixon has appointed, especially the ones from this district. [Applause.]', 'That is a long sentence, but you do get the idea. [Laughter.] I want to also say that the State of Iowa, even though I come from a different State - this is one country - I think the State of Iowa has an opportunity to continue the same kind of responsible government which Governor Loveless has given this State, when you elect Nick McManus the next Governor of the State of Iowa. I have known him for a great many years, and I think he can do a good job. [Applause.]', ""I hope that you will send a young man - this ticket is well balanced, O'Brien, McManus and Kennedy [laughter] - I hope you will send a young man - and Loveless - I hope you will send a young man down there to represent this district. I thought he made in a short time about as concise and effective a political speech as I have heard. The only thing is that he stopped too soon. He was about to suggest the remedies for the agricultural problems and I would have like to have heard him. But we will hear him on television. I think that he deserves the support of this district, because you cannot live in Iowa, you cannot depend on a good agricultural economy, and possibly be satisfied with the kind of leadership which this administration and the Republicans in the House and Senate have given in the search for a new and effective program. I hope you elect Congressman O'Brien, and I don't hold his name against him. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'I come from a nonagricultural State, Massachusetts and, therefore, I am sure that there are some farmers in Iowa and South Dakota and North Dakota who say, ""Why should we elect someone from New England? Why shouldn\'t we elect a farmer?"" Well, there is no farmer up for the office this year. Whittier, Calif., is not one of the great agricultural sections of the United States. [Laughter.] But I think there is more to it than that. That is that I consider the agricultural income to be the No.1 problem that the United States faces. It is not just a problem for Iowa, Indiana, or the Dakotas, but it is a problem for the United States of America. I don\'t think that there is any accident that the farm income which has declined over the past few years has also seen Detroit, Mich., have a relatively secondary year in the sale of automobiles because farmers are the No.1 market for automobiles in the United States. I don\'t think it is entirely unconnected that we find a country which has the greatest capacity to produce steel in the world, producing steel at 50 percent of capacity. The economy of the United States is interconnected. It is interdependent. It is interrelated. When there is a recession on the farm, sooner or later - and the twenties taught us it was sooner - there is a recession in the cities.', 'So I speak tonight as the standard bearer for a national party which is represented east and west, north and south whose strength has been for much of its history, has been the support it has received from the O\'Briens and others from the western United States who spoke for the farmer and the small businessman. I come here tonight pledging that if I am successful in this campaign that I will speak as an American to try to solve what is at one time the most fruitful and promising opportunity we have, and on the other hand, it represents the greatest technological revolution the world has ever seen. An American said to me the other day that if Mr. Khrushchev could have 50 American scientists or 50 of the best American farmers he would take the American farmers and he would be right, because the solution to the staggering problem of a shortage of food which faces the world, which requires 70 and 80 and 85 percent of the world\'s population to spend their day searching for food we have solved here in the United States, and we consider it our No.1 problem - surpluses which are in effect, blessings from the Lord on this country at a time when, as Congressman-to-be O\'Brien said, ""we are fighting a battle for men\'s minds."" We have in Iowa more wealth than was ever mined in the gold of California, and it comes out of the ground. I do not say the solution to the problem of a balance between supply and demand is an easy one. But I do say that this administration has not had the answer. A reporter asked President Eisenhower about a month ago what suggestions and ideas Mr. Nixon has had, and the President said, ""Give me a week and I will let you know.""', 'Well, after the next week, the press conference was called off, and another week went by. Then at the next press conference, no one asked the President what the idea was, but I am here to say what the idea was, and it was described by Mr. Benson earlier this year. Mr. Benson may not be the most unusual Secretary of Agriculture in history, as Mr. Nixon once described him, but he is a truthful man. He said early this year that Mr. Nixon was one of the architects of his farm program. There it is. I am ready to give it to you. Here is the answer we have been waiting for for a month, one idea suggested by the Vice President, and we have it in the Benson farm program. [Applause.]', 'People of this State will have to make a judgment in the next 6 weeks as to which party and which candidate they should support. I speak tomorrow at the plowing contest in South Dakota, and the Vice President of the United States speaks the next day. I cannot predict how different our messages will be. The same phrases perhaps will be used, cost-price squeeze, the necessity of a good income for the farmer, the necessity of distributing our surplus food, all the rest. I think a better judgment from any speeches which may be made by any candidates during the next 6 weeks is written in the record of the last 8 years, and written in the record of the Democratic Party in the last 25 years, and written in the Republican Party during the same period of time, by their fruits you shall know them. And I think the farmers of this State can make a judgment based on vote after vote in the Congress in the last 5 or 6 years on every effort made to increase income for our farmers - five vetoes - an attempt made, effort after effort, to try to improve a difficult situation, without success. I think the speeches weighed on that scale may count for little. I think the record is clear. I think there is an entirely different philosophy which motivates the Republican Party from the Democratic Party in its history, and not just in agriculture. During the session of August, when we tried to get medical care for our older citizens, we got 44 Democrats and I Republican. Governor Rockefeller was right when he rejected today the program that the Congress finally passed, and that the President signed. It is a useless and a wasteful bill. Far better it would have been to have put that under social security as we recommended it. We were threatened with a veto and we were defeated. [Applause.]', 'I spend today in Iowa and Tennessee. The great issue iii this campaign, of course, is the struggle for peace. I think in Tennessee, and Iowa, we have learned a wise lesson. I spent today in the Tennessee Valley and I received a letter tonight on the plane from one of the men who built the Tennessee Valley. He described how project after project had sprung up in southeast Persia, in the Indus River, in Colombia, and all over the world, modeled after what we did in the Tennessee Valley. Because we could do it, they wanted to do it. Because we showed them that a free society was able to organize its resources, other countries wanted to come to our country and learn how to do it and follow our example, the most effective blow in the struggle for peace that we could have waged. I see the same thing for Iowa. Here in this rich and productive State, which has seen this extraordinary revolution in agricultural production in the last 50 years, we show people around the world how to do it.', ""The reason Mr. Khrushchev comes here is because he knows in our own country, almost unknown to our people, we have had a revolution in the last 50 years which can have more significance and bring more happiness and more well-being to people than sputnik or any other scientific discovery, almost, in this century - how to produce food with a few people and feed them well. That is the secret of Iowa, just as the secret of Tennessee is how to harness the resources of the land and use it for the benefit of the people. These programs, I think, are the kind of programs which in the past and again in the future the Democratic Party has been identified. It is a source of pride to me that I am able to represent this party on this occasion, because the more I look at the record, the more I study the leadership which our parties have given, the more study the record of the men whom the Democrats have produced in the last 50 years to lead this country, Wilson, Roosevelt and Truman, and the men who have been produced to lead the Republican Party, since the end of Theodore Roosevelt's administration, how glad I am that I am a Democrat and how proud I am to carry our banner. [Applause.]"", 'A strong America is our objective, a strong country, which can live in peace, and set an example to men all over the world. We wish to show men and women all over the world that we are able to harness the resources of our society, that what we have done they can do, and be strong in the meantime to protect ourselves against any action so that we can keep the peace. Beneath that great shield and beneath that umbrella, beneath that wall, build the kind of society which can serve as an inspiration to people around the world, to cause people to think that the people of this country are on the move, that they are solving their problems that they are feeding their people, that they are building better cities, that they are using their natural resources, that they are cleansing their water, that they are developing their power, that they are on the move, that they are a vital society which represents the future, not the past.', 'We are not finished. We are on the way in this country. We have more to offer than any society ever developed. The Communist society is hostile to the basic aspirations of the people of Latin America, Africa and Asia, and Eastern Europe, and it is hostile to the aspirations of the Russians. If we can maintain our strength, if we can maintain those qualities of character and restraint and self-discipline and will, if we bring imagination and energy to the solution of the problems that we face, if we mobilize ourselves for the public interest I believe this country will not only endure, but prevail. I think the future can be bright. I ask your support in this campaign because I think we have a chance to serve our country in a difficult and dangerous period. It requires the best from all of us. It requires your best in this district and in this State and in this country. But the country is worth it. We have our chance in our generation to contribute to the welfare of our country. I think it is a chance that all of us welcome. We want to lead, and we want this country to move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
145,John F. Kennedy ,"September 21, 1960","['Today I stand on ground hallowed by a first citizen of Nashville, of Tennessee, and of America - Andrew Jackson. I come here as the standard bearer of the party which he helped to build - and as the latest in the long line of those who have worked to carry on in his tradition - to build a more abundant, a stronger, and a greater nation.', 'Nearly 150 years ago from the Hermitage only a few miles away - Andrew Jackson issued a proclamation to rouse the citizens of Tennessee against the threat from abroad which was to become the War of 1812. Volunteer to Arms he called that proclamation, and in it he reminded the men of Tennessee that they were different from ""the titled slaves of George II"" and the ""frozen peasants"" of Russia. ""We are freeborn sons"", he said, ""We are going to fight for the reestablishment of our national character.""', 'Today we too are faced with a threat from abroad - today we too must be aroused to the struggle. And today the Democratic Party is again preparing to fight for the reestablishment of our national character.', 'That is what the New Frontier is all about - the challenge to all Americans to rebuild our national strength - to strive toward new heights of greatness - to start America moving again.', ""Andrew Jackson is a symbol of that challenge. But he is not Tennessee's only symbol. For here the Tennessee Valley Authority stands as a monument to the courage and capacity and imagination of the American people - and as a reminder that the past 8 years have seen stagnation and retreat in nearly all the aspects of our national life."", 'To the people of the Tennessee Valley, the initials TVA stand for far more than Tennessee Valley Authority. They stand for more business, more jobs, richer farms - and a better life for all your people. They have meant the difference between hardship and opportunity, between stagnation and advance. They mean aluminum and chemicals and textiles. And today they mean Oak Ridge where the secrets of atomic energy are being harnessed for the benefit of a future America - and your great university medical center working toward the control of cancer.', ""But TVA is not only a symbol of a more fruitful life to all your people - it is a symbol and a challenge for all Americans. For here under the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt -Americans proved that they could think and act in large terms; that they could deal with the Nation's urgent problems with boldness and imagination and on a scale undreamt of in modern history. George Norris, one of the founders of TVA, was not a citizen of Tennessee. He came from Nebraska. But he saw beyond the borders of Nebraska - beyond the Midwest - to an America of abundance and hope for all its people."", 'The Republicans of today have lost the vision of George Norris. They have failed to grasp the meaning and importance of TVA for all America. During the 20 Democratic years of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, 20 new dams were built into the TVA system. During the past 8 years work has begun on only one dam - and that was started only because a Democratic Senate, led by Senator Gore and Senator Kefauver, fought for action over Republican Opposition. Dams such as the Cordell Hull Dam near Carthage, and the Barkley Dam near the Kentucky line have already had the approval of a Democratic Congress - but have not been started because of Republican reaction. The Percy Priest Dam, near Nashville, only awaits the establishment of a cost ratio before being built.', 'Beginning in 1960 we will return to the vigor and leadership of the Roosevelt administration. We will reverse the disastrous Republican record of no new starts - not only the no new starts in the Tennessee Valley, but throughout this Nation, wherever great rivers flow unharnessed to the sea where growing population and industry increase their need for power and water.', 'We pledge ourselves to a dynamic program for resource development, not as a party which speaks of TVA as a ""magnificent experiment"" down here, but as ""creeping socialism"" in Washington. But as a party which has always believed in TVA and in developing all the resources of our great land - the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson.', 'And the development of our resources is not only important to America at home - it is vital to the cause of peace throughout the world. All over the globe new and struggling nations are working to eliminate poverty and misery - to emerge from their economic backwardness into the 20th century.', 'They are looking for leadership and help in this effort. The great issue of our time is whether they will look to Moscow for this leadership - or whether they will look to America.', ""Only an America which is developing its own resources - only an America with a growing and vital economy - only an America which is meeting the needs of its own people - only such an America can prove that the road to progress is freedom's road, and provide the leadership which can check the spread of communism, and begin the spread of freedom to all corners of the globe.""]"

[Applause.] I don't know whether those two signs hanging on that hotel mean anything, but we will settle for that big a majority next November 8. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'I am grateful for all of you being kind enough to come here today and greet us. I am grateful to your distinguished Governor who was a loyal supporter of Senator Johnson before the convention, and who has given equal support and equal friendship to a ticket of Johnson and Kennedy after the convention [applause], to Albert Gore and Estes Kefauver, who have spoken for the interests of this State and the country, and who speak now as Democrats who believe in a national Democratic Party. [Applause.]', ""I come here to Tennessee, which helped start the Democratic Party. I come here to the home of Andrew Jackson, and I ask Tennessee to come back home. I ask you to. [Applause.] This State and this country have seen in the last 8 years you cannot live in the Tennessee Valley and say that it does not make any difference which party is in control of the Government; you cannot live in this valley, which was built by the people of this area and the Democrats, and say that a Government which has made a boast of no new starts is good enough for the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'Andrew Jackson in 1812 sent out a notice to the people of this State which was answered on that occasion and in that statement he said, ""We are freeborn sons. We are going to fight for the reestablishment of the national character."" We are going to fight for the reestablishment of the national strength.

I want to make it clear that nothing that I am saying will give Mr. Khrushchev the slightest encouragement. [Applause.] He is encouraged enough as he stands 90 miles off the coast of the United States.', 'I propose to discourage him. I propose that when the Democratic Party assumes its control in November that we rebuild our national strength and vitality. [Applause.] The most ominous sound that Mr. Khrushchev can hear this week is not in the debates of the United Nations, but a sound of the United States on the move again, of a country ready to move. [Applause.]', 'I am not satisfied to see a Communist satellite 90 miles off the coast of Florida, 8 minutes by jet. Those who say that they will stand up to Khrushchev have not demonstrated any ability to stand up to Mr. Castro. [Applause.]', 'This State is an important State in this election, and I think this State shows not only what the country can do and what our people can do, but what the cause of freedom can do, because along with Andrew Jackson this State has a great inspiration, not only to our country but to the people of the free world, and that is the Tennessee Valley. I do not come to Tennessee and say that this is a noble experiment and then go back to Washington and say it is creeping socialism. [Applause.] The Tennessee Valley is the greatest asset we could have, not just to the Tennessee Valley and not just to the United States, but to all those people who stand today in the underdeveloped world and try to make a judgment which road they will take. Will they go the road of freedom or will they take the road of Moscow and Peiping? The Tennessee Valley shows them what freedom can do by the collective action of the people and the vision of the leadership. [Applause.]', 'I run in the tradition of great Democratic Presidents. No Democratic President in this century has ever run on a slogan of ""Stand pat with McKinley,"" ""Return to Normalcy with Harding,"" ""Keep cool with Coolidge."" No new starts with this administration.', 'The Democratic slogans have told something of the Democratic Party, the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson, the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, the Fair Deal of Harry Truman. [Applause.] And I ask you today to come with us across the New Frontier of the sixties.', 'Only an America which is strong and developing, only an America which is using its own resources to the maximum, only an America which is rebuilding its cities and distributing its food in a way that benefits our people and the free world, only an America which has a strength second to none, can lead the free world. This is a great election. In many ways it is more critical than the election of 1932, because in 1932 what was at stake was the preservation of freedom in this country. What is at stake in the election of 1960 is the preservation of freedom all around the globe. [Applause.]', ""Lyndon Johnson and I do not run for President and Vice President promising that if we are elected life will be easy, but we do promise that if we are elected this country will start to go forward again this country's strength will increase, this country's momentum will quicken, and we will once more, as we were in the days of Roosevelt and Wilson, be a source of inspiration to all those who wish to travel freedom's way. [Applause.]"", 'During the American Constitutional Convention there was behind the desk of General Washington a picture of a sun low in the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun. At the conclusion Benjamin Franklin stood up: ""Because of what we have done here today,"" he said, ""We know it is not a setting sun, but it is a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I think in 1960, if we are willing to bear our burdens and meet our responsibilities, and look to the future and say, ""Yes,"" to the next decade, I think it can be a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Rising ovation.]']"
147,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Congressman McGovern, Governor Herseth, congressional candidate and Congressman to be, Ray Fitzgerald, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my great pleasure in coming to this plowing contest. I feel it is a most important occasion, because as George McGovern says, I consider the decline in agricultural income to be the No. 1 domestic problem that the United States faces, and, therefore, as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party, I take this occasion to set before you, the farmers of this section of the United States, my views on what should constitute agricultural policy for the United States.', 'I regret the rain, but it remains as the Bible tells us on the just and the unjust alike, on Republicans as well as Democrats. [Laughter.] Tomorrow, the Republican candidate for the Presidency will present his views on American agriculture, and I have no doubt that as you listen, you will find that we use much the same vocabulary, that we both proclaim the same friendship for the farmer, the same concern about his needs. How, then, in an election year of 1960, is the American farmer going to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican and Democratic Parties?', 'For an answer to that question, I think we should return to the ancient Biblical injunction, ""By their fruits you shall know them."" And by their fruits, I believe the American farmer has learned the true meaning of Republican speeches at campaign time.', 'In 1952, they promised not so many miles from here, and Mr. Nixon was among them, not merely 90 percent of parity, but full parity. In 1956, they promised, and Mr. Nixon was among them, and I quote, ""Full parity of income in the marketplace."" And tomorrow, in 1960, whatever formula will have been chosen, they will again promise new abundance and increased income, and protection for REA and the co-ops, and again, Mr. Nixon will be among them.', 'What were the fruits of those earlier promises which you should bear in mind this fall? They were a 20-percent drop in farm income, a 40-percent drop in net farm income from the State of South Dakota alone in the last 8 years, the destruction of thousands of family farms, the liquidation of many holdings, and a farm program which cost more in 1 year than all the farm programs of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman in any year. This is the result of the last 8 years, and I cannot believe that in this difficult and dangerous time, for the country and for American agriculture, the American farmer is ready to move in that direction again.', 'I come here today to set before you what I consider we should do in the winter of 1961, and I think this should be the first domestic matter on the desk of the next President of the United States. Here are my views: The farmer of the United States does not need new speeches and new spokesmen. They need a new program and new policies and a new approach to the challenge of our farms, for today American agriculture, as you well know, is gripped in a technological revolution which has been a source of strength and vitality to the United States, though it has cost, in many cases, the American farmer greatly. It is a revolution which has made the American farmer the most efficient in our history, and if there is one area of competition where we are now ahead of the Soviet Union, it is in the area of agricultural production. It is no wonder that Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Koslov and Mr. Mikoyan have come to the Middle West, because they see here the heart of the American revolution.', 'A distinguished American told me some days ago that if Mr. Khrushchev had to pick 50 American scientists or 50 American farmers, he would pick the farmers, because he realizes that this secret of producing vast quantities of food with only a few people is a revolutionary secret that can change the face of the world. But even though this rising productivity is a source of national power and strength, it can be a disaster to the individual farmer, for when production rises and it exceeds demand, then farm prices fall disastrously, and farm income drops for all, and this fall in income is further intensified by the continual rise in the farmers cost of production.', 'The answer of the opposition party, the Republicans, is to increase dependence on the so-called free market, even though this has meant disaster for thousands of families, caught between a dropping income for themselves and a rising cost for the things that they buy.', 'Other areas of our economy are better able to deal with excess production. When more steel is being produced than can be sold, the steel companies cut back production and maintain prices. Steel production in the United States this week is about 54 percent, and yet the prices have not dropped. The reason, of course, is that they have cut their production over 46 percent in order to bring into balance supply and demand. But the individual farmer, and there are hundreds of thousands of them, cannot do this on his own. He lacks bargaining power in the market. He needs help and support of the Federal Government.', 'I come here today to offer you a program of what I believe to be help and support. My program for agriculture is consistent with my call to the new frontier. It makes no vague promises that can be interpreted different ways. It makes no pledge that I cannot keep, or that the public interest would not permit. I give you no assurances that you can have high income and unlimited production and no controls with no regard to the taxpayers. Rather, it is a program which will take work and sacrifice and discipline. But it is, I believe in all sincerity, an honest program. It is carefully thought out and I believe it can be effective, for I believe that the American farmer is tired of grandiose promises and unfilled pledges, and gimmicks which will save the farmer and save the taxpayer. I believe you want to be told what must be done and that you are ready to do it. I offer such a program, and if you will give us your help and support, we will, together, build once again a farm economy where every man who works the soil can be assured of a decent life for himself and his family.', 'First, we pledge ourselves to securing full parity of income for the American farmer. By parity of income, I do not mean a vague target or a high-sounding goal. I mean a clear, easily defined concept which can be mathematically ascertained and computed. Parity of income is that income which gives average producers a return on their invested capital, labor, and management equal to that which similar or comparable resources earn in nonfarm employment. Parity of income under this calculation and this definition can be figured by the Department of Agriculture for each commodity without difficulty.', 'Here is a concept which strikes to the heart of the farm problem. It does not concern itself directly with prices alone, with what the farmer receives, but only with his net income, his return, the only figure which is meaningful in determining his standard of living, particularly in this age of the cost-price squeeze. For the farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything he buys at retail, sells everything he sells at wholesale, and pays the freight both ways. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, we intend to assure this parity of income for the farmer primarily through supply management, the adjustment of supply to demand at parity income prices. Purchases and loans will be necessary on some commodities at certain times to supplement supply management. But a basic instrument of assuring parity of income will be supply management controls, including the use of marketing quotas, land retirement, with conservation practices, marketing orders and agreements, and other devices, to be used either together or separately, depending upon the needs of the specific commodities and the desire of the producers. The fundamental goal - and this is the point - the fundamental goal of all of these tools is to bring production and demand into balance, and thereby assure a parity of income. And unless we bring them into balance, unless we bring production and supply into balance, what we can consume here at a parity price, what can be usefully distributed to people around the country who depend upon our food, what can be usefully distributed around the world to those who look to us for help unless we bring those into balance, unless we bring production into balance, you will find a continuation of the same disastrous occurrences of the last 8 years - surpluses, heavy tax burdens, and a lower farm income for the farmer.', 'I think the choice is clear. [Applause.]', ""Because of the rain I am going to place all of this into the record, and I want the press to understand that I am supporting all of this, but I don't want to stand you all outside and have you all catch some cold, or at least an easterner might catch cold - I don't know about all of you. But I do want to say three or four more points before I close, because this may be the only chance I have to lay down before farmers what I think we ought to do in the coming months. In my judgment there is no other way than to apply this principle of supply management which I think should be submitted first to the farmers of this country so that they can give their judgment and endorsement of any program that we wish to put into effect. Reducing price supports has not worked. Unlimited production has only driven incomes lower and piled up surpluses. Only effective supply management, bringing a balance between supply and demand, will yield good and stable income to our farmers, and I believe that we must go ahead on that course."", 'Third, we must use our excess productivity capacity to feed people abroad and at home. I spent a month in West Virginia. There are more than 100,000 families in that State that wait every mouth for surplus food packages from our Government. There are 4 million Americans in this country who wait every month for a package from our Government of surplus food. You would not believe what is in that package - some grain, some rice, and this summer the Department of Agriculture is adding lard. These are not just people living in India or Latin America. These are fellow Americans, thrown out of work, many of them sick, many of them with families, and here in this country which stores food and sees it rot on occasions, we cannot find enough good food to feed our own people.', 'Fourth, around the world, when we and the Soviet Union are engaged in a great competition to see whether the world will be free or slave, we continue to persist in regarding the production of food from the ground as a problem, as a surplus, as a burden, when it is a blessing from the Lord. I think we need an administration which so regards it. [Applause.]', ""We spend $42 billion on defense every year. Those ships sail the oceans. They protect us but they do not serve our people and the world. I do not regard the distribution of food around the world as a great burden upon us. I regard it as an opportunity, to use our assets in a way which will attract people to the cause of freedom. I am glad that this is our problem and not starvation. I am glad we can produce more than we can consume, if we can share it usefully, for we are our brother's keeper, and if we have great assets in this country, I believe we should hold out the hand of friendship. When hundreds of millions of people stagger through their lives searching for food and we have it, and we are trying to determine which way the world will go, I would rather see our food used in an imaginative way than to argue in kitchens or anyplace else. I want to help people and I want the United States to be identified with that cause as it was in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman. [Applause.]"", ""Fifth, we must modernize our specialized farm agencies to meet the farm revolution. One thing which is going to be necessary in the next years is credit for our farmers. We are going to have to make it possible for those farmers who wish to develop their equipment, maintain themselves, to have sufficient sources of credit, and I don't think 7 percent interest is sufficient sources of credit. I don't think it is possible for a farmer to maintain his income, to maintain his farm, when his receipts are dropping, his costs are going up, and he must borrow money at the bank for 7 percent interest, which is about 3 or 4 percent more than he would have paid 5, 6, or 7 years ago. These are all things that I think are possible to be done, and I don't take the view [applause] - I don't take the view that these problems cannot be solved. I don't say they are easy problems, and I don't come before you who live with these problems every day and say that if I am elected life will be easy, and your problems will disappear; I think it is going to require the dedicated effort of all of us. But I do believe it is possible to elect an administration and support a Congress which is honestly concerned on its record of 25 years with the problems of American farmers. I think the record of the last 8 years is clear, and I think the record of the Democratic Party in the last 25 years in supporting agriculture, in electing Congressmen and Senators who year after year - Hubert Humphrey and Gene McCarthy of Minnesota, and Proxmire of Wisconsin, and George McGovern in this State, and Senators and Congressmen who have stood for the farmer in all parts of the Middle West. [Applause.]"", ""I come from Massachusetts, and I live on the ocean, and the problems of my State are entirely different from the problems of your State. But this is an economy which is interdependent. My people cannot manufacture textiles or sell fish or make television sets and sell them to the Middle West unless you have the income to buy them. And you cannot prosper on the farms unless our cities move ahead. I think one of the most unfortunate parts of the present administration's policy has been to preach the doctrine of dissension, to tell the people in the cities that the farm programs are expensive burdens, that the farmers live off the fat of the land. I spent a month in Wisconsin in the primary there. The average income for a dairy farmer in Wisconsin is 50 cents an hour, for a very long week."", 'I preach the doctrine of the interdependence of our economy. I don\'t see any point in Congressmen and Senators from the Eastern United States voting ""No"" on farm programs. That does not help the consumers. The consumers have never paid such high prices, and farm income has not been as low as it is now in some commodities for 20 years. This country will move ahead when they prosper on the farm and when they prosper in the city. Congressmen and Senators from the agricultural parts of the United States vote against urban renewal. That does not help a farmer, because some person in the city has a bad house or lives in a slum. I think that the necessity for us is to recognize that we are not 50 separate States; we are not 6 different regions of the United States. We are one country with one great problem, and that is to insure the prosperity of our people and their security in the days ahead, and it is to that great task that we shall address ourselves in the coming months.', ""I want to make it clear in summing up that my view of the problem facing agriculture is this: that unless we bring supply and demand into balance, and that demand should include production for our domestic markets, production for our world markets, production for our school lunch programs and our surplus food programs, for our unemployed and older citizens, and production for food for peace, distributed by the United States individually, or through the United Nations, and after those productions have been determined, then we should attempt to limit the production of any commodity to what can be consumed at parity prices. That is the point that I am attempting to say simply; to try to have effective controls. Five percent surplus in any commodity can break your price 15 percent. And you do not have an effective balance between supply and demand merely by dropping the support price. As you drop the support price you increase your production more because it is the only way you can sustain your income. By providing more effective controls on production, I think it is possible for us to protect the farmer from the hazards of the marketplace, and this is the way that freedom can do it. Because if we don't continue the present way, I think we will find the destruction of free agriculture in this country, as family farmers move from the farms to the cities."", 'I come to you today as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency. I speak not only for myself, but I speak for all those in my party who are vitally concerned about this problem, who feel that a better job can be done, who feel that the security of the American farmer and the security of people all over this country is basic to our survival. This problem is not a domestic problem. Agriculture does not concern only the people of this State or country. It is a problem which affects our position all over the world. I believe in a strong America. I believe in a secure country. But we cannot be strong, we cannot be respected, we cannot hope that people will look to us for leadership unless we are moving ahead, solving our own problems here in the United States. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was greeted as a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor here in the United States. And the reason that Harry Truman could carry on the Marshall plan and NATO was because he had concerned himself with the lives of the people of his own country.', ""We speak and what we do speaks far more strongly than what we say. What we are sounds much more significant than what we say we are, and if we are moving ahead in this country, if we are solving our problems, if we are holding out a hand to people around the world, then I think we are most effectively answering Mr. Khrushchev. Then we can provide for our security, and then we can be the leader of the free world and a world of peace. I don't run for the Presidency saying the future is easy. But I say we can do better than we are doing."", 'This is a great country, but I think it can be a greater country, and it is a powerful country, but I think it can be a more powerful country. I am dedicating myself and Senator Johnson, the candidate for the Vice Presidency, and I think all of us, to the maintenance of a free society here in the United States.', 'During the presidential election 100 years ago, Abraham Lincoln wrote a friend, ""I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now 100 years later, when the great issue is the maintenance of freedom all over the globe, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
148,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Holum, Mr. Patton, Mr. Ellis, Mr. Graybill, Mr. Radin, my distinguished colleague in the Democratic Party, Lee Metcalf, Congressman Lee Metcalf, Paul Cannon, your Lieutenant Governor, Leo Graybill, who runs in this district, if I might bring up a partisan note, for Congress, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to Mr. Holum for his generous introduction. I do come from Massachusetts, but I speak in the Senate of the United States not only for Massachusetts, I am a Senator of the United States, and therefore I speak for the United States. [Applause.]', 'It is, as he said, a source of satisfaction, I think, to all Americans that the two Americans of this century who did more to develop the resources of the United States, to conserve them, and protect them for other generations, both came from New York State, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.]', 'This is an important conference, and for this reason I have come here tonight to give my views on the development of the natural resources of the United States. This conference reminds me of the historic conference called 52 years ago by Theodore Roosevelt. That conference adopted a basic principle which I think should guide this country in the years ahead as it has on occasion guided us in the past. It said, ""We agree that the sources of natural wealth exist for the benefit of the people, and that monopoly therefore should not be tolerated."" As the standard bearer for the Democratic Party I associate myself completely with that remark, and I invite [applause] the party of Theodore Roosevelt to associate with it once again [applause].', 'More than 1,800 miles from here today another conference is also holding the attention of the American people. Gathered at the United Nations are leaders and spokesmen for world interests the globe over. No two conferences could be more different in their appearance. Our concern is with the improvement of free institutions. Their concern is with the protection of these institutions from devastation. Our concern is a better life for all Americans. Their concern is the preservation of life on this planet. But these conferences, so far apart in geography and in subject matter, in reality are closely linked together. For our success in checking the advance of communism around the world, in expanding the cause of freedom, and sending it on an onward march, depends in the final analysis upon the strength of the United States. We must be strong in purpose, we must be strong in leadership, we must be strong militarily, and we must be strong economically. It is no accident that the Communists have made their greatest gains from Laos to Cuba to Africa, during the period when our relative strength was in decline, when 1 out of every 16 Americans is unemployed, when 1 out of 20 who is employed is forced to work part time, when great industries like steel are barely working half of their capacity, when, for 7 years, our farmers have been caught in a cruel squeeze between ever-increasing rises in their costs and a decline in their prices, which has caused them to be the most oppressed group in the American economy, when mining is depressed, when lumber production is double and transportation is down, and the cost of living goes up.', 'Mr. Khrushchev confronts us at the United Nations with arrogant confidence, because he believes that the economy of the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc is growing at a faster relative rate than is ours. He feels that he is rapidly closing the gap between Russian and American economic strength, and he knows and we know that last year the United States had the lowest rate of economic increase of any major industrialized society in the world, and he knows that it is this race for economic strength which can decide which system can best support the best defenses, which system can best help other nations, and which system will most appeal as a thriving, moving system to the underdeveloped people of the world, who stand today on the razor edge of decision and will make up their minds in the next decade which way they will go.', 'Mr. Khrushchev is not impressed by words. He is not going to be slowed down by debate. He is not going to care whether we take a hard line or a soft line, restrict him to Manhattan or invite him to Camp David. Mr. Khrushchev is going to be impressed by one thing, and so is the world community, and that is the power of the United States, and that includes not only military power; it includes industrial power, atomic power, water power and electric power of every kind. [Applause.]', 'The growth of economic power depends on many things. It depends on a national policy of full employment. It depends on money and credit that will encourage investment policies. It depends on a healthy farm economy. But most of all in the western half of our Nation, it depends on vigorous, planned development of our natural resources. [Applause.] And it depends upon the development of our resources, the production of minerals and timber, and the availability of power and water. No State, no region, no nation in the world today can be economically strong without an adequate supply of water. This country is now using 312 billion gallons a day, enough to cover the State of Rhode Island 1 foot deep. This is eight times as much water as we used in 1900 and by 1975 we will use half as much again. But already the water shortage is nationwide in scope. It is limiting the growth of industry in many sections of the Eastern United States, and it limits the growth of industry and agriculture here in the West. And much of the water that does flow in our streams is polluted and poisoned. But in the face of a growing water shortage, a growing demand for power, and a growing threat from Soviet competition, this Nation has virtually ground to a halt in the development of a great natural resource given to us by the Lord. [Applause.]', 'I am not satisfied to discuss the subject of resource development in this campaign in terms of future generalities and past performances, for this is not only a major issue in this campaign; it is a major element of our national strength and the American people have a right to hear not only our goals, but how we intend to reach them; not only our principles, but how we intend to apply them; not only our rhetoric, but the deeds we plan to match our words.', ""I don't say that only Federal funds and Federal planning can do the job. State, local, and private effort will be needed. But we are talking about resources that belong to the public, about rivers that belong to the Nation, about projects that are essential to our security, and unless the Federal Government is going to lead, this Nation is going to be left behind. [Applause.]"", 'Specifically, I propose a nine-point program for resource development to be initiated promptly in January of 1961. [Applause.] First, we will reverse the policy of no new starts. [Applause.] I hope that in the United States in the sixties, when we are going to have to move again, that no slogan is ever put forward which says no new starts, no movement forward, let us stand still.', 'I could not disagree more. [Applause.] And we are going to move ahead under that program on comprehensive plans for multi-purpose river development.', 'Second, we will devote the benefits of public resources to the public good. [Applause.] That includes adherence to the preference clause carrying out; the principles of Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] We will not stand by and permit our resources to be wasted or taken for partial development for the benefit of special interests. [Applause.] We will not stand by, for example, and permit another Hells Canyon blunder in the Clark Fork Basin. [Applause.] I think the next President of the United States must support early authorization of the multipurpose project in the Paradise Knolls area. [Applause.]', 'I remember President Truman was here in 1952 and he said, ""Take a look at Hungry Horse Dam. That is the last one you are going to see."" We are going to see some more in the sixties. [Applause.]', ""Third, we will appoint to the Federal Power Commission, to the Department of Interior, to the Rural Electrification Administration, and to every other agency, men who will put the public interest first, who will recognize that they hold high positions, that they don't fill time, but they hold positions which can be creative for the public interest, that they must recognize that they are part of an administration which sees the economy of this country as moving ahead, and sees them in the foreground in setting public policy which will permit the maximum development of our resources for the public interest. [Applause.]"", 'Fourth, we will establish a Council of Resources and Conservation Advisors in the Office of the President, to coordinate planning of this field. We have had many short-term, limited, piecemeal studies. We have not had enough of the long-range, continuing, and comprehensive surveys, determining the needs of our country, the increase in our population, the available resources and how they can be fitted together to build a strong and vital country.', 'We need a permanent inventory of where we stand now, and where we want to be tomorrow, in water, power, timber, recreation, and other resources. [Applause.] We need a rational schedule of action, instead of the hit-or-miss development that depends upon annual political or budgetary pressures. We need a national as well as a local and regional view, planning, for example, how we might profitably link the power systems of the Columbia and the Missouri Rivers, and deciding where public and cooperative power systems require steam as well as hydro plants. [Applause.] I believe the time is coming in the Missouri Basin, for example, when power user groups will operate thermal generating plants, utilizing the lignite fields of the Dakotas, Montana, and Wyoming, to supplement the hydropower of the Missouri River dams. [Applause.]', 'Fifth, we shall, I hope, develop more businesslike budget practices for the natural resources development, practices which distinguished between capital investment and operating expenditures, instead of a system which treats capital invested in a wholly self-liquidating power project, the same as an expenditure which cannot ever be recovered. Those who cry ""Spending"" on these essential projects will be less convincing when the ledger shows which projects are income-producing, wealth-creating assets that make money, finally, for the taxpayer.', 'Sixth, we will restore REA to its former role of preeminence, bringing it from cost of concern over political interference, higher rates of interest and budgetary starvation [applause] and enabling that remarkable American institution to get on with its work of providing low-cost electricity and telephones for every American farm family.', 'Seventh, we will step up the fight against the water pollution. I can imagine nothing more wasteful than to pollute our rivers and permit valuable water to flow to the sea in conditions where other people cannot use it. [Applause.] Our goal must be the fullest utilization of every drop and gallon of water in every river system in America, and it is a source of regret to me that the Potomac River, which flows by our Capital, is one of the most polluted rivers west of the Ganges. [Laughter and applause.]', ""Eighth, we will restore America's leadership in atomic development and protect the public's tremendous investment in this source of energy which must be tapped for the public good."", 'Ninth, and finally, we will apply to the development of our resources the same scientific talents and energies which we have applied to the development of our national defense, inquiring into methods of preventing evaporation, of controlling weather, of retaining snowpacks, above all, of converting salt water to fresh water, for whichever nation wins that race, to develop an economical way of using our seas for plants and human consumption will have done more to win the friendship of people who live in deserts around great oceans than all the sputniks in outer space. [Applause.]', 'That is our program. It is ambitious, but in my opinion unless this country is prepared to move forward in this area, and in other areas in the sixties, all the debates, all the talk about the great American past will mean nothing. Unless we are prepared to build a great American future, unless we are able to show as Franklin Roosevelt showed in the thirties, what could be done in the Tennessee Valley, which has been a stronger weapon for the cause of freedom than any other weapon we have almost had in the last 20 years - because people from all over the world come to the Tennessee Valley, where I spent yesterday, and look at it and say, ""We can do the same. Under a system of freedom we can harness our resources.""', ""Now, in eastern Persia, in the Indus River, in Colombia, and in 20 other countries, smaller TVA's are being built because we showed them how. [Applause.]"", 'I want us to do the same in the sixties. I want to show the people of the world how freedom can work. I want them to see that this is a private system of individual liberty, where people join together for the public good. That is the best answer. If we are strong and vital and moving here, we are going to be strong and vital in moving around the world. If we sit still here, if we look to the past if we stay and say, ""No"" to the next decade, then all the arguments and debates and high-sounding speeches of our opposition to communism, of our belief in freedom, I think they fall flat. We sound strongest when we are doing something here at home. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States, and the same is true of Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt - men who moved their country and by moving their country moved the world. I think that is the opportunity ahead of us in the sixties, and I am proud as a member of the oldest party in the United States to assert that we are the youngest party from the point of view of vitality and new ideas, of a recognition of our opportunities, and of our challenges, and of our responsibilities. The inscription on the Grand Coulee Dam powerhouse says, ""Begun in time of adversity, it stood in war as a sentinel of strength, safeguarding the Nation, forever a monument to those who shared in its conception and its construction in peace. It is the key to new American frontiers of opportunity and agriculture and industry.""', 'I ask that this country pass in the new frontiers of the sixties where opportunity beckons and the challenges are great, and we can serve our cause and the cause of freedom. Thank you. [Applause and standing ovation.]']"
149,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","['I am here as the Democratic standard bearer to present my program for American agriculture.', 'Tomorrow the Republican candidate for President will present the second half of his views on agriculture. And I have no doubt that, as you listen, you will find that we use much the same vocabulary - that we both proclaim the same friendship for the American farmer, and the same concern about his needs.', 'How then, in this election year of 1960, is the American farmer to choose between Mr. Nixon and myself - between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party? For an answer we must return to the ancient Biblical injunction: ""By their fruits shall ye know them."" And by their fruits the American farmer has learned the true meaning of Republican election year speeches and pledges.', 'In 1952 they promised - and Mr. Nixon led them - ""not merely 90 percent of parity - but full parity.""', 'In 1956 they promised - and Mr. Nixon led them - ""full parity of income in the marketplace.""', 'And tomorrow, in 1960, whatever the formula they have chosen, they will again promise you new abundance, increased income, protection for REA and co-ops - and again, Mr. Nixon will lead them.', 'And what were the fruits of these earlier promises? They were a 20 percent drop in farm income, the destruction of many thousands of family farms, the depressing growth of surplus stocks to the highest point in the history of any nation, and a farm program which costs more in 1 year than all the farm programs of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman combined. This is the result of 8 years of Republican election promises and I cannot believe that the American farmer is ready to be moved in that direction again.', 'For tomorrow Mr. Nixon will come before you proclaiming himself to be the true champion of the American farmer - calling for new and bold programs.', 'But this is the same Mr. Nixon who called Mr. Benson the greatest Secretary of Agriculture in history and said that his programs were the only true road to farm prosperity.', 'This is the same Mr. Nixon who, little more than a year ago, in a report to the President, attacked the policy of providing price supports for what he called a few favored commodities - commodities like wheat and corn and tobacco and cotton.', ""This is the same Mr. Nixon who, according to Secretary of Agriculture Benson, played a prominent part in the formulation of present farm policies. And, although Mr. Benson may not be a great Secretary of Agriculture, he is a truthful man, and no one knows Mr. Nixon's role better than he."", 'Today the Republicans promise higher income for the farmer. Yet for 8 years, as farm incomes declined, the Republicans fought for legislation to weaken farm price support programs and drive prices even lower.', 'Today the Republicans promise to use our surpluses to feed and clothe the hungry people of the world. But, when the Democrats in Congress first proposed a food-for-peace program, the Republicans fought it - and they have fought consistently against all our efforts to expand this program.', 'Today the Republicans promise to use our surpluses to improve the diets of our hungry and undernourished here at home. But the Republicans opposed our efforts to expand the school-lunch program and the school-milk program - and they have refused to put into operation an expanded program of food distribution which was enacted by a Democratic Congress.', 'During the primaries I spent 6 weeks in West Virginia where thousands of families wait every month for packages of Government surplus food. I saw hungry families. I saw undernourished children. But I didn\'t see ""Operation Consume.""', ""This is the record of the party whose leader comes before you tomorrow. There are those who say that the American farmer is going to vote Republican on November 8. I don't believe it. I don't believe that any farmer who has seen his income go down and his costs go up during the past 8 years is going to vote Republican. I don't believe that any farmer who has witnessed the steady destruction of the family farm and the steady decline of farming as a way of life is going to vote Republican. I don't believe that the American farmer is going to vote for a political party which, in all its history, has never taken one single constructive step to raise the incomes of American farmers. And I don't believe that the American farmer is going to vote against the only political party which has ever acted - in this century or any other - to improve the lot of American agriculture - the Democratic Party. For when a farmer votes Republican - he votes not only against himself, but against the interest and welfare of every farmer and every farm in the United States. And I don't believe the farmers are going to do it."", 'The basic failure of Republican leaders to grasp the problems of the farmer have caused them to misinform the American people.', 'They have tried - and in a large measure they have succeeded - in persuading the American consumer that our farmers are getting too much - that they are profiteering from the Government - that farm prices are too high - and that the consumer is paying the bill.', 'This is what Mr. Benson and Mr. Nixon have been telling the Nation during the past 8 years - and they have created a distrust and resentment toward the farmer on the part of many Americans.', ""But you and I know that these charges are not true. We know that while consumer prices have been going up, farm prices have been going down, and that the farmer's share of the consumer's dollar has declined sharply since 1952."", 'But unfortunately the American people do not know this. And they will never know it until they have a Secretary of Agriculture and a President who will speak for, not against, the American farmer - who will champion the cause of agriculture, not attempt to discredit it - an administration that realizes that America needs the farmer as much as the farmer needs the administration.', 'And if elected President, I will give you that kind of Secretary of Agriculture and that kind of administration.', 'But the farmers of this Nation need more than a spokesman. They need a new program, and new policies, and a new approach to the challenge of our farm.', 'For today American agriculture is in the grip of a technological revolution as vast and as rapid as any in history. It is a revolution which has made the American farmer the most efficient in history. It has made his productivity the marvel and envy of every nation. Every farmer in this country produces three times as much as his Soviet counterpart. And if there is one area of our competition with the Soviet Union in which we are clearly ahead, that area is agricultural production. Experts from all over the world come to see our farms, to study our techniques, and learn our methods. And the farm technology we have developed here in the United States holds out hope to the world for the first time that no man, woman, or child on earth needs to go hungry again.', ""But even though this rising productivity is a source of national power and strength, it can be a disaster for the individual farmer. For when production rises - when it exceeds demand - then farm prices fall disastrously and farm income drops for all. And this fall in income is further intensified by the continual rise in the farmer's cost of production."", 'The answer of the Republican leaders is to increase dependence on the so-called free market - even though this must mean disaster for thousands of farmers who are trapped between rising costs and their own inability to control production.', 'Other areas of our economy are better able to deal with excess production. When more steel is being made than is being sold, the steel companies cut back production and maintain prices. But the individual farmer is too small to maintain prices or control production on his own or even with his neighbors. He lacks bargaining power in the markets. He needs the help and support of his Government.', 'And I come here today to offer you that help and support.', 'My program for agriculture is consistent with my call to the New Frontier. It makes no vague promises that can be interpreted different ways. It makes no pledge that I cannot keep or that the public interest would not permit. It gives you no assurances that you can have high incomes and unlimited production and no control, without regard to the taxpayer.', 'Rather it is a program which will take work and sacrifice and discipline. But it is, I believe in all sincerity, an honest program. It is a carefully thought out program. And it will be an effective program.', 'For I believe that the American farmer is tired of grandiose promises and unfulfilled pledges and remedial gimmicks. I believe you want to be told what must be done - and that you are ready to do it. I offer you such a program. And if you give me your help and your support, we will - together - build once again a farm economy where every man who works the soil can be assured of a decent life for himself and for his children.', 'First, we pledge ourselves to securing full parity of income for the American farmer. By ""parity of income"" I do not mean a vague target or a high-sounding goal. I mean a clear, easily defined concept which can be mathematically ascertained and computed. Parity of income is that income which gives average producers a return on their invested capital, labor, and management equal to that which similar, or comparable, resources earn in nonfarm employment. Parity of income prices under this definition can be calculated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture without difficulty.', ""Here is a concept which strikes to the heart of the farmer's problem. It does not concern itself directly or solely with prices - with what the farmer receives - but with his net income, his return, the only figure which is meaningful in determining his standard of living, particularly in this age of the cost-price squeeze. For the farmer, is the only man in our economy who has to buy everything he buys at retail - sell everything he sells at wholesale - and pay the freight both ways."", 'Secondly, we intend to assure this parity of income for the farmer primarily through supply management - the adjustment of supply to demand at parity income prices. Purchases and loans will be necessary on some commodities at certain times to supplement supply management. But a basic instrument of assuring parity of income will be supply management controls - including the use of marketing quotas, land retirement with conservation practices, marketing orders and agreements and other devices - to be used either together or separately, depending upon the needs of the specific commodity and the desires of the producers. The fundamental goal of all these devices is to effectively reach a balance between supply and demand - and thereby assure prices which will yield parity of income.', 'This supply management is necessary because it is a fact - and a fact which must be frankly faced if we are to save the farm problem - that we cannot have both good prices and unlimited production. The present costs of the farm program - six times as high as in 1952 - are already excessive. Our present surpluses - also six times as high as in l952 are much more than would conceivably be necessary for all our needs. So let us put away all slogans and illusions - and realize that supply management is essential. It is the price of good and stable incomes.', 'The type of supply management control to he used will, of course, vary with each commodity. For each commodity has different problems of production and marketing. And any program of supply management for any commodity must be worked out with producer committees and representatives of the farmers involved - and must receive the general approval of the affected farmers. This is basic. Any control program must have the overwhelming support of the person affected if it is to be successful.', 'Let me illustrate how supply management might work in the case of a basic commodity - wheat. Its operation is familiar to members of the National Association of Wheat Growers who have worked to develop a program that will raise and stabilize incomes to producers.', 'Under this program the Secretary of Agriculture would determine the amount of wheat that would be consumed - here and abroad - at parity income prices. This quota would be distributed among farmers on the basis of their historical record of production - and they would be issued marketing certificates permitting them to market their share of the national quota. All wheat sold for primary use must be accompanied by marketing certificates. As a condition of receiving his certificate each farmer would be required to retire a small fixed percentage of his wheat acreage.', ""This is not a production control program; it does not tell any producer how much he can produce, or in what manner. But it does limit his marketings for primary use. Under this program the wheat farmer's income would be increased to parity income levels - surpluses would be gradually reduced - and the retirement of wheat crop acreage would protect feed producers from additional feed production."", 'This is one example of supply management in operation. Feed grains - which are not grown for direct consumption - would require different treatment, such as a land-retirement program shared equitably among feed growers. So would other commodities. The important point is the principle of supply management applied by the producers themselves - to assure stable income and eliminate surpluses.', 'In my judgment there is no other way. Reducing price supports has not worked. Unlimited production has only driven incomes lower, and piled up surpluses. Only effective supply management will yield good and stable incomes to our farmers. And I believe that we must go ahead on that course.', 'Third, we must use our excess productive capacity to feed the hungry and undernourished here at home - through a full-scale school lunch program, a food stamp program that will permit unemployed and impoverished Americans to have a healthy and varied diet, and direct food distribution to welfare agencies and institutions. All three of these efforts to improve food distribution to needy Americans have been offered in recent years by the Democrats in Congress - and halted by Republican Opposition. In 1961 they will go into effect.', 'We must also use our untapped abundance to fight hunger and support economic development throughout the world. Nations fighting to stave off famine - to launch their new economies into orbit - or to prevent the instability on which communism thrives - all need adequate food supplies beyond the limits of their present resources.', 'Several years ago the Democrats initiated the Food for Peace program over Republican opposition. In the last year our efforts to expand that program were blocked once again. In 1961 we must begin a new expanded Food for Peace program, including a permanent food development project where our surplus food and fiber are used to supplement the agriculture of other lands, to combat hunger, to supply food reserve banks and to feed workers engaged in building roads, digging wells, and clearing land.', 'Fourth, we will begin a sound system of soil conservation which does not destroy entire farms and which is administered at the local levels by local farmers.', 'Fifth, we must modernize our specialized farm agencies to meet the farm revolution - by revitalizing our agricultural credit agencies so that farmers can get the credit they need, and at interest rates they can afford, to modernize and expand. In addition, better research and extension services, more assistance to co-ops, a strengthened REA, and expanded marketing services are all essential to the development of a sound rural economy. For our task is not to oppose the agricultural revolution, our task is to harness it to the needs of all Americans.', 'Sixth, we will initiate a special program for the low-production farmer - the farmer who must work with inadequate resources, who lives in rural poverty with a gross income of less than $2,500, and who forms part of an entirely different farm problem. His need is for expanded earnings opportunities. Reorganized and enlarged farms, new rural industries, and movement to nonfarm jobs are among the possible solutions. But new earning opportunities are not going to be developed without affirmative Government action and assistance - assistance which must certainly be more vigorous than the timid and fruitless efforts of the present Republican rural development program.', ""This is the program I offer to you. It is not complete in every detail - but it does, I believe, offer a sound and constructive approach - in fact the only realistic approach - to insuring the full use of our great productive capacity while bringing good incomes and a decent standard of living to all our farmers. It does not call for a regimented farm economy. On the contrary, the purpose of selective supply adjustment is to maintain the farmer's traditional freedom - to prevent the completely controlled farm economy that would result if the present program brings on a complete collapse - and to lead ultimately to a normal balance between supply and demand that will require as little Government interference as possible."", 'But let me close by stressing that this is not an issue for farmers alone. It is not an issue for the Farm Belt alone. This is a basic issue of American strength - and only a strong America can win the peace.', 'For peace is our real goal. Peace overshadows every other effort. And those of you who fought in the Pacific or in Europe - those of you who might have traveled, as I have traveled, to Poland and Eastern Europe and seen the despair of a people in chains - share my dedication to securing a just and lasting peace before it is too late.', 'There are trouble spots all over the world today. They are increasing. The Communists grow bolder every day. Their respect for our power grows less. And unless we get moving and building and strengthening our country and our economy the peace we seek will be in deadly peril.', ""With God's help, let us act now to save the peace - not as farmers or businessmen or workers, not as spokesmen for any group or section, but as Americans devoted to freedom, and to the future of our children, and children around the world.""]"

[Response from the audience.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. I come here today as the candidate for the Democratic Party, and I come in a most important time in a most significant election. I think in many ways the election of 1960 is more important than the election of 1932, because what was at stake in 1932 was the preservation of freedom in the United States, and I think what is at stake in the election of 1960 is the preservation of freedom around the world. There is one issue in this campaign, there is one great decision, which the American people must make in the coming 6 weeks, and that is which candidate, which party, which program offers the best hope for a stronger America. I don't think that there is any American, Republican or Democrat, and I would not cast any aspersions upon any American, and I do not cast them by innuendo or by implication, upon my opponent - I think he wants what I want. He wants a just peace for the United States and so does his party, and so does all America.

I think the question for the people of this district, and the question for the people of Iowa and the question for the people of the United States is a simple one: If you think that we are doing as much as we can do, if you think the balance of power is moving in our direction rather than the Communists, if you are satisfied with the position of the United States in the world, if you feel our policies toward Latin America and Africa and Asia are as vigorous and imaginative as they can be, if you feel the policies which affect this Nation, if you feel the agricultural policies of this administration are as good as they can he, then you should vote Republican.', 'But, if you think we can do better, if you think we can move ahead, if you think we can reverse the downward trend of agricultural prices, if you think we can build a better educational system and more security for our older people, if you think we can build a better defense, if you think that the United States should reestablish the atmosphere which existed through Latin America in the 1930\'s of the good neighbor, if you think the power balance in the world is turning against us, not with us, then I want you to join with us. I want you to move with us. I want you to decide in 1960 that we say ""Yes"" to the next decade, and not ""No""; that we want to move ahead, not stand still. I want your help in this campaign. I want your support, not because I run for the Presidency, but because I think we can make a contribution to the future of our own country - to its strength.', ""I ask your help. [Applause.] I don't say that life is going to be easy in the 1960's, but I think we can do better. I do think we can do more. I don't underrate this country. It is a great country. And I have served it for 18 years. But I think it can he a greater country. I think it is a powerful country, but I think it can be a more powerful country. I am not satisfied as a citizen, let alone as leader of my party. I am not satisfied as a citizen to have any question of whether the United States is first. I want Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro, and those who wish to follow on your road, to know that the United States is the leader not that the United States stands still but that we move ahead. [Applause.]"", ""I want you to join with us. I don't preach the doctrine of ease. I preach the doctrine of vigor and vitality and energy and force. This is a great country and we are going to make it greater. I ask your help in this effort. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
151,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Loveless, Mrs. Price, ladies and gentlemen. I want to express my appreciation to you for your hospitality. One of the interesting things in running for the Presidency is that you have to be prepared to speak at 11 o'clock at night or 8 in the morning. I am delighted to come. You have all contributed heavily. You have been touched deeply by coming to this breakfast. But it is most useful and most worthwhile. [Laughter.] I don't think it is presumptuous in thinking that this is an important election. The Congress has vast powers. I suppose really since the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, every decision of Government affects the lives of all of us. I would say that that is more true in the sixties than it has ever been before. It deserves some of our attention, it deserves some of our lives, whether you be farmers or small businessmen or professional men or housewives. There is not any doubt that the decisions of the next President and the next Senate and the next Congress, and the Governor of this State, will affect for good or for bad not only your lives, but the lives of your children, your education, your health, your income, your taxes, your security, the peace of the world, housing, the kind of business we have in this country."", 'We have been successful in maintaining a free society at the same time the government, State and National, plays a great role in our lives. The question that is before us in the sixties is whether a free society can compete unsuccessfully with a totalitarian society. When the Communists, both Chinese and Russian, are able to mobilize all of the resources to serve the state, when they operate a garrison state, when they are fully mobilized for the cold war, whether we can pursue a free society and pursue our own lives, and yet have sufficient public purpose to maintain our freedom, I think that is the big question that is before the United States, which transcends party differences.', 'I think it is to that question that the next administration and the next Congress will have to devote itself. how can we survive in a dangerous world and still maintain our freedom? I think we can. I think the free system happens to fit the best with the desires of the people every place. I think the experience in many ways of Africa in the last 3 or 4 years, and the experience of eastern Europe, gives me the most encouragement, in spite of all the difficulties in the Congo, and that is because of the desire of these people to be free and independent. In the last 2 or 3 months we have had 8 countries, or more, break away and become independent. We had a tremendous number join the United Nations the other day. In other words, there is a basic, strong passion running through the world to be free and independent. We saw it in East Germany, we saw it in Hungary, we saw it in Poland, and we saw it in Africa. In eastern Europe it was operating against the Communists. In Africa it was operating against the colonial powers. We have seen it in our own history. We have seen it in Latin America. How can people who desire to be free and independent, who will stop at nothing to gain their own independence, how can they possibly submit themselves to the tyranny of the Communists in the next 3 or 4 years? I consider this desire to be independent the strongest force for freedom of our security in the world. We support that cause or at least we should.', ""One of the real criticisms that I have of the U.S. foreign policy has been that we have not associated ourselves strongly enough since the end of World War II with this tremendous force which is sweeping the world. I thought we should have in Indochina. I thought we should have in north Africa. I think we should in all of Africa. These people may not be able successfully to maintain the kind of democracy that we have, but their desire to be free is our most valuable weapon. We do not wish to dominate them; the Communists do. Therefore, I look to the future with some trepidation and concern, but also with some hope. I think this is the strong force that I think is going to favor the cause of freedom with which we are intimately associated. I think we need an administration which is alert to these kinds of changes. When the Congo difficulty began, and I don't know why I am talking about Africa at Sioux City, except this is the kind of problem we will have to deal with, we offered 300 scholarships to the Congo, for young men to come over here, even though there are less than 15 college graduates in all of the Congo, to operate a free society. Why should we suddenly offer 300 scholarships to the Congo when we have not offered nearly that number to all of Africa? We do it in the point of turmoil. Proposals are made for the relief of Latin America because of our difficulties with Castro, proposals are made for aid to the Congo because of our difficulties with Lumumba. Couldn't we look to the future? Couldn't we look through the veil of tomorrow and make some decision which would make it possible for us to foresee events?"", 'The number of students here from Africa, by the Government, number less than 200. There are a number here on private scholarships, many more than that. But it indicates a handful of students from all of these countries where the need is for greater education. I think this administration has not looked to the future and recognized the kind of needs we will have to have in foreign policy.', 'And what is true of foreign policy is true in domestic policy. Therefore, while I feel these are sophisticated issues, and while people talk about foreign policy and the issue of peace and security, and that is the basic issue, nevertheless, to get peace, to get security, I think we have to have an administration with imagination, and with a consuming interest in the problems that face us.', 'I hope that if we are successful - and it is not, as I said before a fight merely between Mr. Nixon and myself, we lead two parties, two forces, two sources of energy. I happen to think that the Democratic Party has the kind of vitality, curiosity, that attracts people who happen to have new ideas and be associated with the future. It always has.', ""If you are a standpatter, you don't join the Democratic Party; you go over to the Republican Party. And they have, for the last 100 years since Lincoln's death, with the exception of Theodore Roosevelt, but if you look to the future, if you have concern, if you have a vague sense of satisfaction with what is going on and a feeling we can do better, I think you should be with our party, whether it is the agricultural policy in this country, whether it is the needs of the State of Iowa, whether it is the problems facing the United States, I happen to think that the Democratic Party has a contribution to make in the sixties."", ""Your presence here indicates that you feel the same. I think Iowa and this district, this State, are gifted with exceptional candidates. Governor Loveless' record is known. I have no doubt he is going to be successful. Mr. McManus has been an exceptional young figure who has come out of the State, and I think he will carry on strong. Mr. O'Brien, I think, will speak strongly for this district and the country. And I hope that if I am elected I will speak for this district, Iowa, the United States, and the course of freedom. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"
152,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Senator Burdick, State Chairman Abner Lawson, Mrs. Knutson, the next Congresswoman from Minnesota, Mr. Anderson, the next Congressman from this district, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for being kind enough to wait at the airport for my sister and myself, and also my regrets for being so late. In case any of you wanted to run for the Presidency, I would say we started this morning in Iowa, we spoke in South Dakota, we speak now in North Dakota, we speak at a dinner meeting in Montana, and end up in Wyoming tonight. I think that my election chief thinks that the election is October 8 rather than November 8. [Laughter.]', 'In any case, we are delighted to be here. I am glad to be here, but there is no doubt also that I would probably not be here if it were not for the support that the Democrats gave me at the National Convention. I doubt very much that I would be nominated. [Applause.] So I come here tonight with the hope that having gotten me this far, that North Dakota would be willing to help me along the rest of the way. [Applause.]', ""The sun is setting and I understand there are no lights - the lights are going out for the Republican Party all over the United States. [Laughter.] But I want to say one or two things. I spoke this afternoon at the plowing contest on what I consider to be the No.1 domestic problem which the United States faces, and that is the sharp decline in agricultural income. I think the farmers of North Dakota and the farmers of South Dakota and of Minnesota and Montana have a very clear choice. The question is which party and which candidate can meet their problems in this State, and meet their problems in this country. They have heard from the Democratic Party and they have heard from the Republican Party. I remember when President Truman used to say that the farmers had themselves to blame for their difficulties because they voted Republican in 1952. But I don't hold that view wholly, because in 1952, the farmers were informed that the Republican Party stood for 100-percent parity not once but at least three times."", 'In this general geographic area, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, joined by the Republican candidate for the Vice Presidency, assured the farmers that they were in favor of 100-percent parity in the marketplace. Now it is 8 years later. Now, when the Republican candidate for the Presidency comes out with campaign assurances and campaign promises, you have the right to make a judgment, based on the experience of the last 8 years, as to which candidate and which party, and members of which ground stand strongest for agricultural income in the United States at this time. I think the Democrats do, in this State, in Minnesota, in South Dakota, and in Montana. [Applause.]', 'I described the type of agricultural program which we wanted and I applied to wheat, and I would like to have you listen to it exactly. It is very short. And that is here is the way we would handle the problem facing the wheatgrowers, and I think comparable programs could be worked out for other commodities.', 'Under this wheat program, the Secretary of Agriculture would determine the amount of wheat that would be consumed here and abroad at parity income prices. This quota would be distributed among farmers on the basis of their historical record of production, and they would be issued marketing certificates, permitting them to market their share of the national quota. All wheat sold for primary use must be accompanied by marketing certificates. As a condition of receiving a certificate, each farmer would be required to retire a small fixed percentage of his wheat acreage. This is not a production control program. It does not tell any farmer how much he can produce or in what manner, but it does limit his marketing for primary use. This is the kind of program which has been endorsed and originally worked out by the National Association of Wheat Growers, and I have endorsed it fully.', 'I think your distinguished Senators from this area of the United States have supported it, and I think it offers far more sense than the programs which this administration has worked out and offered the American farmer during the past 8 years, 100 percent of parity in the marketplace in 1952 and corn at 65 percent of parity in 1960.', ""I think the record is clear. I would like your support in this campaign. I ask your help, not just as farmers, and not just as citizens of North Dakota. I ask your help as fellow Americans in a difficult time in the life of our country. I don't think any candidate for the Office of the Presidency can possibly run in 1960 saying that the problems are easy, or that the solutions are easy. The problems are difficult, the solutions are difficult and the burden that will be placed on the shoulders of Americans in the sixties will be heavier than they have been for 100 years. But I do think it is possible to move in this country. I don't say what we are doing now is as good as we can do. This is a great country, but I think it must be a greater country. We occupy a position of leadership in the world, but I think we can do far better, than our record of the past 2 or 3 or 4 years."", ""Can you tell me anywhere in a crisis, from Cuba to the Congo to Laos, where the United States has been ahead of events? We have held out our hands of friendship to the people of Latin America before we had to, where we did it at our own free will rather than at the point of Castro's pistol? We go now and offer a program of Africa to the United Nations. We offer a program of aid; We offer scholarships to the Congo. Did anyone in this administration talk about Africa before 6 months ago? I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee, and I can tell you they did not."", ""Next January or February India will face a major financial crisis unless she receives some financial assistance. Does anyone in the administration talk about India today? Does anyone look to the future? Does anyone make a judgment that such and such a thing will happen in 6 months and let's do something about it now? Is it necessary for a country to go Communist, or an area, before the United States begins to look at it? That isn't the way foreign policy was conducted under the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. We looked ahead, whether it was in agriculture here in this State, or in foreign policy around the world."", 'We must not react; we must show some leadership, some judgment of events, before they hit us. That is what leadership is; not a response, but a judgment of the future, and an indication of what policies will bring the most secure future.', 'The Democratic Party is the oldest party on earth that is still functioning, but I think in many ways its common denominator has been its willingness to break new ground, to look to the future. The problems we face now are entirely new. Nothing that has happened in the last two or three decades gives us any assurances for the future. Therefore, I put my confidence in those who are ready and who have shown their willingness to face the future and to seed it and to make it ours.', 'I ask your help in this campaign, not merely as citizens of North Dakota, or citizens of the Central United States, but as citizens concerned about the future of freedom in the United States, and the future of freedom around the world. We can do better. That is the issue. Those who feel we can do better, those who feel we can make a better life in this country, those who feel that the United States can reestablish its leadership, as a strong and vital country, who can stand for strong image in a world in doubt, I would like their help. I would like them to join Senator Johnson and myself, and Senator Burdick and others, in trying to fight for a stronger and freer country. Thank you very much. [Applause.]']"
153,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Merwin - I am very grateful for the generous introduction of Merwin Coad, with whom I served in the Congress for several years, and who has been an adviser and a friend of mine, particularly on the subject of agriculture. So I am most grateful to be his guest today. I am confident that this district, which is forward-looking, is going to have the sound judgment on behalf of its own interests and those of the United States to send him back to Congress with a warm majority. [Applause.] And he can renew his service there with a Senator from Iowa, who will speak as the former Governor of this State, who was chairman of the advisory committee on agriculture to the Democratic Party prior to the convention, and who is now chairman of Farmers for Kennedy and Johnson, your distinguished Governor, and your next U.S. Senator, Herschel Loveless. [Applause.] The way is clear now for Herschel Loveless to be succeeded as Governor by your Lieutenant Governor and your next Governor of the State of Iowa, Nick McManus. [Applause.]', 'We are about to depart and go to South Dakota, where I am supposed to speak this afternoon on behalf of the Democratic Party on agriculture. I think the farmers of the United States have a serious decision to make. I remember hearing President Truman, and undoubtedly you heard him make this speech, that the farmers maybe deserved what they got because they voted Republican in 1952. [Laughter.]', 'I am not sure that that judgment is not somewhat harsh, because if you recall the farmers voted in 1952 because they were informed by the Republican Party in 1952 that they were going to get 100 percent parity support prices in the market. [Applause.]', 'Well, now we have had 8 years. The farmer in 1960 is not the farmer of 1952. He has had 8 years to study the fruits of his judgment of 1952. [Applause.] We have heard a good deal about Operation Consume and Operation Distribution and Operation Production, and will hear more tomorrow when the Vice President of the United States addresses the farmers on his farm program. But I do not come to the farmers today, nor does the Vice President come to the farmers tomorrow, out of the blue. This matter before us has been before us not merely for 8 years, but for 25 years. I think the farmers of the United States can make a clear and precise judgment as to which party, day in, day out, month after month, year after year, has been more concerned with the income of the farmers of this country, and I have no doubt that when all the speeches are separated, when all the promises of this campaign are analyzed, I think that we should look at the record. The Bible says, ""By their fruits you shall know them."" One hundred percent parity in 1952, and I don\'t know what we are going to hear tomorrow. But we have the record of the last 8 years. We have Mr. Benson\'s own statement that Mr. Nixon was a major participant in the development of the Benson program, and Mr. Benson may not be, as Mr. Nixon says, the greatest Secretary of Agriculture in history, but he is a truthful man. [Laughter and applause.]', ""I don't say there is any easy answer, but I do say that the Government and the farmers, working together, recognizing that surpluses which are unconsumed by our own people and by people around the world, break the price. The balance between supply and demand useful supply, supply to our own people, and the hungry people around the world, I think to bring that kind of supply into balance with that kind of demand, I think can bring us a successful farm program. I spent a month in West Virginia, and I saw 100,000 families that wait for surplus food packages which include some grain, cornmeal, rice, and this summer they are going to add lard. Why should they have to wait to add lard in the richest country on earth?"", 'Operation Consume I did not see in West Virginia, and there are 4 million people in the United States who wait every month for surplus food packages to sustain their lives. Yet this administration has opposed a food stamp program. It has opposed any worthwhile and realistic way of distributing our food to our people. I would like to see the next President of the United States take 100 acres of farmland and say, ""This percentage can be grown for distribution of a decent price in the marketplace for our people here at home. This percent age can be sold in the marketplaces of the world for a decent price. This percentage of that 100 acres will be for our own people, for schoolchildren, for surplus food, for our older people who get surplus food packages; that percentage will be used for the American people. This percentage will be used and not called a surplus, but will be used as an asset in the great struggle of the sixties to decide whether the underdeveloped world, where people starves by the millions, will come with us or with the Communists.""', 'I said last night if Mr. Khrushchev had the choice between 50 scientists and 50 American farmers, he would take the farmers and be right, because the secret of growing food with only a small percentage of the population is the great asset which we have in the sixties, and an asset greater than sputnik and more meaningful in the long run than any other asset that this country has - to grow, therefore, the remaining percentage, to determine which part of that percentage of the 100 acres can be used to distribute food usefully through the United Nations and by our own agreements, food for peace.', ""Everyone talks about it, but it has not been sustained and supported since we put it forward in 1956 and 1957. Hubert Humphrey and Orville and the others put it forward as a program to spread the message around the world that the American people were not interested just in the cold war, not just in the fight against the communism, but were interested in people for people's sake. That is the spirit which motivated Franklin Roosevelt and Wilson and Truman, and if we are going to have influence, if we are going to stand up to Mr. Khrushchev, it isn't just a question of arguments in the kitchen or out of the kitchen; it is having policies which move this country and make it stand for something around the world."", 'I ask your support in the campaign, not because I am the candidate, but because I think that this country has a great chance in the sixties, and because after 14 years in the Congress, and after 18 years in the service of our country, all of us want the best for our country, and I think this year we can do better. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
154,John F. Kennedy ,"September 22, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Congressman McGovern, Governor and Mrs. Herseth, Mrs. Price, my sister, distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation for the opportunity to be here in George McGovern's home and in the State where he comes from. I appreciated what he said about me and I appreciated it particularly because I think he has the same qualities which he was generous enough to ascribe to me. [Applause.]"", 'Quite obviously, I think whether you may be a Republican or a Democrat - I think that you will agree that what we really need is the best talent that we can get, the most honest talent we can get, the most energetic and vital intellect that we can apply to the great problems that face the United States.', ""I know there is a great feeling that the politicians who used to live 100 years ago, 75 years ago, 125 years ago, were far superior to the men who dominate the political life today. The halfbacks 30 years ago were faster, the girls were prettier, and the politicians, like Daniel Webster and John Calhoun and all the rest were far abler. But I don't know whether you realize that Calhoun and Clay and Stephen Douglas and all the men who dominated the political life in the 19th century really dealt in that entire period of time with four or five problems the development of the West, the railroads passing through the West, the admission of new States, slave or free, our relations with England, France, and occasionally with the Soviet Union."", 'We challenge now, the United States meets now problems which dwarf in complexity every week the kind of problems which those men dealt with in their lifetimes. The problems that you face here in the State of South Dakota, dealing with the problem of agriculture, how we are going to harness our capacity, how we are going to harness our abundance and make our abundance fruitful for ourselves and for people all around the world is a problem far more vast, far more complicated, than any which faced any 19th century statesman.', 'What is true of agriculture is true of fiscal policy, is true of monetary policy, is true of the sophisticated questions which face us in national defense, nuclear energy, our relations with the Soviet Union, Latin America, and Asia. Therefore, I can say to you that the next President of the United States will deal with problems far more complicated, far more difficult of solution, requiring greater judgment, greater responsibility, than any President of the United States in history.', ""We don't have candidates who measure up to those Presidents of history perhaps, but I do want to emphasize that when we can get talent, and I think George McGovern has that kind of talent, I think we should seize it. I think it is the kind of man that we need in this country. [Applause.]"", 'I think the same is true of your distinguished Governor, Governor Herseth. The trouble is [applause] the great trouble with American politics today, I think, is that we talk in slogans too often and symbols and we fight old battles. The sixties are going to be entirely different. Unless the political leaders of both parties can recognize that new problems bring new solutions, that the problems which will face the United States bear no comparison with the problems which faced us in the days of Eisenhower and Truman and Roosevelt and Wilson. We are a new generation which science and technology and the change in world forces are going to require to face entirely new problems which will require new solutions. Therefore, I run for the office of the Presidency as head of a party which is the oldest political party on earth. But I do believe that the Democratic Party has had one silver thread which has run through the tapestry of our history since the days of Thomas Jefferson and that has been the willingness to look ahead, to face the future, to break new ground, to try new solutions, to recognize new problems.', 'I came today to this State in what I think to be the most dangerous time in the life of our country, a time which can be bright for all of us, but which is also full of hazards. It would be easier, perhaps, if we were Switzerland or Norway or Denmark or Sweden, a small country out of the course of world events. But world events and our own power and our own desire to be free have made us the leader of the free world. If we fail, the whole cause of freedom fails. If we succeed, the cause of freedom succeeds. That is the responsibility that is thrust upon a corn farmer or a wheat farmer in the State of South Dakota. He must concern himself not only with agricultural policy, but with our policy toward Pakistan and India and Latin America and Africa, and our policy in outer space as well as in the earth of South Dakota.', ""I think this is the most dangerous time for all of us. I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that there are easy solutions to difficult problems. There are difficult solutions for difficult problems, but there are solutions. I have the greatest possible confidence in our system, because I think it fits in with the basic aspiration of people, not only in the United States, but all around the world to be free and independent, a common desire, possessed by people in Latin America, and Africa, and Asia, and Eastern Europe, and in the Soviet Union, finally, itself. That is the great force working for us."", 'The seed it planted and ultimately is going to reap the harvest the desire of people to be independent whether they live in Congo or Cuba or Russia or Poland or East Germany. Sooner or later the basic desire to run their own affairs, to be free men and women, I think represents the most powerful force that this country has. And my great criticism of the foreign policy of this administration has been that we have not associated ourselves with those aspirations. We have not recognized that that is the way of the future. The United States has not spoken for freedom. We did not concern ourselves with the position of the Congo when the Belgians had it. We are concerned that the Soviet Union will control the Congo, but we never spoke a word about the Congo when it was held in another kind of colonialism. Unless we identify ourselves with freedom here in the United States and around the world, then the United States will appear to have lost its vitality and force. That is why we led before. The reason Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were world leaders was not because they forced their solutions, but because they stood for great moral principles in good times and bad, against friend and foe, and I hope it is possible in the sixties, if the United States is going to lead the world again, that we associate ourselves with great causes once again, that we speak strongly for the interests of South Dakota, that we review and concern ourselves for the interests of agriculture in the State of South Dakota, that we recognize that this is a blessing from the Lord, that there are people who are hungry all over the world, and in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and Kentucky, and here in this State, which is a rich and prosperous State potentially in the food that you produce, this is one of the great sources of strength for the United States in the next 10 or 20 years.', 'I don\'t regard the problem of agricultural surplus as a problem. I regard it as an opportunity to use it imaginatively, not only for our own people, but for people all around the world. There are faces in the United States which you know - West Virginia, Kentucky, parts of Tennessee, southern Illinois, and Pennsylvania - where over 4 1/2 million people wait every month for surplus food packages from our Government. They live on an inadequate diet. The food packages would not total a cost of $3.25 a month for the Government - one can of dried eggs, some powdered milk, some rice, some grain, and this summer the Department of Agriculture announced it is going to add lard. No chickens, no meat, no ham, no nothing, for fellow Americans who live out their lives in desperation and without hope, and every month we give them a pittance. And what is true in this country is true around the world. As long as the great battle which occupies the attention of the people around the world is: ""How can we eat three times a day?"" We have strength, because we know how to do it; 12 percent of our population feeds our people and could feed much of the hungry world; 85 percent of the population in other countries searches for food. That is the revolution which this State and States like it - that is the great miracle of the United States since the end of World War II, the increase of food production, and it is a great asset. It is a great asset and should be so regarded.', 'I hope the next President of the United States, in putting forward his proposals for agriculture and if it is me I will make them very clear - that we recognize that in every hundred acres there is a percentage of that production which could be produced for a price which would be a parity price in the market. If you produce 5 percent more than that 100 acres can consume, you break the price. Divide your 100 acres. One part of it will be for domestic production, at a parity price. The second part will be to feed our own people who are hungry, the unemployed, the old, the sick. The third part of it will be a food program for peace, through the United Nations and through our own distributive agencies.', 'The fourth part will be a conservation reserve, not whole farms, but a conservation reserve, sharing and storing our land for the time when we may need it. To think that you can possibly control production by dropping support prices down and down and down, which causes a farmer to produce more and more has found us in our present situation with great surpluses, low farm income, high burden on the taxpayer, and a farm income which is bringing distress to other sections of the United States. I am delighted to come here today. I appreciate your invitation. I come here as a candidate for the Presidency to say this, and that is that I hope those of you who are farmers will never get the idea, and those who live in cities, that there is a hostility which exists between the cities and the farms. Fellow Americans facing a difficult future, I think the farmers can bring more credit, more lasting good will, more chance for freedom, more chance for peace, than almost any other group of Americans in the next 10 years, if we recognize that food is strength, and food is peace, and food is freedom, and food is a helping hand to people around the world whose good will and friendship we want. So you are a great source of strength to us in these great years ahead, and I come as a presidential candidate with the greatest possible hope for the future and ask you to join in a great effort on behalf of our country and the State of South Dakota. The motto of the State of South Dakota is ""Under God the People Rule."" The motto of the United States could be the same. I hope in the next 10 or 20 years when historians write of our times that they will write that that cause of the people ruling under God spread in these years and became stronger, increased in strength, increased in substance.', 'During the American Constitutional Convention, there was a painting of a sun low on the horizon behind the desk of General Washington and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun. At the conclusion, Benjamin Franklin stood up and he said, ""We now know. We have now decided because of what we have done that it is a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I think it can be for the United States because of what we do in the coming months and years, it can be a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
155,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","['I am grateful to the presidency of the Latter Day Saints Church, and to its presiding bishopric, for according mc the privilege of speaking within the historic walls of this magnificent tabernacle. This is an honor which I shall long remember.', 'I am honored, too, to be here with Elbert Curtis, my friend and spokesman in this State. It was here more than a hundred years ago that the great-grandfather of Elbert Curtis declared: ""This is the Place."" And here Brigham Young built not only a great tabernacle, famed the world over, but a great State, the heart of a great intermountain region, replacing the barren desert with a land now rich in resources, beauty, and spirit.', 'Tonight I speak for all Americans in expressing our gratitude to the Mormon people - for their pioneer spirit, their devotion to culture and learning, their example of industry and self-reliance. But I am particularly in their debt tonight for their successful battle to make religious liberty a living reality - for having proven to the world that different faiths of different views could flourish harmoniously in our midst - and for having proven to the Nation in this century that a public servant devout in his chosen faith was still capable of undiminished allegiance to our Constitution and national interest.', 'I am thinking of Apostle Reed Smoot - and those who challenged his right to a seat in the U.S. Senate, charging that he would subordinate the claims of his country to the claims of his church. They did not know - or would not hear - that the 101st section of the Latter Day Saints Doctrine and Covenants gave a scriptural preeminence to the Constitution and its oaths. But fortunately the forces of reason and tolerance enabled him to take his seat. And in the years that followed, Senator Smoot earned the respect and affection of every Senator who had challenged him. He rose to be dean of the Senate and chairman of its powerful Committee on Finance - and no voice was ever heard to say that he had not been devoted solely to the public good as he saw it.', 'The story of Reed Smoot symbolizes the long struggle of the Mormon people for religious liberty. They suffered persecution and exile, at the hands of Americans whose own ancestors, ironically enough, had fled here to escape the curse of intolerance. But they never faltered in their devotion to the principle of religious liberty - not for themselves alone, but for all mankind. And in the 11th article of faith, Prophet Joseph Smith not only declared in ringing tones: ""We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience"" - he also set forth the belief that all men should be allowed ""the same privilege. Let them worship how, where, or what they may.""', ""And what has been true of the Mormons has been true of countless other religious faiths - Jews, Quakers, Catholics, Baptists, Unitarians, Christian Scientists, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and many, many others. All encountered resistance and oppression. All stuck by both their rights and their country. And in time the fruits of liberty were theirs to share as well; and the very diversity of their beliefs enriched our Nation's spiritual strength."", 'That spiritual strength is not the product of any one church or sect. This Nation, as the Supreme Court has said, ""knows no heresy and is committed to the support of no dogma."" More than 200,000 churches in 50 States represent some 255 religious groups. Many a great nation has been torn by religious feuds and holy wars - but never the United States of America. For here diversity has led to unity - liberty has led to strength. And today that strength - that spiritual, moral strength - is needed as never before.', 'Americans have faced peril before. We have faced powerful enemies before. We have confronted many a dictator as harsh as Secretary Khrushchev. But Mr. Khrushchev - while he may symbolize and personify our danger - is not the enemy. Defeating Mr. Khrushchev in debate does not defeat the enemy. For the enemy is the Communist system itself - implacable, insatiable, unceasing in its drive for world domination.', 'When I visited the Soviet Union in 1939, it was barely emerging into the 20th century, isolated in its godless tyranny, devoid of allies and influence. Today, 21 years later, the Kremlin rules a ruthless empire stretching in a great half circle from East Berlin to Vietminh - with outposts springing up in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and now, only 90 miles from our shores, in the fretful island of Cuba.', 'The products of their once-backward educational system have surpassed our vaunted science and engineering in launching rockets to the moon and outer space. The growth of their once-backward economy now progresses at a rate nearly three times as fast as our own. And the prestige of this once-feared and hated nation now weaves a glittering web entrapping neutralists and nationalists in all corners of the globe.', 'In almost every area of competition - military, diplomatic, economic, scientific, and educational - the Communists are now capable of competing with the United States on nearly equal terms.', 'But in one area the Communists can never overcome us - unless we fall back to their level - and that is the area of spiritual values - moral strength - the strength of our will and our purpose - the qualities and traditions that make this Nation a shining example to all who yearn to be free.', 'This is our single greatest advantage. For this is not a struggle for supremacy of arms alone - it is also a struggle for supremacy between two conflicting ideologies: Freedom under God versus ruthless, godless tyranny. The contest, moreover, is not merely to gain the material wealth of other nations - it is a contest for their hearts and minds. And the challenge to all Americans now is not merely the extent of our material contribution as taxpayers - but the extent to which we can find greater strength for the long pull in our traditions of religious liberty than the masters of the Kremlin can ever exact from disciplines of servitude.', 'Here in our land church and state are separate and free - in their lands neither is free, and the church lives in constant fear of the state. In our land the diversity of equality brings strength to our spiritual ties - in their lands the terror of tyranny drives hope and will from the hearts of men.', 'The Communists camp divides over the best pathway to follow to world conquest. In this Nation our two parties divide over the best pathway to world peace.', 'I have advocated the pathway of strength - a stronger America - the strongest sentinel at the gate of freedom - a nation prepared to put force behind law so that we will not be destroyed by the law of force. But I mean spiritually and morally stronger as well.', 'For it is a harsh fact that we have tended in recent times to neglect these deeper values in favor of our material strength. We have traveled in 100 years from the age of the pioneer to the age of payola. We boast to foreign visitors of our great dams and cities and wealth but not our free religious heritage. We have become missionaries abroad of a wide range of doctrines - free enterprise, anticommunism, and pro-Americanism - but rarely the doctrine of religious liberty.', ""This is not a party issue. It is not a matter of legislation. But it calls for leadership dedicated to our Nation's spiritual ideals - leadership inspiring in its sense of moral values - and leadership passionate in its devotion to the American heritage of liberty. It calls for a President whose every utterance will lift the hearts of those around the world who thirst for power or plenty - but who thirst even more for a leader of conviction and courage and compassion. And it calls, finally, for a whole Nation willing to recapture the spirit of 1847, willing to commit itself once again to great ends, willing to dedicate itself to the enrichment of our society as well as our lives."", 'I have called that challenge the New Frontier - for it represents - not the comforts we seek - but the tasks we must all perform, if we are to live up to our trust and our heritage. Tonight I ask the people of Utah to join me on that frontier - to work with me, and with Americans of every creed and section, in building a still greater Nation - and in building a world where the strong are just and the weak secure.', 'Then - but only then - can we truly heed the command which Brigham Young heard from the Lord more than a century ago - the command he conveyed to his little band of followers: ""Go as pioneers * * * to a land of peace.""']"
156,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","['Senator MOSS. Senator Kennedy, we were all inspired by that lifting address, and we do pledge to you our hearts and our help. [Applause.]', 'Senator Kennedy has agreed to respond to questions. Young ladies have passed through the audience earlier with cards, and questions will be propounded to the Senator which he will answer. He has not seen any of these questions. They will come direct from the floor, and he will respond at this podium.', 'Senator Kennedy, I see we have a question ready. Will you take the podium?', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Richard Avena. Will you tell us what steps you will take to raise American prestige in Latin America, as President of the United States. [Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. In the first place, I think there is a vital inter-relationship between what we are doing here in the United States and a successful foreign policy. In other words, I think the 14 points of Wilson were related to his new freedom here in the United States, and I think the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt succeeded in Latin America [applause] because he was a good neighbor here in this country. So that I think that we should concern ourselves in the coining months and years not only with our relations abroad, not only with the face that we present to the world, but also with the kind of society that we are developing here. ""What we are speaks louder than what we say,"" as Emerson said. [Applause.]', ""Secondly, in regard to Latin America, itself, I am critical of this administration's failure to concern itself with the needs of Latin America. [Applause.] Actually, the United States has given more assistance to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than it has to all of Latin America combined. It is an unfortunate fact that the assistance which was proposed at the time of the Bogota Conference really represented assistance which the United States was determined to give Latin America only when our relations with Cuba soured to the point where we broke off the sugar quota. I think it would have been far wiser for the United States to have held out the hand of friendship 6, 7, or 8 years, to help to provide a long-term loan [applause] to help provide specifically long-term loans for their capital improvements. I support the Bank of America, which was passed a year ago. I think that we can provide for a common market within Latin America, itself, based on the experience now of Western Europe. I think that we have to give some assurances to the producers of raw commodities that they will not he subject to the extremely sharp whiplash of 50 percent in commodity prices which they experienced in 1958 but can have longer guarantees."", 'Fifth, I hope that the United States will attempt, and I hope that the President of the United States, whoever he will be - that the first act he will take in the field of foreign policy will be to announce that he wishes to reassume the close and harmonious relationship which existed between us in the thirties, and which must exist between us in the sixties.', 'Franklin Roosevelt still serves the United States, because his name is the greatest asset we are going to have in the sixties.', 'As the Democratic nominee for the Presidency, I hope to tread that same path. [Applause.]', 'Senator MOSS. Do we have another question? We have another question.', 'QUESTION. Mr. Kennedy, my name is Herwood M. Hembrick. My question: How would you, Mr. Kennedy, as a candidate, try to solve problems resulting from discrepancies between American politics and Rome?', ""Senator MOSS. I didn't get it. Between American politics and what?"", 'QUESTION. And the Vatican.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I did not address myself directly to that question tonight, but I hope I did make some indirect reference to it. I support the U.S. Constitution. [Applause.] I am concerned as a public official with the maintenance of that Constitution. I take the same oath of office as the President of the United States takes and have taken it for 14 years in the Senate and the House, and 4 years before that in the service. The Constitution provides very happily under article 1 of the first amendment, a provision for the separation of church and state, and I consider that to be the most admirable organization of society that we could possibly devise. [Applause.]', 'And I would feel that any group existing outside the United States, whether it is the Vatican or anyone else, respects our basic conviction that church and state must be separate and that my obligation is to the Constitution and to uphold my duty.', 'I also suggest that there is another part of the Constitution also relevant which is article 6, which says there shall be no religious test for office. That protects all of us. [Applause.]', 'And lastly, may I say we have had two Chief Justices of the Supreme Court who have been of the same faith that I have been. We have had three Prime Ministers of Canada in this century. Both General de Gaulle and Adenauer I think speak for the interests of freedom and the interests of their country, as I hope I will, whether I am President or continue as U.S. Senator. [Applause.]', 'Senator MOSS. Thank you very much. We have another question. Give your name, please.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Danny Robacheck, and I would like to know what you think of being elected for a third term?', 'Senator MOSS. A third term? [Laughter.] all right. [Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I must say that I voted for the constitutional amendment when I was first in the House in 1947 which put a two-term limitation on the Presidency. I am beginning to wonder - I still think that is the wisest thing, and I think whoever is the next President of the United States would, not only because of the Constitution, and I support that amendment and will continue to do so, but I think wisdom indicates that 8 years is sufficient. I consider it enough. [Applause.] Especially now 8 years is enough.', 'QUESTION. My name is Dick Boss. I would like to ask you, if you would, to state your position on water reclamation for the Western States. [Applause.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. I spoke on that subject last night. I come from a section of the United States whose problems are different. But I do believe that it is vitally important that the United States recognize that by the year 2000 we are going to have 300 million people living in this country, and our natural resources - water, land, air - constitute the assets which the United States has in order to preserve a happy life on this continent. It is a source of satisfaction to me that the two Americans in this century who have done more to develop the resources of the West both came from New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.]', 'I know Senator Moss put out a statement in contradiction to another statement put out in regard to my record. Let me make it very clear that I have supported all projects which I considered to be soundly financed for reclamation, conservation, and power resources, from Hells Canyon to the project in this State. I supported the upper Colorado project as it came from the House of Representatives. My judgment is that the next administration, and this is certainly going to be true if I am elected President, will reverse the policy of no new starts, which has kept this western part of the United States on dead center for the last 8 years. [Applause.] And we will move ahead on irrigation, conservation, hydro and power resources, to secure fresh water from salt water and an end to polluted rivers. As I live on the most polluted river in the United States, the Potomac River, unfortunately, it reminds me of it every day. I think we can do better by what the Lord has given us in this part of the United States. [Applause.]', 'Senator MOSS. We have another question.', 'QUESTION. My name is R. D. Peters. A writer in the forum in the local newspaper calls you a captive of Mr. Hoffa and Mr. Bridges. He also mentions Mr. Reuther, but he did not mention Mr. Hutcheson of the carpenters. Would you care to set the audience and everybody straight on that?', ""Senator KENNEDY. It is a great pleasure. The New York Times this morning announced that Mr. Hoffa is beginning a tour of the United States that will take him to the major cities by October 3 in order to inform the members of his union of how disastrous it would be to elect me President of the United States. In a story on page 12, I think, of the New York Times this morning, they quote a Teamsters official as saying it is either the Teamsters leadership or Kennedy and it can't be Kennedy and I assure him he is perfectly right. [Applause.] In my judgment, an effective Attorney General with the present laws that we now have on the books can remove Mr. Hoffa from office. [Applause.] And I can assure you that both my brother and myself share a very deep conviction on the subject of Mr. Hoffa. I share the same view on the subject of Mr. Bridges. It is an interesting fact that neither the Teamsters Union nor the Longshoremen's Union dominated by Mr. Bridges is supporting me in this campaign and that both unions are opposing me, both unions. Mr. Bridges, particularly, his union, in the island of Hawaii, as the paper said today, was opposing me. And Mr. Hoffa's views are well known. So I think we can have a very clear choice on this matter."", ""Now, in regard to Mr. Reuther and in regard to others, I consider Mr. Reuther an honest union leader. I have no quarrel with his efforts to secure better economic rights for his union, and I don't quarrel with any honest businessman or union man who is responsible to his members who practices democratic procedures (applause) because I believe in the union movement. I have served on the Labor Committees of the Congress for 14 years. I want to get the crooks out and I want to get the Communists out of it, like Mr. Bridges, some of the group that he surrounded himself with. But I do believe that honest unions are a great source of strength for the United States, and I want to make it very clear that I support them. [Applause.]"", 'Senator MOSS. We have time for one more question. The Senator still has a schedule to keep and be in the air on his way to Chicago. We will have one more question. Will you state your name, please?', 'QUESTION. My name is Raymond Alexander, and my question is: If you are elected President, Senator Kennedy, what would you do to stop the advance of world communism?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Obviously that is the key, how can we stop the advance of world communism, how can we maintain the peace, how can we maintain our security, how can we live on the same globe as the Communists, both of us having a hydrogen capacity, and survive?', 'I would say that is the great problem that is going to be before the next President of the United States. In addition, the problem before him is how a free society can successfully compete with a totalitarian society.', 'Briefly, I would suggest the next President of the United States should consider doing the following things, maybe not in the order of their importance, but all of them should be done soon.', 'In the first place, I would request the Congress to appropriate additional funds, particularly for strengthening our conventional forces, for speeding up the Minuteman and several other of our missile programs in order that we may not move through a missile gap period in the years 1961,1962, and 1963. [Applause.]', 'I think it is possible, by a reunification, by a more effective unification of our Armed Forces. And Senator Symington, of Missouri, has been appointed chairman of a committee which is making a study now of the Pentagon, to see if we can provide a more effective organization within the Pentagon, more effective purchasing programs and all the rest. It may be possible for us to save some money. I hope it is. But I would strengthen the Armed Forces of the United States. We deal not only with the Soviet Union, but we deal with the Chinese Communists, and the whole debate is whether the Chinese Communists will be successful in their viewpoint which is that Communist conquest of the world can only come by war. We have to look forward to the day when the Chinese Communists will have a missile capacity and a hydrogen capacity dedicated to the proposition that war is the solution and that they could survive it and we could not. So I think we better make a better effort there.', 'Secondly, I think we are to parley. If we are strong, if we maintain our defenses, if we are second to none, we are in a better position to negotiate. Winston Churchill said 11 years ago, ""You cannot negotiate successfully with the Communists unless you do so from a position of equality."" One of the reasons we have been unable to secure an effective disarmament policy in outer space was because the Soviet Union was ahead of us and they said they would not agree to any disarmament of outer space unless we also abandoned our bases overseas, because they said they would be giving up their lead. In other words, maintaining a position of equality permits you to negotiate more successfully. It is a source of concern to me that this Government has had less than 100 people scattered through the entire Federal Government working on the subject of disarmament. I would put more people into it. I would indicate our desire not only to maintain our strength, but also to provide for orderly disarmament.', 'Thirdly, I would hope that the United States could make for effective judgments of the events that are going to occur. I mentioned our aid to Latin America being a result of our difficulties with Castro. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa. We talk now of what we are going to do about Africa but the problems have been there for many years. I said earlier at dinner tonight that the United States offered 300 scholarships to the Congo. They never talked about the Congo before June. There are only 12 or 15 college people in all of the Congo. Is it any wonder that they have difficulty running a free society? Did we ever concern ourselves with the educational need of Africa in the last 10 years? We give less than 200 scholarships for all of Africa, by the Federal Government, to study here in the United States, and yet the need for Africa is not only economic development funds, but to educate its men and women if they are going to maintain their societies.', 'So I would have thought it would have been possible for us to make some judgments some years ago. [Applause.]', 'Third, I would say also that the United States is going to face a severer crisis and a serious problem for us in the case of India in the winter of 1961. The Indian 5-year plan is coming forward. I think India represents the best chance we have in the underdeveloped world. Thirty-five percent of the people of the underdeveloped world live in India. It has a distinguished head of government. It has an excellent civil service. It has good economic planning and staggering problems. If India fails to solve her economic problems, if her economic growth increases marginally year by year and the Chinese Communists starting at the same level as the Indians did in 1950 move ahead 10, 12 percent in their economic growth, then of course the battle for supremacy in Asia will have been lost.', 'I think long-term loans of the kind that made the United States so rich - we built the economy of the West, the railroads and all the West, mostly on the funds that were loans to us for private purposes from Europe at the beginning of this century. I think that the United States, from the point of view of public loans and I have supported the strengthening of the development loan funds, should provide assistance with other rich Western European countries, particularly the Germans and I hope the Japanese, who will join with us in assisting India to make an economic breakthrough. [Applause.]', 'There are many other areas, but just let me say that I have had a strong conviction for many years, and I spoke of the matter in the case of Indochina and later in Algeria, that the greatest asset we have is the desire of all these people to be free and independent. Therefore, if the United States would associate itself with that drive, if the United States would be known as we used to be known, as the friend of freedom, not only for ourselves, but also for people all around the world - and one of our difficulties has been that we have talked about the enslavement of Eastern Europe and never said a word about Africa for the last 10 years - unless we stand for the principle as it affects our friends as well as our enemies, then we really lose our moral standing and we lose identification with what is the most powerful force in the world today, and the force that represents the greatest source of strength for us.', 'We want to be independent. We want others to be independent, and they want to be independent. Therefore, I have felt that the United States for some years should speak strongly for independence for all people, Eastern Europe and Africa and Latin America, antidictators, whether it is Castro or some other dictator who may be friendly to us, because these people are going to be independent, and when they finally are, I want them to say, ""The United States are our friends. They believe what we believe, that the Communists are our enemies."" [Applause.]', 'May I say in closing that you have been extremely generous tonight and I am most honored to have had a chance to come tonight. I am grateful for the courtesy and attention which you have given. Running for the Presidency is a very sobering responsibility. President Moyle said today, ""You are not as gay as you used to be."" [Laughter.] Well, I think it is a very difficult and somber time. In many ways, this election is more important than the election of 1932, because in 1932, what was at stake was the preservation of freedom in the United States, and now what is at stake is the preservation of freedom around the world. [Applause.]', 'I really believe that the United States is the great hope for freedom. If we meet our responsibilities, if we meet our obligations, if we maintain our strength, if we build our educational systems, if our economic growth is increasing each year, if we develop our resources, if we build a strong and vital society here in the United States, then I think we can lead the free world. So I come here tonight as a candidate for the oldest party in the world that is successfully operating today, the Democratic Party, and I come with some pride in a party which has produced at critical times men like Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman. [Applause.] I hope that the Democratic Party - I hope that our party can play a useful role today. I hope this election will not sink to be a name-calling contest between my opponent and myself. I hope we serve a great national purpose of presenting to the American people alternative courses of action, and I think if we do that, and that requires the effort of all of us - not merely the candidate on one level or another, but all of us - I think the Democratic Party can serve once again.', 'I will close by reminding you of the election of 1860, when, as Lincoln said, the question was whether the Nation would exist half slave and half free. Now the question is whether the world will exist half slave and half free. And in that campaign of 1860, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Standing applause.]']"
157,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","[""Almost 6,000 miles from Cheyenne - the heart of America's Great Plain - lies another vast and fertile land: the great plains of central Africa."", 'The plains of central Africa seem far removed from the daily life - the difficulties, and accomplishments of Wyoming. But what you do here - how you meet your problems - the effectiveness with which you use your soil and water, can help spell the difference between progress and poverty, freedom against slavery for the people of central Africa.', 'For in the plains of Africa, and the pampas of South America, and the farmlands of Asia, millions of people are struggling to emerge from the poverty and hunger which their land has always known. They are aware that, for the first time, modern technology offers hope that all men may be free from want - and they are determined to have the fruits of that technology for themselves.', 'In this great effort the emerging peoples of the world are looking for leadership. Perhaps the most important single issue of our time is whether they will look to Moscow or to the United States - whether they will choose freedom or whether they will feel that submission to communism is the price of progress.', ""If we are to insure a continued spread of freedom around the world - if we are to halt the advance of communism - we must demonstrate what our own history proves - that the road to progress is freedom's road. But we cannot demonstrate this simply with speeches or with propaganda or by pointing to past achievements only. It is only by moving ahead at home - by expanding our economy and our resources - by pushing forward to new heights of abundance and productivity - that we can demonstrate capacity and vitality in a free society."", 'And we must begin that demonstration here in the Great Plains.', 'The Great Plains cover one-fifth of the land area of the United States. They are rich in resources: in land, in minerals, and in water. Yet our failure to develop these water and mineral resources - to adequately plan against flood and drought - has often brought economic distress and has kept you from realizing full abundance of which our land is capable.', 'As a result of these failures thousands of potentially productive acres are unreclaimed - the Colorado River storage project has been neglected - your mines are suffering from declining markets - your water problem grows more acute every day - and your unparalleled recreational facilities are not fully developed.', 'The Democratic Party - in its platform and in its record - has provided the resource and mineral programs which are necessary for development of the Great Plains. And in 1961 - under a Democratic President we will put these programs into action.', 'But the Great Plains need more than a series of piecemeal programs and policies - important though those programs may be. We need an entire new concept of resource development which will treat the entire Great Plains area as a single unit - which will develop each of your resources in terms of its significance of the economy of the entire region, and which will select policies designed to promote the growth of that economy.', 'The next President must appoint a Development Planning Committee for the Great Plains - a high executive body which will formulate overall plans for resource development and oversee the operations of specific resources and mineral program in order to insure maximum benefit for your region. With this new concept of regional development we can bring increased prosperity to the Great Plains, and provide a model of progress under freedom for all the world.']"
158,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Senator McGee, your distinguished Governor, Governor Hickey, Secretary of State Jack Gage, your State chairman, Teno Roncalio, your national committeeman, Tracy McCracken and Mrs. McCracken, your next U.S. Senator, Ray Whitaker, your next U.S. Congressman, Hep Armstrong, ladies and gentlemen; I first of all want to express on behalf of my sister and myself my great gratitude to all of you for being kind enough to have this breakfast and make it almost lunch. [Laughter.] I understand from Tracy that some of you have driven nearly three or four hundred miles to be here this morning. Yesterday morning we were in Iowa, and since that time we have been in five States: South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, and now Wyoming. We have come, therefore, all of us, great distances, and I think we have come great distances since the Democratic convention at Los Angeles. I know that Wyoming is a small State, relatively, but it is a fact that Wyoming, which was not talked about as a key State in the days before the convention, when they were talking about what California and what Pennsylvania and what New York and Illinois would do at the convention, not very many people talked about what Wyoming would do, and yet, as you know, Wyoming did it. [Applause.]', ""So you can expect in other days, other candidates, will all be coming here. I don't know whether it is going to be that close in November. I don't know whether Mr. Nixon and I will be three votes apart, but it is possible we will be. If so, Wyoming having gotten us this far, we would like to have you take us the rest of the way on November 8. [Applause.]"", 'My debt of gratitude, therefore, to everyone in this room, and everyone at the head table, goes very deep. As Gale said, I have been to this State five times. My brother, Teddy, has been here 10 times, and I think that the Kennedys have a high regard and affection for the State of Wyoming. [Applause.]', ""Bobby has been here, I guess, several times. We have been here more than we have been to New York State. I don't know what the significance is, but in any case, I am delighted to be back here this morning. [Applause.] I am delighted to be here because this is an important election, and because Wyoming elects not only a President of the United States this year, but it elects a U.S. Senator and a Congressman. The electoral college and the organization of the States is an interesting business. New York has 15 million people, Wyoming has 300,000 people; you have 1 Congressman, they have many Congressmen - you have more than that? [Laughter.] Odd people? Well, they have a few in New York, I guess. [Laughter.] But in any case, you have two Senators and New York has two Senators. This causes a good deal of heartburn in New York but it should be a source of pride and satisfaction to you that when Wyoming votes, it votes the same number of U.S. Senators as the State of New York, and the State of Massachusetts, and the State of California. All States are equal, and therefore, the responsibility on the people of Wyoming is to make sure that they send Members to the U.S. Senate who speak not only for Wyoming, who serve not only as ambassadors from this State, but also speak for the United States and speak for the public interest, and that, I think, has been the contribution which Senator O'Mahoney has made to the U.S. Senate and Gale McGee now makes. They speak for this State, they speak for its interests, they speak for its development, they speak for its needs, but they also speak for the country. And, therefore, our system works, and Wyoming and the United States flourish together. [Applause.]"", ""I think we have a chance to carry on that tradition. To send as a successor to Senator O'Mahoney, who grew up in Chelsea, Mass., and who saw the wisdom and came West, I think we have a chance to carry on that tradition when you elect Ray Whitaker as U.S. Senator next November 8. [Applause.]"", ""Actually, as you know, the Constitution of the United States confines and limits the power of Senators. We are given the right to approve Presidential nominations, and to ratify treaties. But the House of Representatives is given the two great powers which are the hallmark of a self-governing society: One, the power to appropriate money, and the second is the power to levy taxes. If you don't like the way your taxes are, if you don't like the way your money is being spent, write to the House of Representatives, not to the U.S. Senate, because our powers and responsibilities are somewhat different. Therefore in sending a man to fulfill these two functions, we want a man of responsibility and competence and energy. I therefore am sure that the people of this State will send to the House of Representatives to share in the great constitutional powers given to that body, Hep Armstrong, with whom I served in the Navy and hope to serve in the Government of the United States next November. [Applause.]"", ""During this campaign, there are many efforts made to divide domestic and foreign problems and I don't hold that view. I think there is a great interrelationship between the problems which face us here in the United States and the problems which face us around the world. I think if the United States is moving ahead here at home, the U.S. power and prestige in the world will be strong. If we are standing still here at home, then we stand still around the world. I think in other words, as Gale McGee suggested, that the 14 points of Woodrow Wilson were the logical extension of the New Freedom here in the United States. [Applause.] And the good neighbor policy of Franklin Roosevelt had its counterpart in his domestic policy of the New Deal. And the Marshall plan and NATO and the Truman Doctrine carried out in foreign policy under the administration of Harry Truman and point 4, all had their logical extension in the domestic policy of President Truman here in the United States. I say that because I think that there is a direct relationship between the efforts that we make here in the sixties, here in the West, here in the State of Wyoming, here in the United States, and what we do around the world."", 'Two days ago I spent the day in Tennessee. I think that there is a direct relationship between what was done in the Tennessee Valley by Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Party in the thirties, and what other countries in Africa and the Middle East and Asia are attempting to do to develop their own natural resources. I stand and you stand today in the middle of the Great Plains of the United States. There are great plains in Africa, and in my judgment Africa will be one of the keys to the future. The people of Africa want to develop their resources. They want to develop their resources of the great plains of Africa, and they look to see what we do here to develop the resources of the Great Plains of the United States.', ""I don't think that there can be any greater disservice to the cause of the United States and the cause of freedom than for any political party at this watershed of history to put forward a policy for developing the resources of the United States of no new starts. I don't say that we can do everything in the sixties, but I say we can move and start and go ahead, and I think it is that spirit which separates our two parties. [Applause.]"", 'I come from Massachusetts, but it is a source of satisfaction and pride that the two Americans who did more to develop the resources of the West both came from New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt, and they did it because they saw it not as a State problem, not as a regional problem, but as a national opportunity, and it is in that spirit that I look to the future of the Great Plains of the United States in the sixties.', 'We are going to have over 300 million people living in this country in the year 2000. Many of them will live in this State. We are going to have to make sure that we pass on to our children a country which is using natural resources given to us by the Lord to the maximum; that every drop of water that flows to the ocean first serves a useful and beneficial purpose; that the resources of the land are used, whether it is agriculture or whether it is oil or minerals; that we move ahead here in the West and move ahead here in the United States. I think that there is a direct relationship between the policy of no new starts in developing our water and power resources, and irrigation and reclamation and conservation, and the fact that our agricultural income has dropped so sharply in the United States in recent years, and the fact that we are using our steel capacity 50 percent of capacity. Pittsburgh, Wyoming, Montana, Wisconsin are allied together. A rising tide lifts all the boats. If we are moving ahead here in the West, if we are moving ahead in agriculture, if we are moving ahead in industry, if we have an administration that looks ahead, then the country prospers. But if one section of the country is strangled, if one section of the country is standing still, then sooner or later a dropping tide drops all the boats, whether the boats are in Boston or whether they are in this community.', 'I can assure you that if we are successful that we plan to move ahead as a national administration, with the support of the Congress, in using and developing the resources which our country has. This is a struggle, not only for a better standard of living for our people, but it is also a showcase. As Edmund Burke said about England in his day, ""We sit on a conspicuous stage,"" what we do here, what we fail to do, affects the cause of freedom around the world. Therefore, I can think of no more sober obligation on the next administration and the next President and the next Congress than to move ahead in this country, develop our resources, prevent the blight which is going to stain the development of the West unless we make sure that everything that we have here is used usefully for our people.', ""The Tennessee Valley in Tennessee, the Northwest power development, the resources of Wyoming, all harnessed together, the Missouri River, the Columbia River, the Mississippi River, the Tennessee River - all of them harnessed together serve as a great network of strength, a stream of strength in this country which is going to be tested to its utmost. So I come here today not saying that the future is easy, but saying that the future can be bright. I don't take the view that everything that is being done is being done to the maximum. I think the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats in 1960 is that we both think it is a great country, but we think it must be greater. We both think it is a powerful country, but we think it must be more powerful. We both think it stands as the sentinel at the gate for freedom, but we think we can do a better job. I think that has been true of our party ever since the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, and I think we can do a job in the sixties [Applause.]"", 'I have asked Senator Magnuson, who is the chairman of our Resources Advisory Committee, to hold a conference on resources and mineral use here in the city of Casper in the State of Wyoming during the coming weeks, because I think we should identify ourselves in the coming weeks with the kind of programs we are going to carry out in January. If there is any lesson which history has taught of the administrations of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, it is the essentiality of previous planning for successful action by a new administration. Unless we decide now what we are going to do in January, February, March and April, if we should be successful, we will fail to use the golden time which the next administration will have. I come here today speaking not for Wyoming or Massachusetts, but speaking for a national party which believes in the future of our country, which will devote its energies to building its strength, and by building our strength here we build the cause of freedom around the world. Thank you. [Applause and standing ovation.]']"
159,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, Senator Carroll, distinguished Governor of this State, Governor McNichols, your Congressmen Byron Rogers and Byron Johnson, your next U.S. Senator from the State of Colorado, Bob Knous, your next Congressman from this State, Frank Stewart, ladies and gentlemen, I bring my case for a stronger America to Colorado, and I will not be deterred in any degree from feeling that it is important for us during these coming 6 weeks, when the American people will make their judgment as to what kind of leadership they want. I seek a stronger America and I will not be deterred by Mr. Morton or anyone else. [Applause.]', 'Not anything we say or anything we preach will bring comfort to Mr. Khrushchev. We seek a strong America, we seek a stronger society. We believe we can do more. The Republicans believe what we are doing today is enough. That is the basic disagreement, and that is the issue before the American people. I hope that everyone in this country who thinks that this great country is doing everything it can, who is satisfied with our position in the world, who is satisfied that the United States, which 25 years ago was a good neighbor to Latin America, now sees its name reviled in the streets of Havana - I want Americans who used to look at Africa and see them quoting Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt, and now they look to the East instead of the West - I want them to vote for the Republicans. But anyone who thinks we can do better, anyone who thinks this is a great country that can be better, that must be greater, anyone who thinks this is a powerful country that must be more powerful, anyone who thinks we can do better than we are doing, I want their help. [Applause.]', 'I have premised my campaign for the Presidency on the single assumption that the American people are uneasy at the present drift in our national course, that they are disturbed by the relative decline in our vitality and prestige, and that they have the will and the strength to start the United States moving again. If I am wrong in this assumption, and if the American people are satisfied with things as they are, if Americans are undisturbed by approaching dangers, and complacent about our capacity to meet them, then I expect to lose this election. But if I am right, and I firmly believe I am right, then those who have held back the growth of the United States during the last 8 years will be rejected in November, and America will turn to the leadership of the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', ""There are those who say it is wrong to call attention to America's need for greater strength at a time when our freedom is being challenged by a ruthless enemy. But it is precisely because we are in danger that we have an obligation to state our needs. It is not dangerous to reveal what we should do in the future. We do not give comfort to Mr. Khrushchev. What we hope to do is to build a stronger defense, to build a more vital economy, to restore the prestige of the United States, to hold out the hand of the good neighbor to Latin America, to once more reassert America's traditional interest in freedom in Africa, to help those who desire to be independent, to lead and not to follow, to move and not to stand still - that is our program for the United States in the sixties. [Applause.]"", 'There are those who say that this kind of talk creates disunity in the eyes of the world\'s leaders who are gathered in New York. But it was a great American and a great Senator who once said, ""If you permit appeals to unity to bring an end to criticism, we endanger not only the constitutional liberties of our country, but even its future existence."" Those words were spoken in 1951 by Senator Robert A. Taft, and I commend them to his successors. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Khrushchev and his friends are not impressed by calls for unity. They are not impressed by debates or insults or even resolutions. But they will be impressed if they see an America desiring to be strong again, if they see an America that makes its decisions this fall that we want to move again. They will be impressed if they see us on the march. They will be impressed by an America rebuilding its economy, rebuilding its defenses, and rebuilding the strength of the free world.', 'Personal attacks and insults will not be enough to win the cold war, and they will not be enough to win this election.', 'Finally, there are those who say that a call for greater effort and greater strength is to sell America short. But I do not equate criticism of Republican leadership with criticism of our country. [Applause.] On the contrary, it is because I have unlimited faith in our country after 18 years in service, because I think we can do more and better, that I am calling for greater effort and a greater leadership. It is those who are satisfied with things as they are, those who think we have reached our limit, those who are afraid to ask the American people for a greater effort and a greater sacrifice and a greater national contribution who are, in reality, selling America short. It is they who have lost their faith in America and in the American capacity to do great things. [Applause.] That is why no attacks, no attempts to discredit us will keep us from continuing to speak for a stronger America. It is not naive to call for increased strength. It is naive to think that freedom can prevail without strength. [Applause.]', 'The American people will hear our program for a greater America, for a greater national effort for our prestige, in our defenses, in our economy, in our education, and in our efforts of peace, and they could listen to those who say that all is well, that we are strong enough, and then the American people can decide who is naive.', 'I come today from Massachusetts, across the United States, but I speak today for a great national party which has made, under your Governor and under your distinguished Senator, a distinguished contribution to the economy of Colorado and also to the Nation, and we have an opportunity to elect another great Senator to join with John Carroll in speaking for Colorado and our country. I ask your support in this election. [Applause.]', 'My opponent in this campaign once said that, ""I am a conservative at home and a risk-taker abroad."" I am neither. I am not a risk-taker abroad, and I am not a conservative at home, if by conservative you mean no new starts, if you mean standing still when we should move, if you mean that this country which is the hope of freedom is not able to develop its natural resources. It is a source of pride and satisfaction to me that the two Americans in this century who did more to develop the resources of the West both came from New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] And they saw in the West not the assets of a State or a group of States or a region - they saw a great national asset. These assets belong to the people and not merely to us. They belong to those who come after us. We do not have the right to exploit the natural resources of this country unless we make provision for the 300 million people who are going to live in the United States by the year 2000. Every time a drop of water flows to the ocean without being beneficially used by our people, every time polluted water is thrown into the sea without being cleaned, every time we waste our chance to build a greater strength here in this country, in the West, in the East, in the North, and in the South, we sell, in a sense, our freedom short.', ""I think the best arguments we can make for freedom is a strong and vital country here. I spent 2 days ago in the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley not only rebuilt the economy of that section of the United States. It was an advertisement of what a free people, joining together, can do for themselves, and it has served as an inspiration to people all around the world, in Pakistan and India, eastern Persia, Colombia, and nearly 18 other countries who build their TVA's. What you do here to harness the resources of the western United States will serve as an inspiration to young leaders in Africa and Latin America and Asia, who wish to solve their great problems, and wonder whether it is necessary to turn to the East, to the Communists, to mobilize their resources. We want to show we can do it here. We want to show that we are able to solve our problems. We want to develop our resources. We want to move our economy ahead. We want to use our farm product with the hand of friendship around the world."", 'I represent today, and Lyndon Johnson running for the Vice Presidency, the oldest political party in the world. But I represent in many ways, I think, in 1960, the youngest party. [Applause.] I think you can get a clear contrast between our two parties in the slogans the Presidents have run on in the 20th century. No Democrat ever ran on ""Stand pat with McKinley,"" or ""Keep cool with Coolidge,"" or ""Return to normalcy with Harding,"" or ""No new starts in 1960,"" or ""You never had it so good."" [Applause.] Our Presidents have run on the rights of man, with Thomas Jefferson, the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson, the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, the Fair Deal of Harry Truman, and now we seek a new frontier, not only for the United States, but for all those who wish to follow us on the road to freedom. What we do here is what counts.', 'During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960 and in the next decade, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we do well here [applause] - if we do well here, if we are a strong and vital country, if we maintain our defenses, if we lead once again, all those who desire to be free, and they are the great majority of the world\'s population, then I think we can reestablish our position and we can serve freedom, which is our traditional vocation and which we must reassert again.', 'During the election of 100 years ago, Abraham Lincoln put the issue whether this country can exist half slave and half free. Now the question is can the world exist half slave and half free. I think it depends upon us. I am reminded of a letter that Lincoln wrote during the election of 1860 to a friend: ""I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
160,John F. Kennedy ,"September 23, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague in the Senate, Ted Moss, Congressman King, Senator McGee of Wyoming, your next Governor of Utah, Governor-to-be Barlocker [applause], your next Congressman-to-be Blaine Peterson [applause], Mrs. Price, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your kindness and generosity to the Democratic Party and its candidates. I am deeply touched - not as deeply touched as you have been by coming to this dinner, but nevertheless it is a sentimental occasion. [Laughter.]', 'I wish there were some other way to have a party run, but there is no substitute than to call on our friends. I was in New York last week. We were trying to raise some support for the party and President Truman told me that in 1948 his train was pulled off the tracks three times because they could not get up the carfare to keep it moving. [Laughter.] But they got it up finally and they won.', ""I think we are going to win and we are grateful to you for your help. [Applause.] In the last 2 days, we have traveled from Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and tonight Utah, and we leave later tonight for Chicago. I don't think we have increased the wisdom, probably, of any of the audiences that have listened, but, nevertheless, I do feel that here in the Western United States there is a great recognition of what we are talking about, and that is our great interest in seeing these States and our country strong. We have engaged in some debate in recent weeks. We have been criticized because the argument has been made that we are downgrading the United States. We don't downgrade the United States. We have faith in the United States. We feel it can do better and we feel it must do better if it is going to maintain its own freedom and the freedom of those who look to us for leadership."", 'I think this is an important election. In a sense, of course, every election is important. But I do think the election of 1960 is particularly important, because what we are and what we do, and the kind of leadership which we give, can make a decisive difference not only to our own security, but to those who look to us for friendship and help. We have serious problems that are facing us in the sixties in the United States, but far more serious problems facing us around the world. My chief disagreement with the Republicans in the field of foreign policy has been that they have not been able to pierce the veil of the future, to make a judgment as to what problems are coming, and then to offer solutions.', 'I was impressed and admired the speech that the President of the United States made at the United Nations, and I have been impressed by the effort that has been made in recent months to provide a more effective policy toward Latin America. But in the case of both Africa and Latin America, the hour is late, the world is moving fast, our role and our position have changed, and I do think it is vitally important in those areas and in other areas that we precede events; that we do not move after them. In other words, I do not like to see the United States offer assistance to Latin America as a result of difficulties in Cuba. I would like to see us offer the hand of friendship to Latin America because of a traditional conviction that the United States cannot maintain its freedom unless Latin America is a strong and viable and growing hemisphere. [Applause.]', ""The same is true of Africa. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee. We have given comparatively few scholarships to students who come over from Africa each year, less than 200 for the whole continent. If there is any great need, far exceeding any great shortage, it is in educated men and women who can maintain a free society. You are familiar with what has happened in the Congo. But what is happening in the Congo is happening in every country in Africa. Called on to maintain their freedom, there are eight new countries in Africa in the last 2 months. The United States does not have yet an ambassador in any of them. Four of them are represented by one man, a chargé d'affaires who is a former consul. Four of them have no representatives of the United States, even though they have been independent for the last 2 months."", ""The world is moving and changing and I do not think we have demonstrated an ability to keep up with it. Two hundred scholarships for all of Africa, and yet when the crisis began in Africa as a result of the Belgians leaving, we suddenly offered 300 scholarships to the Congo alone. Couldn't it have been possible for us to make a determination that freedom was moving through Africa as it is through the rest of the world, that self-government was going to eventually come, and that the United States should hold out the hand of friendship to these people so that they could be prepared to maintain their freedom? What is true of Africa, Latin America, and Asia, I think has been true of the conduct of our foreign policy in the last 8 years. I think there is a basic difference between us. It is that the domestic policies which great Democratic Presidents have offered in this century have had their logical application in successful foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson's new freedom had its logical application in the 14 points. Franklin Roosevelt's good neighbor policy was the foreign partner of his domestic policy, the New Deal, and Harry Truman's Fair Deal had its application in foreign policy in point 4 and the Marshall plan and NATO and the Truman doctrine. If a country is moving ahead here at home, if it is solving its own problems, if it has been able to attract people of imagination and vigor to the Government, then I think its foreign policy is also on the move, because the same problems that face us here at home face us in different forms abroad. The ability to predict with some degree of certainty the problems that are just over the horizon, that will be upon us 6 months from now or a year from now. I think through its history, though there have been exceptions through its history, this is a contribution which the Democratic Party has made, from the time of Jefferson, through Jackson's administration, through that of Grover Cleveland, through Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Adlai Stevenson's candidacy, I think the Democrats have looked to the future. They have spoken not for private interests but for the general good."", 'I think we are called on, I hope, for further service in the coming days. This is not just a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is a contest between two parties. It is a contest between your U.S. Senator, Ted Moss, and Senators who do not share his progressive views. It is a contest between the Members of the House, Dave King and the things he stands for, and the things which the Republican Party has stood for. It is a contest between our intellectual vitality and curiosity and a point of view which I think has dominated the thinking of this administration for too many years in both domestic and foreign policy. We think the best of this country and we want to do the best for it. We talk about a lack of leadership only because we know that this country has unbounded energy and a desire to be of service.', ""So I come tonight as the candidate for the Democratic Party, asking your help in this State, in this campaign. Ted Moss and Dave King has shown what can be done. The primary in this State was most encouraging. I don't give any stakes to Mr. Nixon in this campaign. They are all going to be fought over, and I think that Utah, which played a great role in the convention last July, which was most helpful and generous to me in nominating me, I think that this contest may be close enough so as goes Utah, so goes the Nation, and if that is so we want to have it go in the right direction. Thank you. [Applause.]"", 'I suppose campaigns are really like parades; the music and a lot of confetti and dust and then the candidates pass and move on to another State. We are leaving you here, so the contest is really in your hands in this State. Six weeks to go. I hope that it is possible for us to try to communicate our desire to serve, our strong faith in this country, our feeling on domestic policy and foreign policy; we can do better, our feeling that the greatest days of this country are still ahead, and that though we move through a difficult future, we are identified with the best of causes.', 'My optimism for the future for the country and for the United States and the cause of freedom really goes to our experiences of the last few years in Eastern Europe, in Asia, and Africa. If there is any lesson which the last 10 years has shown to me, and it is a lesson that I have been particularly interested in in Algeria and Indochina, it is that the strongest force in the world today is the desire to be independent. This is going to cause us all kinds of trouble in the next 10 years. People who used to support us will be neutral. But in the final analysis it is our greatest source of strength. We desire to be independent; so do they. They desire to be independent of us. They desire to be independent of Western Europe, but they also desire to be independent of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists. We do not desire to dominate them. They do.', 'Therefore, if we can associate ourselves with this great tide, and it has been a source of regret to me since the end of World War II that we have not associated ourselves with it, then I think we can move with history and we can help form it and help shape it, and by the year 2000 the tide will have turned against the communists and in the direction of freedom. We, in other words, fit in with the basic movement of our time. The Communists do not. Therefore, while there are a great many clouds on the horizon, and there are a great many uncertainties about Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and Eastern Europe, I think that we represent the way to the future. If we associate with it, if we are identified with it - and that is why I was particularly pleased with what the President said yesterday - if we associate with it, if we become part of it, then our security is assured and our leadership is assured. And I think that is a contribution which the Democratic Party can make in the field of foreign policy and the security of the United States. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
161,John F. Kennedy ,"September 25, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ray Miller, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third year in a row that I have been honored by being invited to this steer roast, and I hope that it is going to be possible for me to come back next year in a somewhat different capacity. [Applause.]', 'I want to say just one point about Ohio. In the 1948 election, you will recall, President Truman carried the State of Ohio by 7,200 votes. He carried Illinois by 17,000 votes, and it was the victory in this State and in Illinois which permitted him to maintain his Office of the Presidency. I think the Presidency is a great Office. It is enshrined in the Constitution, and it is also by the force of events and by the pressure of circumstances that it has come to have the greatest possible influence over the lives of us all. Therefore, as I believe that there are sharp differences between the two candidates and great issues which divide historically the two political parties, I do hope it is possible for all of you in the next 6 weeks to give us all the help that you can. My judgment is that the winner of this presidential election will carry Ohio, and I think it is possible for us to carry Ohio. [Applause.]', 'It is possible for us to win Ohio and it is possible for us to lose Ohio. My judgment is that it is a very close, tight race in this State, in Illinois, in Pennsylvania, in New Jersey, and New York. These are the key States. Whoever carries these major industrial States from Illinois east quite obviously will be elected the next President of the United States.', 'Ohio is very important. That and Michigan and these other States must be carried by the Democratic candidate, and the Democratic Party. So I come here today asking all of you who work in the field for the party in this county, for many years, and in the State, I come here asking your help. This election will be close, and the extra effort that you can put in this in the coming 6 weeks, in the next 3 days to get people registered, to make sure that when they are registered they come to vote, to make sure that this is not merely a contest between two names, but it is a contest between two parties and two individuals, one of whom says ""Yes"" to the next 10 years and the other says ""No."" I say yes, and I think the country says yes. [Applause.]', 'In short, I thank you for your past help to the party, but I must say I think in 1960 the tide can rise and we can carry Ohio. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
162,John F. Kennedy ,"September 25, 1960","['* * * Franklin Roosevelt appealed to the Nation in 1932 to remember the ""forgotten man."" The forgotten man of 1960 is the American consumer.', 'The forgotten woman is the American housewife.', 'In 1952 they were promised lower prices. They heard endless Republican commercials about a stable dollar and a cheaper market basket. But under 8 years of Republican rule, the cost of living has gone up and up - and the Republicans have done nothing about it.', 'What are most families to do? They are concerned about the growing missile gap - but they are equally concerned about the growing gap between what they earn and what they have to spend.', 'For example: The cost of medical care, drugs, and hospital bills have become too high for their aged parents to pay. As devoted sons and daughters, they can hardly ask their parents to take a ""pauper\'s oath,"" but they can also hardly afford to pay these bills. The Republicans have refused to pass a decent bill to help ease that burden. A Democratic administration must act in 1961.', 'The interest costs on a $10,000 30-year mortgage have increased $3,300 since 1952. The Republicans refused to ease their tight-money policies for the homeowner. They refused to pass legislation to encourage new housing. They refused to recognize that rents had gone up 20 percent - so that too many families were paying out too much in renting a home to put aside enough to buy a home. A new Democratic administration must act in 1961.', 'Most families dream of sending their son and daughter to college. But the colleges have also been hit by increased costs and growing demand. They have been forced to raise their tuition and fees - the cost of a college education to the family is now $1,300 higher than it was in 1952. The Republicans have refused to act on college scholarships, on college dormitories, on college classrooms. But a Democratic administration will act in 1961.', 'When the homeowner starts adding up his bills, he finds the cost of his utilities has skyrocketed since 1952. Yet, under Republican rule there have been no new starts on public power projects designed - either directly or through competition - to bring down the cost of electricity, as Franklin Roosevelt did with TVA and REA and all the rest. There have been no regulatory agencies fighting for the interests of consumers instead of private interests. But a Democratic administration will act in 1961.', 'The housewife this fall ought to remember the Republican promises of 1952 every time she goes to the supermarket. The Republicans said then that they would help both the farmers and the consumers, and bring food prices down in the process. But, instead, farm income has dropped far below its 1952 level, while food prices have gone far higher. when the housewife wants to buy her family a washer or a TV set or even a car, she finds the interest rates so much higher than 1952 that her budget simply cannot handle them. She wants a Democratic administration to act in 1961.', ""In short, the high cost of living hurts almost every American. But its hurts most of all those whom the Republican brand of prosperity has left far behind - the 4 million unemployed, whose jobless insurance check is too low to meet these costs - the 3 million put on a short work week because our growth has slowed down and our major industries (such as steel and coal and textiles and autos) are below capacity - the millions earning the bare minimum wage, $1 an hour, $40 a week - which cannot possibly be enough at today's prices - the millions on an inadequate social security check - the schoolteachers in need of Federal aid - millions of Americans caught in a squeeze of costs rising faster than income - millions of Americans asking for help."", 'Finally, last year, the Republicans decided to do something bold. They appointed a committee to study the problem. They called it the Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth and for chairman they picked the Vice President of the United States. The New York Times called this Mr. Nixon\'s ""first formal major executive role."" They wanted to give him some ""experience"".', ""The Committee met - and talked - and studied - and, as a result, they acted. They didn't bring prices down. They didn't send our growth rate up.

We hear a lot about how well off we are under Republican rule - but the cost of living is never mentioned.', 'But I intend to mention the high cost of living every week of this campaign. The American consumer and the American housewife may have been forgotten by the Republican leaders - but they have not forgotten the promises those same leaders made in 1952.']"

Each year it is bigger, and I want to come back here next year and really fill this whole park. [Applause.]', 'I was most anxious to come on this occasion for two reasons: First, if I had not received the support of the Ohio delegation at the last convention, if I had not received the support of your distinguished Governor, Governor Di Salle, your mayor, the leader of this county, Ray Miller, I would not have been nominated for the office of the President of the United States. [Applause.]', ""And let me say that I think Ohio is key. I think the next President of the United States will carry Ohio and we have to carry it. [Applause.] I don't think that there is anyone in this county or this city or this State who says that this is an unimportant election. You cannot live in Ohio, you cannot live in Cleveland or Youngstown, you cannot see our steel mills working 50 percent, you cannot look at New York City and see the greatest influx of Communist leaders in the history of the world gathered in New York City because they feel that time is moving in their direction. I think this is an important election, and I think the responsibility is very clear upon all of us. What contribution, what work, what service can we make in order to maintain this country's freedom and maintain freedom around the world. That is the issue in this campaign, and I hope that anyone in this country who looks at the world and looks at the United States, who looks at the unfinished business of our country, who looks at our agenda, who looks at our production, who looks at the people out of work, who looks at our educational system, who looks at our care for our mentally retarded, who looks at the care for our older citizens, who looks at our failure to provide equality of rights for all Americans, regardless of their race or their religion - I hope that anyone who looks at the world around us and then comes to the conclusion that they want 4 or 8 more years - I think they ought to vote for Mr. Nixon. If they are satisfied with the things as they are, if they don't think we can do better, if they feel the balance of power in the world is moving in our direction, then I think they should vote for Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.]"", 'But if they think we can do better, if they think this is a great country which must be a greater country, if they think this is a powerful country that must be a more powerful country, if they think we can do better around the world, if they think we can provide greater security for the United States and for those who look to us, if they think the banner of freedom and its light can be held up higher than we are now holding it, I want their help.

I am going to continue to say what I think should be said for the next 6 weeks and then - [applause] - and then the American people can make their final judgment. It is up to you to choose. You can decide what this country wants to be. You can decide what it is going to be. I can campaign and present my views, and what I think the Democrats ought to do, and Mr. Nixon can present his views and can say what the Republicans think the country ought to be, but I think in the final analysis you have to decide. If you think we can do more, if you feel there is unfinished business, if you feel that this is one of the great critical areas in the life of our country, comparable in many ways to 1860 and 1912 and 1932, I hope you will vote for us. If you want this country to move again - [Applause.]', ""I don't think the decision is easy and I don't think the judgment which the American people must make in November is a simple one. There are, I think, however, very clear facts, and that is that the Democratic Party during its long life, stretching back over 160 years, I think has served the people. Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman served the people, and in serving the people they served the cause of freedom. I cannot think, stretching back to the end of the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, I cannot think of one single act, major act, on behalf of the people of this country that came out of the Republican Party. [Applause.]"", 'Social security, housing, minimum wage, unemployment compensation, educational assistance, support for our farmers, support for those in trouble, public assistance, public health, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, insurance for your deposits in the bank - all came from our party, and the reason is a simple one - [applause] - and that is by and large across the country the Democrats represent every group in our society. They represent farmers and small businessmen and working men and women. They represent westerners and easterners, they represent southern cotton farmers, they represent the people of the country. They represent the Nation, and because we represent the people, we speak for the people. It was very clearly marked in the last session of the Congress when we brought up the new bill of medical care for the aged tied to social security. We were defeated but 44 Democrats voted aye, and one Republican voted aye, and it was not the Vice President of the United States. [Applause.]', 'One of the great arguments made by the Republicans is that the Vice President is a man of long experience. [Response from the audience.]', 'I don\'t know if it is the kind of experience we want 4 more years of, but at least that is the argument. [Applause.] But the fact of the matter is that in 1958 the President of the United States gave the Vice President his first executive function. They picked him for the position of chairman of a committee on economic growth and anti-inflation. The New York Times called this Mr. Nixon\'s first formal, major executive role. They wanted to give him some experience, and after some months this committee considered and finally brought forth its recommendations. I will read to you the report of the Washington Post on Mr. Nixon\'s first executive position.

I would like it to be said that in our administration, if we are successful, in the next 4 or 8 years, that our country moved here at home, it began to solve the problems that face our people, it put special emphasis on education, because no free society can survive without the best educational system in the world, it took care of our children and gave attention to the medical care for the aged. So that our older citizens could live out their lives in some security.', 'And I would like it said that during these 4 years or 8 years we ended discrimination of all kinds in the United States, we finished it.

We have to find 25,000 jobs a week for the next 10 years if your boys and girls are going to find work in this country.', ""I don't think the Republicans consider these problems.

164,John F. Kennedy ,"September 26, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Hutcheson, Mr. Lee, officers of the Carpenters Union, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate very much your generous invitation to come here today. I have served on the Labor Committees of the House and the Senate for over 14 years. I am now chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate, and I hope in that time I have come to have some idea of the problems that you face, the opportunities that are yours, and the responsibilities that are common to us as citizens of this country. This has been billed tonight as a great debate. But in effect the Carpenters Union today have heard one phase of the so-called great debate. [Laughter and applause.]', 'This morning you heard from the Vice President of the United States, who spoke on behalf of his party and his views, and I speak today as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party. The fact of the matter is that though we may debate tonight, and though we may discuss issues which face the United States in the domestic sphere, we have been debating in a very real sense these issues through all of the 20th century. I think since the beginning of Woodrow Wilson\'s administration, the two parties have taken different positions on the domestic problems that face the United States. I think the Democratic Party has said ""Yes"" to the future. I think the Democratic Party has recognized that there are obligations which the people have to serve the people, that the function of the Government is to serve the public interest, and I think it is for that reason that the Democratic Party nominated Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. I think the Republicans have had a different conception of their public responsibility, and I think it is because of that reason that they nominated McKinley, Taft, Harding, Coolidge, Landon, Dewey, and now we have today. [Applause and laughter.] The Vice President stated the issue as a simple one. He said the question is whether the private sector or the public sector moves ahead. He said the question is whether those of us who come with promises for the future, that we are going to be taking money out of the pockets of people that we promise to help. I don\'t see it that way at all. I don\'t think that there will be many carpenters working in the United States, and I don\'t think that there will be many homes built in the United States if there was not Federal guarantees for the building of those homes. Do you think many GI\'s would have come back at the end of World War II and bought new homes which your people helped to build unless they had been given guarantees of Federal credit? Do you think that there would be enough homes built in the next 15 years, and we are going to have to build more homes every year for the next 25 or 30 years than we have ever built in the past - do you think they could possibly be done without Federal credit, without urban renewal, without home loan guarantees? I don\'t think they could be at all.', 'I think there is a great place and a major place for private responsibility and for individual enterprise. It is the system upon which our country is founded. It provides great prosperity, and it provides great freedom. But there is also a responsibility for the people, working as a whole, if they are going to develop the resources of our country, if they are going to provide employment for our people, if they are going to provide homes for our people, and Federal policy affects that program as sharply as any other factor. Do you think that your people will work as much when interest rates go to the highest they have been in 20 years? Frank Church said at the Democratic Convention that Rip Van Winkle could go to sleep and could wake up and tell whether the Republicans or Democrats were in control of the Government by asking how high the interest rates were. [Laughter and applause.]', 'Now let us get it clear on the record, because there are sharp differences between our two parties. The Democratic Congress passed a housing bill last year which I think would have met the needs of our economy, the needs of our people, and that bill was vetoed. This year, the Democratic Congress in the Senate passed another bill and it went to the Rules Committee of the House, and we could not get a single Republican in the House Rules Committee to vote to send it to the floor. They joined with three Democrats who were opposed to the program and they killed the housing bill this year which our people need and which will cause your people to work.', ""So the record is very clear. I support the affirmative policy which will move this country's economy ahead, which will build homes, which will keep our people working, and provide an unparalleled level of prosperity. If that is the issue, let us join it, because I never voted against any program which I felt would serve the people, which was soundly financed, soundly based, which was within the means of our people to afford, and which would sustain our prosperity. If the housing industry fails to move ahead, we not only find our people badly housed, but we don't find our people working. The automobile industry, the steel industry, and the housing industry are the three industries that must move if the economy of our country is going to move. And I don't think you can possibly feel satisfied when there are 15 million American families living in substandard housing; when there are 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States which lack plumbing of any kind; when at our present rate of constructing homes you are going to have more slums by the year 2000 than you have today: when urban renewal, which is the hope of the older cities of the East from where I come, our only hope of sustaining ourselves, when urban renewal is opposed, and vetoed and blocked, and when interest rates are so high that if a man buys a $20,000 house today, he pays over a 30-year mortgage nearly $8,000 more than he might have paid in 1952. So I would just as soon join the issue, and I would just as soon debate this matter, and I would just as soon have the American people make their decision. I am no Johnny-come-lately to situs picketing, either. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""I don't know what that means [laughter] I will tell you what my position is. I am in favor of amending the Denver Building Trades case, and so introduced a bill, so supported it, so tried to get it out of the subcommittee and did, so tried to get it out of the full committee where it was filibustered to death in the last session of the Congress. So while we may not be Johnny-come-latelies, I would like to know what our individual position is on this question. I want to make it clear what my position is. It is my understanding that when the Taft-Hartley Act was passed, it was very clear by the remarks of Senator Taft, that he did not envision that there would be a prohibition against the union activities at a primary site in order to protect its working standards. It would not be called - when there were subcontractors involved - it would not be called a secondary boycott. That is what I mean by changing the Denver case. And I think that the next Congress of the United States, and whether I sit in the office of the Presidency or whether I continue as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, we are going to move again on that next January, and we invite all those, early or late, to come and join us. [Applause.]"", ""Finally, let me say that I know Mr. Khrushchev, too, but Mr. Khrushchev is not the enemy. Mr. Khrushchev could pass from the scene. He is 65 or 66 years of age, and all men are mortal, and he could pass as Stalin passed, and the enemy would remain the same. The enemy is the Communist system, and the enemy of the Communist system, the chief adversary of the Communist system, is our system. Therefore, the question before us is not the question of comparative growth and statistics, compared to what we did 10 years ago or 15 years ago or 20 years ago. The question for the American people to decide in the sixties is are we doing enough to defend ourselves, are we doing enough to sustain ourselves, are we strengthening ourselves and the cause of freedom around the world? That is the question before us. Not argument with Mr. Khrushchev. The system that is opposing us is strong and powerful, both because of its ideology and because of the productive power of the Soviet Union. We are strong and powerful and I think stronger and more powerful because we believe that freedom, and because of our productive capacity in the United States, and therefore the people of this country have to decide by November 8 which way they want to go; whether they feel that everything that could be done is being done, whether the program offered by the Republican Party offers hope to the people, whether in 1964, at the end of the next President's administration, our power and prestige will be increasing relative to that of the Communists or whether we will be standing still and the world will begin to move in the direction of the East rather than in the direction of the West. That is the issue and it cannot be dismissed, and it cannot be put aside by saying we need an argument in a kitchen or out of a kitchen. What we need is strength. [Applause]"", ""I don't care how skilled Mr. Khrushchev is or how skilled the next President is in debate. What counts is the power of the two systems, and where they are going, and what they stand for, and how they associate themselves with the people of the world. I am confident we have the greatest system. I am confident that what we want they want. I am confident that the future can belong to us. But it can only be done so by recognizing the realities of the struggle that face us, and that can only be done by our willingness to recognize the unfinished business that faces our society, the unfinished agenda which Franklin Roosevelt set before the American people in the thirties, the next President of the United States must set before the American people in the sixties. When he does so, I think this country will move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"

[Applause.]', 'Forty years ago next month we returned to normalcy with Warren G. Harding of the State of Ohio and wages dropped 44 percent 2 years later. Thirty-two years later Herbert Hoover was elected and the next year the stock market dropped out of sight.

[Applause.]', 'The difference between Mr. Nixon and myself is the same difference that has existed for many years between the Republican and the Democratic Parties. I said on Sunday in Cleveland that I could not think of a single idea which the Republican Party had produced that constituted major new legislation on behalf of the people. The Cleveland paper today attempted to correct the record, and they mentioned the child labor work that President Taft had done 50 years ago. [Response from the audience.]', ""They mentioned the antitrust suits that had been brought in at the time of Theodore Roosevelt. I think Theodore Roosevelt was a great Republican President. But I want to know what they have done in the last 4 years that has been of benefit to the people. [Applause.] I don't mean that they have not come up with new legislation. The fact of the matter is that every piece of major legislation which is the hallmark of Franklin Roosevelt's administration from social security to minimum wage, from the Securities and Exchange Act to TVA, every one of those pieces of legislation was opposed - at the time they were written - by the Republican Party. They say our goals are the same. Of course, the goals of all Americans, since the beginning of this country, has been the same: a better life for our people. But it is a question of the means by which we achieve those goals. I am not satisfied, and I don't think it is significant to say our goals are the same. Our goals were the same in the thirties and in the twenties, and before that, and in the fifties. What counts in a country, what counts in a system, what counts in political parties is the means by which you achieve those goals, and I think it is on that basis that the people of this country are going to select the Democratic Party once again. [Applause.]"", 'There is some value in brand names. When you buy something at the store, you buy something you know something about. Mr. Nixon says, ""Don\'t pay any attention to the party labels. Vote for the man."" The party labels tell a story. They tell a story of this country. They tell a story of the division between the Republicans and the Democrats on the great issues of benefit to our people. Whether they are Federal aid to education, whether they are better unemployment compensation, whether they are fiscal and monetary policies which stimulate our economy, whether they are housing legislation or roads or whatever it maybe, I think our record is clear.', 'We have come down on behalf of the people, and I therefore am proud, as the standard bearer for a party which in this century has produced Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman - I am proud to come to this city tonight and ask your support. [Applause.]', 'This contest is between those who say, ""You never had it so good"" and those who say, ""We can do better."" This contest is between those who say that the power and prestige of the United States has never been higher and between those who say we can be better around the world. We can stand as we used to stand, for freedom, for a better life for all people. Franklin Roosevelt did not pour billions of dollars into Latin America and Africa, and yet every young man of those countries who looked for a future for his country looked to Franklin Roosevelt, because they felt he served the people, because the Democratic Party and Roosevelt were identified with the aspirations of people, regardless of their race or their creed or their color. And what we are in this country speaks much louder than what we say we are. If we are building a better society here, if we are meeting the problems here in the United States, if we are moving ahead, if we demonstrate that a free society can be a productive society, then I think we serve ourselves and the cause of freedom, and all those who are attempting to decide which road they will take.', ""I want people to say the way of the future is freedom. I want people to say that we want to travel on freedom's road. The Communist system will be dead, we hope, if we meet our responsibilities by the turn of the century. It does not represent, as we do, a basic aspiration of the human nature. The only thing they have been able to do is by organizing their society by the police power of the state, they have been able to move their society ahead physically. Therefore, we have to do the same; we have to do more. We have to be not only free but strong, and therefore I come to you tonight asking your support, not saying that if I am elected life will be easy, but I can assure you that if I am elected, the light which constitutes this country, the light which stands for freedom, the light which comes when a society moves, I think will burn in the United States again.

166,John F. Kennedy ,"September 27, 1960","['A PROGRAM FOR FULL EMPLOYMENT', 'If we are to put idle men back to work and provide for the employment needs of a growing population - if we are to start America moving toward the new heights of production and strength which will give us full employment - then the Federal Government must provide the framework of government policy on which our free enterprise system can thrive and prosper. For the Federal Government has a responsibility to see that plants and men are not idle, that our country does not waste its resources of human skill.', ""First, we must rededicate ourselves to the goal of full employment written into law by a Democratic administration in 1946. That goal has been forgotten in the past 8 years. Mr. Nixon has said that unemployment is inevitable in a free economy. I don't believe it. I believe that our free enterprise system is strong and productive enough to provide jobs for all who want to work. But full employment will never become a reality unless we pursue that goal with energy and dedication, and with faith in our own capacities."", 'Second, we must liberate the investment funds which are vital to business growth and expansion. In the past 8 years the Republican Party has deliberately pursued a policy of maintaining high interest rates, a policy which dries up the supply of money and makes it more difficult for new business to survive and for existing business to expand. As a result we now have the highest rate of business failure since the great depression. By reversing these policies we will again channel our wealth into the investment in America which is essential to a growing economy - an economy with more jobs for the future.', 'Third, we must again use fiscal policies - the management of our national budget - to stimulate growth and halt the continual rise in the cost of living. Today, with the Federal budget at an all time high, the way in which our Government spends its money and raises its revenues has an enormous influence on the health of our economy. We must reshape our fiscal policies to meet the needs of a growing economy. For example, by maintaining a budget surplus in time of prosperity we can keep prices down without discouraging investment - thus using the Federal budget as an instrument to create jobs and protect the incomes of our workers.', 'Fourth, we must move to meet the growing crisis of automation - the replacement of men by machines - which has already thrown thousands of men out of work and which threatens the jobs of millions more. This fast-moving technological revolution offers hope of vastly increased productivity - of greater abundance for all Americans. But we must harness it to serve the welfare of our people and not allow it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment. In the past 8 years nothing has been done to meet this growing challenge. In 1961 a Democratic President will call a conference of the leaders of industry and labor to formulate new programs which will harness modern technology to serve the interests of all the people. At the same time we must begin to retrain displaced workers to provide new opportunities by broadening the activities of the U.S. Employment Service and provide technical assistance to help businesses which are trying to modernize with the least possible impact on their workers. In this way automation will bring increased prosperity and not deepening economic distress.', 'Fifth, we must develop our great natural resources, material resources and resources of the mind, to provide a sound basis for a growing economy. In the past 8 years those resources have been neglected - and our economy has faltered. For industry cannot hope to expand without power to drive its factories, roads to transport its goods, water to supply its plants, and increased skills and knowledge to deal with the growing complexities of modern production - and which will provide the continual flow of new ideas and inventive talent which has been the source of our past greatness, and which is the key to future growth in which full employment depends. But industry itself cannot meet these needs. Only government - the combined efforts of local, State, and Federal Governments - can build the dams and highways and schools on which the strength of our free enterprise economy depends.', 'Sixth, we must formulate special programs of assistance to those areas of our country which are suffering from severe economic distress and chronic unemployment. Today the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus, areas of declining industry, where there is poverty and hunger, where men have been searching for work, but cannot find that work.', 'Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation, depriving all our industry of markets, decreasing total purchasing power, and depriving us of needed production. The distress may be regional, but the problem is a national problem.', 'Twice a Democratic Congress has passed legislation to provide the long-term development loans and technical assistance which can put our distressed areas back on their feet and put men back to work, loans and assistance which will help the underdeveloped areas of America just as we are trying to help the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa and Latin America. And twice these bills have been vetoed by the Republicans. In 1961 this legislation will become law, along with an effective trade adjustment program to help areas suffering under the impact of increased foreign imports.', 'Seventh, we must establish a Committee on National Economic Goals - a committee composed of leaders of industry and labor as well as the best economic talent of our universities and research institutes. This Committee will assess our potential productive capacity and the needs of our Nation, and help the President to formulate the broad goals of our free economy.', ""With the advice of such a broadly based group the President will be able to set our Nation's unfinished business before the Nation, not to direct our economy, but to help and encourage our people to direct their untapped capacities and the untapped capacities of our free enterprise system in a great national effort to revitalize our strength and bring employment to all Americans."", 'For a strong America requires a strong and growing economy - where all who want to work can find fruitful and productive use for their skills and labor. Only the power and determination of the American Republic stands between the increasing menace of militant communism and world domination. History and events, as well as our own deep determination, have committed us to the defense of freedom. We cannot meet that commitment with idle plants and idle men. We cannot meet it with a stalled economy. We cannot meet it by looking to past achievement rather than to the urgent needs of the future.', 'In the past America has met its responsibilities to its own people and to world freedom. For we are, by tradition and capacity, a vital and a growing Nation. But in the past 8 years the hand of timidity and retreat, of little faith and little vision, has reached out and intervened in our economy to halt our long historic march toward a greater and stronger America. America cannot afford such intervention by its governments.', 'We do not lack faith, and we do not believe in intervention which stifles and retards. Rather we seek to liberate our economy and our people, to free them to do what they want to do and what they have the strength to do. If we can succeed in this then the horizons of the future are limitless.']"
167,John F. Kennedy ,"September 27, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Di Salle, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express, as we leave beautiful Ohio, I want to express my thanks to all of you. We have been campaigning from Painesville, this morning, down through at least 50 percent of the State of Ohio. I must say I share the view of Governor Di Salle. I think that this State is going to go Democratic in November.', 'Last night on television Mr. Nixon stated that we agreed on the goals but that we disagreed on the means. That is what the argument has been for 25 years, how you move this country ahead, how do you provide full employment, how do you provide housing, how do you provide education, how do you develop the natural resources. Of course we want these things done, but the big argument is the means and the Democratic Party has provided the means. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt in accepting the second Presidential nomination before 100,000 people in Franklin Field in 1936, I think said very clearly the differences between our two major parties. In that speech he said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'I think that is the issue. What does this country want? Does this country want a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference, or do we want a government that will move, that will care for our people, that will set before the American people the unfinished business of our society? [Applause.]', ""After Franklin Roosevelt was elected in 1933, the new President's friend, Robert E. Sherwood, set it all down in a brief sardonic poem:"", '\n  Plodding feet, tramp, tramp\n  The Grand Old Party breaking camp\n  Blare of bugles, din, din\n  The New Deal is moving in.\n', 'Today on every major crisis that faces the United States, from the crisis at Formosa to Berlin, in the plight of our cities, of people out of work, we hear no blare of bugles, din, din; we see only plodding feet, tramp, tramp, and the Grand Old Party breaking camp.', ""I am a Democrat and I am proud to lead the Democratic Party. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon says the party labels don't mean anything; vote for the man. Party labels tell us something. The Democratic Party would not have nominated Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party never would have nominated me. We come out of the parties because the parties do stand for something. They do stand for a long history, and the record is written in the last 25 years and in the last 50 years. A Democratic majority wrote the Social Security Act and a Republican majority tried to kill it. [Applause.] The Democratic Party wrote unemployment compensation and the Republicans opposed it; a Democratic Party wrote the minimum wage law - a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour away back in the thirties, and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it."", ""I think parties mean something. They tell something about the candidates and they tell something about what the candidates will do if they are elected to office. Mr. Nixon never would have been the unanimous choice of his party unless they felt they understood where he was going, what he believed, and that he believed what they believed, and I don't. [Applause.]"", ""I believe what Wilson believed and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, that it is the function of government not to dominate but to serve. I don't believe, as I tried to say last night, in big government, but I believe in government meeting its responsibilities. When 50 percent of the steel capacity of the United States is unused, when we are building 200,000 homes less than we should, when there are 1,800,000 children who go to school part time, when teachers across the United States are paid 15 percent less for wages than they are in the manufacturing industries in the United States, then I think it is still time for the Democratic Party, I think we still have a function. [Applause.]"", 'When the average wage of laundry women in five large cities of the United States is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week, when the average social security check for people over 65 is $78 a month, and at least 9 million live on less than $1,000 a year, I think there is still need for the Democratic Party. I think the party - I think the next President of the United States will face a difficult time, because our country faces a difficult time. He is going to be faced with the problem of maintaining our position in Berlin, of maintaining our position all around the globe, of attempting to rebuild the image of the United States as a vital and strong society, as a society that is moving ahead, and at the same time he is going to be faced with serious problems here in the United States. He is going to be faced with the problem of trying to maintain in the first months of his office full employment in the United States, and in 1961 we may face a difficult time. That will be a matter of the greatest possible concern and the greatest possible importance to our people.', 'I think that this administration has not realized that when you have a recession in 1954 and when you have a more serious recession in 1958, and then you begin to have a plateau in 1960, that it should be an indication that it is time that our economy was stimulated rather than was held back by a fiscal policy and monetary policy which I think in the last 8 years, which has featured hard money, high-interest rates, which I think has had a deflationary effect on our economy at a time when we needed to stimulate it. I think the United States must address itself again to the Full Employment Act of 1946. I think we must attempt to stimulate the growth of the United States. We are going to have to find 25,000 jobs a week for the next 10 years if we are going to find jobs for your children who are coming into the labor market - 25,000 jobs a week, 52 weeks a year for 10 years, if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States, and it is going to be a matter that is going to be of concern to us all, Canton, Ohio, and the United States. We want to make sure that any American who seeks a job, who honestly wants to work will have a chance to work. That is our objective. [Applause.]', 'And we must do this at a time when automation is throwing men out of work. I ran in the primary in West Virginia. I spent some time in McDowell County in West Virginia. McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men. I think this is not a problem for McDowell County nor is it a problem for Canton, Ohio. It is a matter that should be of importance to the next administration and to the next President.', 'The problem of automation is to make sure that machines make our lives easier, not harder, for those who are thrown out of work. [Applause.]', ""I think we must develop our natural resources. You cannot bring industry into Ohio unless you have clean rivers. I think the greatest asset that has happened to Ohio during the last few years, except for Governor Di Salle's election, was the building of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and I was proud, though I came from Massachusetts, to vote for it, because it is a national asset and a rising tide lifts all boats. If Ohio moves ahead, so will Massachusetts. [Applause.] Good water, power, transportation, those are necessary to develop the economy of the United States in the 1960's."", 'Sixth, I think we must formulate special programs which will be of assistance in those areas which are chronically hard hit by unemployment, areas where it is 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent, and it may have gone on for 2 or 3 years. I had one of them in my own State, Lawrence, Mass., where the unemployment rate was 35 percent for 3 years, and the reason, of course, was because we lost our textile mills.', 'This administration has opposed both area assistance bills. I am not interested in seeing people in the United States out of work not for 1 month, 4 months or a year, or for 2 years or 3 years, while they get a surplus food package from the Government of 5 cents a day in eggs, rice, and they are going to add lard this summer. [Applause.]', ""This is an important election and we need your help in it. We cannot possibly succeed in this area or in this State unless in the next 6 weeks we can carry the State of Ohio. Ohio is key and so is Illinois. This election will be decided in the major industrial States of this country, and the question before the people of Ohio is do you think we can do better, do you think a Democratic Administration, with new people, with a sense of urgency about the affairs of this country, at home and abroad, do you think we can move this country, or do you think [applause] - or do you think you have never had it so good? I don't think Khrushchev has had it so good as he has had it lately. He has been moving outward and he has done it by unrelenting effort to demonstrate that his society represents the way to the future. That is the most powerful weapon he has. Because if the Soviet Union was first in outer space, that is the most serious defeat the United States has suffered in many, many years. The reason - not merely because outer space is important militarily, but because as George Adams, the head of U.S. Foreign Service said earlier this year, people around the world equate the mission to the moon, the mission to outer space, with productive and scientific superiority. Therefore, in spite of all our accomplishments, because we failed to recognize the impact that being first in outer space would have, the impression began to move around the world that the Soviet Union was on the march, that it had definite goals, that it knew how to accomplish them, that it was moving and that we were standing still. That is what we have to overcome, that psychological feeling in the world that the United States has reached maturity, that maybe our high noon has passed, maybe our brightest days were earlier, and that now we are going into the long, slow afternoon. I don't hold that view at all. I don't hold that view at all, and neither do the people of this country. [Applause.]"", ""I hope if we are successful that at the end of the next President's administration, people around the world will begin to wonder what is the President of the United States doing, what is the United States doing, not merely what is Mr. Khrushchev doing. I want to entertain him with a vision of the United States on the move. I am tired of reading every day what he says and what Castro says. I want to begin to see the United States moving ahead. [Applause.]"", 'So we ask your help and assistance in this campaign. I will close by reminding you that in the election of 1860, 100 years ago, the issue was really comparable, the question of whether the United States could exist half slave and half free. Now in this election I am reminded of a letter which Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend during that election. In that letter he said, ""I know there is a God and I know that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if he has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
168,John F. Kennedy ,"September 27, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. I want to say how much I appreciate your coming to the airport to meet me tonight. I know the reason that you do it is because you share the view that I have that it is essential to this country and to the State of Pennsylvania that the Democrats win this election. [Applause.]', 'I think the issue is a plain one and I think we attempted to discuss it last night. [Applause.] That is the question of whether the United States can do better, whether this is a great country that must be greater, a powerful country that must be more powerful. I do not run for the Presidency on the slogan ""You never had it so good."" I think we can do better, and I hope that all those who share my views that this country has a most important destiny, to be the chief defender of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the world, I hope that you feel as I do, that the Democratic Party which in this century produced Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman as a contribution. I ask your help in this campaign. I think here in this State of Pennsylvania this issue may well be decided. It is my judgment that the next President of the United States will carry Pennsylvania on November 8. [Applause.]', 'I would not have been nominated at the Democratic Convention if I had not secured the support of the Pennsylvania delegation. Now that you have done that, I hope you will go the rest of the way. We have a chance to be of service. This is a great country and I think it deserves the best of us.', ""I must say, looking back on the record of the past 25 years, that Mr. Nixon has said party labels don't mean much; what counts is the man. I think party labels mean something. The Republicans never would have nominated me, and the Democrats never would have nominated Mr. Nixon. [Applause.] I believe in the Democratic Party because I think it has been of service to the people. I think it looks to the future, and I think it recognizes that there must be placed before the American people during the next 10 years the unfinished business of our society, the things we must do to keep our people working, to provide security for our old people, to provide good education for our children, to provide a defense second to none. I hope it may be said at the end of the next President's first term that during those years the world started to look to the United States again, and wondered what the United States was doing, and wondered what the President was doing, not what Mr. Khrushchev was doing. I am tired of hearing it. [Applause.]"", 'I will close by again expressing my thanks. I think we have a chance to really be of service now. I think that when we serve our country, we serve not only our own people, but we serve the cause of everyone who wants to be free, also. During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we succeed here, the cause of freedom succeeds. If we fail, the cause of freedom fails. That is why I run for office this year, feeling that we must do better that we must be stronger, because what we do I think depends upon the future of the world. This is a great opportunity for all of us. I think if we can rewrite the history of the world in the next 4 or 8 years, we can be of service to ourselves and all those who look to us and historians will later write that these were the great years of the United States. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Eight years ago the Republicans invented the slogan ""liberation."" They pretended they would work to liberate East Europe from the Communist yoke. You know what happened in East Germany, in Hungary. We had encouraged them, but we did not lift a finger to help them. In the years since, we have heard nothing from our Nation\'s leaders about the Soviet colonies in East Europe - that have forgotten them, until election time. And today in New York Mr. Khrushchev and his puppet dictators are bristling with success and hostility.', ""I say it's time to contain communism around the world and not only on Manhattan Island."", 'I say the so-called policy of ""liberation"" was a cruel election-year fraud.', ""I say the peoples of East Europe do not deserve to be forgotten. And I say they won't be under a Democratic administration."", 'We must make it clear to all the world that we will never accept as a final solution Soviet colonialism in East Europe. We must seek through positive action in the United Nations to hold the searchlight of world opinion on Soviet brutality. We must not allow new crises over Soviet colonialism in Africa and Latin America to make us forget Soviet colonialism in East Europe.

I must say I think Ohio is going Democratic in November of 1960 and is going to lead the United States. [Applause.]', ""I am grateful to your Governor and to your Senator for accompanying me today on, a trip through northern Ohio. This State symbolizes the opportunities and the responsibilities and the problems which face the United States as a whole - a great industrial State, faced with the problem of growing, of finding schools for your children, of meeting the problems of those who are old, of making sure that those who are old enough to work can find a job, of making sure that our economy produces the things we need in this country, the things we need if we are going to be strong. I look to the 1960's with a good deal of confidence and hope, and I stand here today as the Democratic standard bearer of the oldest political party on earth. I stand where Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman stood in their time. [Applause.]"", 'I think the contrast between the two parties and the things for which they stand, and their approach to the future, and their record of the past, can be seen in the men and the slogans that they used in the 20th century. No Democratic candidate for the Presidency ever stood pat with McKinley, or kept cool with Coolidge, or returned to normalcy with Harding, or had two chickens in every pot with Hoover, or ran in 1936, as Landon did, repealing social security, or ran like Dewey did in 1944 and 1948 or runs in 1960 on the slogan ""You Never Had It So Good.""', 'American Presidents who were Democrats in this century, Woodrow Wilson and the new freedom, Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, Harry Truman and the Fair Deal - and now we run in 1960 on a program of the New Frontier. [Applause.]', ""The New Frontier represents all of the responsibilities which the American people must meet in the 1960's, and it represents all of the opportunities that are before us as a country and as a people. Here in the State of Ohio and in the United States, we have an opportunity to prove that freedom is not only the best system of government, but it is also the strongest, that productivity is the handmaiden of liberty, that you can be free, that you can be strong, that you can solve your problems, that you can build a defense second to none, that you can be first in space and first in education and first in employment and first in steel production, that you can meet the problems that we face and still maintain our freedom. That is the responsibility not of the next President, and not of the next Congress, and not of the House and the Senate - it is a responsibility in which all of us participate, in which all of us share. We have seen in the last few days in New York City Mr. Khrushchev and Kadar and Gomulka and Castro. They personify the Communist system, but they are not themselves the great danger. The great danger is the Communist system, itself, and its relentless determination to destroy us. If Mr. Khrushchev should pass from the scene, the Communist system would remain. So all the debates with Mr. Khrushchev, and all the things which we may say to him pale in significance to the relative power of the two systems. Are we stronger or is the Communist system stronger? Are we going to be stronger in 1970 or are they going to be stronger? Are we going to be stronger in 1980 or are they going to be stronger?"", 'My argument with Mr. Nixon and with the Republican administration is that they do not have sufficient vision, sufficient vigor, sufficient imagination, sufficient foresight to see that the unfinished business before us calls for us not merely to be first today, not merely to be strong enough today, but to be strong enough in 1970, in 1980. We protect not only our own security, but the security of all those who look to us, and the security of our children. Therefore, I think it is incumbent upon us to make the right decisions, to choose the strong way, to choose, if necessary, the hard way, for ourselves and for those who depend upon us.', 'Here in Lorain, in Ohio, in the United States, this fight is going to be fought. We cannot possibly miss. We cannot possibly fail, if we maintain our freedom and our strength, because our system represents in my opinion the basic aspiration of people everywhere. The experience of Eastern Germany, of Hungary, of Poland, of Tibet, all these show that people want to be free, and if they feel that we are strong, if they feel that events are moving in our direction, and not in the direction of the Communists, I think they will come with us. And what is true of Eastern Europe is true of Africa and Asia and Latin America. The big question in their minds, and the question which we have to settle in the next 8 years is, is the world moving toward freedom or toward the Communists?', 'I think it can move toward us. I think that we can meet the challenge. I think we can demonstrate that we represent the way of the future. The Communist system is as old as Egypt, and I think we have the greatest chance in our time and generation to show Mr. Khrushchev that Americans who fought in Anzio and in the Pacific now have determined that the United States will move and meet its responsibilities at home and abroad. Thank you. [Applause.]', 'I just want to say one word about the importance of sending a good man to the House of Representatives. We need the best people we can get in the House, the Senate, and the executive branch and I think this district has a great chance in doing a service for itself and the country if you elect Bill McCray to Congress.

I don't think there has been any presidential election where the issues are so serious, the problems facing the United States so burdensome, the responsibilities so heavy upon us all. This is not an easy time for any American. It is not an easy time for any friend of freedom, because you must consider not only what happens here in this district, but also what happens in the Congo and India and Latin America.

But I do say that if I am elected President of the United States, I do think it is possible to set before the American people the things which we must do in order to maintain our freedom, the things we must do in order to be second to none, the things we must do to build a better society here in the United States, and also hold out the hand of friendship around the world.

Today, yesterday, Mr. Castro raised the standard of revolt, the standard of communism through all of Latin America, not merely in Cuba. One or two years ago there was not a country in Africa that was in any danger of moving in the direction of the Communists. The other day Mr. Herter said that Ghana had joined the Communist side, and the Congo is uncertain. A year ago Laos was one of the strongest countries on the side of freedom. Today Laos is torn by a civil war.', 'These are the issues which are before the United States and before the United Nations and before the world in the next 10 years. Are other countries of Africa going to join Ghana? Are other countries of Latin America going to join Cuba? Are other countries of Asia going to join Laos in the next 10 years? What contribution can we make to the cause of freedom here in the United States, and the cause of freedom around the world? I think that is the question that is before us this year. It is not the questions that have been traditionally before us, not the old arguments that divided our party. Now the problems are new and they require new solutions.', 'One-hundred years ago Lincoln said, ""As the problems are new, we must disenthrall ourselves from the past."" I ask you to look ahead. I ask you to join me in making this the greatest country on earth, the strongest country.

It is a contest between those of us who believe that the best days of the United States are still ahead, who believe that it is the function of our generation and our time to contribute to the strengthening of the United States. It is a contest between those who believe that the future can be better for our people and it is a contest between those who say ""Yes"" to the next 10 years and those who say ""No"" or ""Maybe."" I think in that contest, the American people want to look ahead. This is a difficult and close fight. There is not any doubt in my mind that Ohio will play a key role in that contest.', 'In 1948 President Truman carried this State by 7,000 votes. He carried Illinois by 13,000 votes. A change of 3,500 or 4,000 votes might have lost him that presidential election. It may be close again. It is going to be decided in these large States from Illinois east - Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, which have a large number of electoral votes and which any candidate for the Presidency this year must carry. So I come to Ohio again as I did last Sunday, to ask your help in this campaign. I received the support of the Ohio delegation at the national convention, and without it I would not have been nominated. Now, having been nominated, I ask your help once again. I think that there is a real opportunity for all of us to be of service to this country. It deserves the best of us. I think over the next 6 years, if we can meet our obligation to present the issues to the American people so that they have a clearcut alternative, so that they recognize the choice that is before them, then we will have fulfilled our responsibility, and the final judgment is theirs.', 'I hope that we are successful. But we are meeting our responsibility constitutionally and to the system during the campaign. There are many issues which face Ohio and face the country during the next 5 to 10 years. This is a growing State. The St. Lawrence Seaway can mean a good deal to you. But if we are going to maintain full employment in the State, if we are going to realize the opportunities that are before our people, I think that it requires the Democratic Party, it requires your help and it requires Ohio.

The real question before us in some ways transcends the differences between the two parties, and that is ""How can we make this country stronger? How can we identify more successfully the United States with the cause of freedom around the world?"" We are going to face in the 1960\'s problems as difficult and complicated as faced us in the 1930\'s. We are going to have to find in the 1960\'s 25,000 new jobs a week if we are going to maintain full employment, and we are going to do that at a time when new machines are coming in and taking the jobs of men. We are going to have to build more schools than were ever built before. In the next 10 years in the United States, we are going to have to build for your children as many college dormitories and buildings as were built in the whole history of the United States, all in the period of 10 years. We are going to have to develop the resources of this country so that we can maintain the population by the year 2000 twice as large as it is today. I don\'t run for the office of the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy. I think it will be a difficult and trying time for us all. But I do run for the office of the Presidency recognizing that if the office has high responsibilities and great opportunities, and as I said last night, I think the function and responsibility of the next President is to place before the American people what we must do, not only to survive, but to prevail. We cannot be satisfied with things as they are. You cannot live in this hostile world as we do and feel that the tide is moving in the direction of freedom. The Russians, the Chinese, the Cubans, the Eastern European satellite governments are all dedicated to the destruction of the United States, because they know that if we fail, their victory is assured. There is no country and no people to whom we can turn for help. We depend up on ourselves, and therefore, I run for the office of the Presidency, believing that this great country can meet its responsibilities, can assume its functions, that a free society does have more vitality and strength than any other system, and that it is up to us, not only to meet our responsibilities here but to the cause of freedom around the world. That is a heavier burden than any people have ever borne in history, but it is a burden that I believe we can bear. In Africa and Latin America and Asia, in the next 10 years, I think those people who stand today on the razor-edge of decision will be in to make up their minds. Does the future belong to the West and freedom or does the future belong to the Communists? In a Gallup poll taken in February, it showed that a majority of people in 10 countries believed that by 1970 the Soviet Union would be ahead of the United States both militarily and scientifically. I don\'t agree. Why should we - why should we be behind, and what is more important, why should they think we are blind. I am not satisfied to be second in space, to be second in the position that we hold now in some areas of the world. I think the United States should be first, not ""First, if"" [applause] or but or when or maybe, but first because we must be if freedom is to survive. So I ask your help in this election. I think this election is most important, and I think after this election if we are successful, we have the chance to be of the greatest possible service to our country. All of us wish the best for it. All of us have confidence in it. All of us believe it is a great country that can be greater. All of us believe it is a powerful country that must be more powerful. All of us believe that it is time that the United States started moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Many people feel that it may well be decided in the State of New York. But whether it is decided with us or against us, it is my hope that this election will serve a great national purpose, that it will remind the people of the United States of the unfinished business before our country, and I am glad that the Republicans now agree that this country must move ahead. [Applause.]', 'Six months ago the Republican campaign slogan was peace and prosperity. Three months ago it was ""You never had it so good."" Now all those slogans, all those movies have been scrapped and now they are saying it is time America started to wake up, and I agree. [Applause.]', 'I stand here tonight where Woodrow Wilson, Governor Smith, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman stood in their time and generation. [Applause.] 1960 is different from 1912 or 1932 or 1948, but I sing the same song they sang; that is, that the Democratic Party belongs to the people and will serve the people, and in serving the people serve the cause of freedom.

Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'I think that is what we have seen and will see unless we are successful in this election - a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.

That package, and I have seen it and some of you have, too, has included in it $6.50 for a family of four of dried eggs, some cereal, some rice, and this summer the Department of Agriculture is adding lard. That amounts to 5 cents a day per person, 4 million of them, in the United States."", ""Now, the fact of the matter is that I don't say this is Mr. Nixon's fault, but I say we are concerned about it. I say the Democrats want to do something about it. I say these are not statistics to us; these are people who need help, and in a country that has more surplus than any other, we can do better.

We pride ourselves on being the strongest power, and yet in 1961, 1962, or 1963, unless we are prepared to rebuild our strength, the United States will be in a position, I think of danger from an attack which could catch us in a position where we would be secure but not secure enough, where we would be strong but not strong enough.

The best propaganda for the United States is to have a society which emphasizes opportunity for all our people, which develops the personality and talent of our citizens, which builds a happy country, which serves around the world as a beacon and advertisement for the cause of freedom. All the propaganda, all of the messengers around the world, pale next to the fact of what we are. If we can do well here, if we can develop our resources, if we can protect the rights of our people, if we can maximize their opportunities, if we can build a strong society, then the message of freedom will be carried around the world. We won\'t need Voices of America and we won\'t need propaganda statements because the strength of our society will serve as the best advertisement for freedom.

The kind of society we build here will cause those people to say, ""We wish to move in the same road that they are taking."" The great question which we now face in the next 10 years is: Can we make our system work in such a way that the world around us will wish to come with us, or are the Communists going to be able to show that they are the ones to whom the future belongs?

We run as Democrats. We run identified with the party that has brought us most of the gains which I think all of us now accept. But I don\'t say that what we have done in the past is sufficient. Franklin Roosevelt and Truman and Wilson met the problems of their generation. Now we are a new group of Americans with entirely new problems, and it does no good to invoke great names unless we are prepared to bring new solutions to new problems. I don\'t run merely against Mr. Nixon. This is a contest between all of us, between all of us who want to reach for the future, between all of us who have unlimited confidence in this country\'s capacity to lead and be great, all of us who look with confidence and hope to the future of this country, all of us who agree with Thomas Paine who said in 1776, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960 the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. That is our goal. [Applause.)', 'So I close by expressing my thanks to you for your friendship tonight.

I see the storm coming, and His hand is in it, but if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, the issue is still freedom or slavery.

Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['I look forward to the development of the port of Erie as a thriving center of international commerce.', 'The avenue for that development is the St. Lawrence Seaway. It holds the prospect of attracting new industry to Erie. In new industry lies the prospect of revenues to meet other, pressing local needs, such as education.', 'I was the first Member of Congress from my State to support the seaway. At the time it was not popular in the port of Boston. There was a feeling that it would hurt local interests. But my feeling was that the seaway was a great international waterway, of potential benefit to the whole country. My feeling was that it was good for Erie and the other Great Lakes ports, that it was good for Pennsylvania, and good for Minnesota, and good for the Nation. As a matter of national interest, I supported the seaway.', 'I also supported, this year, the bill which authorized the dredging and expansion of the Erie Harbor to accommodate oceangoing vessels.', 'What we must do now is to go full speed forward to complete the port project, and thus bring the seaway to Erie as a commercial reality. You may be sure of my support for this project in the future as in the past.']"

Governor Lawrence, Reverend Clergy, Mrs. Price, ladies and gentlemen: I am very grateful for the Governor's generous remarks, and his kind analogy with Mr. Perry. The only thing is that Mr. Perry did not have to fight three times all over again after having gone through it once. It is like playing Ohio State every Saturday for 4 weeks in a row. So we will try again next week."", 'I appreciate your coming to the breakfast. I am touched by the - not as deeply touched as you have been this morning. [Laughter and applause.] It always warms the hearts of the Democrats to see contributors gathered together in one room on an occasion such as this. I wish there were some other way to run a campaign, but this is what makes the mare go, and this is what keeps us moving today from here to Buffalo and on through New York. You would not have wanted to have gotten a telegram from Albany saying we were stranded there. [Laughter.] So I hope you will keep us going. We are very grateful for it.', ""This is an important campaign and it does involve us all greatly. I have the honor to lead the Democratic Party in this campaign, but the contest is not merely Mr. Nixon versus myself. We have a tendency sometimes in this country to personify or personalize all of our issues. We look at Mr. Castro and we look at Mr. Khrushchev and we look at Mr. Nasser and all the rest. Really, the important thing about Mr. Khrushchev is not Mr. Khrushchev himself being a formidable figure, but it is the Communist system. We worried the same way about Stalin, and we worry about Khrushchev. When Khrushchev disappears, we will worry about Koslov and Mikoyan, whoever emerges out of that. It is the power of the system that counts, and it is the same thing of the United States. The vigor and leadership of the President is an ingredient in national strength, but in the final analysis it is the sum of the total that counts. Presidents may change, but the power of the United States, in the balance of world politics, in the balance of the power struggle of the world, is the great force on the side of freedom. So in a very real sense, we are all involved. When the United States is in trouble, it isn't the President that is in trouble. It is the United States."", ""So this is the struggle between Mr. Nixon and myself. I think it is a struggle really in a larger sense between two different concepts of government which has gone on for many years, and which continues in 1960. We have a Democratic Congress. I hope we are going to have a Democratic Executive. I hope that the Democratic Executive and the Democratic Congress in a responsible and effective way will try to set before the American people the unfinished agenda, the unfinished business. I think it would be helpful if we could make a determination of what we have to do in the next 10 years to maintain our military position, our economic strength, our social strength, here in the United States and throughout the world. Then I am confident we can do it. I don't think there is any doubt that even though I have been critical of some phases of our national leadership, I have never been critical of our country. I think its potential is unlimited. We proved it in two wars. We proved it in peacetime. Therefore, we are all united in support of our country."", ""Mr. Nixon persists in saying that I am downgrading America. I downgrade the leadership, which is getting in some phases of our national lives but I don't downgrade the country. I upgrade it. After traveling through it for many years, after having been in 50 States and after having been as much of it as I have, no American could possibly have anything but the greatest confidence in it and its people. The problem is that we make sure that in the sixties that we recognize not merely the difficulties we are passing through now, but that we try to do everything in relationship to what needs to be done."", 'Mr. Nixon Monday night, and it was well within his debate rights, kept applying to the present statistics what might have happened 10 or 12 years ago. I prefer to apply what is happening today with what needs to happen. I prefer to apply what we are doing with what the Communist world is doing. I think it better to apply what is happening today. Is our prestige increasing relative to theirs around the world? That is the only question before us. In other words, by 1970, will we be stronger in relation to them than we are today, or weaker? That is what the determination is that the American people have to make.', 'My judgment is we can be stronger. My judgment is that with the present relative rate, how ever, there is no assurance of that. I ask your help in this campaign and I want to express my appreciation for the support you have given this campaign, in this State and throughout the country.', ""We could not possibly have carried on without help like this. I want you to know that I think in addition to being of assistance on this occasion, I think that you are also meeting the responsibilities which go with citizenship. This campaign cannot possibly be run without money to pay for transportation - these are the humdrum things - television, radio, and all the rest. Where are we going to get the assistance? We are going to get it from the people who will be willing to help, even though they have many other responsibilities or we just won't get it. I think that both parties ought to have assistance in presenting their views. Then the American people can make a fair choice. Then there is no inequality in their ability to deliver their message. Then the choice is very fair, and we get democracy at its highest. So I hope that you feel as I feel, that in helping this campaign, you also contribute not merely as Democrats or Republicans to a campaign, but in fulfilling a responsibility which goes with citizenship. I appreciate it very much. I appreciate your help in this campaign. I do think we have a great chance to win, but, more important than that, we do have a chance to be of service to our country. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
177,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['The issue in this campaign is not the ""bogus"" issue of how far we extend the powers of the Federal Government tomorrow. It is the real issue of how well we use the powers of the Federal Government today. For by its defense programs, by its highway programs, by its housing programs, by its research programs, the Federal Government already has power to help or hurt every individual in every community. Not to use those powers to help people, is to use them to hurt people.', 'We Democrats have believed at all times and at all places in using the Federal Government to help people. We believe it in depressed counties and in thriving counties. We believe it in the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson, the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, and the Fair Deal of Harry Truman. And we believe it today as we stand on the New Frontier.', 'For areas experiencing acute trouble - areas such as Niagara and Erie Counties - the challenge of the New Frontier requires these measures.', 'First, we must spur the rate of national economic growth so as to take up the slack now existing in heavy industry - such as steel, chemicals, and autos - and in service industries - such as building and construction.', 'Secondly, we must administer existing defense and other Federal procurement programs in a manner that, consistent with the national interest, areas with idle facilities and idle skills are given priority before those skills are disgraced and chronic unemployment takes over.', 'Third, to that end, we will repass, and I would sign, the depressed-areas bill twice vetoed by the Republicans.', 'Fourth, we will provide support and encouragement for communities that want to help themselves in solving urban problems of overcrowded schools, polluted water, and rundown neighborhoods. I would for example, sign - not veto - legislation helping local communities to deal with their water problems by building sewage-disposal plants.']"
178,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Posner, Mayor Wagner - girls, I feel like playing 60 minutes for Rochester after that - I want to express my appreciation to Mr. Posner and the members of the Democratic committee, and to all of you. I must say I think this is the largest meeting that we have had in the entire campaign, and I express my gratitude for it. [Applause.]', 'I did not know that Rochester was such a strong Democratic city. [Applause.] I am informed by someone with a long memory that when another presidential candidate, Mr. Thomas Dewey, came here in 1948, he said, ""It is good to be back in Syracuse."" [Laughter.] He didn\'t know where he was going or where he was, and I don\'t think the Republicans do today. [Applause.]', 'I am glad to be back here in Rochester, because a year ago, almost at this very time, I spoke at the University of Rochester. Interestingly enough, a year ago, as you recall, Mr. Khrushchev was visiting the United States on that occasion, but then 12 months ago he came as a guest of the Government, and there were high hopes expressed that this was the beginning of a period of reconciliation between the two great powers. Therefore, I spoke at the University of Rochester on that visit of Mr. Khrushchev in 1959. You remember that in those happy days, Mr. Lodge was being hailed as the genial host who was showing Mr. Khrushchev America. Mr. Nixon was talking about the increased prospects of peace that were coming out of the ""development of mutual respect"" that was then moving ahead between the two countries."" As a result there were some who resented my warning given at the University of Rochester in regard to Mr. Khrushchev\'s visit, for I said then what is evident now, that a more careful reflection on Mr. Khrushchev\'s visit was a cause for redoubled effort, not for relaxation. ""It justifies more,"" I said, ""not less, sacrifice to protect and extend the world\'s frontiers of freedom. We here in the United States in the year 1959 cannot escape our dangers by recoiling from them or by being lulled to sleep. The real test of Mr. Khrushchev\'s desire to end the cold war will be in his deed, not his words, his deeds in Germany, in advising the Red Chinese on Laos, or in charging his emissaries in the United Nations and the Geneva Nuclear Test Conference.""', 'That was 1 year ago and a good deal has changed in that last 12 months, but a good deal remains the same. His visit in 1960 is again a cause for redoubled effort, because the struggle is as constant as it has been for many, many years, and that is the struggle between two great systems. It really does not make a significant difference in that struggle, through it is highly desirable, if Mr. Khrushchev and the President of the United States can establish cordial relations. I would hope they could. I would hope the next administration, whoever it will be, will make it possible to ease the tension which now exists between the Soviet Union and the United States. But even if he should, the struggle will go on, in Germany in the Far East, in Asia, in Africa and Latin America, until the balance of power begins to move in one direction or the other. The quality which I think the next President of the United States needs, and I think we have needed it for some years, is the quality of judgment and the quality of foresight. [Applause.]', 'The quality of judgment to be able to pick from five or six possible solutions in a crisis which affects the security of the United States, experience and judgment, but the second quality which is equally important is the quality of foresight. The President of the United States made a distinguished speech before the United Nations a few days ago, and as an American I was glad to support everything he said. He did say, speaking about Africa, two things: that he thought it vitally important that the United States associate with the United Nations and also, bilaterally, in a great educational program for Africa. It takes many years to educate a young man or woman. It takes years and experience, and what have we been doing for the last 10 years in the United States to make anyone think that it is possible for these countries of Africa to govern themselves and maintain their freedom when many of them have been denied the rudiments of an educational system and we have been on the whole insufficient. [Applause.]', ""It was not until the crisis in the Congo that the U.S. Government promised 300 scholarships to the Congo and yet there are less than 15 people having college degrees among the natives of the Congo. How can they maintain a democratic society on that basis? We offered 300 scholarships, which is more than we have given Africa from the Federal Government in the United States for the last 2 years combined for all the countries of Africa. You cannot possibly move in an area overnight when the crisis comes. We have given in aid or at least have promised it, to Latin America, 500 millions of dollars passed by the last session of the Congress, not an appropriation but an authorization. And why did we do it? Because our relations with Castro became so sour they came to the breaking point, and because the OAS was going to meet and we wanted them to take a firm stand against the communism in the Latin American hemisphere and the hemisphere of the whole Western World, and because a Bogota Conference was being held which was going to discuss the economic future of Latin America. Therefore, after years had passed in which we were totally indifferent to the needs of Latin America we came forth with a program at the point of Mr. Castro's pistol."", 'Foresight, some ability to make a judgment before the event happens. [Applause.]', ""We talk today in the United States about Mr. Khrushchev all the time. Mr. Khrushchev is a serious opponent and the Soviet Union is an enemy. But what about the Chinese Communists, and what about the relationship which now exists between the Chinese Communists and the Russians? And what about the debate that is now going on where the Chinese Communists say that Lenin said that the only means for the Communists to succeed in their world revolution was by war? How long would it be before the Chinese Communists have a nuclear weapon? How long would it be before they would have an arsenal? How long would it be before they decide to put Lenin's theory in operation, and what will the position be of the Soviet Union? We talk about Khrushchev and Castro, and yet the deadly competition that is now going on in Asia is between China and India, whether a free country can solve its problems as India is attempting to do, or whether they have to follow the example of the Chinese Communists."", 'These are problems that are coming upon us in the next year and yet I do not hear administration spokesmen discussing them. If suddenly India began to go Communist, a crash program would be enacted which would grant all of the things that today might save us. [Applause.]', ""These people of the underdeveloped world are not naive. They don't expect the United States to sustain them and I don't think we should. But I do think that they hope, and I do feel that we should act not when a crisis comes, not when we have to for our own security pass a desperate action through the Congress, but that we should over the months and years work with them in cooperation, not seeking allies in a cold war struggle, but sharing a desire which we have with them to maintain free and independent countries around the world. [Applause.]"", 'We talk about Cuba, but what about Ghana, an independent country granted its independence by the British and recently Mr. Herter stated that they have now passed under the Communist influence, at least in foreign policy. Why should they? Why should the people of Ghana decide that that represents the hope for them, and not the road of freedom? These are the greatest issues which disturb the United States today, and will disturb the life of the next President of the United States. They are all complicated. There are no easy solutions. They all require a fine judgment as to what the future holds for us, what we can do to influence, what should be our function, what image, what vigor, what force should be present ourselves to the world in. I think that what we do here in this country has a greater effect as what we do almost any place around the world. [Applause.] If we are building a better society here, if we are struggling constantly and earnestly, if the President of the United States is indicating the moral imperative behind the struggle against discrimination in all parts of the United States, if we are maintaining in this country full employment, if we are using our great productive capacity to the fullest, if we are developing the best educational system in the world, a system which will turn out not merely mathematicians and scientists and engineers, but educated men and women who can make a judgment about the world around them. [Applause.]', 'Secretary Stimson said some years ago, I think in 1947, that everything that we do in the United States must be framed with reference to the world around us, every domestic problem that we face really has its counterpart in our foreign relations. If our productivity remains high, then our tax revenues remain strong. Then we have sufficient revenues to maintain a defense second to none. If we have the ability to meet the problem of an abundance of food, in an imaginative way, that helps people of the world to realize the blessings the Lord has given them, then we assist ourselves and assist others.', 'If we recognize that we do not have much time, that the nuclear capacity is traveling country after country, almost like a disease, until by the end of the next decade 15, 20, or 25 countries will have the power to destroy not merely their adversaries, but perhaps human life, and yet this a Administration has less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the vital subject of disarmament and our negotiators have reflected that disinterest. [Applause.]', 'These are all difficult problems that may confound us, but I think to their solution we must address ourselves. In the 19th century, great Presidents and great Senators dealt with four, five, or six issues which flowed in a gentle stream across the panorama of their lives. What they talked about when the came to the Congress they talked about 4 years later at the end of their congressional terms. Now the issues are sophisticated. They go beyond the understanding of most experts. Experts disagree on monetary, fiscal policy, and all the rest, sophisticated weapons systems, the problems which face emerging countries. All these problems dwarf in many cases our understanding. Therefore, this is not merely a contest between two men. This is a contest between two parties and the ability of those two parties in the United States to bring men of vigor and intelligence and energy and foresight into the Federal Government to serve the public interest. [Applause.]', 'I want to make it clear that in my judgment the next President of the United States must use all of the talent he can get, regardless of the party - only skill and talent and a devotion to the public interest. [Applause.] Franklin Roosevelt and Truman used Lovett and Stimson and Marshall and Knox and Forrestal and the others; Judge Patterson from this State. I do not recall a single Democrat in a high position of national or international responsibility that has served this administration in any position comparable to what Foster Dulles did in 1950 and 1951 on the Japanese Treaty. I think we must do better. I hope whoever is elected President will use the best talent we can get. [Applause.]', 'After the fall of France, Marshal Petain said:', '\n  Our spirit of enjoyment was greater than our spirit of sacrifice. We wanted to have more than we wanted to give. We spared effort and we met disaster.\n', ""I want to assure you that if I am elected President of the United States in November we will not spare effort. We will devote all of our energy. [Applause.] I think the spirit of this country is to give. I don't know any American who is not prepared to meet any responsibilities or bear any burdens in order to maintain his society, and I think it is proper that we should do so. Our generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny just as much as the generation of 1933 whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed in his inaugural speech. [Applause.]"", 'The contribution of that generation was the maintenance of freedom here in the United States and the maintenance of the private enterprise system. I think the contribution of the next generation of Americans in the sixties and the seventies can be the maintenance of freedom here in the United States and also the maintenance of freedom around the world. Can we in our time and generation cause the tide to begin to come in for freedom, or shall it ebb and we be left high and dry by 1970 or 1975, isolated with a world turning to the East and not to the West? That is the question before us, as serious and as great a question as has faced this country since 1860, the same issue in many ways as the issue of 1860, half slave or half free. I think it will be free but it will depend in the final analysis upon all of us. [Applause.]', 'In the Presidential campaign of 1860, Lincoln wrote a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and I know His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
179,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Prendergast, Mr. Levitt, Mayor Wagner; the last Presidential candidate to come into this particular area of New York was Al Smith in 1928. Governor Smith in that campaign and in many campaigns preceding it used as his basic slogan the motto, ""Let\'s look at the record,"" and he compared what he had done in New York State and he compared the record of the Democratic Party over the preceding years to that of the Republican Party. I say in 1960, let\'s look at the record.', ""Mr. Nixon has stated that party labels don't mean very much in 1960. I think they mean a good deal, because they tell something about the candidates of both parties. The Republicans never would have nominated me, and the Democrats never would have nominated Mr. Nixon. They nominated Mr. Nixon because they knew where he stood, because they knew that he believed in the things for which they believed in, and I do not. I think that is the issue in this campaign. Are we going to move forward or are we going to stand still? Are we going to send a green light to the 1960's? Are we going to feel that everything that is being done today is as good as we can do? I think the record of the Democratic Party written in this century, written in the last 25 years, establishes a sound basis for us in the 1960's, and that is a record of service to the people, of believing that however good this country may be, it can be better. This country has been made by people who were not satisfied. The whole Western United States was developed by people who wanted to better themselves. The United States was built by people who came from other sections because they thought they could have a better life."", 'Mr. Nixon says I am running America down. I am not. I am trying to build America up. What I am saying is that with vigorous leadership, with leadership which will realize the potential of this country, this country can maintain its own freedom and the freedom of those who look to us for help.', ""This is an important election, and I come to you in 1960, in October and September, asking your assistance. This is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is a contest between two parties, and it is a contest between two parties which have had a different philosophy during their political tradition. All through our history in this century, the Democratic Party has looked to the future, with Woodrow Wilson's new freedom, and Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Harry Truman's Fair Deal. We have looked ahead, and I ask you to look ahead in this country. We face an extremely difficult and hazardous time. I don't think the office of the Presidency is going to be easy. I think in many ways the job of the next President will be more difficult than any President since Abraham Lincoln, and it isn't merely the office of the President - I think the job of an average citizen in the United States, the responsibilities that he will face, are more difficult and burdensome than they have been ever in the past. When presidential candidates ran many years ago, they discussed only a few issues, because only a few issues disturbed our tranquillity. Now the issues which face us are not merely to maintain employment in Niagara County, not merely to develop the resources of northern New York, not merely to make a better life for our people in New York State and in the United States. Now the President, and therefore the people, have to be concerned with the Congo and Cuba and Laos, countries which most of us had never heard of 10 years ago, and yet which will affect the lives of everyone here - Guinea, Ghana, countries which were colonial countries 2 years ago, now independent. What they do will affect the security of your children in every school in this country. Therefore, we stand as the dominant force in the coalition for freedom which must move strongly in the next 10 years."", 'I ask your support in this campaign, not merely because I think we can move this country here at home, but also because I think if we do the things at home that must be done, I think it is possible for us to stand once again in the world, not as a dominant power, but as the leader of a coalition of countries who wish to associate with us, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.', 'I wish we could worry just about our own problems, but I do disagree strongly with those who say that they are conservatives at home and risktakers abroad. I think that we have to move here at home. I think we have to carry a big stick, and I think, as Theodore Roosevelt said, we should speak softly. We want peace. We want security for ourselves. We want to maintain life in this continent and this planet. We want freedom to expand, and I think the best way we can do it is to do our job here in this State and here in this country. Build a better life for our people and then what we do here will speak far more loudly than what we say.', 'This is a contest of nerve and will. The next 10, 15, or 20 years may determine the outcome. The Soviet system and our system are on trial. The question will be, Which system has the longest staying power? Which can maintain itself in good times and bad? Which can serve as an inspiration to people around the world? Do they want to move with them or with us? Khrushchev and the President of the United States, only personify the two sides. The real question is, which system and which people have the power, the will, the determination and the conviction? I think we do. I think our future can be assured, but I think we have a responsibility to ourselves and to those who look to us to move in this country, to set before ourselves our unfinished business, and then get to it.', 'I ask your help in this campaign, and I can assure you that if we are successful, we are going to work to make the United States not first if, but, or when, but first, period. And we are going to move. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
180,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['Twenty-five years ago social security became law.', 'But that is not the only anniversary we mark today. For, 25 years ago the Republicans in the Congress voted 95 to 1 to kill social security, calling it an extreme measure.', 'Today, 25 years later, much has changed for older Americans - social security with its hope for a later life of dignity and a decent standard of living is an accepted and admired part of the American way of life.', 'But one thing has not changed. This year again the Republican Party - as it always has in the past - is fighting every single Democratic effort to advance the welfare of our people to relieve poverty and hunger and the burdens of illness. This year again only a single Republican in the Senate voted for medical care for the aged. This year again Mr. Nixon, as the spokesman for his party, speaking to 73 million people in our television debate, said that our efforts to provide medical care through social security were ""extreme.""', 'But I don\'t believe it is ""extreme"" to help our older citizens get the medical attention they need. I don\'t believe it is ""extreme"" to work through our tried and tested social security system. I don\'t believe it is ""extreme"" to relieve poverty and illness and despair.', 'What is ""extreme"" is the fact of 9 million Americans over the age of 65 trying to survive on incomes of less than $20 a week - the 3 million more living on $40 a week. What is ""extreme"" is the fact of millions of older Americans who are unable to afford the medical care - the doctors and drugs and hospital rooms - which they so desperately need. And what is ""extreme"" is the opposition of the Republican Party to every effort to bring help to our older citizens.', 'When the Republican Party nominated Mr. Nixon, they not only selected a leader - they selected a man whose record had proven him to be a true heir and representative of this historic Republican tradition - a man who led the opposition to medical care for the aged. And a man who was ready to carry on that opposition.', 'In 1935 the Republicans failed to block progress. This year they succeeded in destroying the hopes of Americans over the age of 65 for relief from the crushing burden of medical bills - and for the opportunity to fully care for their health. And they substituted for a soundly financed program under social security, a bill which will cost the American taxpayer over a billion dollars a year, is impossible to administer, which will not even be put into effect in many of our States, which has been rejected by the Governor of New York, and which will fail to bring relief where it does go into effect.', 'Why then did the Republicans fail to kill social security in 1935, and succeed in 1960? In 1935 we had a Democratic President in the White House using all the many powers of that high office to insure the passage of his program. This year we had a Republican administration, using all its powers, to destroy our program.', 'The lesson is a clear one. Only with a Democratic President in the White House can we hope to bring help to poverty-stricken older Americans. And in 1961 we will have a Democratic President. And in 1961 help will be on the way.']"
181,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence ladies and gentlemen, does not anyone ever go to school in Erie? [Laughter.] I want to express my thanks to all of you for this morning's reception and also for last night. I don't think that in the whole campaign we have had as high a turnout of the people who live in one community as we have had in this community. [Applause.] We have been traveling in this campaign from community to community, from State to State, from region to region, and we travel by plane and by car, and there are bands and all the rest. But we are engaged in a serious business, in a serious time in the life of our country. I lead on this occasion the Democratic Party which, in other years and other occasions and other great crises, had produced Jefferson, Jackson, and Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. I think the Democratic Party has produced these men for two reasons: First, because the party is a national party, it represents potato farmers in Maine and steelworkers in Pennsylvania, and citrusgrowers in California and fishermen in the State of Washington. It speaks for all the people and all interests, and, therefore, I think looks to the future as the American people do."", 'The second reason is because we have had in every year of our great contribution, men and women of sufficient vitality and vigor to look to the future: Woodrow Wilson in the campaign of 1912 on the new freedom. The first 2 years of his administration were the most productive since the administration of Abraham Lincoln. Franklin Roosevelt ran with the New Deal. As Governor Lawrence said this morning, the first 100 days redid the face of America, and we still benefit from what he did in the first 12 months of his Office. Harry Truman ran on the Fair Deal, to speak on behalf of the people of this country. I think that Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were regarded as great Presidents by the people of this country, and the world. They were regarded as good neighbors by the people of Latin America, because they were good neighbors to the people of this country. You cannot succeed abroad, you cannot be strong abroad, you cannot have our prestige strong around the world unless you are moving here at home. What we are speaks louder than what we say. What we are doing here carries its imprint across the face of the globe. Because Franklin Roosevelt developed the Tennessee Valley, people all over the world thought they could do the same. They wanted to imitate us. I want people to look again to the United States for leadership. I want them to know that we have in this country not only a free society, but also a strong and productive society. I want people in this country working. I want us developing our natural resources. I want us to demonstrate that we can be first; not, if or but or when, but first, now, period. [Applause.]', 'I think the people of this country should make a determination in making a decision as to who they should elect in November. They should make a determination not only on what is best for the United States, but which party can lead this country to a position of preeminence in the world.', ""A Gallup poll taken some months ago showed that of the 10 countries polled, a majority of the people in every country thought the Soviet Union would be ahead of the United States, in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. If people think it so, it may be so. I don't think it so. But I think the important thing is to let people know that it is not going to be so, to let people know that we are on the move here in the United States. [Applause.)"", 'I am tired of reading what Khrushchev is doing. I would like the people of the world to be reading what the American President is doing, and what the United States is doing, not merely what Castro is doing or Khrushchev is doing or Kadar is doing or Gomulka is doing. [Applause.]', ""I make no pretense of saying that if we are elected life will be easier. I think the next President's responsibility in the next 6 months will be extremely heavy. He will be faced with the problem of maintaining full employment here in the United States, of maintaining our economy, of trying to stimulate sufficiently so that people who want to find work can find it, and in addition he will be face to face with a serious situation in Berlin, in Formosa and around the world. He will be face to face with a competition in Africa and Latin America."", ""I don't run for the Office of the Presidency promising that if I am elected life will be easy for the people or for the President. I think it is a difficult time. But I think all of us want to serve our country, all of us want the best for it, and I happen to believe that the Democratic Party has sufficient energy and vitality, sufficient force, to lead the United States through dangerous times. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask your support. [Applause.]"", 'Let me close by saying to you--', '(Response from the audience.)', 'I know that I am doing the work and when I stop you have to go to school, and then you have to work', '(Response from the audience.)', 'In any case, I want to express my thanks to you all. I think here in Pennsylvania you know as much about the issues as you can know. You have a distinguished Democratic Governor. You have had serious problems which have faced this State because it is a major industrial component of the United States. If our economy is moving ahead, then Pennsylvania moves ahead. If our economy stands still or is on a plateau, then Pennsylvania stands still. This is, in a sense, a weathervane State, because if its basic industries are moving ahead, I think the future of this State will be assured. What we want for this State we want for our country, and what we want for our country, we want for the free world.', 'In the American Revolution of 1776, Thomas Paine said that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind. I think in this case the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. I think we have a great contribution to make, and I am satisfied that we are going to make it. I want it said not in November but in a later date in our history by 1965 or 1970, or 1975 or 1980, when the world begins to move in the direction of freedom that we have met the enemy and they are ours. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
182,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Mayor, Mayor Wagner of New York - why don't you stand up, Mayor [applause] - he wanted to see what a big city looks like. That is why he came to Lockport. Chairman Prendergast, Bob Richards, candidate for Congress, Mr. Mayor. I understand, Mr. Mayor, that you are a member of another active party in the United States. [Laughter.] I hope you won't feel I am abusing the hospitality of the city if I say a few good words on behalf of the Democratic Party. [Applause.]"", 'I am a candidate for the office of the Presidency, and I run for the office with a full recognition that the United States moves through very difficult times. I am sure Mr. Nixon would agree that there are no easy solutions to the difficult problems that the United States faces. I think one of the tendencies of all of us who are candidates and perhaps all of us who are voters, is to think of all of the issues between the parties in the traditional sense, and I do think that is valuable because it tells us something about the party. But the point I want to emphasize is that I think the problems that the United States is going to face in the next 10 years are entirely different than we have ever faced before. We are going to have the great problem of demonstrating to the world that a free society can work better than a Communist society. [Applause.]', 'We are going to have to show that not by our words but by our deeds. Mr. Castro and the head of the Ghana Government, the head of the new Laos Government, the head of the Chinese Communist Government, the head of the Russian Government, they believe in their system because they believe that their system represents the best opportunity to bring to the people the material things that they want. We believe our system is better for two reasons. First, because we believe that freedom can produce a better life for our people, and also because we believe that freedom is the way people want to live. We think people want to be free all over the world. [Applause.]', ""I think it is the next function of the next President and the next Congress, and the country, to try to develop policies which will demonstrate here in the United States that we have a vigorous and vital society, that we are able to maintain a defense second to none, that we are able to assist those countries that wish to follow on freedom's road, countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, who are going through now the same experience that we went through 100 or 150 years ago. I wish I could run for the Presidency saying that the only problems that will be before the American people are the problems that face the country here. But I run for the office of the Presidency with full recognition that as voters and as officeholders we must be concerned not only with what happens in this community, and this congressional district and this State and country, but also what happens in Africa and Asia, inside of men's minds in those countries, and what happens on the farther side of space."", ""It may be unfair - the burdens placed upon us may be too great. I don't think they are. I welcome the opportunity for the United States to demonstrate that it is a vigorous and vital society, that it can maintain its defenses, that it can build an educational system second to none, that it can maintain employment at a time when we are increasing our population, and when new machines are taking the jobs of men, that we can make productive use of our agricultural surpluses."", 'I said on television Monday night that 4 million Americans received food packages from the Government which are worth $6.25 a month for a family of 4. That adds up to 5 cents a day. Those are not just statistics. There are 125,000 to 150,000 people in West Virginia alone in this rich country who get that 5 cents worth of food every day. The reason is because machines have thrown men out of the coal industry.', ""Now in the 1960's in coal, in steel, in automobiles, in oil, in chemicals, in paper, in glass, we are going to meet the same problem. How can you find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years, which we are going to have to find if we are going to maintain full employment, at a time when 1 machine will do the job of 10 or 15 men 15 years ago."", ""I run for the Presidency with full recognition that the problems facing the next President of the United States are more complicated and more difficult and more burdensome than they have ever been in the past. How can a free society compete over a long period of time with a totalitarian society? That is the question which our generation of Americans is going to face. I must say I hope after this election that Mr. Khrushchev realizes that a new generation of Americans has taken the leadership, men who fought in Italy and in the Pacific and are not prepared to see freedom lose in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", ""I want to see in the next 10 years people around the world begin to wonder what the United States is doing, not merely what Mr. Khrushchev or Castro are doing, but what we are doing in this country, the most powerful and productive country in the world - a country which represents and stands for freedom. If we move ahead here, if we are first in space and first in defense and first in the things which catch people's imaginations, then I think we can demonstrate to the people of Latin America and Africa and Asia that they don't have to follow Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Castro, that they can come with us and meet their problems and also live in freedom."", ""We have a great cause with which we are identified, and whether I win or lose this election, I would hope that this election would give the American people an opportunity to make a judgment about the future, that we take a great movement forward in the 1960's, that we recognize that what we are doing now is good, but not good enough; that this a great country, but it is not great enough; that it is a powerful country that can be more powerful."", 'Mr. Nixon says that I downgrade the United States. I don\'t at all. But I give you just one figure to show how serious is our situation. Mr. Gallup, and I don\'t always agree with his polls, did take a poll in February of this year. In 10 countries scattered around the world, he asked them the single question, ""Do you believe by 1970 the United States or the Soviet Union will be first, militarily and scientifically?"" In every one of those countries a majority of the people thought that the Soviet Union would be first. Why? A country of one-half of our productive power, the most backward country of Europe 30 years ago, and yet the majority of the people around the world think that they will pass us in both of those areas in the next 10 years. That is why politicians on the make in Africa and Latin America begin to wonder whether Castro and Lumumba and Khrushchev may represent the way to the future. I think we do, but I don\'t think we are going to be prepared to meet it unless we are prepared to move ahead. My invitation to you is to join in building the prestige of the United States, in recognizing that we stand today on the razor edge of decision, and so does the world, and recognizing that if we succeed, we succeed not only for ourselves, but all those who look to us for leadership. I ask your help in this campaign. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon has said that party labels don't matter so much this year, that the question is the man. I think it is also the man and I think it is also the party. I think parties do stand for something. They ought to. Grover Cleveland, a Governor of New York as well as a President, said what good is a politician unless he stands for something and what good is a party unless it stands for something."", 'I want to make it very clear what we stand for in 1960. The Democratic Party stands for a stronger America; not strong if, but when or something, but strong this year, now, period. [Applause.] I want to make it very clear that I consider it to be a central responsibility of the man who is elected President of the United States on November 8, to send a message to the Congress in the first 3 months of his office which will request appropriations which will make us in 1961, 1962, and 1963 in a position to stand up to the Soviet Union or the Chinese Communists or anyone else who wishes to threaten our security. I think it is incumbent and I think it is primary, and I think it will provide us, and we can provide the kind of security that we need.', 'Secondly, I stand for full employment in the United States. [Applause.] There are more people out of work this August than at any time except for the two recessions. Here in this country you have seen it. I think that the Federal Government and the States and the companies have to devote themselves to the goal of providing work for men who want it, for men who need it, and providing work under good conditions. That has been the goal of the party that I represent since Woodrow Wilson, and it is the goal of the Democratic Party today.', ""I have served on the Labor Committees of the Congress for 14 years, and I have traveled in the last year to nearly every State in the Union. I have been to parts of New York and to West Virginia and Pennsylvania, and southern Illinois, and I think that it is a problem which is going to face the next President of the United States in the first 6 months. I don't think it is any secret for Mr. Khrushchev that the U.S. economy today is at a plateau, that our steel mills are working 50 percent, and I don't want to see the winter of 1961 slide as it did in the winter of 1958 and 1954 and 1949. This country cannot maintain its leadership unless our people are working and our machines are working."", 'The Soviet Union last week produced as much steel as the United States, and the reason, of course, is because our steel mills work 54 percent of their capacity. What affects the steel mills affects this country. If this country is moving ahead, if we have fiscal and monetary policies which stimulate employment, if we have a defense policy which provides not only protection for the United States but strength for our economy, if we provide security for our people, then I think we provide security for freedom.', ""My program is brief: that is to strengthen this country, because what we are in this country speaks far louder than what we say. If we are building a strong society here, and a strong economy, if we are providing work for our people, there isn't any question that we can outproduce any country in the world, that our security will be assured. We only fail when we don't measure up to our own potential. It is my policy, and I think the policy of the Democratic Party, and I think the policy of this country, to start this country moving again. That is the program to which we commit ourselves. I will be glad to answer any questions that anyone might have. [Applause.]"", 'Does anyone have a question?', '(Question from the audience inaudible.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was: ""Why are all the defense contracts going to California, to the west coast?""', 'They are going partly to Washington and partly to California. Of course, the west coast of the United States has great advantages in building the aircraft industry originally, No.1, and No.2, there were arguments at one time that they were in a more secure position than the east coast, particularly as the enemy was at one time in Europe. I think that defense contracts should be fairly distributed. I represent a section of the United States, New England, which has had the same problem that upper New York has had, defense contracts leaving, industries laying off, and we have begun to bring them back, particularly in electronics and in the Raytheon Co.', 'I think defense contracts should be fairly distributed across the Nation. I also support the reestablishment of the Defense Manpower Policy No.4, which was thrown out in 1952, which provided that those defense contracts would go to those areas which were able to meet the competitive price and had over 8 percent unemployment.', 'I think we can use defense contracts to strengthen the economy as well as strengthen the country. In any case, if we are successful, we will try to distribute defense contracts fairly so that it protects the United States and protects the economy. [Applause.]', 'I will say that parts of California have also been hard hit lately because of the transition from aircraft to missiles, and I think the decision on the B-70 which I supported I think would do something for the aircraft industry as well as provide us a lead in planes.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, can you tell us how you voted in 1957 on civil rights, particularly on section 3?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is: ""How did I vote in 1957 on the civil rights bill on section 3?""', 'Section 4 of the civil rights bill gave the Attorney General the right to institute suits in all parts of the country to protect the right to vote. Section 3 gave him the right to institute suits in order to protect all other constitutional rights with the exception of voting. I supported title 3 in 1957, and in 1960, and we were defeated in both cases. I would say we had about 33 Democrats supporting title 3 in 1957 and about 9 Republicans, and about the same figure in 1960, and we were defeated both times. I think title 3 ought to pass. [Applause]', 'Can I have one more question?', 'QUESTION. What are you going to do about the medical bill for the aged?', 'Senator KENNEDY. As you know, in the August session of Congress, we had a fight on this issue. The proposal that we put forward was to provide that medical care for the aged would be tied into the social security system. In other words, that during your working years you would contribute through the social security system, and then when you reached the age of retirement, 65, you would receive assistance in paying your medical bills. That program was brought to a vote in the U.S. Senate. We were defeated 44 to about 55. The Senate passed a bill which I consider to be wholly unsatisfactory, and it is a fact that the State of New York as well as other States have not supported or sustained the program which the Congress finally passed. On that vote, 44 Democrats voted ""aye"" and 1 Republican Senator voted ""aye."" I want to make it clear that in my judgment the only way you are going to protect the interest of the country, the only way you are going to be able to provide a program which pays for itself, the only way you are going to provide medical care for the aged, is through the social security system which has worked for 25 years. [Applause.]', 'Therefore, whether I am in the U.S. Senate next year or whether I hold the office of the Presidency, in my judgment the Congress and the President must pass a medical-aid bill through social security which I think represents the best hope for all of us. [Applause.] Especially as we are all aging very fast these days. [Laughter.]', 'Thank you very much for coming out. I appreciate it. [Applause.]']"
184,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Wagner, Mr. Prendergast, Arthur Levitt, Mr. Jordan, ladies and gentlemen I hope the mayor, who is a distinguished Republican, I understand [laughter] will not take my key away if I make a few unkind remarks about his party. [Applause.] I won't include him in them at all. [Laughter.]"", 'There is an old saying that you have not seen any falls until you have seen Niagara Falls. I hope they will also say that we have not seen any victory until we see the Democratic victory on November 8 this year.', '[Applause.]', 'Some of you who are here today are working on the power project, and I appreciate very much your coming over here during this period of time. I think your presence here, and I hope my presence here, indicates that we take this election seriously, and I think it is a serious election because the United States is moving in a serious time. I have never thought that the President of the United States was in difficulty. I have always thought that the United States, itself, faced serious problems and serious challenges. You cannot live in this country during the last 2 weeks and possibly feel reassured about the course of world events, and you cannot live in western New York and possibly feel confident that in the next 3, 4, and 5 years we are going to maintain the economic growth and full employment of this section of the State. [Applause.]', 'I think this State and this country have been made by people who were not satisfied.', 'Mr. Nixon has said that I am downgrading the United States. I am not at all. I could not possibly feel stronger about this country and about what it can do. But I think the Republicans have put limitations on what we can do. We want to upgrade the leadership. We want to made this country in a position of unmatched security, both at home and abroad.', ""I stand today as the Democratic nominee for the Office of the President, and where I stand other Americans have stood, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman [applause] and I stand for the things for which they stood. Mr. Nixon has said in recent weeks that party labels don't mean very much in 1960. Republicans say that every 4 years, but in the intervening 3 years they never do anything in the Congress which would make you think that party labels aren't important. [Applause.]"", ""During the August session of this Congress - I don't think a party label means anything unless the parties mean something, and I think the parties do mean something. I think the Republicans do stand for something. It is not what I stand for, but they do stand for something, and it is against these programs which I think are in the interest of the people of this country. We don't have to go back to Franklin Roosevelt, and we don't have to go back to Harry Truman."", 'We can go back to the August session of this Congress when there were three bills, which I think tell very well what the issues are in this campaign.', 'One was medical care for the aged tied to social security. Forty-four Democratic Senators supported it, only one Republican, and it is a fact that in the last 7 days the Governor of this State, a Republican, has attacked the program which was passed in this last session of the Congress, because it was not tied to social security. Everybody here pays social security, but everybody here when they retire can look forward to some assistance. If we can tie medical care to social security, then when we are retired, when we do reach the age of 65 for men or 62 for women, you do not have to worry about medical care. The fact of the matter is that older people in this country, and I am vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Aged, are hard hit by the problem of finding decent housing and paying for their medical bills.', 'Under the bill which the Congress passed, anybody before 65 who needs medical care who has $800 or $1,000 saved up must first spend that money, exhaust their savings, take an oath that they are needy, and then they will get some assistance. I believe the other way, and that is the way the Democratic Party favors it. [Applause.]', ""The second bill that was up and which is an issue in this campaign was a bill to provide $1.25 minimum wage. Four-fifths of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, including the Congressman of this district, who is chairman of the congressional committee for all Republicans, voted against the $1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week, not for a business which is only ten, fifteen, or twenty-five thousand dollars a year, but for a business which makes more than $1 million a year, we wanted to pay them $1.25 by 1962, not this year, but 1962, and to pay those that were not covered by 1964 $1.25, and four-fifths of the Republicans voted against it. I think these issues are important, not because the minimum wage is maybe the most important issue in the United States today, and not because medical care for the aged itself may be the most important issue, and not because aid to education itself may be the most important issue. I think the most important issue is the security of the United States and the peace of the world. But I don't think we are going to be secure, and I don't think we are going to maintain our freedom unless we are building in this country a strong society on all fronts. As long as there are 15 million American homes in the United States substandard, as long as there are 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States which lack plumbing of any kind, as long as 17 million Americans live on inadequate assistance when they get older, then I think we have unfinished business in this country. If we build a strong society here, we are strong abroad. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor to Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States. People around the world want the same things that we want. They want freedom, they want security for themselves and their families, they want opportunities and they want peace. If the United States stands for freedom as we do, if the United States is strong as we are and can be, if the United States is building a vigorous society and maintaining employment and solving its problems, then people in Latin America and Africa and Asia, faced with Castro's example or our example, will come with us. But if Castro stands for a movement forward, however abhorrent it is to us, and we stand still, then he raises the banner of revolt all over Latin America. We want for other people what we want for ourselves, and I think that is the most effective foreign policy that we can carry out. [Applause.]"", 'A hundred years ago during the election of 1860, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice. I see the storm is coming, but if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, when the issue is still freedom or slavery, the same issue Lincoln fought, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice. We see the storm coming, but I think if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
185,John F. Kennedy ,"September 28, 1960","['GIFFORD. Senator, first of all let me say thank you for taking the time from a very busy schedule to do this interview.', ""KENNEDY. You know that I'm glad to visit Louisiana by this method. I've visited it on many other occasions. I hope we're going to come back during the campaign."", ""GIFFORD. Well, do you think it's possible there will be a campaign appearance in Louisiana? There's been some talk there might not."", 'KENNEDY. I would hope there is going to be. I want to come to Louisiana very much.', 'GIFFORD. I see. What do your campaign people tell you about the Louisiana area? Do they think that it\'s dubious? Or do they think it\'s ""in the bag?"" Or just how do they feel?', ""KENNEDY. I think that they feel - I feel that every State in the Union this year is a close, hard-fought State. I think that's true of Louisiana, New York, California, Texas. It's going to be a tight election."", 'GIFFORD. You plan to have a hard-fought campaign, even down there?', ""KENNEDY. That's right."", ""GIFFORD. Senator, the Supreme Court recently ruled, you'll remember, that Florida and Texas owned their tidelands strip out to ten-and-a-half miles, and that Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama owned only 3 1/2. Now, a lot of people in Louisiana feel that this is unfair - that they're not getting an even break. Now, would you support legislation, as President, to equalize this situation?"", ""KENNEDY. Well, I think we ought to have equity in the area. I thought that the Congress had disposed of this matter; but, of course, then, the Republican Attorney-General, I think, instituted a suit against Louisiana; and therefore, the matter is still in question. I would consult with the Governor, and the two Senators, and the Members of Congress, and try to do what's the fair thing by Louisiana and the country. I think we would be able to work out a good solution."", 'GIFFORD. In other words, if legislation that you considered equitable were presented.', ""KENNEDY. That's right."", 'GIFFORD....you would undoubtedly sign it.', ""KENNEDY. That's correct."", ""GIFFORD. Would you consider yourself actively working for this, or would you simply take the position that, if it's presented, you would sign it?"", 'KENNEDY. Well, I would try to work for what I thought was an equitable solution, and I think that one which would recognize the very vital interest of Louisiana in this matter and also would recognize the public interest.', ""GIFFORD. Another question about oil, Senator Kennedy. A lot of oil men believe this 27 1/2 percent depletion allowance on oil is justified as a tax benefit because of the vitality of the oil industry to the national defense. Now, you're on record as being opposed to this allowance, are you not?"", ""KENNEDY. Well, no. What my position was when the matter came before the Senate, Senator Williams, who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee - in fact, if the Republicans carried the Senate, he would be the Chairman of the Finance Committee (which Senator Byrd now is) - offered an amendment to provide that it should be reduced across the board from 27 1/2 percent to 15. I voted against that. There was a substitute proposal which I supported, which provided that 90 percent of the producers would be protected with that 27 1/2 percent. For the largest producers, there would be a graduation down to 22 percent. I think it's a matter which we are going to have to look at and study. There are about a hundred and two or three depletions for different resources of the United States. We want a tax structure that is fair, that provides for renewed investigations of exploration to find new oil. The oil industry is having a very difficult time now competing against oil abroad. Texas and Louisiana, they're not producing full time. I'll support a tax level for oil and for other natural resources that stimulates investment and is fair, and I think we can work that out with the advice of the Ways and Means Committee. Senator Johnson has strong views on the matter, and I think we'll be able to get a solution which will be helpful."", ""GIFFORD. Well, definitely, then, the depletion allowance certainly wouldn't be abolished."", ""KENNEDY. No, no, not a bit. In fact, I think a case can be made for keeping it the way it is. I think it's a matter that we should look into."", 'GIFFORD. Senator Kennedy, many Southerners feel that the Democratic platform is rather extreme on the issue of civil rights, and in particular the suggestion that plans toward desegregation should be complete or in the works by 1963. Now, in your approach to this school--', ""KENNEDY. No, they said that each, as you recall, they said that each school district should have a plan. The Republican platform criticized that. They said that we're not talking about plans; we're talking about realities. We're not talking about 1963; we're talking about now. So they felt that that was too - not vigorous enough."", 'GIFFORD. I see. Well, do you feel that your position in this matter of school integration is moderate, or just how do you feel?', ""KENNEDY. Well, I think it's responsible. I think that most Americans agree that we ought to try to recognize that the Supreme Court decision is the law of the land. We ought to try to work out a solution which is equitable."", 'GIFFORD. Senator, the opposition forces to your own have been saying that on the religious issue that they feel that your side has been pushing it more than they have, so to speak.', ""KENNEDY. Where - what is the evidence for that? I haven't introduced the matter, except I said in my acceptance speech that I felt very strongly that this matter should not be an issue as I supported the Constitution, and unless I have been asked about it, I haven't commented on it for 2 months."", 'GIFFORD. In other words, you utterly deny this charge?', ""KENNEDY. I don't think we have to deny it. Do you think that I'm the one who's sending this material through the mail by the millions? Do you?"", 'GIFFORD. No, sir.', 'KENNEDY. No, well?', 'GIFFORD. Senator Smathers, who was in Louisiana recently on your behalf, more or less depicted the Kennedy-Johnson ticket as one that would take a moderate, even perhaps a conservative approach, to matters that would interest businessmen and Southerners. Now, do you think that the Democratic ticket could be described, at least in this respect, as more conservative than the Nixon-Lodge ticket.', ""KENNEDY. Well, I wouldn't attempt to make a comparison. All I say is that if you're going to be a successful President and have a successful administration, you have to try to develop an atmosphere in this country where business will flourish and will provide employment. If you don't have full employment in the United States, you don't have tax revenues, you can't carry on your Government, you can't provide for the defense, you can't have your people working and happy. And, therefore, who's ever President, Republicans or Democrats, we may disagree as to how this atmosphere should be developed, but I can tell you that, in my judgment, whoever is President is going to want good business conditions in the United States. That's just basic. You can't flourish without it. This country, it depends on the private enterprise system. So any businessman, I think, will find that whoever is President, that we want this economy of ours to move ahead. We want business to do well. We want people to be working. That's our basic objective. We're committed to full employment."", 'GIFFORD. Sir, for the people of Louisiana, we hear much talk about your vote in the ""civil rights"" business on the jury trial amendment. Would you explain how you voted and why you voted as you did?', ""KENNEDY. I voted for - to provide jury trial protection for people because I think that's a very basic civil right, and I think it provides protection for Americans against criminal charges which might otherwise have put them in jail without any recourse to a jury of their peers."", 'GIFFORD. Senator, Governor Jimmie Davis has not yet, at least, given any endorsement to you. What are your relations with him at this time?', ""KENNEDY. Well, I think that they're reasonable. I haven't talked to Governor Davis for some time, but the decision as to what he will do in this campaign, of course, is his."", 'GIFFORD. Are you hopeful that he will support you?', 'KENNEDY. Yes, I am.', 'GIFFORD. Have you had any contact at all with Governor Barnett of Mississippi, who is in favor of the unpledged elector plan.', ""KENNEDY. No, I haven't talked with Governor Barnett."", 'GIFFORD. I wonder how you feel about the unpledged elector plan. If you could just give us your--', 'KENNEDY. I prefer to have a delegate pledged to the Democratic ticket or the Republican ticket, but, of course, this is a decision which a State must make itself under the Constitution.', 'GIFFORD. Do you feel that this unpledged elector plan is really going to present any serious obstacles in the South?', ""KENNEDY. (Inaudible.) But, that's a decision which each State must reach. All I can do is run as a Democrat. We want their help. We want their support in this campaign. We'd like to have them associate with us as they have in the Democratic Party for 160 years. The South really kept the Democratic Party going in good times and bad times and many of the most important Members of the House and Senate in the Democratic Party are from the South - chairmen of committees, leaders of the House and Senate. We want the Democratic Party in the South to continue together. That's why I asked Senator Johnson of Texas to run as Vice President because I believe in a national party, not a sectional party, but a national party, representing the South, North, East and the West. That's where the Democrats are the strongest. So I'd like to have their help in this campaign. That goes for Louisiana, Mississippi, and these other States."", 'GIFFORD. Yours then, is a plea for unify in this regard.', ""KENNEDY. My plea is to sustain the Democratic Party as a national party. I think it means the most progress for the South. I don't think the Republicans have ever been particularly interested in the South. They were in the control for many, many years - almost a century up to Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt - and I don't think that their policies were noted for developing the industry in the South, increasing its economy, helping its transportation system, cleaning its rivers. I think we've done those things. I've been down on the Mississippi River and it runs through Mississippi and Louisiana. I know what the Democrats have done to provide navigation. What's true there is true in all parts of the South. I think the Democrats from the South, I hope, will stay together just like - because I think that's our strength as a Nation."", ""GIFFORD. Senator, this may seem like a rather parochial question, but down in Louisiana and in the home city of New Orleans, there's talk about our own Mayor Morrison, who's been working very hard for your ticket, being offered some sort of post in the Government, perhaps, if your campaign is successful. Would you comment on this?"", ""KENNEDY. Well, I've a high regard for him. I think what he's done in the city of New Orleans has been most impressive. The city problems are extremely difficult. I've never talked with anybody about what we ought to do if we win, because I think we ought to win first. The last candidate to make the mistake of assigning positions was Tom Dewey in 1948, so I think we ought to go ahead and try to do the best we can and let's wait and see after that. But I do have a high regard for Mayor Morrison."", ""GIFFORD. Senator, down in New Orleans, we're very interested in world trade. Our port is now ranked as the No.2 port of the Nation"", ""KENNEDY. It's been a source of regret to us in Boston that New Orleans has moved ahead, but, however"", 'GIFFORD. Ha, ha, ha, where does Boston stand now?', ""KENNEDY. We've dropped a little."", ""GIFFORD. Well, we're interested in world trade as I'm sure you folks in Boston are, too. Would you expect as President to promote freer trade in general?"", ""KENNEDY. Well, I'd certainly try to stimulate world trade. We can produce so much in the United States that the only way we can maintain our economy is to have an effective trade, not only with Europe, but also with Latin America and the Far East. I think the future of New Orleans is very bright. I've been really impressed every time I've visited there by the tremendous rise of industry and I think the next 10 years can really be bright years down there."", 'GIFFORD. What about a continued movement away from tariff barriers?', ""KENNEDY. Well, I think we want to make sure that no industry sustains too heavy a burden of imports. I'm concerned about textiles and glass. We want to make sure the trade flows; that no industry is wiped out because of excessive imports at low rates. But we had a very good trade year this year. I think we can do better in the future."", 'GIFFORD. Well, now we got into something just a minute ago about relations with South America. Could you tell us, in general, how you feel about this? Might you make some changes?', 'KENNEDY. Well, you know, I think we\'ve ignored Latin America up to the last few months. The last few months, because of the rise of Castro, we have begun to look at Latin America again. I think we should have looked at it before Castro came along. Latin America is basic to the security of the United States, and we gave more aid to Yugoslavia than we\'ve given to all of Latin America since the end of World War II up to the present time, so that I think we ought to look at Latin America. If Latin America is secure, and our friend, then we\'re secure. And this administration for the first 7 years almost ignored it completely. I think the problem of Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties there if we continue to turn our * * * and look to our problems in other sections of the world and ignore Latin America. I would think that the first job of the next President in foreign policy is reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Franklin Roosevelt\'s ""good neighbor"" policy.', 'GIFFORD. Well, we hope we see you down in Louisiana and you say you think the chances are good for this.', ""KENNEDY. I'm very hopeful we get to go there. I am very anxious to get down there."", ""GIFFORD. Well, I'm sure that most people in Louisiana are very anxious to see you, Senator. Thank you again for taking the time to do this interview."", 'KENNEDY. I appreciate it. Glad to have a chance to visit the State this way.', ""GIFFORD. We'll see you in New Orleans."", 'KENNEDY. Thank you.']"
186,John F. Kennedy ,"September 29, 1960","[""Tonight I want to talk about experience in foreign policy - not my experience, not my opponent's but America's experience."", 'I would discuss specifically the question of our experience over the last 12 months.', 'That question is highlighted by one dramatic fact: The head of the Soviet U.N. delegation, Mr. Khrushchev, who is being confined to Manhattan Island, is the same Mr. Khrushchev who 1 year ago was invited to visit the Nation and Camp David.', 'It is certainly the same Mr. Khrushchev. He represents the same Communist system - still dedicated to achieving world domination. He maintains the same objectives, the same views and essentially the same tactics.', 'It is we who have changed our tactics. We tried arguing with Mr. Khrushchev in a kitchen. We tried impressing him on a good will tour. We tried smiling at him in the spirit of Camp David. Now we are trying confining him to the island of Manhattan. But Mr. Khrushchev has not been impressed, deterred, or confined in his efforts to build a Communist empire.', 'The reason is that Mr. Khrushchev is not the enemy. He may personify it. His antics may dramatize it. But the real enemy is the Communist system itself, unyielding, uncompromising, and unchanging in its drive for world domination.', 'Standing up to Khrushchev in debate is not enough. What we must do is stand by and summon the strength of this Nation and the free world to advance the cause of peace.', 'Instead we have concentrated on standing up to Khrushchev - of answering his argument - or reacting to every crisis he creates. We have concentrated on his objectives - and forgotten our own. When he grins we invite him to Camp David. When he growls we restrict him to Manhattan. But our responsibility, whether he grins or growls, is to pay more attention to our objectives and those of other free nations.', 'I am tired of reading every morning what Mr. Khrushchev is doing, or what Mr. Castro is doing. I want to read what the President of the United States is doing.', 'We have great political and economic assets in this country, and the Communists know it. We are the original champions of independence. We initiated the Marshall plan and Point Four. We are the strongest Nation on earth today. And, because the Communists know it, they have succeeded in tying us up in one trouble spot after another - on their own terms, and in areas of their own choosing - and in this way preventing us from using our strength to advance freedom throughout the world.', 'We have been hypnotized by the glare of the headlights from the oncoming car instead of looking at the road ahead.', 'While we are busy in our backyard, we can do nothing in theirs. While we talk to the underdeveloped countries about the evils of communism, the Soviets talk to them about the evils of hunger and poverty and disease. I think we can do better.', 'Consider, for example, the year that has passed since Mr. Khrushchev\'s last visit - the year between the spirit of Camp David and the spirit of Manhattan Island. One year ago this week - when I warned at Rochester that his visit was ""cause for redoubled efforts, not relaxation.""', 'When I said that ""the real test of Mr. Khrushchev\'s (intentions) * * * will be his deeds, not his words"" - some resented by dampening of their hopes. Mr. Nixon had hailed the prospects for peace developing from this ""mutual respect"" between leaders. Others had envisioned the cold war actually ending - as we all wished it would.', 'But now 1 year has come and gone. The spirit of Camp David has gone. The mutual respect has gone. Our hopes for an end to the cold war have gone.', 'And what of the six areas of hope and potential agreement that featured the Camp David talks? - the summit meeting was a fiasco, and our President was insulted in a manner every American resented.', ""The President's trip to Russia was abruptly canceled by his hosts, who have no hesitation in coming here, uninvited and unwanted, to carry the cold war to the U.N. meeting in New York."", 'The Berlin crisis is worse instead of better.', 'The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as ever.', 'The talks on disarmament have been called off.', 'And, finally, instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension, the Soviets have stepped up their efforts to create disorder, danger and division. They have established an Iron Curtain outpost only 90 miles from our shores in the once friendly nation of Cuba. They have, for the first time, extended their sphere of influence into Africa. They have threatened the stability of the free but tiny Nation of Laos in southeast Asia-infiltrated the extremist movement in Nigeria, making a solution of that difficult problem even more difficult - and stepped up their use of funds, arms, technicians, and propaganda in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries.', ""They have exploited anti-American sentiments in Japan so successfully that the President's visit had to be canceled. They have made a world spectacle over the U-2 flight and their trial of our pilot - they have treated this Nation with open hostility and contempt in seizing the crew of the RB-47. And finally, they have sought to increase their prestige and influence in the U.N.; and, failing that, to make it impotent and ineffective."", 'All this they have done in a year - in the year of the Camp David spirit. And what has the United States been doing in the same year?', 'We have frustrated congressional attempts to develop more missiles, to harden our missile bases, to increase our defenses against Russia\'s powerful submarine fleet. We have failed to propose a consistent, comprehensive, and workable plan for disarmament, based on careful preparation and technical studies. And we have been repeatedly reassured by Mr. Nixon - in glowing, sugar-coated terms - that we have nothing to worry about in arms, science, or space - that we have achieved peace without surrender - that statistics showing the Russian economy expanding faster than ours can be dismissed as mere ""growthmanship"" - and that the anti-American riots in Latin America and Japan were actually indications that the Communists were afraid to face us.', ""If you are satisfied with those assurances - if you feel that we are doing all we can do to advance the cause of freedom, by building long-term strength instead of moving from crisis to crisis - then Mr. Nixon's experience is what you should send to the White House. But if you are concerned with the Republican tendency to react instead of act - to become preoccupied with only responding to communism instead of also advancing freedom - then I suggest you consider more closely the foreign policy experience of their presidential nominee."", 'He has, as he frequently points out, had an opportunity to travel widely. He has had an opportunity to study the long-range needs of each area - to recommend new policies for the administration - and to see that those recommendations are properly carried out. What has been the result?', 'Today, in six key areas around the world, we are reacting too late to a cold war crisis where the cause of freedom is in serious trouble; in Cuba, where Communists openly plot the disruption of hemispheric security - in Ghana, whose President was assailed by Mr. Herter last week as ""very definitely leaning toward the Soviet bloc"" - in Japan, where the anti-American demonstrations have already been mentioned - in the area once known as Indochina, where the tiny nation of Laos is struggling to keep its head above a Communist tide - in Poland, where the once hopeful cracks in the Iron Curtain seem to be gradually disappearing - and in India, where the one nation capable of surpassing China for the economic leadership of the Asian continent is meeting one setback after another.', 'These six areas are far apart in their geography, their history, their devotion to freedom and the kind of threat their situations now pose. But they all share two features in common:', '(1) First in each case, early action by this Nation or the West - before the Communist threat reached its present state - might well have gone a long way toward strengthening the forces of freedom within that country.', '(2) Secondly, also before the threat reaches that stage, each of these areas had been visited by Mr. Richard Nixon.', ""Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958, after Mr. Nixon was there, instead of now at the point of Mr. Castro's gun?"", 'Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955, in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana news conference ""the competence and stability"" of the Batista dictatorship?', ""Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African diplomatic posts and scholarships? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo and practically none to other French and Belgian colonies which have since reached independence. But now, when the situation becomes desperate, we are taking a new interest in the education of their future leaders - an education, however, which takes time and should have been started in 1957, following Mr. Nixon's trip to Ghana."", 'Why did we fail to realize the situation in Laos - in India - in Japan - in Poland and other areas of the world - before the crisis developed? Mr. Nixon was there - presumably he saw what was going on - presumably he made recommendations. But it is apparently an unfortunate fact that for all these years a trip by Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Mikoyan has had a far greater effect on our foreign policy than a trip by Mr. Nixon.', 'The facts of the matter are that trips and tours are not enough. Words and debates are not enough. Slogans about peace are not enough.', 'For peace takes more than talk, more than experience, more even than effort. It also requires foresight.', 'The next administration - in addition to meeting our present commitments and facing up to the crises already mentioned - must look ahead to all the new problems just over the horizon:', '\n  The spread of nuclear weapons to several nations, drastically altering the world balance of power and sharply increasing the chances of accidental war;', 'The emergency of Red China as a nuclear power, dedicated to the proposition of victory through war, and differing with the Soviets as to the pursuit of their ambitions;', 'The possibilities of new cracks in the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe, new Communist moves in Africa, new East German pressure on Berlin, and new voting blocs in the U.N.;', 'The possibilities of a new step to integrate the economy of Europe or the markets of Latin America.', 'We need to plan for such developments before they happen. We need to foresee that they are going to happen. We need to recognize the revolutionary tempo of the world in which we live - if we are to strengthen this country - our arms, our diplomacy, our economy and our sense of purpose - and strengthen the cause of freedom around the world. We cannot be complacent with things as they are. We cannot be satisfied to drift, to rest our oars, to glide over our shortcomings.', 'In 1939, I saw in Europe what happened to those lulled into a complacent sleep by leaders who talked of peace instead of building for it. And when France fell to the Nazis, one of its most illustrious leaders declared:', '\n  Our spirit of enjoyment was greater than our spirit of sacrifice. We wanted to have * * * more than we wanted to give. We spared effort, and we met disaster.\n', 'I run for the Presidency in 1960 in the conviction that the people of this country are willing to sacrifice - to give - to spare no effort.

187,John F. Kennedy ,"September 29, 1960","['QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, you mentioned in your debate Hoffa. Could you tell America that you are for the laboring people and not against all union labor?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I don't consider Mr. Hoffa a labor leader. I consider him a special case. [Applause.] I have served on the labor committees of the Congress for 14 years. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor. I have been endorsed by the AFL-CIO nationally. I believe in the objectives of sound, responsible, and honest union movements. I also believe that the continued presence of Mr. Hoffa is most unfortunate for the labor movement and the country. I find it extremely interesting that he is now traveling around the United States asking for my defeat. I would like to know what the question is now going to be before the American people. I think that Mr. Hoffa should go. The Teamsters Union is the largest in the United States [applause] - the Teamsters Union is the largest in the United States and it has a good many men and women - men in it that I know extremely well in my own State and around the country. I think they are just as desirous of having an honest union as any other union group in the United States. I think a change of leadership is what is needed. But I would not use the name of Hoffa to tar the reputation of other union leaders and members who are trying to represent their members and do the best they can for their members in the country. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Tom McSpeden. I come from Yonkers. I am a salesman for Coty Bros. I have an entirely different question to ask tonight, and I think an awful lot of people in this room are interested. That is this: Are you hoping it is a boy? [Laughter.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, as a matter of fact, I am flying home tonight to try to find an answer to that question. [Laughter.] But actually, I have a daughter, and I know it sounds terrible and treasonous, but I don't really mind having another daughter again if that is the way it goes. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Mrs. Emmett DuKatt, from Plattsburgh, N.Y. After your debate the other night, I had a strong discussion with a Republican and he said that you quoted that your proposals for the medical - he said your proposals for the medical care for the aged does not quite give the people a choice, and that Nixon does. How should I answer him?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, here is the choice that is given to them. The choice is really to get no assistance, in my opinion. The Governor of this State rejected the program which Mr. Nixon himself advocated as well as the bill which passed the Congress. In the bill that passed the Congress, if you want to get medical care and you are over 65, and you have saved $800, and your husband gets sick and needs attention, you first have to spend the $800, your life savings, and then take what amounts to a pauper's oath that you are an indigent case, and then you can get some assistance. That means that if you then recover and live longer your savings are gone and you live on public assistance."", 'Now, our proposal is based on the social security system which has served the people for many years. Every one would contribute through social security so that when they do retire, 65 for men and 62 for women, that they shall then receive assistance in paying their medical compensation. I think that this is the soundest system. The same arguments that are used against our proposal were used against the Social Security Act in 1935, and I think the people of the United States are going to make a judgment in November that this proposal is fiscally sound, that it is morally sound, that it is responsible, that it meets a great need. There are 9 million Americans who live on less than $1,000 a year, and who live in inadequate housing. Their diets in many cases are inadequate, and if they get ill, they have to turn to charity or to public assistance for relief. I think they want to contribute during their working years and pay their own way and I think our system is the best. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Walter Butler, and I am a labor representative. A good many of our membership are very much concerned about the growth of unemployment throughout this State and throughout the Nation. I wonder if you might in a few words explain what your program will be when you become the President of the United States concerning this problem.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I traveled through some areas of New York today which have been hard hit by technological changes and by industries leaving, Amsterdam and Troy and two or three other areas, and I think it is a problem in many sections of the United States, parts of my own State, West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania, parts of southern Illinois, parts of Kentucky. The problem is twofold. First, there is the slowdown which is now taking place in our economy generally, which causes only 50 percent steel capacity to be used. The Soviet Union produced as much as we did last week because we are only using 50 percent of the capacity we have, and over 100,000 steelworkers are out of work and others are part time. So it is generally due to the fact that there has been a slowdown in our economy, partly brought on certainly by a fiscal and monetary policy which has featured high interest rates, which helped contribute to the severity of the recession in 1954 and the one we had in 1958, and I think it has helped slow down business in 1960. So I would say first as to the general national slowdown in our economy, which has brought 4 1/2 million people out of work and about 3 million working part time, and the second is the so-called distressed areas, where unemployment is 6 percent, for a year or 2 years. Even if the economy picks up, they are still faced with serious problems, and I think the best thing for them is the area redevelopment bill, which has passed the Congress twice and has been vetoed twice. I was the floor manager the first time it passed. You cannot expect these communities, the industries of which have left, to possibly rebuild themselves unless they can get some capital at low rates of interest, unless they can get some pure water so that the industry can he attracted, vocational retraining so that workers can be trained for additional work, reestablishment of Defense Manpower Policy No. 4 - I think all those programs are in the public interest and I hope we can pass it again in January and I hope we have a President who will sign it. [Applause.]', ""QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Joseph C. Mann, College of Education, Brooklyn, N.Y. Will you explain why Federal support for teachers' salaries would not lead to Federal control?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. There was quite a discussion on this Monday night on the television. Mr. Nixon had voted against it, had cast the deciding vote against the Federal aid for teachers' salaries, and I think that vote was a mistake. As I said on Monday night, and as he pointed out at some length, he feels that direct Federal appropriation for teachers' salaries could lead to Government control. The point is, of course, that the bill which came before us in February on which he voted was a bill which would have given the money directly to the States on a per capita basis. The State then could make its judgment as to whether the money would go into Federal aid for school construction or would go into teachers' salaries or go into both. Therefore, it was up to the State. The State sets the salary level or the local school district does, the State decides how the money shall be distributed, the State decides whether it shall go into one program or the other. So there is no more Federal control in that than there has been in the Hill-Burton Act which has built so many of our hospitals. So I would say in answer to your question that I would consider the argument to the bill which came in the Senate to be somewhat of a mirage. I think he is opposed to the Federal aid for teachers' salaries, but I don't think there was Federal control involved, and I think it is unfortunate that the bill was defeated. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Ralph Weber, Madison County Democratic chairman. In the debate Monday evening Vice President Nixon stated it would cost several billion dollars to enact the Democratic program causing higher taxes. Is this true?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, it is untrue. The figure was used that he had personally calculated the Democratic platform and it ranged between $12.3 billion and $15 billion, or some such figure. There is no such basis for that. I stated on the program on Monday night that I supported a balanced budget. In my judgment the only reason to unbalance the budget would be if there was a severe national emergency requiring a crash program for defense, or, secondly, if there was serious unemployment requiring expenditures in order to stimulate employment. It is an interesting fact that the largest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States was not in Franklin Roosevelt's administration and not in Harry Truman's administration. The largest was in 1958, when due to the recession, tax revenues dropped and we had a $12 billion deficit. I believe that the present tax level, except as taxes may be rewritten in order to prevent loop-holes, the present tax level is sufficient to provide the income to maintain our programs and the programs we are now discussing, particularly if we have a normal rate of growth. When we talk about medical care for the aged under social security, we are talking about a program that provides a balanced appropriation for the demand. The program which was passed in the Congress which the President signed would have cost the States and the Government $1.2 billion a year. Secondly, our program for agriculture would require less appropriations by the Government because it hopes to bring supply and demand into balance. And we now have $9 billion of surplus food stored away, most of which has been appropriated for in the last 8 years. The present Secretary of Agriculture has spent more money than all the Secretaries of Agriculture in history, in the last 8 years. Thirdly, I cannot believe that there is not some money that can be saved in the Pentagon. I was chairman of a Subcommittee on Reorganization that passed 30 bills dealing with purchasing. There is not any doubt in my mind at all that you are spending $32 billion and not getting as much of a bang for your buck as you could by control over effective expenditures. [Applause.]"", ""That same argument was used against every program of Franklin Roosevelt and Truman and the country came through, survived, grew, and prospered, and I think that those arguments which are used against the programs which are fiscally sound, which stimulate the economy - and I don't know any President of the United States who does not want to see sound fiscal policy. No President, no Governor of any State, wants to do anything to risk the stability of the dollar in his own State or the United States, and as a Democrat and Republican with the problems that the United States faces, I am just as anxious as Mr. Nixon. But I don't think it is possible to move, and I don't like to see the same old arguments used which attempted to block the minimum wage, social security, housing, the Securities and Exchange Commission and all the rest, programs which now everybody is for, and the same arguments used 25 years ago. I would like to hear some new arguments. [Applause.]"", ""I express my thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, again. You have been extremely generous, as I said at the beginning of the program. There isn't any doubt that I would not have been nominated for the Presidency and would not now be traveling 28 hours a day if it had not been that you gave me a portion of the needed time. So I am most indebted. I think the best response I can make to you is to campaign as hard as I can on the issues which face us, so that the American people can have a clear choice November 8 between not only Mr. Nixon and myself but between our two parties and the things for which they want. I hope to repay you by doing the best I can, and I think we have a chance to win. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"

[Laughter.] I don't know how much work is being done in the city of Albany this morning, but I do appreciate very much your generosity in coming out, and the mayor's. [Applause.]"", 'One hundred sixty-five years ago Thomas Jefferson and James Madison came up the Hudson River near here searching for butterflies and fish, and then sailed down the Hudson River, met with some New York Democrats and formed the National Democratic Party, the union between the rural United States and the cities of the United States, which has lasted 165 years. [Applause.]', 'I do not come here this morning chasing butterflies. I come here asking your help in this campaign. I come here asking your support. [Applause.] I stand where three distinguished Governors of the State of New York have stood, Theodore Roosevelt, Al Smith, and Franklin Roosevelt, as candidates for the office of the Presidency. [Applause].', 'Theodore Roosevelt was a man of such understanding and such comprehension of the force of events that ultimately he left the Republican Party or it left him. But Al Smith stood here on these steps and accepted the nomination in 1928. I do not believe this is 1928. I believe this is 1932 and 1948, and I think the Democrats can win this election here in the State of New York. [Applause.]', 'The first American to ever sail to and open up the China trade was a Captain Dean, whose street is named after him, Dean Street, and after he had gone to China and brought back a good many goods, the American paper here in this city had written that he had given an exalted idea of the United States to the people of the world. It seems to me that in 1960 that is our function, to give an exalted idea of the United States to the world, even more importantly to give an exalted idea of freedom to the world. There have been suggestions that during the United Nations meeting that the debates of this election should be stilled. I hold a different view. I do not believe there is a more valuable exposition of the vitality of freedom to Mr. Khrushchev and Gromyko than it is to see the United States involved in a great free election, to have an opportunity to make a freedom of choice, to have the issues presented honestly to the American people, so that they can make their judgment on November 8.', ""I think this is a serious election, in many ways the most serious in many years of this country's long history. The issue is the same as it has been for many years. How can the United States maintain its freedom? How can it live in peace, how can it maintain its security, how can it hold out a helping hand to those countries to the south of us who stand today on the razor edge of decision, trying to determine which road they shall take? I believe that the responsibility of our generation of Americans is to build a society here in this country so vital, so vigorous, so effective, that it serves as an example to the world, that it serves as an example to those who wish to decide which road they shall take. I think by the end of the next President's administration the balance of power in the world will begin to change more or less in one direction or another. We have seen in the last 3 or 4 years where several countries, once independent, have now passed into the Communist orbit. The question is how many more in 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964. How many more in 1965, 1966, and 1967 will begin to move in the direction of the Communist orbit or begin to move in the direction of freedom?"", 'We do not sit here on a stage watching a slow glacial like movement in history. I think these movements may take place in 5, 10, or 15 years. We have seen since 1945 enemies become friends, and friends become enemies. The world is moving faster than it ever moved before, and therefore we are settling one of the great issues of history, whether the Communist system will be successful in its charge to dominate the world, or whether freedom will spread.', 'It is an old struggle but it has a new form, and I think in the next 10 years or the next 15 years, in the lifetime of nearly everyone here, we will see an entirely different world picture than we see today. We will either see freedom on the ascendancy around the world, or other countries of Latin America and Africa and Asia will begin to move in the direction of China and Russia. And, therefore, I think it incumbent upon us to concern ourselves with the problems in New York, with the problems here in the United States, so that we build a stronger society, so that what we are speaks louder than what we say.', 'But we should also frame every action with reference to the world around us. The security of the United States is the basic responsibility now before us, and in my judgment that security can be maintained by the United States once more standing as an example to all mankind.', ""I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Foreign Relations Committee, and every African nationalist 20 or 25 or 30 years ago quoted Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Now many of them quote Marx: many of them are Marxist if not Communists. Many of them believe that that represents the way of the future. What has happened to the vitality of the United States that they should feel that history moves in the direction of the most reactionary system of government ever devised? Why is it that we who represent the final flowering of the human experience in self-government should be regarded as a tired country, as a country which has seen its best days? I don't hold that view. think our high noon is yet to come. But I think if we devote ourselves to the public interest, if we are willing to bear the burdens which go with self-government and the maintenance of freedom in a country such as the United States, if we say that we will have a defense second to none, if we concentrate ourselves on building our economy so that we are the No.1 productive power in the world and maintain that position, if we provide equality of opportunity for our citizens, regardless of their religion and regardless of their race, then what we will be will speak far louder than what the Communists say we are. I think that is the responsibility of this generation of Americans."", 'Franklin Roosevelt early in his administration said that ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" I think they met that rendezvous. I am asking this generation of Americans in 1960 to do the same, to do in its time what those generations before us did, to maintain freedom and serve as an example and a bright light to the world around us. That is our opportunity, and I think that is our destiny. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

But like most illnesses, it should have been prevented; and it can be cured.', 'Economic arteriosclerosis has been allowed to slow down and cripple scores of communities that once ranked as economic pacesetters in the Nation. These communities pioneered in textile production, in railway development, in better education, and in better working conditions.

[Applause.]', 'Amsterdam, N.Y. and Boston, Mass., have many things in common. They are among the oldest cities of the United States, and like all old cities, they meet the same problems which come with maturity, with age. Our responsibility, those of us who live in the urban centers of the United States, is to try to rebuild our cities and their economies so that they can serve as a place of vitality in the economic life of the United States. We are an old section of the United States, you who live along the Mohawk River or along the ocean in Massachusetts. Senator Green, who represents Rhode Island in the U.S. Senate, was 12 years old when General Custer was slain in Montana. That is how young America is. That is how young the West is. That is how old we are. If we are going to maintain our economic position, if we are going to prevent our factories from leaving us for other Sections of the United States, sections which have great natural resources, which have iron, gas and oil underground, and coal - we have no natural resources in the soil of the Northeast United States - the only resources we have is the skill of our people - I believe it incumbent upon the next President of the United States and the next administration to join together with those who fight for the rebuilding of our American economy, especially in those areas which have been hard hit, and Amsterdam, N.Y., is one of them. Lawrence, Mass., is another. And the reason is the same in both cases. In Lawrence, Mass., we lost our cotton and worsted textiles, in Amsterdam you lost carpets and some textiles. They moved to other sections of the United States.', 'How are we going to maintain our employment? Part of it requires, of course, local effort. We have rebuilt Lawrence, Mass., partly by bringing Raytheon in there, partly by concentrating on electronics, and partly by using the skills of our universities and colleges for new research work. So part of it requires a local effort and part of it requires a State effort and part of it requires a national effort.', 'I believe the next President of the United States should sign the following bills, and if I am elected I will do so:', '1. The area distress bill, a bill which put the credit and power and vigor of the economy of the Federal Government in those areas where unemployment is higher than 7 or 8 percent for a long period of time. In other words, the Federal Government will loan its credit to businesses that wish to come to areas such as this, will provide vocational retraining for older workers, provide supplemental unemployment compensation benefits for those who are out of work for a long time, will aid in cleansing the rivers, will aid in trying to bring new industry into this area. We will, if we pass defense manpower policy No.4 again, steer defense contracts into those areas with a high level of unemployment.', ""2. I think the President and the administration and the Government and the State government and the city should join together in cleaning our polluted rivers. They are a great national asset. But if you are going to bring industry in here which is going to use fresh, clean water, they can't use the river as it is today. The administration vetoed the distressed area bill; the have vetoed the polluted river bill last year. Our rivers belong to the people who live along them and belong to the people who come after us. I live on the most polluted river in the United States, the most polluted river in the world west of the Ganges - the Potomac in Washington, the Potomac River in Washington. But these rivers in the New York area are not so clean and we have to do a better job of maintaining them if you are going to bring industry in that needs fresh water."", ""3. I think this administration should pass a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour. [Applause.] The Vice President of the United States on Monday night's television show said that the $1.25 an hour was extreme, $1.25 an hour being $50 a week. You will get that under the bill which was considered extreme in 1960. What is extreme about that? I want somebody in the Senate or the House to live on $1.25 at a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics says a single woman to even survive in an urban center of the United States, it costs her $52 a week. Yet the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States is 64 cents an hour, and for a 48-hour week."", 'I believe in $1.25 minimum wage, and I think the next Congress should pass it.

I am concerned about these cities of the United States because I think the problems that urban centers have faced, such as Amsterdam and my own city, are really one of the undiscussed problems that face the United States today. Housing, transportation, water, fresh air, space, schools, libraries, hospitals - these are all public resources, public facilities, which are essential to the development of an orderly society. And I think the Democratic Party looks ahead. I come here as a Democrat. Mr. Nixon says it doesn't really make much difference which party you belong to. I am not going to let him run away from the Republican record on social security, minimum wage, housing, civil rights, and the rest.

But the security of this city, its maintenance, its economic prosperity, are matters of continuing interest to the people of this area and of the United States. Schenectady will rise or fall, the economy of this area of the State of New York will prosper or decline, not merely on what you may do or this community, but also on what economic policies are pursued by our Government which stimulates business as a whole.', ""This community, like the cities of my own State, Massachusetts, can fight against recession. They can build their own economies. They can try to bring business in here. But if there isn't business growing in all parts of the United States, every effort which Schenectady may make, or the city of Lawrence, Mass., or a city in Illinois may make, isn't enough. If there isn't enough to go around, no city of the United States can rebuild itself by its own effort. It requires the cooperative effort of the people of this city, of labor and management, and of economic policies which stimulate our economy carried on by the Federal Government. It is a joint effort by us all if we are going to bring the tide up. [Applause.]"", 'One of the problems which now affects us is the fact that we have this tremendous industrial capacity in the United States which has been stimulated by automation, which has been stimulated by great capital investments in the last 10 years, and the question is, can we consume in this country and around the world all that we can produce. If we can, we can maintain full employment. If we cannot, we will have layoffs, and it is a somber economic fact that in the United States in 1960, only 2 years after the recession of 1958, we are using only 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills. Steel is basic to the economy of the United States. If steel is down, then the economy of the United States is on a plateau. Therefore, I consider the most serious domestic problem facing the next administration is to reverse the decline in agricultural income and also the maintenance of full employment in the United States. That will be a problem that will affect the administration of the next President in the first 6 months.', ""Some of the things that I think we can do: First, I think we can carry on a monetary and fiscal policy that stimulates our economy. I don't think that there is any doubt that the high interest rate policy followed by this administration intensified the recession of 1958, and also I think has had a deleterious effect on the economy in 1960."", 'I think the failure of the Congress and the administration to agree on an area redevelopment bill, which would be of particular benefit in attracting new industry into communities like Schenectady, I think it is most unfortunate. Both parties talk about it and it is a fact that twice we passed it in the Congress and twice it has been vetoed. I think that the administration and the Congress in January 1961 should pass an area redevelopment bill, because otherwise, even if you build the economy of the country as a unit, you are going to find areas which, because of technological changes, because of changes in the use of raw materials, or for one reason or another, will be left aside and there are over 150 of those communities in the United States today.', 'You know all about that in this section of New York. Therefore, I think the passage of the area redevelopment bill will be of the greatest possible help. In addition, I think we have to develop our natural resources. I mention all of these things, not because I think the Federal Government has the answer to all of these problems, but because I think there is a proper function for individual effort, for community government, for State government, and for National Government, and unless each group is meeting its responsibilities toward the community as a whole and toward the country, this country does not go ahead.', 'Mr. Nixon says I want to centralize everything. I have no desire to do so. I was the chairman of the Governmental Reorganization Committee which put over 30 of the Hoover Commission recommendations through the Congress in 1954 and 1955, but I do believe in effective government, and I do believe that there is a governmental policy now that affects all of our lives, education, economic and fiscal policy, foreign trade, our goals, all the rest - every phase of our national life and personal life is touched by personal policy. When you buy a house, the interest rates you pay on that house - all are affected by national policy. I want to make that national policy more effective. I want to make it more constructive. I think we can do a better job than has been done in recent years. [Applause.]', 'The old city of Schenectady, as all of you know, was wiped out by an Indian massacre early in its history. What is interesting and remarkable about it was that the settlers in Schenectady knew about the coming Indian attack over 2 years in advance. In fact, in the summer before, they made preparations for resisting it, but they did not believe it would come in the winter. Therefore, they laid down in the winter and the attack came and they were wiped out.', ""I don't say history repeats itself, but I do think there is a somber lesson in history, and that is that those who feel that they are secure, those who are not willing to work in the summer and in the winter, those who are not willing to prepare themselves for hard days ahead, have suffered in history the inevitable result. This is a difficult time. I think the United States is going to pass more difficult times in 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964. The next President of the United States is going to have to meet a crisis in Berlin, in the early days of his administration. He is going to have to meet a position in the Formosa Straits with an increasingly dangerous and belligerent Chinese Communist government. I think the job of the next President will be more difficult, more burdensome, more responsible than it has been in any administration since the time of Lincoln. But in the last 4 years I have traveled to every State in the Union, and I have visited every part of this country, and I have the greatest possible confidence in it. We have a productive strength which is unequaled. We have a form of government which every person in the world around us would most like to live under, given their free choice. We represent, in my judgment, the way of the future. I do not regard us as an extinct flowering of human experience. I regard us as the place where everyone ultimately wants to be. And if there is any lesson of the last 10 years in history, it is in Eastern Europe and in Africa, the same force has been at work, in Eastern Europe against the Communists, in Africa against the Western colonial powers, and what is it? The desire to be free and independent. This is the greatest and most heartening event in world history. It shows that ultimately the Communist experiment is bound to fail, because these people are not determined to gain their freedom in order to lose it. What I think is important for us is to associate ourselves with that great historical movement. I think in the last decade the United States has lost its image around the world as a friend of freedom. We have often allied ourselves with dictatorships which are on the way out. I think we should raise the standard of freedom as we always did."", 'Thomas Jefferson said the disease of liberty is catching. I think it is catching in our time and I want it to spread the world over. Our function is to maintain its vitality here, maintain our example here, so that as it starts to spread throughout the world, we will be the nucleus of a great army of people the globe around who desire to follow the same road we follow.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I think we can win it here in the State of New York. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.] Stick with O'Brien and Kennedy. We want you to go all the way with us. [Applause.]"", 'I want to express my thanks to all of you. I run for the office of the Presidency in a difficult time. About 15 miles from here the independence of the United States was saved at the Battle of Saratoga. Now, as every generation of Americans has had its responsibility to maintain freedom in its time, I think the most serious challenge comes in our generation. Here in the United States we are defending not only ourselves, but we also defend the case of freedom. If we build a strong and vital country here, we affect not only our own independence and those directly allied with us; we also affect the security of all those who wish to follow in the same road that we take. Therefore, I think this generation of Americans has special responsibilities and special obligations. My own feeling is that it is incumbent upon us to build a strong and vigorous economic society here in the United States. If we are maintaining full employment, if we are using our productive capacity to the fullest, if we are building a better society here, then it reflects itself around the globe.', 'I think our obligation is to concern ourselves with our country here, and then hold out the hand of friendship to all those who wish to follow on our road. [Applause.]', ""I think that in the administration of the next President of the United States, particularly if he is reelected, we will begin to see the world move, either in the direction of freedom or in the direction of Russia and China, and I think this decision can be made in the next 10 years. I think it is possible for us to reestablish ourselves as a strong and vital country, to demonstrate that our capacity for leadership is still unfilled, to show the people of Africa and Latin America and Asia, who look at Mr. Khrushchev now and look at Castro, and wonder whether they represent the new way to the future. I don't believe they do. I think we do. But I think it is up to us to demonstrate that we have vitality. I think the people of the world should wonder what the President of the United States is doing, not what Mr. Khrushchev is doing. [Applause.)"", 'So I come here to Troy and ask your support. The name of Troy goes back in history. Therefore, in this city you connect the old with the new but the cause is still the same, the maintenance of freedom, the maintenance of self-government, at a time when it is under far more serious challenges than the city of ancient Troy ever faced. I come to Troy and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.] Does anybody have any questions for 1 or 2 minutes, and then we will proceed on', 'Thank you very much.', 'Robert Frost from nearby Vermont once wrote a poem which I will paraphrase:', '\n  ""I will hitch my wagon to a mule\n  For I have promises to keep\n  And miles to go before I sleep.""\n', 'Thank you.

I'm going to talk about experience. Not Ted Williams', not my opponent's; but the experience during the last 12 months of the United States."", 'That question is highlighted by one dramatic fact: the head of the Soviet U.N. delegation, Mr. Khrushchev, who is being confined now to Manhattan Island, is the same Mr. Khrushchev who a year ago was invited to Camp David.', 'It is certainly the same Mr. Khrushchev. He represents the same Communist system - still dedicated to achieving world domination. He maintains the same objectives, the same views and essentially the same tactics.', 'It is we who have changed our tactics. We tried arguing with Mr. Khrushchev in the kitchen. We tried impressing him on a goodwill tour. We tried smiling at him in the spirit of Camp David. Now we are confining him to the island of Manhattan. But Mr. Khrushchev has not been impressed, deterred, or confined in his efforts to build a Communist empire.', 'The reason is that Mr. Khrushchev is not the enemy. He may personify it. His antics may dramatize it. But the real enemy is the Communist system itself, unyielding, uncompromising, and unchanging in its drive for world domination.', 'Standing up to Mr. Khrushchev in debate is not enough. What we must do is stand up and summon the strength of the free world to advance the cause of peace and our own security.', 'Instead we have concentrated on Mr. Khrushchev - of answering his arguments - of reacting to every crisis that he creates. We have concentrated on his objectives - and forgotten our own. When he grins we invite him to Camp David. When he growls we restrict him to Manhattan. But our responsibility, whether he grins or growls, is to pay more attention to our objectives and those of the other free nations.', 'I am tired of reading every morning what Mr. Khrushchev is doing and what Mr. Castro is doing. I want to read what the President of the United States is doing.', 'We have great political and economic assets in this country, and the Communists know it. We are the sponsors of our own great independence movement. We initiated the Marshall plan and Point Four. We are the strongest nation still on earth. And, because the Communists know it, they have succeeded in tying us up in one trouble spot after another - on their own terms, in areas of their own choosing - and in this way preventing us from using our strength to advance freedom throughout the world.', 'We have been hypnotized by the glare of the headlights of the oncoming car and have forgotten to look at the road ahead.', 'While we are busy in our backyard, we can do nothing in theirs. While we talk to the underdeveloped nations about the evils of communism, the Soviets talk to them of hunger and poverty and disease. I think we can do better.', 'Consider, for example, the year that has passed since Mr. Khrushchev\'s last visit - the year between the ""Spirit of Camp David"" and the ""Spirit of Manhattan."" One year ago this week - when I warned at Rochester, N.Y., in this city, and I quote, ""A cause for redoubled efforts, not for relaxation"" when I said ""the real test of Mr. Khrushchev\'s intentions - will be his deeds, not his words"" - some resented my dampening of their hopes. Mr. Nixon had hailed the prospects for peace developing from, and I quote him, ""the mutual respect"" that was being stimulated by our leaders. Others had envisioned the cold war actually ending - and we all wished it would.', 'But now 1 year has come and gone. The spirit of Camp David has gone. The spirit of mutual respect has disappeared. Our hopes for an end to the cold war have also gone.', 'And what of the six areas of hope and potential agreement that featured the Camp David talks just 1 year ago now?', 'The summit meeting was a fiasco, and our President was insulted, which every American objected to.', ""The President's trip to Russia was abruptly canceled by his hosts, who have no hesitation in coming here, uninvited and unwanted, to carry the cold war to the U.N. meeting in New York."", 'The Berlin crisis is worse instead of better.', 'The negotiations on nuclear testing are as far apart as they ever were.', 'The talks on disarmament have been called off.', 'And, finally, instead of the hoped-for general relaxation of world tension, the Soviets have stepped up the tempo of disorder, division and danger.', 'They have established an iron curtain outpost just 90 miles from the coast of the United States, 8 minutes by jet. They have, for the first time, extended their sphere of influence to Africa. They have threatened the stability of the free tiny nation of Laos in southeast Asia - they have infiltrated and tied to the extremist movement of the nationalists in Algeria, in order to make a solution of that difficult problem even more difficult - and stepped up their use of funds, arms, technicians and propaganda to Iraq and the other countries of the Middle East.', ""They have exploited anti-American sentiment in Japan so successfully that the President's trip was canceled. They have made a spectacle before the world of the U-2 flight and the trial of our pilot and they have treated this nation with open hostility and contempt in seizing the crew of the RB-47. And finally, they have sought to increase their prestige and influence in the United Nations; and, failing that, to make it impotent and ineffective."", 'All this they have done in a year - the year of the Camp David spirit. And what has the United States been doing in the same 12 months?', 'We have frustrated congressional attempts to build more missiles, to harden our missile bases, to increase our powerful submarine fleet. We have failed to propose a consistent, comprehensive and workable plan for disarmament that would gain the support, at least, of the free world, based on careful preparation and technical studies. And we have been repeatedly reassured by Mr. Nixon - in glowing, sugar-coated terms that we have nothing to worry about in arms, science and space - that we have achieved peace without surrender - that statistics which show that the Russian economy is expanding faster than ours are dismissed as ""growthmanship"" - and that anti-American riots in Latin America and Japan were actually indications that the Communists were afraid to face us.', ""If you are satisfied with those assurances - if you feel that we are doing all that we must do to build up the cause of freedom around the world, to prepare long-term strategy for its defense, instead of moving from crisis to crisis - then Mr. Nixon's experience is what should be sent to the White House. But if you are concerned with a tendency to react instead of act - to become preoccupied with responding to communism instead of also advancing freedom - then I suggest you consider more closely the foreign policy experience of the Republican nominee."", 'He has, as he has pointed out, had an opportunity to travel widely. He has had an opportunity to study the long-range needs of each area - to recommend new policies for this administration- and to see that those recommendations are promptly carried out. What has been the result?', 'Today, in six key areas around the world, we are reacting too late to a cold war crisis where the cause of freedom is in serious danger in Cuba, where the Communists openly plot an attack upon hemispheric solidarity - in Ghana, whose President was assailed by Mr. Herter last week as ""very definitely leaning toward the Soviet bloc"" in Japan, where we have seen anti-American demonstrations - in the area once known as Indochina, where the tiny nation of Laos is struggling to keep its head above the ground from Communist attacks - in Poland, where the once hopeful cracks in the Iron Curtain are disappearing - and in India, the one nation which is capable of outstripping the Chinese Communists in the race for the attention of Asia, already is meeting one setback after another.', 'These six areas are far apart in their geography, their history, their devotion to freedom and the kind of threat that they pose to our future. But they all share two features in common:', 'First, in each case, action by this Nation or the West - before the Communist threat reached its present stage - might well have gone a long way toward strengthening the cause of freedom in each of those countries.', 'Secondly, also before the threat reached that stage, each of these areas had been visited by Mr. Richard Nixon.', ""Why was not our Latin American capital investment program strengthened in 1958, after Mr. Nixon was there, instead of this summer at the point of Mr. Castro's gun?"", 'Why did we not encourage free elections in Cuba after Mr. Nixon was there in 1955, in order to stave off a revolt against what he called in a Havana press conference in 1955 ""the competence and stability"" of the Batista dictatorship?', 'Why are we suddenly embarking now on a crash program for African scholarships for students? Last year we allocated no scholarships at all to the Congo, practically none to other French and Belgian colonies and, indeed, practically none to the continent of Africa itself.', 'We have allocated more scholarships this summer to the Congo than we allocated to all of Africa a year ago. We allocated 300 scholarships to the Congo, and there are only 6 students here on those scholarships from the Congo. We allocated less than 220 to all of Africa last year. And you cannot educate a leader overnight. It takes many, many years before these men and women will be able to lead their country along the road of freedom.', 'Why did we fail to realize the situation in Laos - in India - in Japan - in Poland - in other areas of the world - before the crisis developed? Mr. Nixon was there - presumably he made recommendations, but it is apparently an unfortunate fact that for all these years a trip by Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Mikoyan has had a greater effect on our foreign policy than a trip by Mr. Nixon.', 'The facts of the matter are that trips and tours are not enough. Words and debates are not enough. Slogans about peace are not enough.', 'For peace takes more than talk, more than effort, more than ""experience,"" particularly if that ""experience,"" in Oscar Wilde\'s words, is ""the name that everyone gives to their mistakes.""', 'The next administration, in addition to meeting our present commitments and facing up to the crises already mentioned, must look ahead with foresight to the new problems just over the horizon.', 'The spread of nuclear weapons to several nations drastically altering the balance of world power and sharply increasing the chances of accidental war, the emergence of Red China as a nuclear power dedicated to the proposition of victory through war, and differing with the Soviets as to the means of achieving their joint ambitions.', 'The possibilities of new cracks in the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe, new Communist moves in Africa, new East German pressure on Berlin, and new voting blocs in the United Nations.', 'The possibilities of new steps to integrate the economy of Europe and the economy of Latin America.', 'We need to plan for such developments before they happen. We need to foresee now what is going to happen in 1961 and 1962. We need to recognize the revolutionary tempo of the world in which we live if we are to strengthen this country, if we are to provide for our arms and diplomacy the kind of foresight that is desperately needed, and strengthen the cause of freedom all around the globe.', 'We cannot be satisfied with things as they are. We cannot be satisfied to drift, to rest on our oars, to glide over a sea whose depths are shaken by subterranean upheavals.', 'In 1939, I saw in Europe what happened to those countries who were lulled into complacency by leaders who talked of peace instead of building it. And when France fell to the Nazis, one of its most illustrious leaders declared:', '\n  Our spirit of enjoyment was greater than our spirit of sacrifice. We wanted to have, more than we wanted to give. We spared effort, and met disaster.\n', 'I run for the Presidency in 1960 in the conviction that the people of this country are willing to give, are willing to sacrifice, and will spare no effort and will not meet disaster.', 'That is our objective, and that is our policy.']"
194,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. President, Mayor Daley, Congressman Machrowicz, Congressman Pucinski, members of your organization, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your generous invitation to be here today. I hope I can in the words of the oldtime orators claim kinship here. I am not of Polish extraction, but I have been interested in Poland and the people of Polish extraction for many years, stretching all the way back to 1939, when I visited Warsaw and Danzig, and spent nearly a month of late July and early August in the summer of 1939, traveling through Poland. On that occasion, I came to have the greatest possible respect for those who, faced with threats east and west, were nevertheless willing to stand up for their country and to die for it, if necessary.', 'That interest built then was stimulated some years later when I read a book written about the Polish Army in exile, which had been captained by General Anders originally, and which had, of course, fought in the Middle East and Italy. After the war, I visited the Polish cemetery in Italy. Some of you who have been there may recall that at the cemetery are written the words, ""These Polish soldiers for your freedom and theirs have given their bodies to the soil of Italy, their hearts to Poland, and their souls to God.""', ""I am a friend of freedom and where freedom is I feel at home, and therefore I feel at home today. [Applause.] As a result of that visit and that book, I cosponsored at the end of the 1940's a bill which would have permitted members of the Polish Army in exile, most of whom had gone to England after the war, to come into the United States in greater numbers than our immigration laws permitted. It has been a source of regret to me that the United States did not do in that case as much as some other countries scattered around the world. Many of those soldiers settled in England, some in Canada, some in Australia, some in the United States, but no nearly as many as I think this contribution to our security and freedom warranted."", 'In 1955 I visited Poland again and spent some days there and traveled on that occasion to Czestochowa. It is an interesting fact that those of us who are students of American history to some degree, and who have seen the names of Pulaski and Kosciuszko and the others, who came to the United States and helped fight for our freedom, it was interesting to me on that occasion to see the sword of John Sobieski, with which he had saved Vienna in the battle against the Turks in the middle of the last of the lOth century, to see a crucifix of Kosciuszko, to see a tiny model carved by Pulaski of Czestochowa, all of which are in the great library in that old shrine which symbolizes the great religious and national heritage of that great country.', 'Since that time I have labored in the Congress, in attempts to try to establish closer ties between the people of Poland and the people of the United States. Poland moves into a dark period of its history and has since 1939. But my own conviction is that the words of the Polish National Anthem have great relevances to this meeting today. ""As long as you live, Poland lives."" As long as you continue to meet together, as long as we in the United States continue to maintain our strength, and send out rays of freedom around the world, then in my judgment the situation behind the Iron Curtain can only be regarded as a temporary one. [Applause.]', 'During the last months many of us have read some of the speeches given by distinguished world figures before the United Nations, and one of the subjects which is constantly discussed and constantly harped upon are the evils of colonialism. This is particularly stressed by the people of Africa, who have emerged in some cases from two or three hundred years of colonialism and are now independent nations. They were joined in those attacks on colonialism - and the definition of colonialism, of course, is the rule of one country by another - they were joined by Mr. Khrushchev, and I thought that surprisingly few found that completely unsatisfactory. The fact of the matter is that the greatest slave master and colonial power in the world today is the Soviet Union, and should so be regarded. [Applause.]', 'I have never defended Western colonialism. In fact, I have criticized it when it existed in Indochina or Algeria or any other place in Africa. But, therefore, I think we are in a good position. As long as we maintain that we are for freedom wherever it may exist, I think we are in a very good position to demand an accounting of the Soviet Union, because it holds a great - [applause] - it holds as a colonial power not only the Baltic Republics and Poland and Czechoslovakia and Hungary and Bulgaria and Rumania; it holds as a colonial power countries within the boundaries of the U.S.S.R., countries which up to the end of World War I had a long tradition of freedom and independence, countries which have the Mohammedan religion, which are descended from the people of the Middle East, which had an ancient culture, which worshipped their own gods in their own ways. Therefore, it is only in recent years that the Soviet Union has extended its power to them to destroy their culture, destroy their religious freedom, destroy their traditions. It is within the boundaries of the Soviet Union as well as eastern Europe that the Soviet Union holds under its sway the greatest number of people that any colonial power has for many, many hundreds of years, and they hold them with little hope for freedom. The British, the French, the Belgians, however unfortunate their record may have been in the past, at least their countries now that they once held are moving into the sunlight of freedom, and within 2 or 3 years one-quarter of all the nations of the General Assembly of the United Nations will be Africans, which 5 or 10 years ago were held by the colonial powers of the West. Now we ask the Soviet Union to do the same. Now we ask them to match their deeds with their words. Now we ask the Africans who are now independent, to join with us in the fight against the colonialism wherever it may exist, and whoever may be the colonial power. [Applause.]', 'This convention meets every 4 years. You meet the same year that there are presidential elections, and I think it is appropriate that candidates for the Presidency should speak to you, because all of us as Americans are concerned about what our country must do and what it must be and what it must stand for and what it must symbolize. I believe that in meeting here today you serve the United States because you serve the cause of freedom, and what serves the cause of freedom serves us. It serves this country. It reminds us of what we stand for. It reminds us of our unfinished business around the world. Therefore, in coming here today, and in considering the problems that may exist in Poland, you are serving the United States in the best sense of the word. [Applause.]', 'It has been easy in recent years to make speeches for some people, to audiences of Polish extraction. We denounce the Soviets, we talk about liberty. But the question is what real contribution, what genuine contribution can we now make, given the condition of the world, given the intransigence of the Soviet Union, what contribution can we make in 1960? What is the policy that the United States should follow? That has been a matter of great importance to me for some years in the Congress, and we have attempted, as some of you may know, to pass legislation in the Congress which would permit an easing of the tension which now exists between Poland and the United States, to hold out the hand of friendship to the Polish people, to recognize that even though they are in prison, nevertheless we still are tied to them by history and by a common purpose. [Applause.]', 'I think that this is most important, that we do so, for Mr. Khrushchev knows very well he can read the signs of the times. He knows that the strongest tide that has swept the world since the end of 1945 is the desire of the people to be free and independent. The African experience indicates it clearly. The Hungarian experience indicates it even more clearly. And so does the experience of Poland. These people are determined to be free. They have not accepted the idea that their culture, their religious heritage, their traditions, can be destroyed by domination by a foreign power. Therefore, as long as that spirit remains alive, whether it is in eastern Europe or whether it is in any other part of the globe, ultimately the Communist empire is doomed to destruction. [Applause.]', 'It is our function to maintain that principle. I spoke in 1956 in regard to Algeria and the necessity of the French recognizing the right of self-determination. The reason I did was a simple one. It was because that September and October before the United Nations the Hungarian resolution was coming. How can we possibly be indifferent and stand for an important principle which is the right of people to be free unless we did it regardless of whether it be a friend or a foe? The principle is the important thing. The principle serves us. The principle serves the cause of freedom. I want Africa to be free, and I want eastern Europe to be free, and I want those who are now free in Africa - I want them to look to the remaining areas of the world, and if we are wrong, I want them to tell it to us. I want the principle to be stood for wherever it may be. I will take the chances in the United States, and I want them to look at the Soviet Union also. I want them to stand for the principle. [Applause.]', ""Now, the question is: What should the American policy be under these conditions? We recognized after the experience of the 1960's the limitations of the so-called policy of liberation. We do not want to mislead the people of Poland or Hungary again, that the United States is prepared to liberate them. Therefore, within the general framework of present events, what policies should we carry out? What can we do to maintain the spirit of independence? What can we do to help, in Thomas Jefferson's words, the disease of liberty to spread? Poland is a satellite government, but the Poles are not a satellite people. [Applause.] We have no right, unless we are prepared to meet our commitments, to incite them to national suicide. But neither can we abandon them, leaving them without hope for the future. In 1647, when the famous Irish revolutionary, General O'Neill, was poisoned, the poets compared the fate of the Irish people to sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out the sky. We cannot let that be true of Poland today. This Nation, under the new administration must be their shepherd until freedom is theirs again. [Applause.]"", 'Our task is to encourage and pursue a policy of patiently encouraging freedom and carefully pressuring tyranny, a policy that looks to evolution and not toward immediate revolution. More is involved than our policy to Poland alone in Europe. We must show in West Berlin that we have no intention of yielding to Soviet claims, that we believe that history will yield in time a free and united Berlin, and a free and united Europe. We must convince the Russians that we are rebuilding our defensive strength so that the route of military force can no longer be open to them. [Applause.] But the next administration must also devise a specific policy for Poland and eastern Europe, and I would suggest these seven points:', 'First, we must arm ourselves with more flexible economic tools. In 1951, as you know, the Congress passed the Battle Act. The Battle Act says that if any country is dominated by the Soviet Union, no economic assistance, no Export-Import Bank loans, no food loans, no nothing can be granted to any country that is dominated by the Soviet Union. The difficulty, of course, is that the situation has changed to a degree since 1951. Therefore, 2 years ago in the Congress I offered an amendment to the Battle Act which would provide that some degree of economic assistance, some loaning back of the money we may have tied up, the zlotys we may have tied up in Poland, as a result of our surplus food sales, could be loaned back for specific purposes, for health and food and so on, and that this could be done when, in the judgment of the President of the United States and the consent of the Congress, it was in the interest of the United States. This amendment failed by one vote 3 years ago. It passed in the Senate last year by seven votes and failed again this year in the House of Representatives. My judgment is that it is in the interest of the United States and in the interest of Poland and the other countries behind the Iron Curtain that we should have some flexible tools so that if the situation develops that closer relations are desirable, that assistance to the Polish people is necessary, if they should be stricken by economic difficulties which increase their independence on the Soviet Union, then I think we should have tools available to the President and to the Congress. We should prepare the way. Therefore, in my judgment the next Congress and the next administration should support our efforts to amend the Battle Act in the interest of international security. [Applause.]', ""Second, we must never, at the summit, in any treaty declaration, in our words or even in our minds, recognize the Soviet domination of eastern Europe as permanent. We must never do it. [Applause.] Poland's claim to independence and liberty is not based on sentiment or politics. It is rooted in history, and it is to history that we must address ourselves. [Applause.]"", 'Third, we must strengthen the economic and cultural ties between Poland and the United States, by expanding reciprocal trade, by tourism, by information services. We can encourage the investment of American capital and technology and recognize the needs of Polish ships and airlines, and perhaps most important of all, we can open our doors to refugees from the tyranny of Eastern Europe.', 'Fourth, we can increase the exchange of students and teachers and technicians, to give more Poles an opportunity to see the blessing of liberty, to give us an opportunity to assist Poland in building an independent economy particularly in agriculture, and the management of medium sized industries. The facts of the matter are that there are 10 times as many students from the Ryukyu Islands in the United States studying with the assistance of the Government as there are from Poland; 10 times. I think we can do better. I think we can do better. [Applause.]', 'Fifth, we must strive to restore the traditional identification which Poland has had with the Western European community, which goes back into history. It is tied by culture ties. Poland has always looked to the West, never to the East. Therefore, anything that we can do to encourage more intimate relations between France and Poland, Italy and Poland and the test, I think, is in the interest of peace and in the interest of maintaining an independent spirit. [Applause.]', ""Sixth, we must eliminate Poland's fear of the West, fears that are very real, and this includes in particular fear of Germany. We must make plain our intention that disputes between West and East can be settled by peaceful negotiations and not by force, that never again will Eastern European nations be violently stripped of their territories and their resources, and we should work to encourage a peaceful and mutual accommodation in the spirit of a free Europe. [Applause.]"", 'Seventh, and finally, we must make use of our frozen Polish funds, to remind the people of that Nation that we share their traditional pride in culture, learning, and human welfare and offer the use of these funds to build a national library, an archives, or housing districts, new schools, and I think this would be particularly effective - the reconstruction of the Warsaw Palace which is a great symbol of national independence and national liberty. [Applause.]', 'The United States under Public Law 480 sells food, surplus food, to Poland. The zlotys that we secure for that food is tied up in Poland, and in most cases is unused. I think there are things that we can use it for which will help maintain the life of the people there and help maintain their spirit and help them know that here in the United States we are still concerned with their welfare, still concerned with their progress. None of the things that I have mentioned, perhaps, have the immediate force of the word ""liberation,"" but we are concerned with trying to help people, not misleading them. We are trying to hold out the hand of friendship to them. Anyone who has looked at the history of the world for the last 15 years and seen friends become enemies and enemies friends, who have seen all the changes in the globe and in science and technology, cannot help but feel that what is now happening in Eastern Europe represents only a step in a long evolution of history. I hold that view and, therefore, I consider our immediate function to be to maintain the spirit in that country, to let them know that we are still concerned, that we are still identified with them, that we believe that they will be free, and that we are devoting our energies to that cause. That is what you do today, that is what we ought to try to do in our national policy. If we do, and if we maintain this spark, this fire, even if it is in the ashes, then some day they will be free and we will have played our proper role. [Applause.]', 'I know some of the people will say that all this is a wasted effort, that the people of Poland, however brave, are in a prison from which there is no escape or early escape, but is this the reason to ignore their needs? Is this an excuse for inaction? Have we forgotten the words, ""I was hungry and you gave me to eat, naked and you covered me, sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came unto me."" Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
195,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Congress, Mr. Mayor, my nephew, ladies and gentlemen [laughter], I want to express my thanks to all of you. I came to Chicago today to address an audience of Poles who are also Americans, who believe in the close ties which have always existed between the United States and Poland and who believe Poland must one day be free. [Applause.]', 'I come here today because in the last 3 weeks in New York City, at the United Nations, speaker after speaker, from Mr. Khrushchev, has spoken about the evils of colonialism. The Soviet Union today is the greatest colonial master in the world, and until they are ready to permit the people of Eastern Europe to have free elections and a free choice, then they stand indicted before world opinion. [Applause.]', 'I was in Poland in 1939, and I spent a month there, from Warsaw to Danzig, and I saw Poland free. And I was in Poland in 1955, and I saw Poland under the domination of the Soviet Union. But in my visit in 1955 I visited Czestochowa and saw the Mattabuca, and saw the free spirit of Poland. I think Poland will someday be free. But Poland will be free as long as we have the United States and all who believe in the cause of freedom maintain our conviction.', 'I am a descendant of Irishmen who were under servitude and domination for 700 years. The Polish people will remain free as long as we are free, as long as we believe in their freedom. The Polish national anthem says, ""As long as you live, Poland lives."" As long as we in the United States retain our conviction that someday not only will maintain our freedom but others shall also be free, whether they live in Latin America, whether they live in Africa, whether they live in Asia, whether they live in Europe, or wherever they may live, they shall be free. That is the policy. [Applause.]', ""This country's freedom was won by us, by the people of this country and people who came from Europe, including distinguished Poles who came here to fight for freedom. The U.S. Congress gave those people who came to this country each a bequest, each an award, and Kosciuszko, who was the most celebrated of all of them, when he died, he left his entire American estate, all the property he had in this country, to Thomas Jefferson. For what reason? To free the slaves. He believed that he could not be free until all men were free. And that is what we believe here today. [Applause.]"", 'I want Mr. Khrushchev, who spoke about colonialism in the United Nations, and about what has happened in Africa, I want him to look not only at Africa, but also at Eastern Europe. The purpose of our meeting today is a simple one to determine what steps we can take usefully here in the United States, and I have attempted to do so. I do not believe that the United States should turn a deaf ear. There are many things we can do. We can maintain our belief that Eastern Europe will someday be free. We can never agree to any concessions that would recognize Soviet domination. As long as we live, Poland lives; as long as we live, our country lives. As long as this country lives, what Thomas Jefferson called the disease of liberty will be catching. Other people know that until we have been destroyed, their chance of independence is good. The reason the Communists attack us is because they know when the United States fails, the cause of freedom fails. But as long as we maintain our strength, as long as we identify ourselves with the cause of independence with the cause of liberty for ourselves and others, we and our generation can do for Poland what Kosciuszko and Pulaski and the others did for us in 1776.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I ask your help in building a stronger America, and in building a stronger America to advance the cause of freedom wherever it may be enslaved, to tell all the people around the world that the United States is on the move again. And as long as we move forward, they move forward. [Applause.]']"
196,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Daley, Congressman Dawson, members of the assembly, representatives, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming over and giving me a warm hand of friendship. I think this is an important election. Mr. Nixon has said that party labels don't make so much difference; what we want is the man. I think we want the man who is a Democrat, because the Democratic Party stands for the people. [Applause.]"", 'Every program which we now put forward and which both parties now endorse was written into the statute books over the opposition of a substantial group of the Republican Party, things which make life decent for all Americans, a chance for social security, for minimum wage, for unemployment compensation, for public housing. I have stood for those things in 14 years in the Congress. Mr. Nixon now says he stands for them. But I was in Congress when he was. I remember when he made effort after effort to get better housing for our people, to get a better minimum wage. I am chairman of the Subcommitee on Labor. We tried to put through a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour. The average wage to laundrywomen in five large cities of the United States, and most of them are Negro women, is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. Every time that we fail to build better homes and public housing, we fail our people. There are 5 million homes in the United States, in the cities of this country, that lack plumbing of any kind. Fifteen million American families live in inadequate housing. The average social security benefit is less than $78 a month for someone who is retired, and out of that he has to pay food and housing and medical care. Anyone who says that there is nothing left to do, that all the things that had to be done were done by Truman or Roosevelt, I think is wrong. I think we in our time still have responsibilities left if we are going to build a stronger society here in the United States. I gave some figures on television which are true, which is if a white baby and a Negro baby are born in houses next to each other, that the Negro baby has one-half as much chance of finishing high school, one-third as much chance of getting to college. There are four times as many chances that he will be out of a job. Why should it be so? And he will live on the average 7 years less. Why? It is because they do not have a fair chance to develop their talents. That is what we want in this country. [Applause.]', 'You cannot possibly maintain your families unless you get a decent education. You cannot possibly live in decent homes unless you are treated fairly and secure a decent job. As it is now, the first to be fired at the time a recession comes are mostly those who are Negroes, because they have not had a chance to finish school and because they have not had a chance to learn skills. Everyone says we should do these things because the Communists are talking about them. I think we ought to do them because that is the way we build a better country - that is the way we build a better country. [Applause.]', 'This is not just a problem for one section. I read a story in the New York Herald Tribune yesterday morning that 14 of the delegates who had come from Africa to this country for the first time wanted the United Nations moved from the United States to another country because they had not been treated with courtesy here in this country. I want to build a strong society here, not merely because we sit in a goldfish bowl, but because by building a stronger society we show we really believe in the cause of freedom.', 'I am speaking today to the Polish Congress, which is meeting downtown. The great Polish hero who helped free the United States was Kosciuszko. When Kosciuszko died, he was given a good deal of money by the Congress, and he left his money to Thomas Jefferson to free the American slaves. He was a Pole. He fought here for freedom and he wanted everyone to be free. That is the spirit in which we move in the United States today. [Applause.] What we want for ourselves, we want for others. We want freedom and a decent standard of living, which is what people want around the world. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor around the world because he was a good neighbor in the United States. [Applause.]', 'I come here today and I ask your help. I support the Democratic platform, which stands for equality in the rights of man, and I stand for it as the Democratic candidate. Whether I am President or Senator, we will continue this fight until every American, regardless of their religion, regardless of their race or creed, steps forward and stands in the sun. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
197,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","['Our task is to pursue a policy of patiently encouraging freedom and carefully pressuring tyranny - a policy that looks toward evolution not revolution - a policy that depends on peace, not war.', 'More is involved than our policy toward Poland alone. We must show in West Berlin that we have no intentions of yielding to false Soviet claims or fierce Soviet threats - that we believe history will in time yield a free and united Berlin and a free and united Europe. We must convince the Russians that we are rebuilding our defensive strength so that the route of military force can no longer be open to them. And we must prove to the men in Moscow that colonialism is doomed everywhere in the world, including Eastern Europe.', 'But the next administration must also devise a specific policy for Poland and Eastern Europe - and I would suggest seven points:', 'First, we must arm ourselves with more flexible economic tools. We must be willing to recognize growing divisions in the Communist camp, and be willing to encourage those divisions. My amendment to the Battle Act would permit the President to use our economic strength to promote peaceful change behind the Iron Curtain whereever this would help wean the so-called captive nations away from their Kremlin masters. In the 85th Congress this amendment was defeated by one vote. In the 86th Congress it passed the Senate but died in the House. In the 87th Congress, under new Presidential leadership, it must become law.', ""Second, we must never - at any summit, in any treaty declaration, in our words or even in our minds - recognize Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. Poland's claim to independence and liberty is not based on sentiment or politics. It is deeply rooted in history, in culture and in law - and no matter what pressures the Soviets may exert, we do not intend to see that claim abandoned."", 'Third, we must strengthen the economic and cultural ties between Poland and the United States - by expanding reciprocal trade, tourism, and information services. We can encourage the investment of American capital and technology. We can recognize the needs of Polish ships and airlines. And, perhaps most important of all, we can open our doors to refugees from the terror of tyranny.', 'Fourth, we can increase the exchange of students, teachers, and technicians - to give more Poles an opportunity to see the blessings of liberty - and to give us an opportunity to assist the Poles in building an independent economy, particularly in agriculture and the management of medium-sized industry. The facts of the matter are that there are 10 times as many students here on Government grants from the Ryukyu Islands as there are from all of Poland. I think we can do better.', 'Fifth, we must strive to restore the traditional identification which Poland and Eastern Europe have had with the European community instead of the Soviet empire. We should invite all satellite nations to participate in all-European projects - to share in intellectual and cultural exchanges, to lower barriers to travel and trade, to work toward the resolution of ancient disputes. For Poland back through the centuries has belonged to the European tradition of freedom and national independence. It has been a part of European culture, of European economy and European history. And even the Soviet Union cannot rewrite that history.', ""Sixth, we must eliminate Poland's fear of the West - fears that are very real - and this includes, in particular, a fear of Germany. We must make plain our intention that disputes between West and East be settled by peaceful negotiations, not by force - that never again will Eastern European nations be violently stripped of their territories and resources. We cannot impose a boundary settlement on other nations - but we can encourage peaceful and mutual accommodation in the spirit of free Europe."", 'Seventh, and finally, we must make use of our frozen Polish funds to remind the people of that nation that we share their traditional pride in culture, learning, and human welfare - and offer to use these funds to build a national library and archives, a housing district, new schools, or - and I thing this would be particularly effective - the reconstruction of the Warsaw Castle.', 'When I was in Warsaw in 1955, I found no Poles who enjoyed the gaudy Soviet Palace of Culture. And I believe that the millions of dollars worth of zlotys we have idle in Poland - acquired from our surplus food sales - could be put to no better use than to answer this new symbol of Soviet arrogance by rebuilding this traditional symbol of Polish independence.', 'I know that some will say that all of this is wasted effort - that the people of Poland, however brave, are in a prison from which there is no early escape. But is this reason to ignore their needs? Is this an excuse for inaction? Have we forgotten the words: ""I was hungry and you gave me to eat, naked and you covered me, sick and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.""']"
198,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Freeman, Senator Humphrey, Senator McCarthy, Members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, the outstanding news story of this week was not the events of the United Nations or even the Presidential Campaign. It was a story coming out of my own city of Boston that Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox had retired from baseball. It seems that at 42 he was too old. [Laughter and applause.] It shows that perhaps experience isn't enough. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""This week I had the opportunity to debate with Mr. Nixon. I feel that I should reveal that I had a great advantage in that debate, and I am not referring to anyone's makeup man. [Laughter and applause.] The advantage that I had was that Mr. Nixon had just debated with Khrushchev, and I had debated with Hubert Humphrey, and that gave me an edge. [Laughter and applause.] That is much tougher."", 'But I am delighted to be here tonight. Grover Cleveland many years ago said, ""What good is a politician and what good is a political party unless it stands for something?"" He would never ask that question here in Minnesota, because the political leaders of this party and the party have stood for something, and that is progress and the welfare of the people of this State and Country. [Applause.]', 'Governor Freeman, Senator Humphrey, Senator McCarthy, and the Members of the Congress have all spoken powerfully for the well-being of the people of this State, and they have also spoken for the United States, and I am proud to be with them here tonight in an election that we are going to win here in Minnesota and across the country. [Applause.]', 'I stand here tonight as the nominee of the Democratic Party in a difficult and somber time in the life of our country. It is our hope, I know, that whether we win or lose this election, that we will, during these weeks and months, serve a great national function, and that is to present to the American people the great issues which face us in this watershed of our history, and I think we have made a contribution already.', 'Six months ago the Republicans were running on a slogan of peace and prosperity. Three months ago they were running on a slogan of ""You never had it so good."" Now, even they are saying it is time America woke up and started to move ahead. [Applause.]', ""I stand here tonight where Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman stood in their time, and though the problems were entirely different in their day, and though our generation of Americans faces new challenges, nevertheless I sing the same song they sang, and that is the song that the American people and the Democratic Party, when working together, have fulfilled their destiny. I belong to the Democratic Party, and the Democratic Party belongs to the people and it stands for progress. I think in 1960 it has, as it has had in great years of our history, a chance for distinguished service, a chance to speak for the public interest, a chance to turn the attention of the American people into the 1960's, and the challenges that face us in the sixties."", 'Franklin Roosevelt said in 1933, ""This generation has a rendezvous with destiny."" I think in 1960 this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny. It is not the preservation of freedom here in the United States, which he helped save. It is the preservation of freedom around the world. That is the responsibility and destiny of the United States in the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', 'In his second inaugural address, before 100,000 people at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, President Roosevelt said:', '\n  Governments can err Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'I think that is what we had [applause] and I think that if the Republicans win this election, I think we will have again a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.', 'Speaking in my own city of Boston this week, Mr. Nixon said, ""The American people believe in measuring promises against the solid performance, and they are going to vote for real performance and not unreal problems.""', ""I agree with Nixon. I agree that the American people are not going to be taken in by the presidential-year election promises by leap-year liberalism every 4 years, which comes about during the fall. But where are they when the Congress is in session? Where are the Republican Party's record of their performance against the promises of Senate, when the issues which affect the welfare of our people come before us to vote? That is the question of 1960, and I think that we can compare very satisfactorily not only Mr. Nixon, but the Republican party's record of their performance against the promises of this campaign, for the Republican Party, the same party which gave us the missile gap, and the economic gap, have also given us a performance gap, and that is the gap which will bring about the rejection of the Republican Party this November. [Applause.]"", ""This month Mr. Nixon promised us better schools and better salaries for our teachers. But this year in the month of February, Mr. Nixon cast the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate against the Federal aid for teachers' salaries, and this summer, in August, the House of Representatives, led by the Republican members of the Rules Committee, killed Federal aid for education."", 'This month Mr. Nixon promised a new housing program and slum clearance, but the same edition of the New York Times which gave us the details of this program also pointed out that Mr. Nixon as a Congressman had voted against the Housing Act of 1949, and public housing for our people, and that he had cast, as Vice President of the United States, the deciding vote which would have decreased interest on GI home loans.', 'This month Nixon promises to keep the cost of living down, but in the past 8 years Mr. Nixon has supported Republican policies which have increased medical care in the last 8 years 32 percent; rent, 20 percent; and the cost of household management, 23 percent; and which have added $3 billion a year to the interest on the debt over 1952.', 'This month Mr. Nixon promises you medical care for our older citizens. But last August Mr. Nixon directed the opposition to a Democratic bill, which would have provided medical care for the aged under social security. Only one Republican voted for that bill, as only one Republican had voted in 1935 for the original Social Security Act.', ""A national news magazine reported that when the Senate roll-call came killing medical care and when it was announced, the Vice President smiled, but the older people of this country who must take a pauper's oath to receive medical care as aged citizens are not smiling, and I do not believe Mr. Nixon will smile on November 9. [Applause.]"", 'All this is wrapped up in the poem by T. S. Eliot, ""The Rock,"" and in that poem he says, ""And the wind shall say: \'These were decent people. Their only monument the asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls.\'"" We can do better than that. [Laughter and applause.]', 'This month Mr. Nixon has promised equality of opportunity for all Americans, but I am not aware that the Republican Party has supported our efforts in the Congress to secure the passage of legislation which will provide equality of opportunity, nor am I aware that the President of the United States and this administration has ever given their endorsement to the 1954 Supreme Court decision, a decision which is in accordance with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. We believe it. We believe in it. [Applause.]', 'But I think the greatest gap between performance and promise is in Mr. Nixon\'s agricultural program. Underneath the phrases ""Operation Consume"" and ""Operation Safeguard"" lie the same policies and the same programs which have brought American agriculture to its lowest level in 20 years, for Mr. Nixon has simply refurbished the programs which Mr. Benson introduced, a program which Mr. Benson endorsed, a program which bears a remarkable resemblance to the very language which Ezra Taft Benson used in describing his program. For example, Mr. Nixon promised last week to reduce farm production through a massive land retirement program. ""We will,"" he said, and I quote him, ""use the surplus to use up the surplus."" Who said those words first? Mr. Benson in 1956 in talking about the soil bank, said this, and I quote, ""We will use the surplus to use up the surplus."" [Laughter and applause.]', 'Secondly, Mr. Nixon said last week, ""In dealing with the problems of increasing farm income,"" he said, ""We promise a long-term price-support system with levels based on an average of market prices under the immediately preceding crop year.""', 'Who said those words first? It was Mr. Benson in 1959 who said, ""Price supports will be based on the average of market prices for the immediately preceding year."" This is not a new program. This is an old program dressed up with old slogans. It uses the very language Mr. Benson used. It provides the same protection that Mr. Benson\'s program provided. It provides a support price tied to the market price of the preceding year, and as the market price drops, support price will drop. In 1952 corn sold at $1.50. Yesterday, in Sanborn, Minn., it sold for 85 cents. Next year the market price will be lower, because the support price will be tied to this year\'s price, and then in 1962, it will drop lower and lower, because there is no support tied to parity. Instead it is tied to the support price for the preceding year. I think the farmers of this country should understand it. Then they can make a decision. They can decide whether they want to continue to count down the steps, step by step, step by step, until they are ruined, as Mr. Nixon said on Monday night, ""until we get rid of the farmers."" [Laughter and applause.]', 'As part of Operation Consume, Mr. Nixon promises to use the food surpluses of our country to take care of the needy abroad and the needy at home. Food for peace was devised by Hubert Humphrey. It was never supported by the administration.', 'And as for Operation Consume here in the United States, the Republicans have opposed every effort we have made to increase the school lunch program. Mr. Nixon voted against it when he was in the House of Representatives. And they have refused to expand its distribution to our needy citizens in the last few years. Hubert Humphrey and I spent 6 weeks in West Virginia. We did not see Operation Consume. We saw Operation Misery. Five cents a day of surplus food for each person in West Virginia, in the richest country on earth, a country that has $9 billion of surplus food stored away, and yet this administration opposed the food stamp program, which Senator Humphrey and others supported. They opposed a program which I suggested, to distribute surplus food through the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and then they come and talk about it in the election of 1960, all these programs which they opposed for 8 years, which they have opposed for 25 years. I said on Sunday that I could not think of a single original piece of progressive legislation for the benefit of the people suggested originally by the Republican Party, and a local paper said I was wrong, that President Taft had initiated the child labor laws. [Laughter and applause.]', 'I think the differences between our two parties are important. Mr. Nixon says party labels don\'t make any difference. It is the man. I think party labels do mean something because they tell us something about the history of this country. They tell us about where we are going and where we have been. The Democratic slogans of this century have been Woodrow Wilson\'s ""New Freedom,"" Franklin Roosevelt\'s ""New Deal,"" Harry Truman\'s ""Fair Deal,"" Adlai Stevenson\'s ""New America."" The Republican slogans have been ""Stand Pat With McKinley,"" ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge,"" ""Two Chickens in Every Pot"" with Herbert Hoover. [Laughter and applause.] ""Repeal Social Security"" with Alf Landon, and I don\'t know what Thomas Dewey ran on - nor does he. [Laughter and applause.]', 'These are all important issues, because they affect the security of the United States. We are not talking about issues which are domestic issues. We are talking about the security of their country, because if we are building a stronger society here, if we are solving the problems of our agricultural surpluses in such a way as to shower blessings on the world, instead of to store and rot, if we are taking care of our older citizens, if we are providing the best education for our children, if we are developing our natural resources, if we are providing full employment then this country is strong and growing, then it has vitality, then it is moving ahead, and then it serves as an inspiration to the world around us.', 'People in Africa and Latin America and Asia who stand today on the razor edge of decision, trying to decide which way the future is moving, they look at us, and they look at the Communists, and they wonder have we reached our high noon, are our best days in the past, are we unable to solve our problems, is the Communist way the way that they should organize their society? I don\'t think it is. I think ours is the right way. But we have to serve freedom. We cannot expect that our problems will be solved without the devoted effort of our people, without the recognition that they require great leadership. The unfinished business of this society is the maintenance of freedom here and around the world. Thomas Paine said during the American Revolution, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I think in 1960 the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we remain strong here [applause] I think the future is assured. I do not say that if I am elected President that life will be easy, but I do say that if we are successful in November, if we win this election, I can assure you that this country will be given leadership through the Democratic Party, that the unfinished business before our society will be placed before the American people, and this country will begin to move again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
199,John F. Kennedy ,"October 01, 1960","['Mr. WINKLE. These questions are questions which were written on the cards distributed among you during the course of the evening, submitted to a group of citizens of six people, screened by them, and the questions which will be asked of Senator Kennedy were selected from the questions so submitted. Senator Kcnnedy has not seen the questions. They will be submitted to him. Do you have the questions?', 'QUESTION. I am Mrs. Emily Ruggles. Why are Catholic Presidents so opposed?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I did not hear the question.', 'QUESTION. Why is a Catholic opposed to being the President?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Would you repeat it?', 'Mr. WINKLE. The question was, Why are Catholics opposed to being President?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I don't think they are being opposed to being President. The question was: Why are Catholics opposed to being President? They are not opposed to being President. I don't know if anyone else is, but I would hope, in fact, I am quite confident that in 1960, the United States is faced with so many serious problems which involve the security of everyone in this State and country, involve really the whole fight for freedom, that I would think that everyone would consider that much more important than whether I go to church tomorrow morning. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, can you please tell me how a 12-year-old girl can campaign best?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was how a 12-year-old girl can campaign best? I must say I would rather have three 12-year-old girls campaigning than I would Hubert or Orville or Gene McCarthy, because actually the things which have to be done in a campaign can be done when you are 12 years old or when you are 80, which is to come down to headquarters, to be given a list of telephone numbers, places to call, literature to distribute, envelopes to address, stamps to put on, to be willing to walk and work, and unfortunately most of us when we are in politics are much more allergic to doing all of these things, so we would rather have you in headquarters than anybody else. Come on down. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. What do you think of Castro and what would you do with the situation? What do you think of Castro and what do you think of the situation?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was what I thought of Castro and what I think we ought to do about the situation. I must say that I think the most serious errors were made in the years 1955, 1957, and 1958. It is rather interesting that Mr. Nixon in Havana, Cuba, in 1955, gave an interview in which he spoke rather glowingly of the stability of the Batista regime. It seems to me it would have been far more valuable for us to be striking a blow for freedom, to stand for freedom, to use our great influence, which we had in Cuba at that time to persuade Batista to hold free elections, so that the people of Cuba could have a free choice. The fact of the matter is that when I was in Cuba 4 years ago, the American Ambassador said to me he was the second most powerful man in Cuba. Today the Soviet Ambassador is, and the reason is because the United States did not use its influence. The administration was not concerned about the problem of providing for free elections and democracy in all of Latin America and sooner or later dictatorships lead to control of the national movement by the Communists. It happened in Iraq, it happened in Cuba, it will happen any place. Anyone who feels that you can do business with a dictator year after year because he is going to vote with you in the United Nations, sooner or later the Communists will gather control of the opposition movement and when he goes they will seize control. [Applause.]', ""Now, as to the future, any action which we take should be taken through the Organization of American States, what I think should have been maximum concern in 1960 and 1961 should be that Castroism does not spread through other countries of Latin America, that we hold out the hand of friendship. It was not until our relations with Castro became soured to the breaking point that the United States came forward with a program of economic assistance to Latin America. They know what we know. They are not completely blind. They know that we turned a deaf ear, that we gave more aid to Yugoslavia than we did to all of Latin America for the last 10 years, and, therefore, suddenly when we offer assistance it is at the point of Castro's pistol. We did the same thing in Africa, we gave 300 scholarships to the Congo. That is more scholarships than we gave to all of Africa in the preceding 2 years. Isn't it possible to make a judgment on these matters some time ahead and not wait until we are forced to do a generous act? [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. What must we do, Senator Kennedy, to get a really effective Federal aid to education hill through the Congress and into law?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The Federal aid to education bill has been passed in the Senate, it has passed the House, it has never passed the Senate and the House. I must say that I do believe that in this area a Democratic administration working with clear Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, I think could do the job. The problem is now that there are some members of the Democratic Party who oppose it. Every bill we put forward has been threatened with a veto by the President, and, therefore it is tied up in parliamentary procedures and hangs under the threat of veto, and we never can get a clearcut vote in the House and the Senate and a signature by the President.', 'I must say I think the next Congress should pass a Federal aid to education bill and teachers salaries. If we control the Congress it will pass. If we have a Democratic President. I am confident that he will sign it. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. What legislation do you have in preparation on the civil rights issue?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think I will say two or three things. First, there is a good deal that can be done by the executive branch without legislation. For example, the President could sign an Executive order ending discrimination in housing tomorrow. Second, the President could compel all companies which do business with the Government, and after all that is nearly every American company, to practice open, fair hiring of personnel without regard to race, creed, or color. So there are two or three things that Federal Government can do in the executive branch without congressional action. In addition, the Department of Justice can pursue the right to vote with far more vigor. The Vice President's Commission on Contracts has been completely ineffective. It has not instituted one suit outside of the District of Columbia. So I would say that the greater opportunity is in the executive branch without congressional action. The things I would ask the Congress to do are really two-fold. First, to pass title 3, which gives the Attorney General additional powers to institute suits to provide for constitutional rights."", 'Secondly, some assistance to school districts that are trying to desegregate, and third, provide technical assistance to school districts, that are trying to desegregate. I would say the change in title 3 plus vigorous Executive action will provide for more protection for Constitutional rights. I think that the failure of the President to indicate his endorsement of the Supreme Court decisions has cost us heavily. I hope the next President of the United States, states that he stands for equal rights, that he stands for a fair chance for all Americans to have a decent education, to get a job and to hold it. I think the Democratic Party stands for that principle, and win or lose, I think we are going to continue to fight for it as Hubert and Gene and others have done in the State.', 'May I express my thanks to all of you. I feel that this election, as I said at the beginning, can be won. I think it is a close election. It may be decided by a few percentages. Harry Truman carried Ohio by 7,000 votes in 1948 and Illinois by 17,000. He won that election. We can begin this election and it may be won in the State of Minnesota. I can assure you that if we do win it [applause] can assure you if we do win it, we are going to give the green light and say ""Yes"" to the 1960\'s. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
200,John F. Kennedy ,"October 02, 1960","['Much is different between 1948 and 1960 - but much is the same. It was 2 years earlier, in 1946, that President Truman brought to Fulton College one of the great figures of the English-speaking world. And on that historic day in March, Winston Churchill bluntly confronted our Nation and the world with the fact that ""from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent.""', 'He warned the world that ""time is plenty short,"" that we cannot ""take the course of allowing events to drift along until it is too late,"" and that ""our difficulties and dangers will not be removed by closing our eyes to them [or] by merely waiting to see what happens."" He called for action to establish conditions of freedom throughout the world to strengthen our Western alliances and the United Nations. And he particularly emphasized these words which have meaning for us today:', '""From what I have seen of our Russian friends and allies during this war, I am convinced that there is nothing they admire so much as strength and there is nothing for which they have less respect than weakness. We cannot afford, if we can help it, to work on narrow margins offering temptations to the trial of strength."" These prophetic words of 1946 are even more true in 1960. If we are to protect our heritage of freedom - if we are to maintain it around the world - we must be strong - militarily, economically, educationally and morally strong. And that is why I am dedicating this campaign to the goal of a stronger America - to the proposition that this Nation is strong but can and must be stronger.', 'Mr. Nixon says that my call for a stronger America demonstrates a lack of confidence. If by that he means a lack of confidence in Republican leadership - if by that he means a lack of confidence in the policies and platform of his party - if by that he means a lack of confidence in the same Republican campaign promises that have been repeatedly broken during the last 8 years - then he is absolutely correct - I do lack confidence in that kind of leadership, and so do the American people.', ""But I have great confidence in the people of this State and Nation. I have confidence that this country is strong enough to permit free and open discussion of our needs and shortcomings. I have confidence in our ability to close the missile gap, to modernize our conventional forces, and to give this country the kind of defensive strength it needs to stop the next war before it starts; the kind of strength Stu Symington pointed out we would need many years ago. I have confidence in this Nation's ability to look out for its older citizens - to see that they have a decent pension, a decent home, and decent medical care. The people who oppose this program today, under Mr. Nixon's leadership, are the very same people from the very same party who used the very same arguments against social security a generation ago. They said it would mortgage our future and socialize our economy. But the Democratic Party under Franklin Roosevelt had confidence in America then - and I have equal confidence that we can take better care of our older people today."", 'I have confidence in an America where the farmer does not have to be a second-class citizen - where he can obtain through Government help the same share of the national income and the same kind of bargaining power and the same return on his capital and services as his cousins in management and labor. I think it is time that this Nation faced up to the agricultural revolution which has brought us so much abundance - that we forget about reshuffling the Benson program, as Mr. Nixon proposed, which will only bring us more farm surpluses and more farm foreclosures - and concentrate instead on a program of supply management which will give to each farmer his full parity of income.', 'I have confidence in an America able to afford the best schools and the best teachers in the world - an America where no one is denied his full constitutional rights by reason of his race or religion - an America where every family lives in a decent home in a decent neighborhood - an America where the cost of living is not completely beyond those who work for a living - particularly those receiving an inadequate minimum wage of $1 an hour.', 'I have confidence that America is capable of operating at full capacity - that we could consume in new schools and hospitals and dams and highways the full output of our steel mills now operating at only half their capacity. And the same is true of the coal mines in West Virginia and the textile mills in Massachusetts and the lead mines here in Missouri.', 'I have confidence in an America that can meet the economic challenge of the Soviet Union - this challenge to outdo us in economic growth in heavy industry, in agriculture, and in one particularly vital area of national strength: the development of electric power.', ""America's power production is the greatest in the world. But, as I pointed out in last week's debate, that superiority is threatened by growing Soviet power development - a growth which is so rapid that it threatens to overtake us by 1975 if we continue to stand still. Mr. Nixon says this statement is false. He boasts of tremendous progress in power development during the last 8 years - and he asserts that the Russians could overtake us only if we did nothing for 15 years while they built eight Grand Coulees a year."", 'That is his charge. What are the facts?', 'The facts were reported last year by a committee of the same U.S. Senate over which Mr. Nixon presides. That committee\'s findings, and I quote - were that ""although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians couldd overtake us in 1975 - in 15 years - unless we speed up or they slow down.""', 'For, they pointed out, under current plans and projections ""both countries will have equal power-generating capacity, which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975.""', 'It would not take eight Grand Coulees a year to bridge this gap by 1975. It would not even take three.', 'And the facts of the matter are that this year the Soviets are building three dams larger than Grand Coulee, two of which are more than twice as large and what have the Republicans been doing in the meantime? Ask your local REA director about what has happened on generation and transmission facilities. Ask the people who live in our great river valleys whether our rate of power expansion increased as fast as it did before. Ask the Army Engineers to list all the projects Mr. Nixon talks about, and you find out, contrary to his implication, they are not power projects, they are not public projects and they were not initiated by the Republican Party.', 'It\'s time to get moving again on power development - to help our farmers and small businessmen and homeowners obtain cheaper electricity to help our industries to expand - to help our defense production disperse and expand to match the growing Russian menace. For if we should ever offer what Churchill called ""temptation to a trial of strength"" there would be no time then to build new dams or new plants or even new missiles.', ""This is the time to act. And regardless of Mr. Nixon's charges, I intend to keep pressing for action.""]"

It seems that at 42 he was too old. It does show that perhaps experience doesn't count. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'Massachusetts and Missouri are closely linked in the history of the United States. Both have been cradles of American freedom. The French who founded the city of St. Louis and the Germans who came after were searching for a freedom stronger and better than they had ever known, and if there is one principle that has stood out in the careers of the men that this State has sent to Washington, it has been their devotion to freedom and their willingness to fight for it. If there is one principle that has stood out in the career of Senator Stuart Symington, it is the principle that to protect individual liberties you must be strong as a nation. And there is one principle which stood out in the career of the late beloved Senator Hennings. It was that to be strong we must protect individual liberties.

They said then it would mortgage our future and socialize our economy. But the Democratic Party of Franklin Roosevelt had confidence in the United States, and I have equal confidence that we can do a far better job than this administration has done in this area, as in so many others. I have confidence in an America where the farmer is not treated as a second-class citizen, where he can obtain, through joint action, by his own efforts and the co-ops and governmental action, the kind of bargaining power in the marketplace that will permit him to have a decent, livable income. I think it is time that this Nation faced up to the agricultural revolution which is a great asset, which is a great source of defense, which is a great source of peace, and a great source of security to us in a hungry world. And I cannot believe that the same programs which have left us with $9 billion of surplus food rotting away in a country which has over 4 million people living on surplus food packages, and hundreds of millions around the world - I cannot believe that the American people in 1960 are going to endorse that kind of an agricultural program again. I think we can do a better job. [Applause.]"", ""We have confidence in the United States. That is the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats this year. They say we have never had it so good, and we say we can do better. They say they have never done so much, and I say we can do more. And I say we have to do more, because if the United States is not prepared to realize its potential to the fullest, to have the best educational system in the world, to give our citizens their equal constitutional rights, to move ahead as a vital and strong economy, then this country is not going to be able to sustain itself and will not serve as the chief defender of freedom around the world. What has been good enough in the past will not be good enough in the 1960's. The United States has no other country to which it can turn, if world events go against us. We are the only sentinel at the gate. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us for our own survival, as well as for our responsibility to the cause of freedom all over the globe, that we move ahead in all these areas, that we build a stronger and more vital society here in the United States, one that can serve as an inspiration to people all around the world, who stand today on the razor edge of decision, trying to decide whether the future belongs to the Communists or whether it belongs to us. I think it belongs to us, but I do not believe it is going to belong to us merely by wishing it. I think it will come when the next President of the United States sets before the American people the unfinished business of our society, our national goals, what we must hope to achieve in the next 10 years, if we are going to maintain our independence, if we are going to build our strength, if we are going to provide greater security for ourselves and for those who wish to move in the same direction that we are moving."", 'Latin America and Africa and Asia all stand now wondering which road to take. They will come with us if we can demonstrate here in this country that we are moving ahead, that we are solving our problems, and that we are holding out the hand of friendship to them. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman were successful in their foreign policy was because they were successsful in their own country.

The New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt was the domestic counterpart of the good neighbor policy, and the Fair Deal of President Truman had its match in the Marshall plan and NATO and point 4 and the Truman doctrine. You cannot move abroad unless you move at home.', 'Mr. Nixon has said that ""I am a conservative at home and a risk-taker abroad."" I am neither. I do not believe that in the United States and in the world, as difficult and somber as tbe world around us, I think we need a progressive at home, a progressive society, one that moves ahead, one that solves its problems, one that serves as an example, as it sits on a most conspicuous stage.', 'That is the decision before the people of the United States this year, which road they want to take; whether they feel what we are now doing is good enough or whether they have confidence that there are unrealized powers in our free society. I think that in 1960 the American people are going to say ""Yes"" to the next 10 years. They are going to give it the green light. [Applause.]', 'As one indication of how serious is the debate now taking place, last week, Monday night in the debate, I said that our power superiority is threatened by growing Soviet hydropower, a growth which is so rapid that it threatens to overtake the United States by 1975. Mr. Nixon said later this week that that statement was false. He boasts of tremendous power development during the past 8 years, and he asserted that the Russians can overtake us only if we did nothing for 15 years, while they built eight Grand Coulee Dams a year. That is his charge and what are the facts? The facts were reported last year by a committee of the U.S. Senate, over which Mr. Nixon occasionally presides. [Laughter.] That committee\'s findings, and I quote, were ""Although the United States is still far ahead, the Russians could overtake us in 1975, in 15 years, unless we speed up or they slow down. Both countries will have,"" the Senate said, ""an equal power generating capacity which will be 337,500,000 kilowatts in 1975.""', 'It would not take eight Grand Coulee Dams a year to bridge the gap. It would not even take three. The facts of the matter are that this year the Soviets are building three dams larger than Grand Coulee, two of which are more than twice as large.', ""On this issue of power development, economic growth, of better schools, of a sound agricultural program, of moving ahead in a whole variety of areas, I think there is a very sharp difference between the two political parties. Mr. Nixon has said recently that parties don't count, what counts are the men. But I think what counts are the kinds of parties and the kind of men that those parties produce. I would not have been nominated by the Republican Party, nor would have Harry Truman, and the Democrats never would have nominated Richard Nixon. [Applause.] The fact is that the parties tell something. The political parties run like rivers through the history of this country, and their force and power and direction, and the movement of the flow all tell something about the movement in the future. What is past is prologue and the record of our two parties is written for the future as it has been for the past. I think the Democratic Party has again a rendezvous with destiny, an opportunity to be of service, not only to ourselves, not only to our own country, but to all those who look to us."", 'Wilson, Roosevelt, and Truman have been the Democratic Presidents who have led this country in the 20th century. McKinley, Coolidge, Harding, Landon, Dewey, and the Vice President have led the Republican Party in the 20th century. I cannot believe, faced with the difficult problems that this country now faces, that the American people are going to turn back to a Republican leadership. I cannot believe that the American people are going to say in 1960 that we have never had it so good, and we want more of the same. I think they are going to want to cross the new frontier. [Applause.]', 'I think that all those who agree that we never want to have a trial of strength agree that it is incumbent upon us to rebuild the strength of the United States.', 'In 1964, this city will observe its 200th anniversary. I hope the next President of the United States comes to that occasion, and I hope he is able to say that this country has turned the corner, that the tide of history is once more moving in the direction of freedom, that America is on the way. I do not say that that job will be easy. During the next 4 years, the American Presidency will be at all times what Harry Truman called ""the loneliest job in the world."" There will be dangers and difficulties on every side for our country. There will be crises, both within and without. But it is, I think, our intention to bear in mind the words of Lincoln during the darkest days of the Civil War. Many were fearful of the outcome and many were concerned about our survival, and when a delegation called on the President to express its fears, Lincoln told them of an experience of his youth. ""One night in November,"" he said, ""a shower of meteors fell from the clear night sky. A friend standing by was frightened. But I looked up and between the falling stars I saw the fixed stars beyond, shining serene in the firmament, and I said, \'Let us not mind the meteors, let us keep our eyes on the stars.\' ""', 'As we face a difficult and sometimes dangerous future, let us look beyond the fiery meteors of the present and look to the steady stars that have guided this country through so many difficult times. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
202,John F. Kennedy ,"October 02, 1960","['Mr. Nixon has said that his goals and mine are the same - that we only differ as to means.', 'But our goals are not the same. I want a $1.25 an hour minimum wage, medical care for the aged through social security, Federal aid to help raise teachers salaries as well as schools, an adequate program of slum clearance and low-rent housing, and a program of aid to areas of chronic unemployment which would include northern Minnesota.', ""These are my goals. But they are not Mr. Nixon's goals. They are not the goals of his party, and Mr. Nixon and his party have opposed and killed every one of these programs."", 'And their opposition - an opposition born of indifference to the urgent needs of the American people - has helped transform the Duluth-Superior area into a section of declining income, and increasing unemployment.', 'But northern Minnesota has not been the only area to suffer. This Nation today has more than 126 areas of substantial unemployment - almost 4 million Americans out of work - and 1 out of every 10 Americans struggle to support themselves and their families without any job, or with only part-time work. If your mining areas are depressed - it is because mining areas all over the Nation are depressed - and our vital steel industry is being allowed to operate at barely 50 percent of capacity.', 'If your farmers are losing income - it is because farmers everywhere are losing income.', ""If your economy has stopped growing - it is because America's economy has virtually come to a halt."", 'If the strength and vitality of northern Minnesota are in danger - it is because the strength and vitality of America are in danger.', ""For your problems are America's problems and the worlds problems - and the party that has not helped you will not be able to help America, or the world."", 'Twice a Democratic Congress has passed legislation to bring relief to areas of chronic unemployment such as Duluth-Superior. Our bill would have provided long term development loans and technical assistance to help develop the industry and business which would bring new jobs and increased income to your people. In short, this bill would have done for hard-hit areas of America what we are now doing through development assistance programs for hard-hit areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America.', 'But each time this bill was passed, it was vetoed by the Republican Party - with Mr. Nixon leading the fight for the veto. And for a comprehensive Democratic program the Republicans substituted their own bill - a bill which would have helped no one. A bill better calculated to bring votes instead of jobs - and a bill under which Duluth-Superior would not have qualified for any aid at all.', 'But in 1961, a Democratic Congress will again pass a bill bringing help to northern Minnesota and to the other depressed areas of the country.', 'And here - today - in the heart of Minnesota - I pledge myself to sign that bill.', ""For while Mr. Nixon's goal has been to refuse to help you - my goal is to give you the help you need to put your great port - your rich mines - and your vigorous and determined people back in the service of American greatness and American strength."", 'For America cannot afford to continue to waste her resources and the skills of her people. The implacable Communist drive toward world domination now reaches to within 90 miles of our shores - on the once - friendly island of Cuba - and communism is on the march in Asia, and Africa and the Near East. In the face of such power and determination we cannot afford to falter or lag behind. For only a strong America - an America with a rapidly growing economy where all who want to work can find work - can summon the strength and the will which is vital if freedom and peace are to triumph.']"
203,John F. Kennedy ,"October 02, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Freeman, Congressman Blatnik, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I want to say that I am most indebted to my friend and colleague, Senator Humphrey, for his kind and generous introduction. Hubert and I chased each other all over northern Wisconsin during January, February, and March, and now we run together on a Democratic ticket for the Democratic Party, and a country which we feel can best be led by Democrats in the Senate and in the House and in the executive branch of the Government. [Applause.]', 'Everything that has happened since he was no longer a candidate has been easy. He made it so tough last winter that this fall is very pleasant. I am enjoying it. [Laughter.]', ""Mr. Nixon was staying home in bed when we were running all over Wisconsin and West Virginia, and I think we are ready to continue the fight through the month of October.[Applause.] And I am delighted to be here at this university. Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I don't know which third of the student body is here today of the University of Minnesota in Duluth, but I am confident I am talking to the future rulers of this State and country in the sense that all educated men and women have an obligation to participate, to govern, to join in the great discipline of self-government, and I am proud to be here and I am proud of the fact that the Governor of this State has been farsighted enough to know that no State and no country can move ahead without the best educational system in the world."", ""I wish the present administration had had the vision in Washington that he has had in the State of Minnesota. [Applause.] And I am delighted to be here with John Blatnik. He and I came to Congress the same year, 14 years ago. He came after a distinguished war record, and he has served this State and country in peace. He speaks for this district, but he also speaks for the United States. He represents the kind of man of integrity and vigor which I think this country is going to need if it is going to move ahead, if it is going to meet his obligations. This is an important election, and I think the people of Minnesota have a most important judgment and decision to make. Mr. Nixon said on Monday night, and he said on other occasions, that parties don't make much difference, what counts is the man. I think what counts is the kind of a man a political party chooses. Mr. Nixon and I were not suddenly discovered after our two conventions. We have not been kept in ice. We are part of a long tradition, both of us, of a political service and political philosophy which stretches back in the case of the Democratic Party to the beginning of this country, and stretches back over 100 years in the case of the Republican Party, and consistently, on issue after issue, the two parties have taken different positions, because they represent different interests. The Democratic Party is the only national party in the United States. It is composed of miners and farmers. It is composed of potato growers in Maine. It is composed of fishermen in Washington State. It is composed of ranchers in Texas and peanut farmers in Georgia. It is composed of all the interests in the United States and, therefore, speaks for the people."", ""The base of the Republican Party is far narrower. It is not accident that the President in this century who broke away from the boundaries which had been set by his party was Theodore Roosevelt, and they read him out of the party in 1912, or he left, and the reason is simple. A Republican candidate and a Republican President, representing as he does those interests and members of the Republican Party, must take a particular position on a particular issue. Is it any accident that for the last 25 years the Republicans have voted against the minimum wage nearly every time? They voted against the 25 cents in 1935, and they voted against the $1.25 in 1960. They voted against the social security in 1935, and they voted against the medical care for the aged in 1960. They opposed unemployment compensation in the thirties, after the State of Wisconsin had originally invented it, and they opposed Federal standards for unemployment compensation in 1958 and 1959. Parties do mean something. If they don't mean something we ought to get rid of them. If parties don't tell us something about the political philosophy of a man, then it means that our parties have outrun their usefulness."", 'But they do tell us something. They do give us a point of view. Mr. Nixon never would have been nominated by the Democratic Party and I never would have been nominated by the Republican Party, because he does not agree with us and we do not agree with him. [Applause.]', 'On Monday night he said the goals of both parties are the same, the means are different.', ""I do not accept that view. I do not accept the view that the Republican Party's goals and our goals are the same, because if they are the same, why have they opposed progressive social legislation during the last quarter of a century? Why have they not been willing to grasp the future? Why have they not been willing to recognize that the United States moves in a difficult and dangerous time that requires a maximum effort? I don't think any Democratic President would have run this summer on the party labels that they had originally designed in the most dangerous time in the life of our country. I don't think any Democratic President would have counted the first vote of the United Nations, 70 to nothing, as a great success for the United States and felt that what was happening at the United Nations was a source of strength to us."", 'It is no accident Mr. Khrushchev spends a month there. He is a busy man. He thinks he is fulfilling a useful purpose. Day in and day out he confers with the neutralists, attempting to win their loyalty, attempting to win their commitments, as he has in the case of Cuba, as he is beginning to do in the case of Guinea and Ghana. He is a busy man. If he will stay in New York until October 15, it is because he feels that the time is moving in his direction. Before the United Nations ends, there will be other votes, and we will see what should be apparent, that the prestige and power of the United States is not increasing in relationship to that of a Communist world, that we are moving in the most hazardous period that this country has ever moved in, and I do not say that because I enjoy saying it. It is because I think it is the function of the Democratic Party in this election, as the only opposition party, as the only means of presenting alternative courses of action, to sound the alarm bell in the night.', 'The American people have 6 weeks in which to make a judgment as to what kind of America and what kind of a future they want. I hope that they give us the opportunity to serve this country, not because the future is easy, but because I think the future can be realized as a bright and promising one for us, and for the cause of freedom if we are willing to recognize facts as they are, if we are willing to recognize that there is an opportunity for us, but that it cannot be seized by dismissing the world around us as one which is bright and promising and moving in our direction.', ""In the next 4 years, in the next 8 years, in the next administration of the next President, Africa, Latin America, and Asia will all change. The question is, Will they move with us or will they move with Mr. Khrushchev? Will they decide that the future belongs to him or to us? Will they decide that they want to mobilize their resources through a system of freedom or will they determine that the way of the future is in the East, not the West? All this is tied into the problems that this district faces. This is a great boiler in the U.S. economy. The reason that this section of Minnesota has suffered three recessions in recent years is because the economy of the United States has not been moving. We are producing 50 percent of our capacity in steel. Last week, the Soviet Union outproduced us, not because they have more capacity - they have less than half our capacity - but they are using their capacity to the fullest. Here we are with a great food reserve, the strongest in the world, and yet we have not used that in an imaginative way. We are not using our steel capacity. We are not using our iron ore capacity. We are not using the St. Lawrence Seaway to capacity. This country cannot possibly maintain itself unless it moves here at home. If this country moves at home, if we maintain full employment, if we meet our responsibilities to our own citizens, if we spread the same image of vitality abroad, then I think those people who stand today on the razor edge of decision may decide that we represent the future, the Communist system the past. We, after all, represent the kind of country in which they want to live. They do not want to move to the East. Most of them have not thrown out colonial powers in order to substitute that of the Soviet Union. I believe that we can change the movement of history. I believe that the brightest days as far as service are not even those of Wilson or Roosevelt - I believe in the 1960's the United States can fulfill destiny as the great defender of freedom at a time of maximum danger."", 'But it requires us to realize where we are, and what we must do. It requires the next President of the United States to set before the American people our unfinished business, to give an impression around the world of force and vitality. ""That which we do here, that which we are,"" as Emerson said, ""speaks far louder than what we say."" I am tired of seeing us follow the advice of the poet ""to take the cash and let the credit go, nor heed the rumble of a distant drum."" I heed that rumble and I am sure the American people do.']"

When Andrew Jackson seized control of the great bank, the Senate of the United States, dominated by the Whigs, who were the forefathers of the Republican Party, they censured him in the U.S. Senate. They say we are not in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson. They did everything they could to ruin Woodrow Wilson's life. At the end of the World War I, they led the fight against the League of Nations. They say, the Republicans, that we are not in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt. They fought Franklin Roosevelt four times. They tried to block every piece of progressive legislation that he put forward, and they say we are not in the tradition of Harry Truman. They despised Harry Truman and he beat them again and again and again. We stand in the Democratic tradition. The Republicans fight us in our day as they have fought every progressive piece of legislation since the time of Lincoln.

This district here in northern Minnesota has had three recessions in 8 years. Here in 1960, after the recession of 1958, the steel strike of 1959, we see the steel mills of the United States working 50 percent of capacity. Steel is the basis of industrial power. How can the United States meet its commitments around the world and to our own people if we use our capacity 50 percent? And it isn't just the steel mills; it is the men. One hundred thousand steelworkers are out of work in the steel mills, with others working part time, and you feel it back here where it all begins. This is the Iron Range and the Iron Range is the power of the United States. I believe we need an administration that will put this country to work again, that will move this country forward.

We cannot afford to stand still. If we cause our efforts, if we rest on our oars, if we are unable to use our capacity to the fullest, who is going to defend the United States when trouble comes? Who is going to speak for us? Who is going to come to our rescue? We depend upon ourselves. We depend upon our own strength. We depend upon our own right arms, and the United States, depending as it does upon itself, the world of freedom depending upon the United States, cannot afford to stand still, cannot afford to look back, cannot afford to rest on its oars, cannot afford to stand still in the sixties. I think that is the very clear test the very clear choice that the American people are being offered. Do you want to say ""Yes"" to the sixties? Do you want a green light to the next 10 years? Or do we want to continue to drift, letting the world explode around us, not using our capacity to the fullest, always on the border of a recession, always taking a risk with our national defense, always seeing people newly emerging who begin to look to the Far East instead of the Far West. I want the people of Africa and the people of Latin America to look to us as they once looked to Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.

It rests upon the power of the United States. The people of the world can make a judgment as to which way history is moving. A Gallup poll taken in February among 10 countries scattered around the world, was very revealing. It said to them which country do you think will be ahead by 1970 scientifically and militarily? And a majority of the people in every country, except Greece, said the Soviet Union will be first militarily and scientifically.', 'Why should it be? The Soviet Union was the most backward country in Europe 40 years ago. If they are able to convince the people of the world that they are going to be No.1, that they are going to be the leader in 1970, what are the leaders of these underdeveloped countries going to say? Which way will they want to go? They want to tie in with the future, and if they think the future belongs to the Communists, they will move with them. If they think the future belongs to us, they will move with us. I think the future belongs to us. I think it can belong to us. But it cannot belong to us possibly, and this we might just as well understand, because we will see it in the sixties, it cannot possibly belong to us if we are content with being second in space, if we are content to turn out one half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union, if we are content to use our steel capacity 50 percent.', 'Last week the Soviet Union produced more than we did in steel, not because we could not produce twice as much, but because we did not, because the economic and fiscal policies of this administration, because the leadership of this administration, because the vision of the Republican Party has put a damper on our energies at the one time that we need it.

It is a beautiful hat."", ""I am grateful for Joe Karth's introduction.

In the U.S. Senate we are given the responsibility of ratifying treaties and confirming presidential appointments. The House of Representatives, however, is given far greater power. They are given the power to levy taxes and appropriate money. So any time you don't like the way your money is being spent or what the taxes are, do not write to Senator Humphrey, McCarthy, or me, but write to Congressman Karth. [Applause and laughter.]"", ""Actually, he represents the kind of able, vigorous progressive Congressman, in fact public servant, that I think this country needs. I think this is an important election. I know that candidates say that about every election. But I think in many ways the issues which face the United States in 1960 are the most significant that we have ever faced, even more significant than 1932, because in 1932 the issue was whether freedom would remain here in the United States. I think the question in 1960 is whether it will remain around the world. I don't think it is any accident that Mr. Khrushchev spends a month at the United Nations. He is a busy man. He is the dictator of a large country which has many projects at home and abroad, but he chooses to spend a month at the United Nations. Many of us in the United States have rather igiiored the United Nations, and Presidents have visited it for a day and made a speech, and then gone back to Washington and the United Nations continues. Why does he spend a month there? Why do all the members of his empire come with him?. Why does Nasser and those from every other nation around the world come to the United Nations this year? He is there for a very significant reason, and he stays there for a very significant reason, and that is because he realizes that the balance of power now hangs in the finest balance that it has hung in the last 2,000 years; that if he can win the loyalty and good will, if he can win a commitment to the future from the leaders of Africa, who are not committed to any course of action today, the leaders of Asia, if Castro can spread his influence throughout all of Latin America, then the balance of power will begin to move in the direction of the Communist world, and his future and the Communist future is assured. That is why I say 1960 is the most significant time in the history of not only the American Republic, but I think the history of freedom."", 'What course of action in the next 10 years will these people take? We have seen in the case of Guinea that they moved in the direction of the Communists. We have seen it in the case of Ghana, when Mr. Herter said, somewhat unwisely, I think, that the Ghana Government has moved in the direction of the Communists. We have seen it in the case of powerful groups in the Congo. Three countries of Africa, newly independent in the last 2 years, have begun to move in the direction of the Communists. We have seen it in the case of Cuba. India hangs in the balance. These are the most vital days of our lives, and when I said the other day that I was tired of reading about Castro and Khrushchev, and I wanted to read what the United States was doing and what the President of the United States is doing, I meant it, because these are dangerous times. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon in this morning's paper chose to regard that as a personal attack on President Eisenhower and he came to President Eisenhower's defense. He is going to be coming to President Elsenhower's defense in the next 5 weeks. During August, he was coming to Governor Rockefeller's defense, and he wasn't mentioning the President, and he was not in September. But now he is attempting to embrace the President. I don't quarrel with the President of the United States. The question is the future. The question is not President Eisenhower but President Nixon. That is the question the American people have to contend with in the next 6 weeks. Do they want to move in the direction of Mr. Nixon; do they want to move in the direction of the Republican Party, or do they want to move with progress? Do they want to say in the 1960's that the United States is ready to move ahead? Do they want to say to the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America that here in the United States is a strong and vital society that represents a far greater hope for the future than the Communist system which is as old as Egypt. We represent, we think, the way of the future. Mr. Khrushchev says we are a sick and dying and faltering horse that is about to collapse into the ground. I don't believe it. I don't believe that the people of Africa have become independent in order to sell their birthright to communism. I don't think the people of Eastern Europe, who have demonstrated in the last 10 years what they think of the Communist system are prepared to say that the Communist system represents the way to the future. The Communists hold an empire, and I feel if we remain strong in this country, if we are building our economy, if we are building a vital society, if we are practicing what we preach and what we are, then what we are will be far stronger than what we say we are."", 'We have a chance to demonstrate that freedom can work. The next President of the United States must personify the spirit of this great society of ours, he must set before us the things we must do, if by the year 1970 we are not only going to be free but strong and moving here and around the world.', 'I think the opportunity before the United States is bright. In many ways, our time is like the time Dickens described at the beginning of his book: ""It was the best of times and the worst of times."" It is the worst of times because we face the most severe challenge that we have ever faced, and because in many ways the future will be somber. But it is the best of times because we have a chance to strike a blow, not only for our own security but for the freedom of those who look to us for assistance and succor, who look to us for an example of what freedom can do. Here in the last 8 years, I think the United States has drifted. At the time of the Congo crisis, the United States offered scholarships to the Congo; at the time of the break with Castro, we offered aid in Latin America. What were we doing for the last 8 years in regard to Africa and Latin America that it was necessary for us to be reminded by Mr. Castro and by the threat of Communist takeover in the Congo that Africa is--? Foresight is needed by the next administration. What were we doing in the early fifties when the Soviet Union was making a decisive breakthrough in outer space? It is because we have drifted with the times. It is because we have been rowing across what we thought were passive seas, ignoring the subterranean explosions underground that we find ourselves today faced with the most serious crises that we have ever known.', ""I don't run for the office of the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy. But I run for the office of the Presidency with the greatest possible confidence in this country. Mr. Nixon says I downgrade America. I downgrade the leadership, but I do not downgrade America. I have the greatest confidence in it. [Applause.] And I think that if we go to work, if we start this country moving again, that the cause of freedom will not only endure but it will prevail. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
207,John F. Kennedy ,"October 02, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Humphrey, Governor Freeman, Congressmen, Mr. Thatcher, gentlemen: I want to express great appreciation to Hubert. As I told him this morning, having to run against him in a couple of States, it is like playing Ohio State, and then having to play Harvard. It is much easier to play Harvard after you have played Ohio State. So I find this fall not as difficult as last spring, in many ways. I am here today with him because we all agree in common that the problems that American agriculture faces I believe is the No.1 domestic problem. The reason, of course, is a simple one. From 12 to 13 percent of the population have a steadily diminishing income and sooner or later it spreads its influence to the rest of the country. Farmers are the No.1 market for the auto industry, and the auto industry is the No.1 market for the steel industry. Sooner or later if farming comes to decline, the economy of the rest of the country declines. Therefore, as I come from Boston, Mass., not a great agricultural center, and from Massachusetts, I also serve the United States, and the economy of the United States is interdependent, and, therefore, I believe that on the front of the desk of the next President of the United States is going to have to be the problems of American agriculture.', ""One of the most unfortunate factors, I think, of present agricultural policies has been the effort to persuade people from the cities and towns of the United States that a satisfactory farm income is going to serve them unsatisfactorily. When I ran for reelection to the Senate in 1958, the chairman of the Republican National Committee came to Massachusetts and said I had voted for higher support prices which were against the interests of the people of my State. I said I didn't think so at all. The people of my state of Massachusetts could not possibly sell fish and television sets and shirts to the people of Minnesota or Wisconsin or the Dakotas or Montana unless the people of the Dakotas and Montana and Wisconsin and Minnesota were able to sell their agricultural products at a decent price."", ""The American economy is interdependent, and a decline in one area inevitably brings a decline in another. I feel this is an important principle and I think the Democratic Party has an opportunity to make a real contribution in----------this point. The reason we have not been able to rebuild our older cities of the East is too often Congressmen and Senators from the agricultural areas vote against us. They don't serve the farmer by keeping slums in the cities of Boston and New York, and the Congressmen and Senators from the urban areas of the United States do not serve their people by depressing farm income. The Democratic Party is a national party. I think this year we have a chance to emphasize the interdependence of the American economy, that when one section and another section join together, then the economy of this country begins to move forward."", 'So I emphasize, though I come from an urban section of the United States, I think we have a chance to make a real contribution to the farm families with whom you work.', 'Secondly, we had a good chance to see this in action. When our bill, which Senator Proxmire and Senator Humphrey and I cosponsored in the Senate came to a vote in August, to increase the support price for B milk from, I think, $3.05 to $3.24 or $3.25, I was able to persuade the members from New England in the Congress, in the House of Representatives, to support that bill, because I emphasized this point, that we can never get movement on the things that we need in our own section unless we also recognize that we must cooperate together in lifting the economy of this country. So I hope that if I am successful in this election and if we do control the House and Senate, which I believe we will, if we do have Democratic Governors like Orville Freeman, that we can emphasize the national state in a prosperous agriculture.', 'Mr. Nixon on the debate on Monday night said that the farm program which I suggested would increase prices to the consumer. The old game of trying to turn the city against the farmer. Now, how much does a farmer get out of a loaf of bread, and how much of his income was up, a dairy farmer, how much would that cost the consumer? Very, very little as we know. Three cents on a loaf of bread which may cost 25 cents; 6 1/2 cents on a quart of milk which may sell for 25 or 26 or 27 cents, eggs, cotton - as Hubert said last night to me, it cost more to launder this shirt in the hotel where we were staying than the cotton farmer gets for the cotton that he sold for this shirt. [Laughter.] So I think that in trying to improve farm income we serve the consumer and the farmer and the country.', 'Now, let me say that there are four principles which, if I am successful, will guide us in attempting to develop an agricultural policy.', ""First, let me say that I think that the farm program put forward by the Vice President is much, much more of the same, and I can't believe that farmers in the Middle West are going to buy the same. They are not going to get any guarantee that however bad things are, now they are going to stay this good, because they are going to go down and down and down, because the support price which Mr. Nixon [applause] the support price which Mr. Nixon advocates is not tied to any increase in the cost of the farmer doing business. It is tied to the average market price for the past 3 years, and as that price drops, which it has been for the last 8 years, so the support price will drop. If the support price for corn, which may be higher than the market price this year, the market price for corn, as I said last night, the Governor had said that the figures were 85 cents in St. Paul, Minn., and on Friday, that is the market price, then that was what the support price will be, and down it will go."", ""Mr. Thatcher gave us some figures this morning on what corn was selling for, and barley and oats, in 1932, 6, 8, 10, 12 cents. There is no check on the downward drop of farm income under the program put forward by the Vice President, and you can't eat that amount of surplus, to quote Mr. Benson and Mr. Nixon. [Applause.]"", 'First, let me say that for Secretary of Agriculture we are going to take someone and select someone as Secretary who really has a sympathetic understanding of the problems of the farmer here in the Middle West of the United States. [Applause.]', 'I want a Secretary of Agriculture who believes in and follows the principles of farmer-elected committees of farmers to carry out farm programs on the local and county levels.', 'Secondly, we must make the fullest use consistent with our national interest of any agricultural abundance. I talked about that briefly last night in our own country. We are not doing a job at all that we ought to be doing, distributing our farm abundance to those Americans who need help. We are not doing it in Europe. We are not doing it in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Someone said to me recently if Mr. Khrushchev had his choice of 50 of the best farmers in the United States and 50 percent of our scientists, he would take our farmers, because this is a great asset that we have in this country, and an asset that he wants.', 'He always has emphasized food production in his whole career. He runs to the Middle West, and Koslov comes and Mikoyan comes, because they want to know the secret of how we can produce so much food with so few people, and if they can master that secret, then they are going to use that as a great weapon in the cold war.', ""I don't think we should use food as a weapon in the cold war. I think we should hold out the hands of friendship and I think the bread we float on the water will come back to us, many times over in the coming years. [Applause.]"", 'Here is an example of how we can really help our friends abroad and also our farmers. The Democratic Congress, in 1958, specifically passed a law authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to buy farm-produced fats and oils for relief feeding abroad. This was done at the suggestion of the National Council of Churches, which had distributed very successfully with other church groups, a good deal of our agricultural produce in countries that needed it. These church organizations of all faith have requested Mr. Benson for some fats and oils to be used as part of their program over all the world. They donate their time and effort to distributing these goods, but the Secretary of Agriculture has consistently refused to implement the will of Congress. I think the next President of the United States and the next administration should inaugurate a program of buying soybean oil and cottonseed oil and lard for feeding abroad, and I would do this before harvest time, when the farmers have soybeans to sell, not later when their crop is already owned by the processors.', ""Third, I would support farm program which will raise farm income to full parity levels as soon as it is feasible to do so. By parity income, I mean an income which will give average farm producers a return on their farming investment, their labor, and their managerial effort equal to the returns that are earned by comparable resources in other industries. Parity income should be the yardstick of equity for the farmers. After all, it is income that has real meaning in terms of farmers' needs, and no fairminded American who seeks the same for themselves can possible object to this goal as part of our national policy."", 'Fourth, after all that we have done that can be done to find useful outlets for our food and fiber products, and after we have provided for fully adequate safety reserves for essential farm products, then we must find effective ways to bring supplies into balance under the total expanded demand. We need a positive policy of managing our agricultural surplus in the interest of avoiding waste, and securing fair prices and incomes for the farm people who produce them.', 'There are many different ways and many devices for managing these supplies, and we do not say that every commodity should use the same device. But we are determined to make the laws of supply and demand work for the farmer for a change. [Applause.]', 'Fifth, we must find a way to get credit down for the farmers. Farmers are paying 6 to 8 percent for money that bankers are getting for a good deal less. This is a very good markup, and let me say that I think that the excessive cost of credit is one of the most serious factors affecting not only farmers, but also small businessmen, stretching across the United States.', 'Sixth, I think the Federal crop insurance program must be expanded and revitalized into a program that works. Let me say finally that this is a very difficult problem. I do not underrate. I know that those of you who have worked with it for years know that the technological revolution which is taking place in agriculture has produced many problems in its wake, and anybody who feels that we can bring an instantaneous solution to all the problems misleads. But I do think by the devices which I have suggested, by using the best talent that we can get that we can stop the downward drop in prices and begin again on the upward curve.', 'That is our objective; that is our commitment, and I am confident that this can be done. I want to assure you that I will work as hard as I can, whether I am elected President of the United States or whether I continue in the Senate, for a program which in serving agriculture serves the United States, and in serving the United States serves the cause of freedom. We have great assets here, and I think they should be used beneficially.', 'The Lord has been good to us and I think we can repay his generosity by devising programs that feed our people well. And also feed those who look to us, whose assistance we need, whose good feeling we welcome, whose identitication of interest is necessary if this country is going to maintain its position.', 'You work with farmers who serve the cause of freedom, and I want to make it clear to you if I am elected I will join you in that effort.

We passed that bill in 1956 by a vote of 60 to 30 and 93 1/2 percent of the Democratic Senators voted for it and 63 percent of the Republican Senators voted against it.', 'That bill passed the Senate three times. It passed the House twice. And both times the Republicans vetoed it. At first the Republicans had no program at all. After the second vote, with an election year coming on, they submitted a token bill.', 'Now, in an election year, the Republicans are pretending that their token bill will provide more help than the Democratic bill. But if you read the fine print in the Republican contract you will see that it cuts the heart out of the program. It requires local sources to raise six or seven times the amount of money that the Federal Government will provide. And local money is precisely what cannot be raised.', 'This is an example of the Republican ""bargain-basement"" approach to economic problems. Mr. Nixon says he agrees with me on our goals for America but differs on the means to reach those goals. I say this is nonsense. The goal is meaningless if he refuses to take the only road that will reach it. And he won\'t take the only road that will reach the goal here in southern Illinois.', 'We have a good comprehensive program hammered out in years of work in the Senate.

209,John F. Kennedy ,"October 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Powell, many thanks; Governor, Congressman Gray, Senator Douglas, Otto Kerner, the next Governor, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to the president and the trustees of Southern Illinois University for their generosity in having us here today, and I am glad to see so many students who are also participating in the profession of politics. Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body we have here today at Southern Illinois university, but I am confident I am talking to the future rulers of America in the sense that all future men and women have an opportunity and an obligation to participate in the discipline of self-government. I come here as the Democratic candidate for the office of the President, and it is my hope that this campaign will serve a useful national function. My responsibility and the responsibility of the Democratic candidates is to present alternative courses of action to our present policy so that the people can make a clear choice, can make a judgment as to what they want their country to be, as to which direction they want their country to go.', ""I believe that there is a clear choice in 1960, as there was in 1948, as there was in 1932, as there was in 1912. I believe that the Democratic Party has once again an opportunity to be of service because I believe that the problems which the United States will face in the 1960's are entirely new, entirely different, and require new people and new solutions. [Applause.]"", 'The hard tough question for the next decade and for this or any other group of Americans is whether this country, with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives, whether that country and that system can successfully, over a long period of time, compete with a totalitarian state, where the total resources of the state, both human and material, are harnessed to the service of the state. How can we, over a long period of time, maintain our position, our strength, our leadership, relative to that of the Communist world? That is the question which faces both parties, and which faces America and which faces all who believe in the cause of freedom. It is for that reason, among others, that I find it particularly distressing that this country, after a recession in 1954, and a recession in 1958, is now moving a short time later, less than 3 years, into a period of plateau, of standstill, with nearly 5 million Americans out of work and nearly 3 million Americans working only part time.', ""Last year, 1959, not a recession year, our economic growth was about one-third that of the Soviet Union and one-half that of Germany, Italy, and France. We are going to have to have double the economic growth we had last year if every student here and their successors in the next 10 years is going to find a useful job. We are going to have to find in the 1960's 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States. And even when we have done that, there are still those eddies, still those islands of unemployment, because of technological changes, because of many conditions. And you have seen it in southern Illinois, and I saw it in the textile towns of Massachusetts, and I spent a month in it with West Virginia and in Kentucky and parts of Pennsylvania."", 'The Federal Government is going to have to devise a better use of its monetary and fiscal powers if it is going to stimulate the growth of our economy. It cannot rely on a high interest rate policy which I believe stifles our expansion, and we have to pass once again and have a President who will sign the area redevelopment bill. [Applause.]', ""I was the floor manager in 1956 for the first Douglas area redevelopment bill. I was a cosponsor of it the second time and a cosponsor the third time. Twice it has been vetoed and there is no indication in 1960 that if we elect a Republican President that he will sign a bill which I think will serve the general need. You cannot possibly agree that it is in the public interest to have communities which have 15, 18, and 20 percent - in my own city of Lawrence 30 percent unemployed for 3 years. What do those Americans do I saw them in West Virginia, over 100,000 families getting surplus food packages and no hope for the future. Unless the Federal Government is willing to devote its energies, unless it is willing to cooperate with local groups in this area, in the field of education, in the field of health, in the field of minimum wages, unless the Federal Government is able to use its powers affirmatively, I don't think then that we can look to the future with the confidence and hope that must be ours if we are not only going to endure but prevail."", 'I believe that the assignments facing the next President of the United States are more difficult than any since the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. In many ways, they are more difficult than any president has faced since the time of Lincoln. And in the time of Lincoln the issue was just the same as the issue that we face now. In his speech in his last debate he repeated his house divided theme, and in that speech he said, ""The question is whether this Nation can exist half slave and half free.""', 'Now the question is whether the world can, and I want to make it clear that I am not satisfied as an American with the drift of events, with a Gallup poll which showed that a majority of people in 10 countries in February believed that the Soviet Union would be ahead of us in science and military power in 1970. You cannot stand still against an adversary who is devoting all of his energies to a movement forward. Mr. Khrushchev spends a month at the United Nations and he is a busy man. He does it in order to further his cause. He knows that in the next decade people in Latin America and Africa and Asia are going to begin to make a judgment as to which side they are going to take, which side represents the best hope for them, which system travels better, communism or freedom. Can our system help them solve their problems, or must they turn to the East? If you think American policy toward these areas has demonstrated any lack of understanding of the serious problems we face, I will name only one incident. We gave last summer at the time of the uprising in the Congo we offered 300 scholarships to the Congo. That was more than the U.S. Government had given to all of Africa in 1959. There are 7 students from that 300 here in the United States today from the Congo, even though over 800 applied. Two years ago, Guinea became free. Three years ago Ghana became free. Guinea and Ghana have both moved in the direction of associating themselves with Soviet policy. Cuba is not the only example.', ""What I am concerned about is in 1970 I don't want to see independent country after independent country begin to move where Guinea and Ghana have gone, where the Congo almost went and may still go, where Cuba has already gone, because for a simple reason they feel that the Communists represent the future, they feel that we are identified with the past, they feel that we are identified with colonialism, they feel that we are identified with the kind of future which they do not want. Why? After all, what we want is their independence. I think it is because the United States in recent years has not demonstrated the vitality here in the United States. I believe that Franklin Roosevelt and Wilson and Truman were successful in their foreign policy because they were moving here at home. Because Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in the United States, he was a good neighbor in Latin America. And what is true of Latin America is true of Africa and true of Asia."", ""Next spring India may have a financial crisis. But I don't hear anybody in this administration concerning themselves with the problems of India which may be the most serious postwar crisis that this country has faced. There is no use offering scholarships to the Congo in 1960. It takes years to educate a man or a woman and prepare them for self-government. There is no use suddenly coming at the point of Castro's pistol and offering economic aid to Latin America, which we did this summer when our relations with Castro became soured. These people know what is going on. Where have we been the last 8 years? What new original concepts of government, what has been associated with American foreign policy to cause people around the world to believe that the Communist system and Communist countries which, 40 years ago, in the case of Russia, the sickest country in Europe, 10 years ago in the case of China was regarded as a country with no future, and now they move, and the question is whether they move fast enough? I believe that this is a great country, but I believe it can be a greater country, and I believe it must be if it is going to maintain its freedom, and is going to maintain its position as the leader of the free world. No one is coming to our assistance if we fail. Only ourselves, and, therefore, I believe that the unfinished business of this society is to begin this country on the upward go, for every citizen to be willing to devote his time and his energy to the service of this country."", ""I do not run for the Presidency saying life will be easy in the 1960's, but I do run for the Presidency with the strong feeling that the United States manifest destiny in 1960 is to serve ourselves and serve the cause of freedom. [Applause.]"", 'Thomas Paine in the American Revolution said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" I believe in 1960 that the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. And I believe that once again the Democratic Party, with stretches back in history longer than any active party now in the world, stretching all the way back to Jefferson - I believe that once again it is going to be called upon for great public service and once again it is going to be given the opportunity to lead this country and start this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. [Applause.]\n', ""I don't believe that the American people in 1960, in these dangerous years of our days, are going to elect a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. I think the American people are going to choose to move forward. [Applause.]"", 'I come here to Illinois tonight and ask your help in this campaign ask your help in moving this country forward again. [Applause.] Some people have said that this campaign is 1928 all over again. For the sake of the farmer, the worker, the merchant, and the teacher, for the sake of those who remember 10-percent interest and 10-cent corn, I trust it will not be 1928 all over again. I trust it will be 1948 all over again. [Applause.]', 'Last Thursday night in my own city of Boston, Mr. Nixon dismissed me, and I will quote him, ""as just another Truman."" I regard that as a great compliment. [Applause.] And I have no hesitation in returning the compliment, I believe Mr. Nixon is another Dewey. [Applause.] Like Mr. Dewey, he represents a do-nothing Republican leadership. Like Mr. Dewey he is a say-nothing candidate. Like Mr. Dewey, he will win nothing in November. [Applause.]', 'I cannot believe that even the Republicans can be happy about a candidate who runs on the slogan ""Party Labels Don\'t Mean Anything."" I believe party labels do mean something, because they tell us something about the candidates, and they tell us something about the philosophy. They tell us something about the future. They tell us how a candidate stands on the great progressive measures which face our country and which must be enacted if our country is going to move forward.', 'In 1948 the people of Illinois made two significant contributions to the future of this country. They not only played a major role in the election of President Truman, but they also sent to Washington a great U.S. Senator, Paul Douglas. [Applause.] And you elected a great Governor in 1948, Adlai Stevenson. [Applause.] And I know in 1960 that this State is going to elect another great Governor, Otto Kerner. And I am confident that the people of this district will send back to the House of Representatives, where he speaks for them and speaks for the country, will reelect your Congressman, Peter Mack. [Applause.]', 'It is traditional for presidential candidates who come to Springfield, Ill., to invoke the name of Abraham Lincoln, and I invoked his name the other night, on Monday night, in the so-called debates or discussions, the precedent of which was, of course, the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 102 years ago. I pointed out that in that 102-year-ago discussion that Abraham Lincoln set the issue here in Springfield, a house divided against itself cannot stand.', '""I believe this Government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.""', 'Today I am convinced that the basic issue which faces the American people and, indeed, the people of the world, is whether the world can exist half slave and half free, whether it will move in the next decade in the direction of freedom or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. That is the great issue which transcends all others. The next President of the United States, whether he is a Republican or a Democrat, must face up to that issue with, to the extent possible, the same vision and courage which Lincoln showed in a comparable case 100 years ago.', 'Some may say that a Democratic candidate for the Presidency has no right to invoke the name of Lincoln. I disagree. Abraham Lincoln belongs to the ages, and he belongs to all Americans, regardless of their party. [Applause.] His boyhood idol was Andrew Jackson. The principles of Jefferson were in his political career and he was nominated and renominated and reelected under the Union Party label. Nevertheless, it is true that the Democrats have never claimed Abraham Lincoln. That has been largely an act of generosity on our part. We can point to Jefferson and Jackson and Wilson and Roosevelt, and Truman.', 'Now, what are we going to do with the Republicans? They can point to Benjamin Harrison, who, according to legend, saw a man forced by the depression to eat grass on the White House lawn, and had only one suggestion for him, that he go around to the back where the grass was longer. [Laughter and applause.]', 'They cannot mention William McKinley who, according to Theodore Roosevelt, had a backbone as firm as a chocolate eclair. [Laughter.] They cannot mention Warren G. Harding who made the Teapot Dome famous. They cannot mention Calvin Coolidge from Massachusetts, who caused a White House usher to say, ""No other President in my time ever slept so much."" [Laughter.] No wonder Coolidge said when they came to him to tell him in the twenties that farm prices were dropping, he said, ""Farmers never made much money. I don\'t think there is much we can do about it."" And they have not done anything about it since then. [Applause.]', ""They don't often mention Herbert Hoover, and they can't mention Theodore Roosevelt, because he left the party in 1912. [Applause.] And I would like to emphasize tonight that I do not believe that Mr. Nixon can claim wholly the mantle of Abraham Lincoln. One hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln was not running on a platform of experience. It was clear that his opponent had far greater experience, as Lincoln's experience was confined to a few obscure years in the House of Representatives. But the country was then suffering from a President with experience, James Buchanan, who had been Congressman, Senator, Ambassador, and Secretary of State. He had been in public service for almost 42 years."", 'Herbert A. Garth, the historian, has written, and he mistakenly believed that he had been learning all the time [laughter], ""I don\'t think experience necessarily counts"" [applause].', 'The three great qualities which characterized Lincoln\'s Presidency were leadership, courage, and foresight, the three qualities that the next President of the United States is going to need in full measure if this country is going to meet the challenges at home and abroad. When he called his wartime Cabinet together to discuss the Emancipation Proclamation, he faced a group of men who were carefully chosen to reflect all views in the country. But Lincoln did not ask them for a compromise, a halfway measure, a consensus. ""I have gathered you together,"" he said, ""to hear what I have written down. I do not wish your advice about the main matter. That I have determined for myself."" This Nation needs that kind of leadership in 1961 from the next President of the United States. [Applause.] And no one needs it more than the farmers of Illinois. [Applause.] I can assure them that they will not find that leadership in a candidate who once praised Mr. Benson as one of the great Secretaries of Agriculture in history, who said in 1958, and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately, ""that the farmer has never had it so good,"" and who revealed his farm policy 2 weeks ago to be a collection of the old Benson fables under new Nixon labels.', '[Response from the audience.]', ""Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Nixon's farm program consists of this one basic principle, that the support price for commodities shall be based on the preceding average market price for the past 3 years. In 1952, corn was selling for $1.50. In Sanborn, Minn., on Friday, it sold for 85 cents. The support price for corn under the Nixon program will be tied to the average market price of the preceding 3 years, and as that price drops, so will the support price, down, down, down, and you have not seen the bottom yet. You have not seen the bottom at 85 cents because there is nothing to prevent it from going down and down as corn comes out of our ears, which it will this year as a result of the Benson program. [Applause.] And this is not a problem just for the farmers of Illinois or the farmers of the United States.. Here in Illinois, International Harvester is shutting down, for various periods of time this fall, seven out of eight plants, throwing 12,400 men out of work. Some of these plants may never reopen. Some of these men may not find a job for a long time. Some of them will be unable to meet their bills on Main Street. And soon hard times will have spread from the farm to the town, from the town to the city, as it did in the twenties. Our farmers are the No.1 customer for Detroit and the automobile industry. Detroit is the No.1 market for the steel industry, and when the farmer ceases to buy equipment, and when he ceases to buy automobiles, and Detroit starts to close down, the steel mills of this country, which are operating today at 54 percent of capacity you cannot tell me that this matter is of concern only to those who live on the farm. It is of concern to all Americans who want our country to fulfill its responsibility, and I cannot believe that in 1960 the farmers of Illinois, Missouri, or any other State are going to vote for more of the same, and that is what they will get. [Applause.]"", 'When Lincoln signed the Homestead Act, he had confidence in the people who till our soil, and in my judgment the next farm program should have two features in it: First, a provision tying support prices to a parity price, so that the farmer has assurances that the price will remain in relationship to the things he has to buy, and, secondly, that there will be controls over production which will prevent these surpluses from hanging over the market and breaking the price. A balance between supply and demand and a support price that protects them is the Democratic program. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, Abraham Lincoln had courage and the next President of the United States will need courage. He knew the storm that would be raised by the Emancipation Proclamation. But when he went to sign that historic document, exhausted from several hours of shaking hands at the White House, he said to those present, ""If my name goes down in history it will be for this act. My whole soul is in it. If my hand trembles when I sign this proclamation, all who examine this document hereafter will say, \'He hesitated\'.""', 'But Lincoln\'s hand did not tremble. He did not hesitate. He did not equivocate, because he was the President of the United States. The Lincoln tradition is not found in a man who considers $1.25 minimum wage to be, and I quote him ""extreme."" The Lincoln tradition of courage [applause] is not found in a man who considers Federal aid for education and teachers salaries to be ""extreme,"" and I quote him accurately, and who calls helping our older citizens through the medium of social security to provide medical care for their aged life - who considers that to be ""extreme.""', 'I do not regard these measures which help our people, including the measure for rebuilding our surplus labor areas, I do not regard them as extreme. I do not regard cleansing our rivers rebuilding our economy, fighting our slums, to be extreme measures. [Applause.]', 'I stand where Franklin Roosevelt stood, and I think in the next few years here in this country we should build a better society, where all Americans, regardless of their race, of their creed and their color, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, have an equal oppportunity to develop their talents. That is what we stand for in 1960. [Applause.]', 'Finally, I said that Abraham Lincoln believed in foresight. During the darkest days of the Civil War, many were fearful of the outcome, and when a delegation called upon the President to express their fears, Lincoln told them of a youthful experience. ""One night in November,"" he said, ""when I was a boy, a shower of meteors fell from a clear November sky. A friend standing by was panicked, but I looked up and between the falling stars, I saw the fixed stars, shining serene in the firmament, and I said, \'Let us not mind the meteors; let us keep our eyes on the stars.\'""', ""In the 1960's this country will need leadership that will keep its eyes on the stars, on the fixed constellations which have guided this country in so many difficult times in the long history, and what are the fixed stars of our constellation? They are confidence in our country, a sense of the progressive, a sense of the new, a sense of willingness to break new ground, a sense of confidence in the people to meet the great problems that face them, a confidence in freedom, a confidence in a free society. If we in this country can build a strong and free society, if we can maintain employment, if we can provide a better life for our farmers, if we can provide an educational system second to none, if we can meet the needs of our older citizens, then our system will ornament the cause of freedom."", 'We sit in 1960 on a most conspicuous stage. We are the great defenders of freedom. If we fail here in this country, we fail around the world, because people in Africa and Asia and Latin America, who are attempting to make their judgment which road they shall take, they look to us. When we are moving they have confidence, when we stand still they begin to wonder whether the world is moving in the direction of the Communists. I say in 1960 that we have to move again, that we have to build in this country a strong and vital society, that when we are a good neighbor in the United States, we shall be a good neighbor around the world.', 'I come in this campaign to this old State and this old capital and ask your help. I ask you to join me. I ask you to give us your hand, your voice. I ask you to give us your support. I ask you to help us lead this country. [Applause.]', 'We say to you, those of us who seek high office and high responsibility in this somber time in the life of our country, we are reminded what Lincoln said when he left this city to go to Washington:', '\n  My friends, I now leave with a task before me greater than any which has rested upon any President since the time of Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance, I cannot fail.\n', 'In that spirit in 1960, we come here tonight and dedicate ourselves to this country, dedicate ourselves to its future, dedicate ourselves to moving this country forward again. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"

We farm about 300 acres and we fall behind about every year.', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was, What we would do for the farmers? I did attempt to indicate in my speech that we would try to bring by controls that are put on with a clear majority of the farmers in that commodity, to try to bring supply and demand into balance.', ""Secondly, that the support price will be tied to a parity price which would bear the relationship between what the farmer would earn, with comparable resources, and comparable managerial skill. May I say that one area that I did not mention is I think we can make better use of this food in this country and abroad. There are over 4 million Americans who depend on surplus food packages, and that is things that are distributed under the name of surplus foods, which don't feed our people at all. And I think we can do a better job abroad. If Mr. Khrushchev had our food resources, he would be using them to spread the doctrine of communism. I want to use them to spread the doctrine of freedom.

Would you let your religion affect your influence if you were elected President on some matters?', '(Response from the audience.)', ""Senator KENNEDY. I must say that I don't mind the question because, after all, there are a good many Americans who have spent - who are concerned about the question of religious liberty in this country, and anybody who seeks the office of the Presidency, I think should be willing to answer any question which disturbs any citizen or group of citizens. [Applause.]"", 'Let me say that if the question is would I permit my religions affiliation to interfere with my devotion to the Constitution and my responsibilities under the Constitution, I would not. I would hope that anyone who believes in the moral law, who believes in the precepts of Christianity or Judaism, would carry out their constitutional responsibilities with a conscience. But I must say if the question means would I permit unconstitutional or improper interference by anyone in this country or abroad in carrying out my responsibilities, then I would not permit it. Let me say that it would be unconstitutional. [Applause.] And any President who did permit any such action would be subject to impeachment by the Congress for a breach of the Constitution. [Applause.]', ""So my hope is that in 1960, after 14 years in the Congress, and 4 years in the Navy, taking the same oath that the President takes, I hope that with all the serious problems facing the United States in 1960, I hope that we make our decision based on the candidate's competence in those areas and not where he goes to church.

I will remind you that John Quincy Adams from my own State after being defeated for the Presidency in his second term, the people of Plymouth, Mass., wrote to him and asked if he would serve them in Congress, and he said yes, he would, on two conditions; first, that he would not have to run for office and campaign, and second, that he could vote the way he wanted.

I am Daniel Faulkner of Springfield, Ill. Senator, do you believe that Castro will last much longer as dictator of Cuba? [Laughter.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think it is hard to make any - of course, you can't predict a future. The future is extremely uncertain. The events of the last 5 years have shown us how difficult it is to make a long range judgment. What we should do, however, is move ahead on the basis that he will stay in power for some time, that he will continue to try to spread his revolution throughout all of Latin America, and, therefore, we must take action on two fronts."", 'First, we must sustain and strengthen those democratic forces in Latin America. And it is an unfortunate fact that this administration has been indifferent to Latin America until the last few months. The fact of the matter is that the United States has given more aid to Yugoslavia than to all of Latin America combined in the last decade. And suddenly, when our relations with Castro become bad, we begin to put forward a program of aid and loans to Latin America. I think we should do it because if Latin America should fail under the grip of the Communists, if they should be unable to sustain democracy in Latin America, our security would be directly imperiled. So the fight against Castro takes place in other countries.', 'Secondly, in regard to Cuba, itself, I feel that the United States should sustain the cause of freedom, that we should indicate that we do not believe that Castro believes in freedom, that until he is willing to submit his case to the people in a free election, that we will hold out the hand of friendship to those who have been driven out of Cuba by Castro, that there are undoubtedly those in the mountains now who are growing beards in preparation for undoing Mr. Castro. I think we should observe with at least some interest their progress. Castro may come or go, but the problem he represents continues. The problem is twofold. First, the poverty of the people in Latin America, which are subject always to seizure by a Communist or by a nationalist who may turn in the direction of Communists. As long as people live on the margin of existence, as long as they see us rich and prosperous, as long as they see us indifferent, then Castro has an attraction.', 'Secondly, we have to recognize that Castro and others will move in and out of countries over the next 10 years. I think the next 10 years are going to be the most difficult in our history, will require qualities of self-discipline, restraint and perseverance as we have never needed them before. But my judgment is that sooner or later people want to be free. The whole Castro movement was based on the desire of the people in Cuba to be free from Batista. Castro betrayed the revolution. That does not mean that the revolution did not have legitimate force in the beginning. This desire of people to be free has shown itself in Africa, has shown itself in Eastern Europe, is showing itself in Asia, and in my judgment that force is the strongest force in the world against the Communists. We should associate ourselves with it. We should hold out the hand to those people before the moment of desperation comes, and then accompany them on the road to freedom. [Applause.]', 'You have been very generous tonight. This is the 15th speech we made today, which is the alltime record of this campaign, and I am sure it must be enough. I want to thank you all very much for your hospitality. [Standing ovation.]']"

Mr. Kerner, who I am confident is going to be the next Governor of Illinois [applause], Senator Douglas, who is the Senator [applause] and who I must say speaks for this State and the public interest - I hope Illinois not only for its own interest, but for the sake of the United States, which needs all the courageous and able and dedicated figures that we can secure in public life, will send Paul Douglas back to the U.S. Senate [applause], and your own distinguished Congressman, Mel Price [applause], Will Rogers once said it is not the original investment in the Congressman that counts; it is the upkeep. I don't know what the original investment is in Mel Price or the upkeep, but it is worth it. [Applause.]"", 'In this town, in the square, the last of the Lincoln-Douglas debates was held, and in this debate here in this town, Abraham Lincoln repeated a speech which he had made earlier, and in that speech he used the same lines, ""A house divided against itself cannot prevail,"" that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free. I think 100 years later the issue is still the same, but this time it is written on a wider horizon. The question of whether the world will exist half slave and half free, and what contribution we in the United States can make to maintain the world in a state of freedom. That is the issue before the American people in 1960, how the United States can be strong, how we can fulfill our historic destiny to contribute to the cause of freedom around the globe.', 'I think we can best do so by maintaining in this country a strong and vital economy, by meeting our problems here at home, by building a stronger industry, by providing for full employment, by providing the best educational system in the world, by in 1960 returning the leadership of this country to the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', 'I stand in this election where Wilson stood in 1912, and Roosevelt stood in 1932, and Harry Truman in 1948. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon stands in this election where McKinley stood and Harding stood and Coolidge stood and Hoover stood and Dewey stood and Landon stood. I think in 1960 that the people of the United States after 8 years have decided that they want to move forward again, have decided that they want to regain their national purpose, have decided that what we are doing now is not as good as we can do, that this is a strong country that must be stronger, a more powerful country that must be more powerful. I think the issue is clearly joined.', ""Mr. Nixon says we have never had it so good, and I say we can do better, and I say we must do better. [Applause.] The issue is still the same. The world does not change. One hundred years has brought us face to face in this very same square with the issue that was put to the people of Illinois by Lincoln on that occasion. Can this Nation exist half slave and half free; can the world? As the United States met its responsibilities in the 1860's, so must the United States meet its responsibilities to the same issue, the cause of freedom. I ask your help in this election. I ask you to strike a blow once more for this country. I ask you to join with us in moving this country forward, in reestablishing its image as a strong and vital society. I ask your help in this election. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
213,John F. Kennedy ,"October 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. First of all, I would like to have Congressman Mel Price of this district come up here and wave. [Applause.] And then Senator Paul Douglas, who I know you are going to send back to the U.S. Senate. [Applause.] And then we brought over from Missouri to see what a great State you have in Illinois - Senator Stuart Symington. [Applause.]', 'We also have the Secretary of State here in Illinois. [Applause.] And I am running for President. [Applause.]', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for coming here today. I run for the office of the Presidency with full recognition of the tremendous responsibilities which the U.S. Constitution and events gives the President of the United States. He is not only the Commander in Chief, but he also is the center of our entire constitutional system. I have served in the Congress for 14 years, in the House and in the Senate, and I am sure that Paul Douglas and Mel Price would agree that the Office of the President is key. We can take action to provide aid to education. We can take action to provide medical care for our older citizens. We can take action to try to stimulate the American economy. But in the final analysis whatever we may do depends on the President of the United States, depends on his vigor, depends on his concept of what needs to be done to make this a stronger and a better country. The Presidency is key. I can assure you that if I am successful in this campaign, I do not run saying life will be easy, because I think the difficulties of the sixties will press upon us, but I do run for the office of the President with the greatest possible confidence in this country, with the greatest possible confidence in its ability to fulfill its historic function of being the chief defender of freedom in a difficult and dangerous time. I think one of the chief tasks of the next President of the United States is to set before the American people the things we must do in order to protect ourselves, in order to maintain our freedom, and in order to meet our commitments to freedom around the world.', 'I am not satisfied as an American to be second in space, to be turning out one-half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union, to have our economic growth increasing one-third as much as the Soviet Union, and one-half as much as Germany, France, and Italy. Last year, the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world, and the result of that is this year only 50 percent of our steel mill capacity is being used. We have the highest unemployment in this month of any month except for the two recessions of 1954 and 1958, and the one in 1949, ever since 1945. This country is moving into a serious and difficult time in the life of our country, and in our relations around the world. We stand on the razoredge of history. In the next 10 years Africa and Asia and Latin America will begin to move in one direction or another, will begin to decide whether the future belongs to us or whether it belongs to the Communists, and I think our responsibility is to make this country move with sufficient vigor and sufficient force so the people around the world can decide the future belongs to us, to solve our problems, to build a better society here, to hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for leadership. I am not satisfied with the drift of events today. I am not satisfied to be reading every day that Khrushchev and Castro and the Chinese are on the upward march. I want to read that the United States is once again asserting its leadership as a great and free country, which offers a ray of hope to all those who wish to follow our example.', ""I think this is the most difficult time of our history, even more difficult than the 1930's. I think the election of Franklin Roosevelt insured the maintenance of freedom in this country. The great task for the United States is to defend the cause of freedom here and around the world in the sixties, by building a strong and vital country, by maintaining our defenses, by building an educational system second to none, by providing full employment for our people, and demonstrating that Mr. Khrushchev is wrong when he says the United States is a sick and dying and faltering horse. I don't believe it. I think we represent the way of the future. I think the Communist system is as old as Egypt. But I think it is our function as American citizens at this criticial time in our development to demonstrate our vigor and force again, to look to the future, to say we are not satisfied with things as they are, to say this is a great country that can be greater, a powerful country that can be more powerful. That is the responsibility of all of us as citizens of the United States, as believers in freedom, those determined to maintain it."", 'One hundred years ago, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice. He can see the storm coming and He has His hand in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if He has a grace and a part for us, I believe we are ready.', 'I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in the journey to the new frontier.

214,John F. Kennedy ,"October 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Douglas, Congressman Gray, Otto Kerner, the next Governor of the State of Illinois, the next Congressman from this district, and the next U.S. Senator, ladies and gentlemen, somebody told me before I came here that there were a lot of Republicans that live in this community. Is that right?', '(Response from the audience.)', 'Are there any Republicans here today? Will they hold up their hands?', 'Are there any Democrats here today? Hold up your hands.', 'Well, there are a few people that did not hold up their hands on either occasion, and we are going to talk to them. We want to convince you between now and November 8 that the Democratic Party can be of service to this State and this district and the country. One of the things which we talk about so much in government is waste; how can we make our Government more efficient, how can we bring about a better break in the expenditures of tax dollars and get more results from them. I want to talk to you about another kind of waste, and that is the waste of our resources and the waste of our talent.', ""Thirty-five pereent of our brighter students in this country in high school do not go to college. What happens? How is their talent wasted? Why aren't they given the opportunity to get a good education and contribute to their own welfare and that of their country? This district in the last 10 years lost nearly 60,000 people. Why is that? Because there has been in this district, and in my own State of Massachusetts, and in West Virginia, and in Pennsylvania, technological changes which have left some of this district behind and some of my own State behind. That is why I cannot understand how this administration on two separate occasions could veto the area redevelopment bill. I can assure you that if I am successful or if I continue in the Senate, this bill will become law next year. I think it must, if this district and districts like it are going to move ahead. [Applause.]"", 'When we consider waste, consider $9 billion worth of food stored by our Government, when our own people in many areas, at least 4 million of them, depend on surplus food packages from the Government which average 5 cents per day per person, and when there is a world around us which is hungry. That is waste, in my opinion. I believe in putting our bread on the water, and I think it will come back to us many times over. I cannot believe that the best use for food is letting it rot in storehouses. I think it should serve people. I think it should serve the cause of peace. I think it should serve us and serve freedom. That is what I consider to be an objectionable kind of waste - not using our best students, not using our food, not using our industrial capacity.', 'Last week in the United States we used 50 percent of our steel capacity. The other 50 percent was unused. That is waste. There is waste in this country. Fifty percent of our mills are quiet; 100,000 steel workers are out of work. That is waste. If we could use our capacity to the fullest, if we provided full employment in this country, we would have, by 1962, $10 billion more in governmental revenue as well as billions of dollars for our economy.', ""I am for the end of waste, whether it is taxpayers' dollars or whether it is the waste of the people, or our natural resources, or our talent or our machines, or our plants or our resources of wealth which can produce so much for our country."", 'I think we should consider all of this in making our judgment as to what our country should do. We waste our people. There are people born in this country that because of their color do not get as good a job, do not go to as good a school, do not have as good teachers, do not get to go to college, do not get to be professional men, do not get to own their house. I consider that waste, too. There are many kinds of waste, and I think it is the function of government to use our resources to the fullest, to use our natural and material and human resources to the fullest, to educate our children, to build a stronger economy, to provide medical care for our aged under social security, to use to the fullest those areas of the United States where unemployment has been chronic for a great many years, to use our brains and our energy to build a stronger and better society here in the United States.', 'I think the future is ging to be a difficult one for us, but I have the greatest confidence in this country. I have served it in the Congress now for 14 years, and I must say after traveling to 50 States in the last 2 years and nearly every section of the United States from the Northwest to the Southeast, I believe that the United States can fulfill its function as the chief defender of freedom in a time of great danger for us all. A strong defense, a strong economy, a strong society serves not only ourselves but serves freedom.', 'We sit on a conspicuous stage. The kind of society we build, the kind of country we maintain, the principles for which we fight identify us with countries around the world. The United States was a great revolutionary country. As long as we maintain that spirit, we are going to hold the imagination of the world. I cannot believe that Mr. Krushchev and the Communist system, given time and given a strong America, given a hand of friendship held out to people around the world, I cannot believe that the result can be anything but on our side, and in our way. But I believe we have to go to work. I think this country has to move again. I ask your help in this campaign, and I can assure you that if we are successful we will serve the general welfare.

He said last night, and I say this afternoon, that when Mr. Nixon last Thursday night in Boston said I was another Truman, I regarded it as a compliment. [Applause.] And I returned it to him and said he was another Dewey, and he does not regard it as a compliment.', ""I come here today singing the same song that Woodrow Wilson sang in 1912, and that Franklin Roosevelt sang in 1932, and that Harry Truman sang in 1948, and that is that I have confidence in this country. I think its capacity is unfilled. I think it is a great country to which we owe much, and I am confident that in our day and generation in the 1960's we are going to serve our country, because we are going to build a stronger country and we are going to start this country moving ahead."", ""I come here today and ask your help in this campaign.

Would you stand up and take a bow? [Applause.] He was on a merchant ship that got sunk in the Solomon Islands and he had the bad fortune to then come on my boat which got sunk.

I have served with Senator Douglas now in the Senate for 8 years. I have served with Mel Price for 6 years in the House of Representatives.

I know the name of his opponent, which is a good thing for Mr. Kerner. That is why he is going to win. [Applause.] And I know who I am running against and so do you. I can't believe in 1960 the American people are going to turn the United States over to the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon for 4 more years. [Applause.]"", ""I spoke the other night about leap year liberalism. Every 4 years the Republican candidate for the Presidency says it doesn't matter which party wins, we are all for the same things, we are all for the same goals. Well, if we are all for the same goals, why did the Republicans defeat our efforts to provide a minimum wage of $1.25, and medical care for our aged citizens, and Federal aid to education, and housing to rebuild our cities? Our goals are not the same, nor are the means the same, nor have they been since Theodore Roosevelt. A Democratic Party sees the government and the people working together for a stronger and better country, for, in Paul Douglas' words, a juster America. The Republican Party says it is good enough and they have blocked every effort we have made to move this country off dead center. This is not just a contest involving Mr. Nixon and myself or the candidates here. It is a contest that involves us all. We pass on from here, but you stay. I ask your help in the next 6 weeks. If we get out and do the job as we did it in this State in 1948 when President Truman carried Illinois by only 17,000 votes and he carried Ohio by 7,000 votes, those are the victories that made it possible for him to resume the leadership of the United States, instead of Thomas Dewey."", 'Now, in 1960, in this State, in Missouri, in Ohio, and Pennsylvania and Michigan and New York and New Jersey, this fight is going to be won or lost. You can make the greatest possible contribution, and in return we will work, this country and this State, from one end to another. We will carry our message. We will inform the American people that the choice is between standing still and moving forward, between yes and no, between progress and mediocrity. I hope that you will join us in this effort. It involves us all. A stronger America involves us all. Every governmental action affects our lives for good or for bad. Every movement forward moves us all forward.

[Applause.] I don't want them to call the Vice President and say we are mean in any way. But we are just trying to tell the truth. [Applause.]"", ""I think the overriding issue which is before the United States in 1960 is how we can maintain our freedom, how we can not only survive but how we can prevail. There are many domestic matters that disturb us, the decline in agriculture, the slowdown in industry, but they are all wrapped up in the one subject: How can the United States maintain its position, how can the United States build a stronger country here and help the cause of freedom throughout the world. I don't make any mistake ahout it, that the 1960's are going to be the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. Anyone who says that the future is easy is wholly wrong. I think the future is going to be a difficult one, and because I think in the next 10 years that the people of Latin America and Africa and Asia will begin to make their judgment as to which direction they should move; should they come with us, should they follow the road of freedom, or should they move in the direction of the Communists?"", 'We can affect that judgment by the kind of society that we build here. George Allen, the head of the U.S. Information Service, testifying before a congressional committee this year, said that ever since Sputnik, ever since the United States was second in space, the people of the world had begun to feel the Soviet Union is moving ahead faster than we are. We cannot afford to fail in any area of our national and international life. If the people of the world begin to decide that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists are strongest, if they begin to decide that their educational system is better than ours, if they decide that their effort in science and production is better than ours, if they decide that they represent the way of the future, and that we represent the way of the past, then we have lost the battle of the future.', 'I do not say that the future is easy. I do not say that time and events have not placed a heavy burden upon us all. It would be nice to turn those burdens over to some other country and some other people, but we have had them placed on us, and I do not regret it. I cannot possibly afford to permit the Soviet Union to produce as it now does twice as many scientists and engineers as we do, to be first in space, to be increasing their economic productivity three times the rate we are.', 'I don\'t say that our future is in danger of a military attack if we maintain our strength. What I am concerned about is that the people of the world whose support we need, the people of the countries south of us, and Africa and Asia and in Europe, itself, and in Eastern Europe, will begin to feel that the world and history are moving in the direction of our adversaries and that we are standing still. That is the basic dispute that I have with the present Republican leadership. Their slogan has been, ""You never had it so good."" I think that our slogan should be ""We must do better, we must do better, we must do better."" [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon has said that when I say that some of these things could be better, that I am downgrading the United States. I don't downgrade the United States. I served it for 18 years. I have the greatest confidence in the United States. I am not satisfied to see it second best in any area of national and international life. [Applause.] I want an America that is not first, if; not first, but; not first, when; but first, period, and I think we can do it. [Applause.] I believe that this generation of Americans has the same rendezvous with destiny as that generation of Americans in 1936 to whom Franklin Roosevelt addressed those words, that that generation had a rendezvous with destiny. I believe we do, too. The rendezvous was the question of whether freedom could be maintained here in the United States. Our destiny is to determine whether freedom can be maintained throughout the world, whether a house divided against itself can survive, whether a world can exist half slave and half free."", 'I think we will move in the direction of freedom.

I come from Massachusetts, which is not a great agricultural center, but I can tell you that Massachusetts will not be prosperous unless the farmers of the United States are prosperous.', 'We heard today that International Harvester, which makes farm machinery, has closed down today, and John Deere plants have closed down; and the reason is that agricultural income has dropped in the past few years almost 20 to 25 percent, and because when farmers go down the rest of the economy sooner or later goes down. The farmers are the No.1 market for the auto industry of the United States and the auto industry is the No.1 market for the steel industry, and the steel is 50 percent of capacity. That is what we are producing this week. The Soviet Union last week produced more steel than we did, because we are only using half of our capacity and only slightly more than half of our people. The economy of the United States is tied together. If the farmer prospers, the city prospers, and if the city prospers the farmer prospers, and I think the Democratic Party has understood that from the beginning. I think Franklin Roosevelt and Truman and Woodrow Wilson fought for the people of this country, fought to advance their progress, and we must fight in 1960 and 1961 and 1962. [Applause.]', ""As long as there are millions of Americans who receive less than the $1 minimum wage for an hour of work, as long as there are hundreds of thousands of farmers who are being driven off the land in the last few years, as long as we are producing one-half as many scientist and engineers as the Soviet Union, as long as our economy is moving ahead at a slower rate, not only than the Soviet Union, but Germany, France or Italy, I think there is need for new leadership. I don't say that life will be easy if we are successful, but I certainly can assure you that we are going to move this country and move ahead."", 'Paul Douglas said we have been on dead center and I think we have been on dead center long enough. There are 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States that lack plumbing of any kind; 15 million American homes which are substandard, and yet we are not building anywhere near enough homes per year. I think a Democratic administration, under the leadership of vigorous people, who look to the future, can move this country into the sixties, and in strengthening the United States, they strengthen the cause of freedom. This country will not maintain its freedom, this country will not maintain its commitments around the world, unless we have a strong and vigorous economy, able to maintain our commitments, able to build, able to move. I come here today and ask your support in this campaign. I feel that we have in 1960 the same opportunity that we had in 1948 and 1932 and 1912, the chance to move again.

220,John F. Kennedy ,"October 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, needless to say, this is not my automobile that I am now standing on. [Laughter.] I want to introduce to you the Democratic candidate for Governor of Illinois, Otto Kerner. [Applause]. I want you to meet your distinguished Congressman, Mel Price, who you are going to send back. [Applause]. And I want you to meet again the present U.S. Senator and the next Senator from the State of Illinois, Paul Douglas. [Applause.] And I am here runninig for the President. [Applause.]', ""I come here to the all-America city and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.] Anybody who says that there is nothing left for us to do has not read the paper, doesn't know what is left for the United States to do in its unfinished business here at home. As long as this administration refuses to pass a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour, as long as this administration vetoes housing bills, as long as this administration refuses to pass legislation for medical care for our older citizens, as long as there is not equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or their religion, there is unfinished business for our generation. I stand here where Harry Truman stood and Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson in this century. The United States is faced with its most severe test, but we cannot possibly meet our obligations, we cannot possibly maintain a defense second to none, unless we are moving here in the United States, unless our economy is going ahead, unless we have full employment, unless we have the best educational system in the world."", ""I believe we can do a better job. I stand where Democratic Presidents have stood in difficult times in the life of their country, but they have looked to the future. The same people who tried to kill social security in 1935, tried to kill our efforts to protect social security in 1960. I believe the United States can have an unparalleled period of growth in the sixties. I think we can maintain a defense second to none. I see no reason why we should be second to anyone in outer space. But we can do none of these things, we can meet none of our obligations. The tide of history will move against us unless we begin to move here in the United States. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. You cannot possibly be successful abroad, you cannot possibly convey an image of vitality and energy in your relations with the world around us unless you are moving here at home, unless the Government is holding out a hand and joining with the people in building a better society. With Paul Douglas in the Senate and Mel Price in the House of Representatives, and Otto Kerner in the State of Illinois, all men who look to the future, all who believe that a public interest is a public trust, all that believe that this country can do anything, this is a strong country but I believe it must be stronger, and it is a powerful country but I believe it must be more powerful. We had a recession in 1954, a recession in 1948. In the State of Illinois we had in the last few days the highest unemployment that we had in any August prior to the three recessions since 1945. I don't want to see us stand still in the winter of 1961. I don't want Mr. Khrushchev and Castro to be on the move while we are on the defensive. I ask your help in this campaign, and I ask that on behalf of our country because I think we can serve the United States."", 'Last February George Gallup took a poll in 10 countries of the world and asked them one question: Who do you think will be first in science and military power in 1970, the Soviet Union or the United States? Nine out of the ten countries with the exception of Greece - every one of those people, a majority thought the Soviet Union would be first. Why do they think they are moving faster than we are? Why do people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America begin to wonder whether the Communist system represents the way of the future instead of our system. I think ours, but we have to work at it. We have to show the same vitality and dedication which we have shown in other great crises in other years.', 'Mr. Nixon runs on the slogan ""You never had it so good."" I think we can do better, not only individually, but as a country, not only as a country, but as a country which personifies the cause of freedom. If the United States is on the move, the cause of freedom is strong. If we stand still, freedom loses. So I think this is an important election, and I think there are real issues in it. I think the Democratic Party can serve in 1960 the people of this country. I ask your support in this campaign. I ask your support to cross the new frontier of the sixties. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
221,John F. Kennedy ,"October 03, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Otto Kerner, who is going to be the next Governor of the State of Illinois [applause] and Senator Douglas, who I think has made a singular contribution, as senior Senator from Illinois, to the welfare of this State and also to the welfare of the United States. Senator Douglas [applause] and your own Congressman who speaks for this district and so speaks for the country, Kenny Gray [applause] and Paul Powell, who has taken me by the hand, and has taken me along the same road that Harry Truman took in 1948 when he carried this State and carried the country [applause] and ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nixon the other night in my own town of Boston, speaking to his party, said I was another Truman. I regard it as a compliment. [Applause.] And I said he was another Dewey, which he does not regard as a compliment.[Applause.]', ""This district, which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land, personifies the kind of problems which I think the United States is going to face in the 1960's. This district has depended in the main for its resources, its growth, its wealth, upon the minerals underground and upon the food that is grown on the ground. And those are those industries that have faced serious problems in the 1960's. I can imagine nothing that represents a greater opportunity than $9 billion worth of surplus food stored away in barns and in sheds and in mills across the United States, at a time when over 4 million of our people look to the Government for surplus food to sustain them, and when hundreds of millions look to us around the world."", 'This is bread I would cast upon the water. I am confident it would come back to us many times over. Mr. Benson is an honest man, but he has not been a successful Secretary of Agriculture. I could not disagree more with the agricultural policy pursued by this administration, which has got for its basis, a steady drop of support prices as a method of eliminating overproduction. Mr. Nixon proposed his plan a week ago and he put in the same basic feature, which is that the support price shall be tied to the average of the market price for the preceding 3 years, and as the market price goes down, so does the support price.', ""Corn was selling for nearly $1.50 under the support price in 1952. In Minnesota, on Friday, in Sanborn, it sold for 85 cents. If this is the market price this year, next year under Nixon's program, the support prices will be tied to 85 cents, and as the market price drops, the support price will drop, until finally there won't be as many farmers in the United States in 1961, 1962, and 1963."", 'My own judgment is for our agricultural program that we should tie support price to parity price. Then the support price is fixed. But along with that we should have effective controls on production. We are going to have corn coming out of our ears, and wheat. We are going to have other crops which are being grown in surplus greater than we can consume, and 5 percent surplus breaks the price 15 or 20 percent.', 'The Secretary of Agriculture and the administration should make a determination as to how much we can usefully consume of wheat, livestock, other commodities, and then control production with the support of the farmers so that there is a balance between supply and demand, with a high support price for that crop which is grown. I put much greater confidence in that than in a support price which is steadily going down. That is the Democratic program. I feel we can do better. This program of this administration has dropped agricultural prices in this State over 20 percent in the last 8 years, and we are going down, down, down, step by step. That may have been all right in those times when we had full employment. Farmers could farm and work in the cities and towns, but this year we have the highest unemployment that we have had in any months of August and September, the three Augusts and Septembers preceding the recession of 1949, 1954, and 1958, and this district knows this problem well, because this district has lost 60,000 people in the last 10 years.', 'The failure of this administration to support the area redevelopment bill which has passed the U.S. Senate three times, introduced in the Senate by Senator Douglas, supported strongly by your Congressman, I think has made it more difficult for this district and districts in my own State of Massachusetts and in West Virginia and in Pennsylvania and in Kentucky, to lift themselves off the ground. I can assure you that if I am successful, in this campaign, that we will pass that bill in the House and the Senate and I will sign it, and if I am not successful in this campaign and I continue in the Senate, we will try to pass it again in the Senate and again in the House, and we hope that the next President will sign it. [Applause.]', ""Our problems are problems which affect the growth of our economy. In the next 10 years we are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide full employment, in order to get jobs for your sons and daughters in the next 10 years. We are going to have to make our economy grow. Last week, the steel mills of this country were employing 50 percent of capacity, and if you don't use steel, you don't use coal, and when you don't use coal and steel, you don't make autos, and when you don't make autos and you don't make coal and steel, sooner or later the economy of our country begins to slow down. And that is at a time when the United States has great responsibilities to meet at home and abroad. If we can maintain full employment, if we can make our economy move ahead, if we can bring a balance between supply and demand in the field of agriculture, if we can provide effective education for our children, if we can put medical care for the aged under social security, which will equalize the burden upon us all, then I think we will have met some of the problems that this country faces in the 1960's, because in building a stronger society here, we help build a strong society around the world."", 'The United States is a great defender of freedom. If we are moving a head, if we are building our strength here, then we help the cause of freedom. If we stand still, if we fail to meet our problems, then we damage not only ourselves, but the cause of freedom around the globe.', ""I have served this country for 18 years, 14 years in the Congress of the United States, and I have traveled in every State in recent months. I have the greatest possible confidence in this country. But this is a great country that I believe must be greater, and it is a powerful country that must be more powerful. I approach the 1960's with the greatest possible confidence that the United States will meet its obligations both at home and abroad. I come here today and ask your support, not saying that if I am elected life will be easy, but I can assure you that if I am elected and if the Democrats control the House and the Senate, men like Paul Douglas and your own Congressman, and Governor Kerner here in the State of Illinois, we will try to put before this country its unfinished business, we will try to provide leadership, and this country will move again.

Congressman Gray, Senator Powell, Speaker Powell, Senator Douglas, Otto Kerner, the next Governor, ladies and gentlemen, I have served in the Congress for 14 years, and during a good percentage of that time I served on the Veterans\' Committee of the Senate, so I have some understanding of the importance of this hospital, the services it performs, the assistance it renders to those Americans who have need of a hand from the Government, Americans who helped this country maintain its freedom. So I am delighted to be here today. I believe that this hospital and hospitals like it must continue to grow to meet the needs of our population, and also that this country must grow. All of us who are here today, who are veterans of World War I or World War II, or the Spanish-American War, must also recognize that our obligations and our service to our country were not passed by military service in time of war. We also must serve our country in time of peace. We must insist that the United States make those hard decisions which go with being secure, with maintaining our freedom, with maintaining our strength, with maintaining our position in the world. I think the veterans of the United States having made their contribution in their youth to the survival of this country, can, at a later date, in other days, facing different dangers, make a contribution again. So I am delighted to come here today. I appreciate very much your coming outside and saying ""hello,"" and I want to assure you that we share the same hope, not only for this State, but also for the country. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

A Republican Party, which in 1935 voted 95 to 1 in the House of Representatives against the social security bill, voted 44 to 1, with only one Republican, for medical care for the aged in the last session of the Congress.', 'A Vice President who was a Congressman in 1949 opposed public housing, is part of the same administration which in 1959 vetoed two housing bills. Are the people of Illinois and the people of this city and the people of this district to have a change to determine what kind of government they want here in this State and across the country?', 'Do you feel that everything that has to be done to provide better working conditions for our people and better housing, and medical care for the aged, which affects us all, because we all have someone in our family that needs assistance - and under the bill which the Congress passed and which was signed by the administration, before anyone can get medical aid, they have to sign a petition that they are indigent, that they are broke, that they have expended their money, that they are paupers.', 'I believe in medical care for the aged, nursing care, all tied to social security, which has served our people so well for 25 years. I believe in an expanding America where there is equality of opportunity, regardless of religion, regardless of race, regardless of creed. I believe in an America where the housing is second to none. There are 15 million American homes in the United States which are sub-standard. The average unemployment compensation check in the United States, the richest country on earth, is $31 a week, and in some States as little as 8 weeks. The average wage for laundrywomen in five large cities of the United States, and most of them are Negro women, is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. Anybody who says that we have to do nothing now, that all we have to do is realize the opportunities which Franklin Roosevelt and Truman presented, is wrong. We in our time have our own responsibility. We have to build homes. We have to get our mills moving again. We have to provide employment for our people. We have to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. We have to build a stronger America. And I ask your help in this campaign. It is the oldest fight in the world, the fight for progress. In every generation there are those who say that we should stand still, that we have never had it so good; and in every generation there are those who say it is time to move forward again - it is time to move forward, it is time to build a better country, it is time to extend the benefits of our society to all of our people.', 'I ask your help in this campaign because I believe that in 1960 the Democratic Party in this State and across the country has a chance to be of service. We are going to finish the unfinished business of our generation. We need your help. I ask your assistance. And I can assure you that with the Democratic Congress and a Democratic Executive, that Government will be manned by people who are interested in the future, whose program is their product, who are identified with the future, who believe that this country can move ahead. I ask your help, and so do we all.

In a free society, we cannot compel the same rigid efficiency of which Mr. Khrushchev boasts. But we can inspire an even greater effort by freemen willing to dedicate themselves to preserving that freedom.', 'With so many national responsibilities pressing upon us - with every tax dollar counting for so much - we need a government that knows how to govern - and history shows that this means a Democratic government.', ""The Republicans talk of economy. They talk of efficiency. They talk of eliminating waste and deficits and debt increases. But the facts of the matter are that during these years of Republican rule the Government has operated at a deficit exceeding $18 billion. The budget has steadily grown. The number of Federal agencies has grown. The number of Federal employees has grown. The national debt ceiling has been increased five times. The total Federal expenditures far exceed those of the previous administration. And in fiscal year 1959 the Republicans ran up the highest peacetime deficit in our Nation's history."", 'And what have we achieved with all this money? Most of it has gone for foreign aid, agriculture, and defense. But our foreign aid budget has not been managed in a way that won us friends and increased our prestige, for our prestige has rapidly declined. Our farm budget has not been managed in a way that brought prosperity to the farmer, for his income is the lowest in 20 years. Our defense budget has not been managed in a way that assures us of continued superiority across the board, for the missile gap is widening, our conventional forces are outmoded, and our defenses are in danger of becoming second rate.', ""I think a new Democratic administration can eradicate waste in the Pentagon - get our dollar's worth out of foreign aid - and restore some sense to our farm program. Mr. Nixon's farm program, on the other hand, would continue Mr. Benson's discredited soil bank program, taking land out of production and substituting Government payments for the income on that land. An independent study by Iowa State University has shown that if such a program is to raise corn prices to $1.30 a bushel and hold wheat prices at $1.50 a bushel, we would have to take 133 million farm acres out of production - one out of every three acres of existing cropland - at a minimum cost of $2 to $3 billion a year for an indefinite period of time."", 'This Benson-Nixon program has already cost more in 3 years than the entire cost of farm supports under 20 years of Democratic administration - and at the same time it has reduced farm income and raised prices at the supermarket. I think we can do better.', 'For this is not a record of economy or efficiency. This is not a record of campaign promises kept and carried out. This is a record of poor government by a party which does not believe in governing and has no talent for government.', 'The Democratic Party believes in government - but it believes that government must be responsible, economical and prudently run. I believe in a balanced budget and an honest dollar in the Federal Government doing only those tasks that cannot otherwise be done. I believe that the taxpayer is entitled to value what he buys with his taxes just as highly as that which he buys with the money left over. But I also believe in action where action is needed, and I am opposed to the costs of waste that are caused by Republican delay.', 'Mr. Nixon has purported to estimate the cost of the Democratic platform. His figures are wholly fictitious. But how can anyone figure the cost of the Republican platform? How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and highways that cost more now than they did when they should have been built? How can you measure the cost of increased juvenile delinquency bred in the slums they refuse to clean up? How can you measure the cost to their families of the medical care aged persons are denied? How can you measure the cost every consumer bears in high interest rates - or the cost of an abandoned farms - or the cost of illness caused by polluted water? How much more are emergency programs in foreign aid costing us because we did not long ago take the steps we should have taken before a crisis was reached in the Middle East, in Latin America or in Africa? And how do you measure the cost to a country whose security is in danger of being nibbled away by brush-fire wars too limited to justify the use of the massive retaliation our defense budgets have forced us to rely upon?', 'I do not call that economy. The Republican Party is one of waste - the waste of our human resources and the waste of our natural resources.', 'Thirty-five percent of our brighter students in this country do not go on to college. They cannot afford it and the Republicans have refused to help either the colleges or the students. But what a tragic waste of their talents. What a costly waste to the American people who paid to educate them this far.', 'Nine billion dollars worth of foods is wasting in storage at a time when millions of Americans are without an adequate diet and at least 4 million of them depend on surplus food packages from the Government which provide each person with roughly 5 cents a day worth of rice, cornmeal, dried eggs, skimmed milk and now a little lard. That food and fiber is being wasted when it could be serving people, when it should be serving the cause of peace.', 'Last week approximately 50 percent of our steel capacity was idle; and 100,000 steelworkers were out of work. That is waste of the worst sort. This is waste caused by the shortsighted policies of the Republican Party that have slowed down our economic growth and threatened us with a new recession.', 'We are wasting our great river valleys, such as the Wabash, if we fail to utilize their potential, to develop their resources and to purify their water. It is wasteful to have our best teachers moving into other jobs because their pay is too low. It is wasteful for our areas of chronic labor surplus to be burdened with idle men and idle plants that are needed in our economy. It is wasteful for talented men and women to be denied an equal opportunity to make the most of their talents because of their race or religion. It is wasteful for more and more tax dollars to be consumed in higher and higher interest rates on the national debt.', 'This country can afford that waste no longer.

Today almost 4 million Americans are out of work and another 3 million must struggle to maintain a decent standard of living on part-time work and half-full pay envelopes.', 'And nowhere has the impact of Republican unemployment been greater than in the 126 sections of this country which are classified as areas of chronic labor surplus, areas where large numbers of men, long out of work, cannot find new jobs, areas where unemployment compensation checks are runnning out, where industry has declined or collapsed, where families struggle for the bare essentials of a decent life, where thousands are forced to depend on meager and inadequate Government surplus food packages for existence.', 'These are the rapidly growing islands of poverty in the midst of a rich and abundant America - islands which have been growing in number and expanding in size under the leadership of a Republican Party which is indifferent to the urgent human needs of our own people and which has fought against every effort of the Democratic Party to eliminate poverty and distress in America.', 'Mr. Nixon has traveled through the coal fields of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the distressed idle towns in some parts of Michigan and Illinois, and he has come to Evansville. And yet Mr. Nixon tells the American people that all is well, that ""you never had it so good,"" that all Americans are prosperous and contented.', 'I say that Mr. Nixon has looked, but he has not seen. He has heard, but he has not listened. When it comes to our economy, he sees no evil, hears no evil, speaks no evil. But the unpleasant facts are still there. And I can assure you that if Mr. Nixon can travel across this great land and remain indifferent to the problems of unemployment and economic slow-down which afflict many sections of America - problems which he is seeing at first hand - his vision will be no clearer and his awareness no greater from the White House in far-away Washington.', 'For the Mr. Nixon who can look upon your distress - and say all is well - is the same Mr. Nixon who, in the past 8 years, has led the fight against every Democratic measure designed to increase the welfare of the American people - to put men back to work - and to help rebuild the economically distressed areas of America.', 'Twice the Democratic Congress has passed legislation designed to help communities like Evansville - areas of chronic labor surplus. And twice the Republicans have vetoed this bill - with Mr. Nixon leading the fight for the veto.', ""Our bill would have provided long-term loans and technical assistance to America's distressed areas in order to stimulate the construction of new industry, the rehabilitation of existing business, and the creation of new jobs and higher incomes. In short, our bill would do for the hard-hit areas of America what our foreign-aid programs are doing for hard-hit areas of Latin America and Asia and Africa. For, although we Democrats believe in meeting our responsibilities abroad, we also believe in looking after the welfare of our people at home."", 'And we cannot hope to meet our responsibilities as the protector of freedom throughout the world unless we meet our responsibilities to provide a decent life for all of our own citizens. For an America which is wasting the resources and skills of Evansville, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania - an America which is allowing the aircraft plants of California, the steel mills of Pittsburgh, the automobile factories of Michigan to run at only half their capacity or less - such an America cannot serve as an example to the peoples of the world who are looking for leadership in their own efforts to build strong and growing and vital economies.', 'That is why I have pledged that if elected President I will sign a bill to bring help to areas like Evansville, to rebuild the economies of our distressed areas, so that a strong and growing America can serve its own people, and serve the cause of freedom everywhere.']"

Senator Kennedy, on behalf of the people of Indiana, it is my pleasure to introduce you to the radio audience and to the panel that is here and to, of course, wish you every success in this campaign and in this election. I feel confident that you are going to carry Indiana.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Matt, I appreciate that. I am glad to be here with you as your guest. Indiana occupies a key place this year in the elections. That is why we are coming tonight, to spend the day tomorrow and be back before the campaign ends.', 'Mr. WELSH. You are always welcome.', 'QUESTION. Senator, I have heard it said that Indiana is the problem child of the North for your campaign. I have wondered - we have often been told, and I know it personally, that you have the best system of finding facts in Indiana as any candidate in Indiana. I just wondered what you think your status is in Indiana?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would think we were behind in Indiana. I think we have been doing better the last 3 weeks and I think particularly in the last 7 days we have gained some. But I would still say we are behind in Indiana.', 'QUESTION. You think you are still behind?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is my judgment; yes.', 'QUESTION. In the rural areas, probably, or where would you say?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I have not got a regional breakdown or a functional breakdown. I would just say we are behind in Indiana and we have to try to do better in the next 5 weeks. But I think in the last 3 weeks I feel that the tide has moved somewhat in our favor, but we still have some to go before we are ahead.', 'QUESTION. You are pretty satisfied with the cooperation of the State ticket in Indiana and your candidacy?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Well, I think Matt Welsh is ahead in Indiana, and I think he is going to win. They have been very helpful to us.', ""QUESTION. Are you riding on Matt Welsh's coattails, Senator?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. I will be glad to, if they are big enough to give me room.', 'QUESTION. That would be a switch. I just wondered.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, over the weekend President Eisenhower rejected the proposal by five so-called neutralist nations that he meet with Khrushchev. Do you agree or disagree with that decision?', ""Senator KENNEDY. Well, in view of Khrushchev's statements last week that he did not want to meet with the President unless the President gave an apology for the U-2 flight, in view of his very harsh intransigent statements at the United Nations during the past 3 weeks, I think the President showed good judgment. There is no sense having a meeting unless there is an atmosphere before the meeting which leads you to hope that there will be some success."", 'On the issues on which we are divided with the Soviet Union, disarmament and Berlin, which are the two chief ones at the present time, there is no indication that there is a common meeting ground. Therefore, just to meet, just to sit down, just to spend an hour, unless there is some basis for hope, particularly as Khrushchev is being extremely belligerent now, I thought the President showed good judgment.', 'QUESTION. Some Democrats have been critical of the decision of the State Department to restrict Khrushchev to Manhattan. Do you think these travel restrictions were wise or necessary?', 'Senator KENNEDY. That was really a decision for them and I never quarreled with it.', 'QUESTION. You have never made any statement on that?', ""Senator KENNEDY. No. I never disagreed with it. It was on the basis of security. I don't think we should harass visitors, but in view of the judgment of the State Department that it involved security for Mr. Khrushchev as well as harmony between the nations, because they did not want anything to happen to Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Castro, I never quarreled with their decision."", 'QUESTION. Senator, did you ever actually say that we should apologize?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; I never recommended that we apologize. I thought that what we should have done, rather than the lie we told, I thought it would have been proper for us to express regrets that a plane of ours landed on Soviet territory, because as Mr. Lodge said on ""Meet the Press"" the other day, technically we were in the wrong from the point of view of international law, and if there was any value to the summit conference, then it would have been of some advantage with a word to try to keep it going.', 'QUESTION. The Republicans keep saying that you said he should apologize. That is not so?', 'Senator KENNEDY. No; that has never been so, and I would hope that you as a good newspaperman would ask me to produce evidence of that, because my remarks were fully recorded and fully reported. There is a good deal of difference between the words ""apologize"" and ""regret."" Apologize expresses some feeling of morally in the wrong. We apologized, I believe, to Mr. Castro, or at least expressed regrets, when a plane, a private plane, landed in Cuba, as you remember, this last winter. The Soviet Union expressed regrets to us during the Barents Sea incident before the last summit conference. That is an acceptable procedure between nations, and if anyone thought that the summit was worth while, and quite obviously the President did because a great effort was made to develop the summit, then it would have been, I thought, more advantageous to us, more advantageous to peace, if there had been merely an expression of regret rather than saying a lie.', ""QUESTION. What is your feeling about President Eisenhower's proposal that we make more use of the United Nations to aid under-developed nations?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. Yes, that has been suggested by a good many people and I think it would be extremely useful. I don't overestimate how much the United Nations would be able to do in Africa, but I think that we should increase our support for it in two or three areas. One, give more support to the effort which they made to secure civil servants for the African nations and other nations. They have set up this service in recent years, and begun to develop it. The big need in Africa now are trained civil servants. The Congo has none. All the Belgians have left."", 'QUESTION. We have a few in our post office.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the United States would be an admirable recruiting ground. Secondly, I think they could do something on education.', 'QUESTION. Senator, both you and Vice President Nixon have suggested that we get rid of the surplus grain by sending it to the needy nations. But as I understand it, the State Department has always fought it on the ground that Canada and Australia and other nations are fearful that it will destroy the market, the international price market, for grain.', 'Senator KENNEDY. That is correct. That has been an argument against Public Law 480. We have done a good deal with Public Law 480 and the so-called food-for-peace program. My own judgment is that within the normal, within the limitations which you suggest, of Canada, the Argentine, Australia and so on, I think we can pursue the program more vigorously.', 'QUESTION. Do you think you can send more grain abroad, then, if you are elected President, than we have been sending?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I do. I think we can make more effective use of it. With countries like India and other countries which have great needs for capital, which have great food shortages, I think we can make more effective use of our food. In addition, I would hope that any future agricultural program would provide reasonable controls over production so that there can be some balance between supply and demand. It is pretty hard to distribute effectively the kind of surpluses we are now building up in corn and wheat and will build up this year under this program. I don't think you can possibly control your surpluses and possibly provide a decent income for our farmers, until you have effective controls over production."", 'QUESTION. Senator, do you think that either your program or the program of Vice President Nixon is very specific on agriculture?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think they are both specific. I understand what they are both getting at. Mr. Nixon's program, as you know, provides that there shall be the support - that the support price shall be the average market price for the 3 preceding years, 90 percent of it. As that market price drops, and it is steadily dropping - corn is selling for 85 or 88 cents, depending on what region you are in that is the market price, and, therefore, the support price would be tied to that, 90 percent of that, and next year, if the market price goes lower, the support price again will be hitched to the market price, so that where in 1952 you had $1.50-corn, now you have 85- or 88- or 90-cent corn. You are going to find the market price and the support price under Mr. Nixon's program steadily dropping, and you do not have under Mr. Nixon's program effective controls over production. Under our program we do have effective controls over production. We hope to bring supply and demand into reasonable balance and then work for a parity income which is tied, the income of the farmer, to the same income he would receive in other industries with a comparable use of his resources and managerial skill. I think there is a very distinct difference between the programs. Mr. Nixon's program is a continuation of Mr. Benson's, and ours would go in a different direction."", 'QUESTION. What would be the effect of your strict production controls on the consumer food prices?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think - you have to realize the amount of income that a farmer gets out of the food dollar is extremely limited. In the case of bread, it is 3 cents out of a 25- or 26-cent loaf. In the case of eggs, it is extremely limited, and in the case of milk, which is as high as it is in any item, it is 6 cents out of a 25- or 26-cent quart of milk. So that the actual return to the farmers is very marginal. The amount of cotton there is in this shirt, the amount of income that the farmer got---', 'QUESTION. What you are saying is that it would not have an appreciable effect.', ""Senator KENNEDY. Even if you take in the case of wheat, and you said the farmers' income is going to increase 25 or 26 percent, if it is 3 cents, it still is only 1 penny, and I don't think anyone hopes or feels that they can possibly maintain food prices if you are going to have the farmer being liquidated at the rate he is now. You are going to have large corporation farms. Food will be more expensive that way and less desirable that way."", 'QUESTION. You have talked about economic growth. Why should I or the average Hoosier care about that? Is it important', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think it is the great problem for the next President, that and the decline in farm income. In order to maintain full employment in the 1960's, which, after all, must be the object for all of us, we are going to have to have an economic growth twice what we had last year, about 4.5 percent per year instead of 2.4 percent. We have to secure 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide jobs for all of the people coming into the labor market. That is a terribly difficult task at a time when automation and new machinery has taken the jobs of men. And at the present rate of economic growth or productivity increase, we are not going to have those jobs or people. We now have 4 million out of work. You have 3 million on part time. You will have a million and a half people coming on the labor market next summer. I think it is the big problem that will face the President of the United States domestically. There is no easy answer to it. But I do think that the economic, monetary, and fiscal policies of the administration have helped limit growth."", 'QUESTION. I wonder if we can come back to the farm problem for one question. Your program calls for some agency or something to determine what is a fair return for a fanner in terms of his labor. Who is going to do this?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I think the Department of Agriculture. I don't think that that is impossible at all to compute, statistically. I think you could make a reasonably good judgment as to the amount of capital investment, the amount of labor, managerial skill, a farmer puts into the production of his pound or bushel of his commodity as to what he would receive in a comparable nonagricultural industry."", ""QUESTION. What I was wondering is, couldn't this same type of thing be extended to other segments of the economy, say the ma and pa grocery operator or the gasoline station man or the newspaper reporter?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. They don't have the same problem that the farmer has in regulating their production. You can close down. A steel company closed down and is now Operating at 54 percent of capacity. Their profit margin remains the same. They can go up next week to 90 percent of capacity. But a farmer has a very difficult time making that kind of control over his production, if he plants in the spring and harvests in the fall. In addition, may I just say that if the farmer continues to decline in income, you are not going to have any ma and pa, because, after all, most of them depend pretty much, in small towns, finally on the farmer."", 'QUESTION. Will this tend to keep the marginal farmer on the land, the farmer who is doing a poor job of farming?', 'Senator KENNEDY. If he is doing a poor job of farming, then I think sooner or later - I am sure that most of the people that you would refer to have jobs now in towns or cities. If he is doing a poor job of farming, his future is not going to be particularly bright under any program. There is not much that you can do for anyone who is poor at his work.', 'QUESTION. This would not guarantee an income for him, then?', 'Senator KENNEDY. It does not guarantee a farmer that is unable to farm that he would be maintained on the farm, but it, does guarantee that those who are within the economic, the viable, that they can be continued.', ""QUESTION. Senator, isn't there a depression on now?"", ""Senator KENNEDY. No; I would not say that, but I would say that there is certainly a plateau of economic activity which could be serious in the winter of 1961, but I would not use that term as yet, because I don't think we know enough where we are going. But. I would say that the prospects for the winter of 1961 - this could be a serious time unless we get an upturn."", 'QUESTION. I would like to ask that question of Senator Welsh, as pertains to Indiana. What do you think is the economic picture in the State and in the immediate future?', 'Mr. WELSH. Well, in northern Indiana, around the steel mill area, of course, there is economic distress, because the steel mills are operating at 50 or 55 percent of capacity. In the rural areas, generally speaking, I think we have had a good crop year. However, in some parts of the State the crops are not good because of drought. In most of the cities of the State, I would say there is a good bit of concern about employment, about business. A general air of uneasiness would be the way I would characterize it.', 'QUESTION. Is that usually - does that mean Democratic votes in the fall, do you think?', 'Mr. WELSH. If there is anything to the old political axiom that people vote against, I would say yes. Certainly, many people are dissatisfied with present conditions, many people are.', 'QUESTION. Senator, is the heavy registration because of the AFL-CIO, or some other factor?', 'Mr. WELSH. It is general. It is general. In Republican, normally Republican counties, where the voting population is overwhelmingly small town and rural, not industrial, the percentage increase in registration is equally as great as it is in the industrial areas. This is an election when the people have made up their minds they are going to go to the polls, and we are going to see a tremendous vote this fall.', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I wonder - Senator Matt Welsh mentioned difficulties in the steel mills and there are those who maintain this is partly a result of imports of foreign steel. I wonder how the Democratic national platform planks seem to be for sort of free trade how that will affect the steel industry in the next 4 years if you are in the White House.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Actually, as far as trade, we have a favorable balance of trade. In the last 12 months we are selling abroad more than we are importing, and that is true of steel as well as other products. One of the reasons of course, I am frank to say, is because the German and Belgian mills are overordered and it takes a longer time to get orders than it does from the United States. But at least for the present now we are selling abroad in steel as well as other commodities more than we are importing. But I do think it is a matter that we should concern ourselves with. The unfavorable deficit is due to the fact that we are paying troops abroad to maintain bases, giving foreign aid. That is what is hurting. The balance of trade this year is all right.', 'QUESTION. What would you do to give the hypo to the general picture?', 'Senator KENNEDY. On the steel mills?', 'QUESTION. Yes.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think that is affected by the general state of the economy. As the economy slowed down, we had a recession in 1954. We had a recession in 1958, and now it is 1960, 2 years later, and we are moving into a difficult economic period, and of course steel feels it first.', ""* * * * * * * * * * I would think that those programs such as schools, hospitals and so on, I think can stimulate the steel industry. Secondly, the housing industry is not building as much as it should in view of the increase in our population. That has partially been affected by the administration's failure to support good, progressive housing legislation, add also by the high-interest-rate policy. If you had housing moving ahead, I think you would also assist the steel industry."", 'QUESTION. Would you, for example, support a move to lower the FHA interest rate on older houses to the point where it is close to new houses?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Do you mean for repairs?', 'QUESTION. No, for purchase. For example, as I understand it, if you are going to buy a $20,000 house, if it is new, you can buy it with $2,000 down, but if it is an old house, it would take maybe $7,000 down.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would certainly attempt to liberalize credit in 1960 in the housing field. We are building 200,000 houses less than we should be for the increase in our population. There are 15 million American homes which are substandard. Therefore, I would hope that we would do everything we could to stimulate particularly new housing. That is where we want to go, to replace this old housing.', 'QUESTION. Senator, some Republicans have charged here in Indiana that during the postconvention session of Congress you scuttled the passage of a $1.15 minimum wage bill for political motives. I just wonder what were your motives.', ""Senator KENNEDY. In the first place, it is inadequate. I supported $1.25 which passed the Senate. Mr. Nixon considers that too extreme. We went to the House Conference and when we were unable to get $1.25, which I don't think is extreme - that is $50 a week, and that is not this year; that is 1962. This $1.25 would be paid, for those not now covered by the minimum wage. Those who work in retails and restaurants and laundries, they would have gotten it by 1964. Mr. Nixon considers that too extreme. I think that is a very clear difference in our perspective on social legislation. But when we were unable to get the $1.25, we offered $1.15, the Eisenhower program, with 3 million new coverage, and we could not persuade the Republicans from the House or Senator Goldwater and Senator Dirksen to accept the $1.15."", 'QUESTION. Did that ever come out of conference?', 'Senator KENNEDY. It never came out of conference because we could not get the votes for $1.15 for 3 million new coverage. I think we should have taken $1.25. I would have taken $1.15. The question was whether we would get new coverage. In other words, would we cover people working in the retail stores? If a retail store makes more than a million dollars, in my judgment they should pay more than $1.25. And they certainly should pay $1.15. The Republicans opposed that on this occasion as they did the minimum wage of 25 cents in 1925, as they do medical care for the aged. These issues are very sharp. I think the people of Indiana should make a judgment if that is the kind of administration they want in the sixties, that considers $50 a week extreme, that they consider medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme, considers aid to education as extreme.', ""QUESTION. Wouldn't your program cost a great deal more money?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. Minimum wage would not cost anything. The average wage for laundry women in five cities in the United States is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. Can you tell me anything more wasteful than that? So the minimum wage does not cost anything.', ""Medical care for the aged is financed under social security. Far more wasteful is the bill which was finally passed which would cost $2 billion a year, $1 billion by the Federal Government out of the Treasury, and $1 billion by the States, and before anybody gets any assistance they have to take a pauper's oath before they can get any assistance, if they are over 65."", 'The program we put forward would have been financed under social security and everyone under social security would have contributed to it, and when they retired, would have received assistance, which is far more responsible than the program that was finally passed.', 'QUESTION. What would be the average contribution under the social security tax under your program?', 'Senator KENNEDY. As I recall, it was a half a percent.', 'QUESTION. That would be for the employee?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The employer and the employee would both contribute to the program. That, in my opinion, is the way we should finance these kinds of programs. Ours was fiscally far sounder. We wanted to put it under social security. Governor Rockefeller supported the same proposal. Social security has worked for 25 years. Before anybody who is 65 and over, or women over 62, can get any medical assistance under the present law, they have to spend all their savings and take an oath that they are indigent. I think that is the Republican policy on all these programs.', ""QUESTION. I don't mean to argue that yours is or is not expensive or too expensive, but I would like to know how much it would add to the Federal budget."", 'Senator KENNEDY. It would not have added at all.', ""QUESTION. I don't mean just medical care. I mean your overall programs, Federal aid to education and medical care."", ""Senator KENNEDY. Federal aid to education, the bill that finally came up, I think, was $400 million a year. The farm program will be, I hope, far more economical than the present administration program, the most expensive program. They have spent more in the last 3 years under the administration's program than 20 years preceding. Mr. Benson has spent more money than all the Secretaries of Agriculture in the history of the United States since the Department was founded. So I cannot think of anything more wasteful than their agricultural program. I cannot think of anything more wasteful than their high-interest-rate policy. That costs the taxpayer $3 billion a year on interest on the debt more than he was paying 10 years ago on interest on the debt. Every year it is added on. He has to pay $3 billion more in taxes, just to maintain the interest on the debt. We have spent $42 billion in the Defense Department and General Medaris and others have indicated that we have not gotten a missile program, we have not gotten conventional forces which should be as strong as they should be. My judgment is that the next budget, unless there is a national emergency, or unless you have a recession where there is a drop in tax revenue, I think the next budget should be balanced. I believe in a balanced budget. I believe in trying to get the best we can get for each dollar. But I can think of nothing more wasteful than these programs that I have described."", 'QUESTION. Senator, the Republicans have charged that it is the Democrats who bring up the religious issue. I was with Lyndon Johnson a week ago tonight. He spent quite a period in Columbia, Ind., talking about the religious issue, and he said he was concerned, that he did not think he would ever see the day when there would be politics in the pulpit. The next day I met one of your leading Democrats in Indiana, and he said he talked Lyndon Johnson into bringing that up.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Caddow, I have not mentioned the religious issue since I have been nominated unless I have been asked a question about it.', 'QUESTION. That is what I thought.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I do not plan to.', 'QUESTION. What about your speech in Salt Lake City?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I didn't talk about mine. I talked about the contribution which a good many people have made, the Mormons on that occasion. I never discussed my problem, or a person of my faith, nor did I in that speech."", 'QUESTION. I think this implication was clear, that you were talking about a member of a group that was a minority group.', 'Senator KENNEDY. Is that improper?', 'QUESTION. I just wondered. To me it seemed as though you were bringing up the religious issue.', 'Senator KENNEDY. I talked about the contribution of the Mormon Church and how they demonstrated in spite of great difficulties their support of the Constitution. Every poll shows that 25 or 28 or 30 percent of the people are very concerned about it. My experience in Houston shows it is a matter of the greatest concern. I am delighted to answer any questions about it. What I hope is that the serious issues which face the United States will be such that people will make their judgment based on that, not on my religion. I have answered every question that I could be asked. I am delighted to answer any more. There is nothing improper about discussing it. After all, I am running for the Presidency, and I should talk about anything that is of concern. Evidently it is of great concern in many States. I wish we could do away with it. If there is anything I can say on it, I would be delighted to say it.', 'QUESTION. May I get back to one of the serious issues? Senator Kennedy, you and also Senator Johnson, when he was here recently, have expressed concern about the fact that there is a Communist-led dictatorship 90 miles offshore. If you were President, what would you do about Castro, or what would you have done?', ""Senator KENNEDY. I can think of nothing that has demonstrated this administration's refusal to face up to issues than permitting Mr. Castro to operate and seize power as he did 3 years ago. Now Mr. Castro is in control. Now the only way that-- nobody suggests that we launch an invasion of Cuba, so you are faced with the situation where he is now in office, now in control. In 1957 he was not in control. Why was he permitted to seize control? Why was the judgment made of Mr. Castro that he represented a force for liberal democracy in Cuba? I think that is a proper question. I think it is a proper question to ask how they could have permitted Mr. Castro to seize power. You say, What can we do about Chinese Communists? We cannot do anything today, but everyone wonders why they were permitted to seize power."", 'QUESTION. What can we do about Castro?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the following things. First, I think we should be extremely vigorous in our programs through Latin America. We have two problems: one through Cuba, itself, and the other through the rest of Latin America. That will be the big fight in the sixties, whether Castroism or communism will spread through other countries. This administration has ignored Latin America.', '* * * * * * * * * * Latin America has been almost forgotten. It was not until we had difficulty with Cuba and we wanted the OAS endorsement of our policy toward Cuba that we began to give them economic assistance.', 'ANNOUNCER. That ends the program, Senator.']"
228,John F. Kennedy ,"October 04, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator Welsh, Senator Hartke, Governor Schricker, Congressman Madden, and Congressman Barr, Members of the Congress, national committee men and women, Mrs. Price, ladies, and gentlemen:', 'I am grateful for the introduction by Matt Welsh, who I am confident is going to restore to this State honest and progressive government next November. [Applause.] And I think as Governor he will serve in the tradition established in this State by Governor Schricker. I think he will show what can be done in Indiana. [Applause.] And just as we hope to show them what can be done in the country. I think the test in Indiana and the country is just the same: whether they want an administration which says ""No"" to the sixties, whether they want an administration which will stand still, or whether they want an administration in this State and in the United States that will move ahead. I think we are going to win this election. [Applause.]', 'The choice before us was very clearly put, and the standard of the Democratic Party was clearly raised away back in 1936, when Franklin Roosevelt made his acceptance speech before 100,000 people in Philadelphia, Pa. In that speech he said:', 'Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.', 'I think that is the test for the sixties. [Applause.] Where Franklin Roosevelt set before our country its unfinished business, the agenda of our nation, the things that we must do if we are going to realize our potential, this administration has set ceilings and limitations, and we now move from stage to stage in the most difficult time in the history of our country, when the challenge is clearly laid upon the United States. We move into 1960 not with vigor and energy and foresight, but instead being dragged along, year after year, without any recognition of how serious are the problems that face us at home and abroad.', 'I think the issues are clear, and I believe that the American people on November 8, faced with the most serious challenges at home and abroad, are going to return the leadership of this country to the party which in this 20th century has produced Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon has traveled about the United States and said that party labels don't matter; what counts are the men. I think what counts are tho men that the political parties put up, and I think party labels mean a good deal. [Applause.] I am not impressed by this leap-year progressivism which comes upon the Republican Party every 4 years, when they support and sustain programs which they fight against year after year in the Congress. The Democratic Party in this century has produced Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman. There is not any doubt that none of those men would have been nominated by the Republicans, and I don't think there is any chance at all that the Democratic Party in this century would have nominated McKinley or Taft or Coolidge or Harding or Landon or Dewey or Nixon. [Applause.]"", 'No Democrat ever ""Stood pat with McKinley"" or ""Kept cool with Coolidge"" or ""Returned to normalcy with Harding,"" or ran on a program in 1936 of repealing the Social Security Act, which Alf Landon did, or ran like Thomas E. Dewey.', 'Mr. Nixon in Boston the other day said I was another Truman, and I returned the compliment and said he was another Dewey. [Laughter and applause.] And he has not said I was another Truman since, but I wish he would. I regard it as a compliment. [Applause.]', ""I am reminded of the poem that Robert E. Sherwood wrote in 1933, hailing Franklin Roosevelt's administration."", '""Plodding feet tramp, tramp,The Grand Oid Party\'s breaking camp,Blare of bugles, din, din,The New Deal is moving""', 'Today, on every major crisis that threatens our country - Berlin, Formosa, the plight of our cities, the plight of our schools, the problems of unemployment - we hear no blare of bugles, din, din; we see only plodding feet, tramp, tramp, and the Grand Old Party breaking camp. I think we can do better. [Applause.]', 'I do not say that they have been silent on all these issues. In fact, I am reminded of the exhortation from King Lear that goes, ""I will do such things; what they are yet I know not, but they shall be the terrors of earth."" I think the Democrats can do better, I think they must do better if the United States is going to maintain its position at home and abroad. What we are now doing might have been good enough for another day and another time. But I believe in the next 10 years the world will begin to move either in the direction that we have set out, or in the direction of the Communists, and during these next 10 years I think it is time the United States began to stir itself again. You cannot possibly be satisfied [applause] to move from a recession in 1954 to a serious recession in 1958, to a slowdown in 1960, which promises a hard winter in 1961, and feel that the United States is living up to its capacity. You cannot be satisfied when there are 15 million American homes which, according to the last census, are substandard, 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States which lack plumbing of any kind. You cannot be satisfied as an American when the average wage for laundrywomen in five cities of the United States is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week, and most of them are Negroes. You cannot be satisfied to see our steel capacity at 50 percent, to know that last week the Soviet Union produced more steel than the United States with one-half of our capacity, because our machines and men are not being used to the fullest. I think this is a somber time for us all.', 'I have the greatest confidence in the United States. Mr. Nixon says I downgrade this country. I do not downgrade it. After 14 years in the Congress, and after traveling to every State in the Union in the last 2 years, I have the greatest confidence in it. What I downgrade is its leadership. I downgrade the prospect of Mr. Nixon leading the United States in the most difficult and somber time in the life of our country. I believe the Democratic Party has, as it has all through our history, an opportunity to contribute to the United States, to break new ground, to move the United States ahead in the 1960\'s. [Applause.] And those Americans who agree with the Republican slogan ""You never had it so good,"" who believe that what we are doing now is as good as we can do, who believe that everything that has to be done at home and abroad is being done in full measure, then they should support the Republicans. But any American who has unlimited confidence in this country\'s capacity to lead, who believes that the ouly way that we are going to be a good neighbor abroad is by being a good neighbor at home, who believes that the economy of this country must move if we are going to maintain full employment and secure sufficient revenues to maintain our defenses, then I hope they will come with us.', 'One of the issues that Mr. Nixon has mentioned has been efficiency in government. He has stated that he is going to save the taxpayers money. I want to describe to you what I consider to be the most wasteful administration in this century. The harsh facts of the matter are that in the last 8 years this administration has operated at an $18 billion deficit. In 1958, the Republicans, because of the recession, induced in part by fiscal and monetary policies which they follow, had the largest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States; 1958, $12 billion. The national debt ceiling has been increased five times in the last 8 years. The total Federal expenditures have far exceeded any in the history of the United States, and in fiscal 1959 we have this high deficit, and what have we achieved with all of this?', 'Most of it has gone for foreign aid and for agriculture and defense. Our foreign aid programs, emphasizing as they do the military in their distribution of surplus military equipment, have not secured us friends, have not won us allies. The United States today is not stronger than it was, in relationship to the Communist world, than it was 8 years ago, after all the programs have been carried out and after a the money has been spent. As Secretary Wickard knows, our farm budget in the last 3 years has spent more money than in the 20 years before. This administration has spent on agriculture more money than all the administrations since tbe Department of Agriculture was begun, nearly a century ago.', 'You talk about waste in government and about inefficiency. Can you imagine an administration which has brought farm income to the lowest point in 20 years, which has $9 billion of surplus food stored away and hundreds of millions more coming in crops this year, being regarded as an efficient government?', 'I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Reorganization that put through over 30 Hoover Commission recommendations, and I can tell you that this administration has not mastered the bureaucracy. The Department of Defense has more employees and spends more money than it spent in any peacetime year, and yet we do not have a defense second to none, and we are not in the lead in missiles, and we are not in the lead in outer space. These are all important because a free government has only so much resources. We have only so much energy that we can devote to the purposes of national security.', ""I believe as a Democrat, in a responsible fiscal and monetary policy. But I want to point out what I consider to be the real waste of this administration. Mr. Nixon has purported to figure out the cost of the Democratic platform. His figures are wholly fictitious and untrue. But how can anyone figure out the cost of the Republican platform? How much have they cost the taxpayer for the dams and the highways that cost more now and in the early sixties than they would have 5 years ago? How do you measure the cost of a flood which a dam could have protected? How can you measure the cost of juvenile delinquency in the slums which have not been torn down by an effective urban renewal program? How can you measure the cost to families for medical care for their aged parents because this administration has refused to support medical care for the aged financed under social security, and instead they gave their support to a bill which will cost the taxpayers, if fully used, $1 billion a year from the National Treasury, and $1 billion from the States and before anyone gets any assistance they must take a pauper's oath that they are medically indigent, instead of financing it as Governor Rockefeller and most of the Governors recommended, under social security, which would have added no burdens on the general revenue of the taxpayers, they financed it under the general revenue, a program which does not meet the need and which is wasteful and which must, in my opinion, be changed by a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President. [Applause.]"", 'How much waste is there in the fact that 35 percent of our brightest students do not go to college? How wasteful is that of a great human resource in a country that needs all of the brains that we can get? They cannot afford it, most of them, and this administration has not been willing to stimulate those programs for building our schools and colleges that would permit them to afford it; $9 billion worth of food stored away in surpluses, and yet I spent a month in West Virginia and I saw over 100,000 families waiting every month, a family of 4, for a food package of $6.25 of surplus food. It includes for each person 5 cents a day of rice, corn meal, dried eggs, skim milk, and they are going to add lard at the end of the summer. The food and fiber is being wasted in a country which has people who depend upon it and in a world which looks to us for relief.', ""Last week, as I said, approximately 50 percent of our steel mill capacity was unused. What a waste that is. And over 100,000 steelworkers out of work. What a waste that is. If the Soviet Union's economy is growing at twice or three times as fast as ours is, if they are using their resources to the maximum and we are not, then quite obviously this race that we are now engaged in can have only one end. These are all difficult and somber questions."", ""I don't run for the office of Presidency saying if I am elected life will be easy, but I do believe that a new administration composed of new people inheriting a great tradition of intellectual vitality, can move this country further ahead. Can you belleve that this administration has shown vigor in its foreign policy when we offer to the Congo at the time of the crisis early this summer over 300 scholarships, which was more than we had offered to all of Africa the year before, and only 6 of those students are now in the United States studying? How long does this administration think it takes to train a leader, to send him through school and college and give him experience? It takes, 10, 15, or 20 years. And yet this administration has been totally indifferent to the needs of Africa which will control, by 1962, one-quarter of all the nations of the General Assembly. What is true of Africa is true of Latin America. No program for aid for Latin America of any substantive importance was suggested until we broke off the sugar quota with Castro in June. And then we went to the Bogota Conference with an authorization. Eight years - we gave more aid to Yugoslavia in the last 15 years than we have given to all of Latin America in the same period of time. I do not believe that this administration has demonstrated sufficient foresight, I don't believe that its experience in foreign policy or its experience in domestic policy jutifies a renewal of its lease."", 'I share the view that its experience is like that, that Oscar Wilde described as ""Experience is the name that you give to your mistakes,"" and I must say in the field of foreign and domestic policy, I don\'t believe that this administration has demonstrated its awareness of how swiftly the world is changing around us, of how hazardous is our present position.', 'Lincoln said 100 years ago, ""This Nation cannot exist half slave and half free."" Now the question is whether the world will exist half slave and half free, and if it does not, which way it will go. Will they come with us or with them. [Applause.]', ""I believe that they can come with us, but I believe to have an effective policy toward them we have to be moving here in the United States. Franklin Roosevelt and Wilson and Truman's foreign policy was a direct counterpart of their domestic policy. It was because Franklin Roosevelt was moving this country with progressive and humane legislation, that the people of Latin America and Africa regarded him as a good neighbor. If you are solving our problems here at home, if we are using our resources, if we are providing a more honest and fair life to all of our citizens, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, if we are making this country a shining example of what freedom can do, then I think the world will begin to move in our direction. But if they get the idea that our high noon is in the that the brightest future is possessed by those countries in the that our day was years ago, and that the secret of organizing their society is to duplicate the Chinese and the Russian example rather than ours, then quite obviously those countries to the south of us will begin to move in the direction of the Communists."", 'That is why I believe that this is the most difficult of all of our times. It is the best of the days and the worst of the days, and I think the responsibility upon the next President, and upon the citizens of the United States in the next 4 or 5 years will be as heavy as it has been in our long history. But I have confidence in this country. I really believe that if the leadership sets before us the unfinished business of America, if we set before ourselves our goals that we must achieve, if we are going to maintain our society free from being vulnerable, then I am confident that the power of this country can be unmatched.', 'This election is an important one. It involves not merely Mr. Nixon and myself. It involves us all. We are all committed. We all participate. We are all affected by its result. I come here tonight and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in this effort. [Applause.]', 'Here in this State of Indiana it is not an easy job. This is a long, tough, uphill fight, even though I am confident that you are going to elect Matt Welsh as Governor. But I am under no illusions that this election on my part is easy in the State of Indiana. It is uphill. But I am confident that the tide is moving in our direction. [Applause.] I am confident that the people of this State recognize that there are serious issues which affect the two parties, that the history of the two parties is entirely different. My judgment is that a majority of the citizens of this State are going to choose the Democratic Party and choose to move again, choose to go ahead again, rather than standing on dead center. [Applause.]', 'One hundred years ago, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I know His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice and we see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
229,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","['* * * Henry Clay has been gone now for more than a century. But that principle of national unity is now a central fact in our economic life. When homebuilding slackens in Boston, then dishwashers and refrigerators pile up at the plants in Louisville, and workers go on part time. When workers in Louisville are on part time, then the market sags for the farmer who produces oranges in Florida and hogs in Iowa. When the farmers in Iowa are in trouble, then the manufacturers in Detroit cannot sell cars and tractors. When the manufacturer in Detroit cuts back, then steel production drops-as it has now, to 50 percent of capacity. For better or worse, in other words, Kentucky and Massachusetts, East and West, North and South, are bound together.', ""To advance his American program - to extend the old frontier - Henry Clay called for help from Massachusetts - in the person of Daniel Webster. Today, as a son of Massachusetts, I ask Kentucky's help in advancing a new American program - in extending our new frontiers. For once again it is time that America was on the move. Once again it is time that we firmed up the soft spots in our economy before their blight spreads throughout the Nation."", ""For all is not well economically. There are depressed areas not only in eastern Kentucky, but all over the country. There are too many small business failures, and too much big business unemployment, not only here in Louisville, but all over the country. Steel production is too low, not only in Newport, but all over the country. Farmers can't meet their bills, not only in Paducah and Bowling Green, but all over the country."", 'This Nation cannot afford to stand still today any more than it could in the days of Henry Clay. We must make a clear decision this November - to move ahead with the programs and policies of the Democratic Party or to drift along with the same do - nothing policies of the Republicans.', 'My opponent, of course, is reluctant to admit around election time that he is a Republican. He says he is against too much emphasis on party labels. He says he is against the Republican Secretary of Agriculture. He says he is against the Republican Secretary of Treasury\'s tight-money policy. He says he is against the Republican Secretary of Interior\'s principle of ""no new starts.""', 'On the other hand, he says he is for higher teachers\' salaries - forgetting that it was his vote that killed an amendment offering funds to the States to raise such salaries. He says he is for Federal aid to colleges - forgetting that he called it ""undesirable"" in the days when the Democratic Congress passed it twice and the Republican administration vetoed it twice, calling it ""extravagant, inflationary, unnecessary, and highly objectionable."" It is a little late for Mr. Nixon to be putting out a ""position paper"" on education - because it cannot paper over his record or the record of the Republican Party.', 'Now he has a paper on housing. It is based upon the premise - and I quote - that ""the Housing Act of 1949 has worked well."" This is an interesting admission - because, as Wilson Wyatt and others can tell you, Mr. Nixon voted against the Housing Act of 1949 and has consistently opposed every basic feature in it. His new ""position paper"" may express concern for those who live in slums. But his principal concrete suggestion is to raise the interest rates on FHA and VA mortgages. And the last 8 Republican years have demonstrated that higher interest rates have never yet built one new house or cleaned up a single slum.', 'Mr. Nixon has also unveiled his farm program. And it turns out to be nothing but the old Benson fables under the new Nixon labels - basing the support price on the previous market price to drive it down, down, down and expanding the discredited soil bank in a futile attempt to reduce surpluses at a fantastic cost to the taxpayers.', 'In short, the Republicans continue to say ""no"" to the 1960\'s - no new starts, no new schools, no new housing programs, no new help for the farmer. I believe it is time we said ""yes"" to the 1960\'s. I believe it is time that Massachusetts and Kentucky joined together once again to meet the challenge of new frontiers - to recognize that progress in one State helps progress in all, and that a slowdown in one State means a slowdown for all. Let us initiate a program based on the principle that Clay and Webster lived by - the rising tide lifts all the boats.', 'First, we must get going on the maximum development of our rivers and natural resources in every State. George Norris did not pioneer the TVA because it would help Nebraska. He recognized that the development of the Tennessee Valley would be a great national asset.', 'Henry Clay realized that the national road would help all States, adjacent or not. And today we should realize that the development of our river valleys has equally widespread benefits. The TVA and the work of the Army engineers on the Ohio River demonstrate what development means - more heavy industry, more light industry, more construction, and many more jobs. It means better recreational facilities - better protection from floods. It means more revenues for local government to meet the urban problems of too little housing and too few schools and not enough parking space downtown.', 'Secondly, we must get moving on the problem of depressed areas, whether they are in eastern Massachusetts or eastern Kentucky. I have visited with the unemployed coal miners of West Virginia - living off surplus foods, worrying about where the rent will come from. I have seen the unemployed carpet workers in the Mohawk Valley of New York - trying desperately to learn a new trade and attract new industry. I have seen the farm-equipment plants shut down in southern Illinois, the lead and zinc mines closed in Idaho, and the deserted textile towns of Massachusetts. And I know, as the Bible tells us Job knew, that these troubles do not spring from the ground. Something caused them - and something can be done about them.', 'This Government is spending billions of dollars a year - in defense contracts, in housing, on highways, in education and other programs. And consideration must be given in the administration of those funds to help, not hurt, our most needy communities. Twice the Congress has passed a bill to help our distressed areas - twice that bill has been vetoed - but next year I promise you it will be signed.', 'Third, we must get moving on a constructive new program to strengthen the national economy by strengthening our farm economy. The one bright spot in the whole farm picture is tobacco - because the Democratic Congress put through a really worthwhile tobacco program, and protected it against Republican vetoes and Benson sabotage. That program has two essential features - full parity of income for the producers, and effective controls to bring supply into balance with demand. And I believe it is high time we made those two features the basis of our farm program for all commodities.', 'For that kind of program is in the best interests of the producers, the consumers, and the taxpayers. By helping the farmers, it helps the workers. By helping your State, it helps mine. Depression on the farm means depression in the small town and then depression in the city. It is time we replaced this downward spiral heading for a farm depression with an upward spiral of farm prosperity.', ""Finally, we must get moving on policies designed to strengthen our economy and society in every segment - helping the young in need of education, the aged in need of medical care, the small businessman in need of credit. Children whose education suffers from overcrowded classrooms or underpaid teachers can never gain back what they have lost - and it is the Nation's loss as well as theirs. Wage earners who must help their aged parents bear the high cost of drugs and medical bills - because they would never require their parents to take a Republican pauper's oath - have less money to build a future for themselves and their families. And the same high rates of interest that tie up the small businessman - or force him into bankruptcy - also slow down the farmer and discourage the homebuilder."", 'In short, the restrictive, negative policies of the Republican Party put a drag on our whole economy. By hurting one party they hurt us all. By holding back one area they hold back all. And this is no time for holding back the energies and efforts of the American people.', 'For these are not only domestic problems. These are problems of national strength. And only a strong America can stand up to Mr. Khrushchev, no matter how many debates we have in the kitchen. Only a strong America can attract the new nations of the world, no matter how many good will tours we take.', 'Why is it that so many of these countries turn their backs on us, and open their arms to Russia? It is not because they are Communists. Nkrumah of Ghana is no Communist. Sukarno of Indonesia is no Communist. But they are men on the move. They want the full fruits of independence. They want better homes for their people, and more jobs, and paved roads, and schools, and doctors, and cities, and food. They have turned to Washington, and found no response, because for 8 years Washington has not been on the move; and so they turn to Moscow, for the Russians have been moving.', 'These countries and these leaders speak a variety of languages. But once this country begins to move again, we will be speaking the language they understand; and they will turn their backs on those who would make a mockery of their new freedom, and rally to those who started the fight for independence.', 'None of this will be easy. The frontiers which Henry Clay conquered were not easy. But history was on his side - and I believe that history is on our side - on the side of free men. And I believe that once we are on the move, the sun will shine bright, not only on old Kentucky homes, but on new homes, across Kentucky, across America, and across the world.']"
230,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","['QUESTION. Dr. David Greeley, Harlan, Ky. Senator Kennedy, as you have indicated, thousands of people in eastern Kentucky and in the United States are unemployed, but those in eastern Kentucky have no prospect of employment, even with a total healthy economy. What do you propose to do, Senator, to help these people to help themselves?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, in eastern Kentucky the problem is comparable to the problem in West Virginia and the other States, where coal has brought in new machinery and automation has taken the jobs of men. I believe that the best program that we can put forward, as I suggested in my speech, was the so-called area redevelopment bill, which provides loans to small business, which provides loans and grants to communities to provide fresh water, which provides assistance for vocational retraining to train men for new jobs, loans for small businessmen at low rates of interest, supplemental unemployment compensation.', 'The second program that I think would be useful is to restore defense manpower policy No.4, which provides that defense contracts shall be steered into those areas which have chronic amounts of surplus labor. The figure prior to this was 8 percent, which had 8 percent over a period of a year or 18 months. I believe that that program could be useful in using defense contracts most of which are not by bid but which are negotiated, to put those in areas where it is possible, where there is chronic unemployment and little hope for new industry.', 'I would feel both of those, plus the coal research bill, plus the national fuels policy, I believe all of those would be of assistance in eastern Kentucky and these other hard-hit areas. I would use also my surplus foods far more imaginatively in the meanwhile. [Applause.]', 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Kenneth Hopkins from Franklin, Ky. I want to know when you are elected President, will your religion interfere in any way while you are President?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question was whether if I am elected President my religious afliliation would interfere with my being the President. I think quite obviously the answer is ""No."" The United States believes in the separation of church and state. I believe in it strongly. The Constitution of the United States, article 1, the first amendment provides for a separation of church and state. The President of the United States, in fact, could be impeached if he permitted improper pressures to be brought to bear upon him from any source, including a particular religious group.', ""Now, I don't think there is any doubt that there would not be those pressures. Americans have been on the Supreme Court. We have had two members of my faith who were Chief Justices of the Supreme Court. One was from Louisiana, who fought in the Confederacy in the war and who became Chief Justice - I believe Cleveland appointed him - and served with great distinction, Justice White, and of course, the man that Andrew Jackson nominated to the Supreme Court, Justice Tanney, who was also the same faith as I am. General de Gaulle, Adenauer, and three Prime Ministers of Canada are. I believe the record is clear that Americans of my faith are just as anxious to maintain the Constitution whether as President or as citizens as any other member of the community. [Applause.]"", 'QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, my name is Ben Mann. I am from the eastern Kentucky mountains. When I formulated my little question, I did not dare dream that my own personal little quandary would invite the attention of the next President of the United States. [Applause.] However, the question is this: As a Kentuckian, I married a Massachusetts girl. Can you state as evasively as Nixon would under the circumstances, which State, Kentucky or Massachusetts, produces the most beautiful women? [Laughter and applause.]', ""Senator KENNEDY. Taking a leaf out of the Vice President's book, my wife comes from New York, and, therefore, I would say that New York produces the most beautiful women. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""QUESTION. Senator Kennedy, I am Mrs. Agnes Elkins of La Grange, Ky., and being a farmer's daughter, I would like to know what you plan to do for the farmers and will you promote their program?"", 'Senator KENNEDY. In the place of the program which I suggested that Mr. Nixon had clearly advocated, which was to tie the support price for agricultural commodities to the average market price, to 90 percent of the average market price for the 3 preceding years, which as I suggested as the market price steadily drops, so would the support price, my own judgment is that, by effective controls, which would go not only to the acre but to the unit per acre, we should bring agricultural production into balance with demand. The Secretary of Agriculture would make a determination of how much we could consume of a commodity, and then provide that much production, plus that production which we would need for reserves, plus our own surplus distribution to our own citizens, plus the food for peace program, plus the distribution of food through the United Nations. But if the balance can be brought between supply and demand, if necessary if that still does not maintain an increasing price with a higher support price as in the case of tobacco, I believe that that would bring far greater relief to the farmer and also really more relief to the taxpayer. Tobacco, I think, shows the way for other agricultural commodities. What has happened in recent years, of course we have had dropping support price, limited controls, and therefore we have had more and more production per acre as the support prices dropped and we have had these tremendous surpluses.', ""Effective controls, a balance between supply and demand, if necessary a support price that will maintain the farmers' income at a higher level. [Applause.]"", 'Senator Kennedy, I am Leon Page, from Franklin, Ky. I understand that you do definitely favor Federal aid to education. My question is, Are you in favor of such aid being administered by the local and State boards of education?', 'Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Under the bill which passed the U.S. Senate, the money is given to the States to distribute. Each State receives the amount based on a formula, based on their per capita income, plus the number of children of school age, and the money is then distributed by the States and by the State board of education, under control of the local group and the State body. I would be opposed to the Federal Government assigning the money directly to the board of education in each community. But I believe that in this way we do get a supplemental assistance with appropriate tax overburden, and we still maintain local control of education, and I believe that this kind of program 15 in the public interest. The United States as a free society needs the best educated citizens in the world. All of us are at the mercy of the good judgment of a majority of the citizens. Whatever they decide binds us all. Therefore we want that majority to be as well educated as it possibly can be. Therefore, as a citizen of the State of Massachusetts, where Plymouth, Mass., developed the first public school system, I believe strongly in the maintenance of an effective public education system. [Applause.]']"
231,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Roush, Matt Welsh, who is going to be the next Governor of the State of Indiana [applause] and your present U.S. Senator, Vance Hartke [applause] Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my great appreciation to all of you for your kindness in coming out and giving us a warm Hoosier welcome. I understand that this town suffered a misfortune this morning when the bank was robbed. I am confident that the Indianapolis Star will say that Democrats arrive and bank robbed. But we don't believe that. [Laughter.]"", ""We are here on a different mission. We are here on a mission to rebuild this State and country. I think this is a most important election, and I believe the people of Indiana should make a careful judgment as to which party and which candidate they should endorse in this State and country. It has been 24 years since Indiana voted Democratic in a national election, in Franklin Roosevelt's second term in 1936. Each presidential year since then Indiana has voted Republican. But I must say that I think this year Indiana, which is participating as a part of the United States, must realize that at home and abroad this country is not realizing its full potential. Here in this State which has lost over 38,000 factory jobs in the last 8 years, which has seen its agricultural income go steadily down, which sees corn now sell for 93 or 94 or 95 cents and realizes that the bottom has not yet hit, I must say that any citizen of Indiana and any citizen of the United States should consider carefully this election. The kind of leadership which this country has, the kind of President which you elect, the kind of Congress which is dominated by one party or another, has a good deal to do with the prosperity of this city of Anderson, and the prosperity of the State of Indiana."", 'The kind of schools that you have, the kind of assistance which you have for the aged people of this country, the kind of agricultural program which stabilizes corn and hog and wheat prices, or permits them to go down, the kind of national defense, the kind of vigor with which the United States speaks in our relations abroad - all those are tied up in this presidential election.', 'My own judgment is that after 8 years of the Republicans that the Democrats can begin to move this country ahead. I think this is an important election. [Applause.] If there is any merchant in this town who thinks his business is good this fall, who looks to the future of 1961 with optimism, who thinks that agricultural prices are going to go up, who thinks that the tide is rising in Indiana and the Nation, who believes that our position is more secure in the world than it was 5 years ago, who believes that the balance of power is moving in our direction rather than in the direction of our enemies, I believe they should vote for Mr. Nixon. But any citizen of this community and any citizen of Indiana who believes that the balance of power in the world is not moving in our direction, who is concerned about the rise of Castro in Cuba, and the spread of his power through all of Latin America, who is concerned that the nations of Africa are not following our road but one of nentrality and one of increasing friendship with the Communists, who believes that the economy of this country is moving at a slow rate, who sees that we are only using 50 percent of our steel capacity, only 50 percent - last week the Soviet Union outproduced us in steel, though they have one-half of the potential we do, because we are only using 54 percent of our capacity.', ""Corn is down, steel mills are at 50 percent, a recession in 1958, and already less than 2 years later, we find the economy in the fall which should be our best time moving at a slower rate of growth than it should. This State and this country is going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years to maintain full employment. Here you have a General Motors plant and those of you who work there know that new machinery takes the place of men, and unless this country moves its economy at twice the rate it now is, you cannot maintain full employment in the United States. We have 4 million out of work and 3 million part time. And in the winter of 1961 and 1962, unless this country moves again, this State won't move. I don't care what happens in Indiana by itself - unless the rest of the country is going ahead. Who buys the products of General Motors? Not the citizens of Indiana but the citizens of the United States. Therefore, in this State, which for 24 years has sustained the Republicans, I think you should give us a chance. I think you should give us a chance to lead. [Applause.]"", 'I think the choice is between standing still and drifting, and moving ahead. The choice is between our meeting the unfinished business of our country and the cause of freedom around the world, or drifting along through the early sixties, the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. This district is fortunate to have a vigorous spokesman for its interests in the Congress, and Ed Roush speaks not only for this district, but for the United States. And Matt Welsh, I believe, can give leadership to this State as Governor of Indiana. In the final analysis what this district does and what this State does depends on what the United States is doing. Corn sells for the same price in Indiana as it does in Minnesota. Automobiles sell in Indiana and sell in Michigan and sell in Massachusetts. This country rises or falls based upon its economic growth, its economic vitality. And I come to Indiana facing a hard fight in this State, and I come here and ask your help in this campaign.', 'I ask your support, and I can assure you [applause] - I can assure you that if we are successful we will begin to give this country the kind of leadership which I think it needs, if it is not only to survive, but also to prevail. We will set before this country as Franklin Roosevelt did in the early thirties, our unfinished business.', 'I want those of you who are ready to move, and to see this country realize its potential, to join us. We will give this country, I think, the chance to meet its historic destiny of being the great example of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe.', 'The next 10 years will see the balance of power begin to move in the world in one direction or another. I want it to move with us. Lincoln said 100 years ago that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free. I don\'t think the world will exist in the long run half slave and half free. Whether it moves in the direction of slavery, or whether it moves in the direction of freedom depends, in the final analysis, upon the citizens of the United States; it depends upon us. To do that, I think this country must move. This country must go forward again. This country must say ""Yes"" to the sixties. This country must move. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

All those people who want to stand still, all those people who believe that things are as good as they can be, that the power of the United States is increasing as fast as it must, who are satisfied to have this country drift at home and abroad, they should join Mr. Nixon. But all those who look to the future, all those who want this country to move again, all those who want this country to get off dead center, I want your support, I want your support for the Democratic Party.

[Applause.]', 'Finally, let me say that I do not underrate the difficulty of this election. It will be hard fought in Kentucky and all across the United States. But this is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is a contest between two parties and their different philosophies between two outlooks, between one party which gives the green light to the sixties, and the other party which stands still between a party which moves forward, between a party which looks back, between a party which produced Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman and a party that produced Landon and Dewey and now in 1960 Mr. Nixon. I ask you to join us in this effort. This struggle in the same as the struggle 100 years ago. When Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend during the election of 1860, he said, ""I know there is a God, and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and I know His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, in the election of 1960, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming, but if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready Thank you.

233,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Kennedy. I am here running in Indiana, and I just wanted to stop here and ask your help in this campaign. I think that this is a difflcult and important election. I think the fight in this State is going to be close and hard fought. I have come here today and asked your help. I don't believe that anyone can live in Indiana and in the United States and feel that the tide is moving in our favor in this State and around the country. The economy now, with over 4 million people out of work, with corn in these fields selling for 95 and 93 or 92 cents, the economy with the steel mills down across the country using only 50 percent of capacity, I don't believe we need a diagram to know that the economy of this country is not moving to the fullest. I am sure that any merchant in this town would agree with that. We had a recession in 1958 and 1954. You cannot possibly afford in the United States, at this serious time, with all the responsibilities pressing upon us around the world, we cannot afford to have our economy moving slowly. This economy of the United States, on it depends our strength and the strength of the free world, and I believe that the fiscal and economic and legislative policies followed by this administration have contributed to this slowdown, on the farm, in the towns, and in the cities. I come here today and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.]"", 'I think there are very real issues in this campaign that divide the parties. Though I know that Indiana has not gone Democratic in any Presidential election, I think, since 1936, I believe that the United States and Indiana will move mto the Democratic column in November, and I come here today and ask your help. [Applause.]']"
234,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Tucker, Judge, Dutch Letzkus, Senator Hartke, your next Governor, Matt Welsh, your distinguished and hard working Congressman who has worked for this district and for the United States, Congressman Wampler, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that today is the Opening day of the world series. I would hate to think that politics is taking the place of baseball as the national sport, but I do think it indicates that the people of this country are concerned about what is happening, are anxious about what we are going to do are willing to join with us in building this State and building this country. The Pirates may win today, or the Yankees, but I think the Democrats are going to win on November 8. [Applause.] And I believe that here in this State of Indiana, in the heartland of the United States, along this Wabash River, I believe all the issues which are as significant to us as Indianians and as Americans are gathered here in this State. This State depends upon agriculture, and for the last 8 years farm income has gone steadily down. At the beginning of this first administration 8 years ago, corn in this State was selling for $1.50. It is selling now for 93 or 94 cents. And under the support program put forward by Mr. Nixon 10 days ago, where the support price is tied to the market price, corn next year will be selling at a lower price and at a lower price, and there isn't anyone in this community whose employment is not affected by the decline in agricultural income. It is no wonder that in the 1920's the recession and depression of 1929 was preceded by the sharpest decline in agricultural income that the country had seen up to that date. And now here in Indiana, and in this city of Terre Haute, you have unemployment of nearly 7 percent, you see steel mills in Gary and elsewhere in this State which are working 55 or 60 percent of capacity, and every merchant and every banker in the State of Indiana can tell you that this September and this October have been as difficult and hard as the September and October of 1957, and the September and October at the end of 1953, which preceded the recessions of 1954 and 1958."", ""I don't believe this country can afford another recession. The demands placed upon us are too great. Every time that we fail to meet our problems, every time that we fail to move our economy forward, we fail not only our own people, but we fail all those who look to us for leadership. My judgment is that there is a very clear choice between the Republican and the Democratic Parties. They stand for different things, and they have stood for different things all through this century. Woodrow Wilson, running in 1912, said that the Republican Party idea of policy is to sit on the lid. Franklin Roosevelt carried the fight in 1932 and 1936 and Harry Truman carried the fight in 1948, and on the issues which matter, housing, social security, medical care for the aged minimum wage, development of the resources of this country, I believe the Democratic Party looks forward. I believe it has presented to this country programs which move the economy of this country."", 'Indiana does not exist by itself. There is no business in Indiana that does not sell to the rest of the country, and if the rest of the country is standing still, if our economy is not moving forward, where are all the young men and women going to school in this State going to find jobs? We are going to have 25,000 people coming into the labor market every year, every week every year, for the next 10 years, and we are going to have to find them jobs, 25,000 new people a week for 10 years, looking for jobs. And unless this economy of this country moves forward, unless the Federal Government gives leadership we are not going to find jobs for those people or the people now working.', ""I believe the issue is very clear, and the issue is whether the American people are satisfied with things as they are, whether they feel that the 1960's are a time to really conserve and stand still and gather our energy, or whether the 1960's are a time to move forward again, as 1932 was, as 1912 was. Here in this State which has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1936, I recognize that this is a tough, uphill fight. But I believe that Indiana and the rest of the United States are going to choose in 1960 to look forward again, to put their confidence in the Democratic Party which, in other days in other years, in other crises, has produced leadership and has moved this country off dead center. [Applause.]"", ""I want to emphasize that what we do here, and the kind of society we build here, affects our position around the world. The strength of the United States depends on the strength of Indiana, Pittsburgh, Detroit, California. If this country is moving forward, if we are producing to our maximum, there is no country in the world that can catch us. The United States produced about one-third of the rate of economic growth last year as the Soviet Union, one-half that of Germany. If we were using our steel mills to the fullest, if we had an agricultural program that maintained farmers' income, if small business in this country was prosperous, if the monetary and fiscal policies of this administration did not rest on a high interest, hard money policy, then the economy of this country would move and no one could catch the United States. But if we drift, if we use our people and our resources at slow speed, then at a time when the world is in turmoil and in revolution, people to the South of us, people in Africa, people in Asia are going to determine that the way of the future belongs to the Communists."", 'Mr. Nixon says I downgrade America. I have served the United States just as long as he has, and I have just as much affection for it and just as high an opinion of it. I downgrade his leadership. [Applause.] I downgrade the Republican leadership. And anyone who thinks that the prestige of the United States is increasing as fast as it needs to should look around us. A Gallup poll taken in February in 10 countries scattered around the world showed that a majority of people in 9 of the 10 countries believed that the Soviet Union would be ahead of us militarily and scientifically by 1970. Why? Forty years ago the Soviet Union was the sickest country in Europe. Forty years ago the Soviet Union had no scientists and engineers. Now suddenly, in 40 years, they make the people of the world think they are going to be ahead of us, and if the people of the world feel they are the way of the future, then they turn to them, not to us.', ""I want leaders in Africa and Asia and Latin America to be quoting American statesmen. I don't want them to just quote Jefferson and Lincoln. I want them to be quoting American leaders who stand for freedom, who will build a strong country, who will extend the benefits of that prosperity to all Americans. I ask your help in Indiana. I ask your help in a tough fight. But I can tell you that we are going to win in this country, and I want Indiana to join us. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
235,John F. Kennedy ,"October 05, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Matt Welsh, who I am sure is going to be Governor of this State, Senator Vance Hartke, Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my thanks to you for coming here today. I believe that we have in Indiana a tough fight, but my judgment is that Indiana, which has not supported the national ticket of the Democratic Party since 1936, has had enough. [Applause] I cannot believe that this State, which depends upon its farm economy, which depends upon its industrial economy, I cannot believe that the people of Indiana are going to endorse any program which says you never had it so good. I believe we can do better, and I come here to Indiana today and ask your support as a Democrat, as a Democratic candidate for the office of the Presidency. [Applause.]', 'The United States throughout its history has moved back and forth like a pendulum between the Republican and the Democratic Party. It has chosen on some occasions the conservative course, and on other occasions it has looked ahead. I believe that this year, like 1912, when Woodrow Wilson ran against Taft and won, and like 1932, when Franklin Roosevelt ran against Herbert Hoover and won, and 1948, when Harry Truman ran against Dewey and won, I believe in 1960 when we run against Mr. Nixon, we are going to win. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon said the other night in Boston that I was another Truman. I regard it as a compliment, and I returned it to him - [applause] - and I suggested that perhaps he was another Dewey. [Laughter.] I believe the issue is very clear, and the people of this State should understand them. They are between a party which regards $1.25 minimum wage as too extreme, a party and a candidate which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as too extreme, between a party which vetoes an area redevelopment bill as too extreme, between a party which regards a progressive farm policy which will bring supply and demand into balance as too extreme.', ""Now, if you regard those programs as extreme, I believe you should support Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party. But if you believe that you cannot have a prosperous town in this State if your agricultural income continues to drop, if you recognize that under the program which Mr. Nixon put forward, which is a continuation of the Benson program, and corn which sold 8 years ago for $1.50 sells in this State at 95 cents today, will sell next year at 80 cents, and down and down it will go, because this administration's farm program provides for a free market price, and the free market price for corn in this country with unlimited production will take that down at least 20 percent below what it is selling at today, and if any merchant in this State feels he can prosper with corn on the downward trend, with unemployment in this State, at 6.8 percent to 7 percent, any merchant in this country who feels he can move forward when steel production is at 50 percent of capacity, which it is in the United States, when 7 out of 8 International Harvester plants in Illinois closed down in the last 2 weeks, and they may open some of them in October - if that is the kind of country you want and that is the kind of economy you believe in, if those are the programs you want, I believe you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you believe it is time this country moved forward, if you believe we have stood on dead center long enough, if you believe that the balance of power in the world should shift in our direction instead of against us, if you believe that the United States should be first - not first but, if, sometimes or perhaps, but first, period. I want your help. '[Applause.]"", 'When the United States is second in space, when we turn out one half as many scientists and engineers, the Soviet Union, when their economic growth is three times ours now, and Western Germany, Italy, and France twice the growth, when we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years to maintain full employment in Indiana and the country, I cannot believe that the people of this State and the people of the United States are going to give an endorsement and continue that leadership.', 'I ask you to join us in moving ahead. I ask you to put your confidence in our party and in our leadership, a leadership which in this century has produced Mr. Truman and Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wilson. I do not ask you to put your confidence in a leadership in this century which has produced Mr. McKinley and Coolidge and Harding and Hoover and Landon and Dewey and now in 1960, Mr. Nixon. I believe we can do better. [Applause.]', 'This is a hard campaign and it is closely fought, and it is very close, in this State and around the country, and it is going to be closely fought until November 8, but in the final analysis you have to make your judgment, as to what you want this country to be, the kind of leadership which you want, whether you want the President of the United States and the Congress to place before the American people the unfinished business of our society, and then start this country moving again.

237,John F. Kennedy ,"October 06, 1960","[""I want to talk with you tonight about the most glaring failure of American foreign policy today - about a disaster that threatens the security of the whole Western Hemisphere - about a Communist menace that has been permitted to arise under our very noses, only 90 miles from our shores. I am talking about the one friendly island that our own shortsighted policies helped make communism's first Caribbean base: the island of Cuba."", ""Two years ago in September of 1958 - bands of bearded rebels descended from Cuba's Sierra Maestra Mountains and began their long march on Havana - a march which ended in the overthrow of the brutal, bloody, and despotic dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista."", 'The slogans, the manifestos, and the broadcasts of this revolution reflected the deepest aspirations of the Cuban people. They promised individual liberty and free elections. They promised an end to harsh police-state tactics. They promised a better life for a people long oppressed by both economic and political tyranny.', 'But in the 2 years since that revolution swept Fidel Castro into power, those promises have all been broken. There have been no free elections - and there will be none as long as Castro rules. All political parties - with the exception of the Communist Party - have been destroyed. All political dissenters have been executed, imprisoned, or exiled. All academic freedom has been eliminated. All major newspapers and radio stations have been seized. And all of Cuba is in the iron grip of a Communist-oriented police state.', 'Castro and his gang have betrayed the ideals of the Cuban revolution and the hopes of the Cuban people.', ""But Castro is not just another Latin American dictator - a petty tyrant bent merely on personal power and gain. His ambitions extend far beyond his own shores. He has transformed the island of Cuba into a hostile and militant Communist satellite - a base from which to carry Communist infiltration and subversion throughout the Americas. With guidance, support, and arms from Moscow and Peiping, he has made anti-Americanism a sign of loyalty and anti-communism a punishable crime - confiscated over a billion dollars' worth of American property - threatened the existence of our naval base at Guantanamo - and rattled red rockets at the United States, which can hardly close its eyes to a potential enemy missile or submarine base only 90 miles from our shores."", 'He has transformed the island into a supply depot for Communist arms and operations throughout South America - recruiting small bands of Communist-directed revolutionaries to serve as the nucleus of future Latin revolutions. ""This army,"" Castro has boasted, ""begins in Cuba and ends in Argentina."" His abusive anti-American and pro-Communist messages are carried in books and newspapers shipped to every corner of the hemisphere - often concealed in diplomatic pouches - and handed out together with Soviet propaganda by the Cuban embassies. Presna Latina - Latin America\'s largest news agency, controlled from Havana - carries anti-American and pro-Soviet dispatches throughout the hemisphere. And Radio Mambi - the anchor station of a network which will be beamed at the entire South American continent - broadcasts constant attacks on the United States and the leaders of every Latin American democracy.', ""Exploiting the twin themes of human misery and Yankee hatred, Castro's campaign has met with success in almost every country - in Brazil, where both Presidential candidates found it politically expedient to appeal to pro-Castro and anti-American elements in the electorate - in Mexico, where anti-American riots followed pressure on a pro-Castro spokesman - in Guatemala, where Castro-equipped revolutionaries are a real menace - in Uruguay, where a general strike was threatened if Castro was not supported at the San Jose Conference. And - at the same foreign ministers' conferenc - the United States suffered one of its few diplomatic defeats in the history of inter-American relations, when it was forced to withdraw its protest over Communist efforts in this hemisphere."", 'This is a critical situation - to find so dangerous an enemy on our very doorstep. The American people want to know how this was permitted to happen - how the Iron Curtain could have advanced almost to our front yard. They want to know the truth - and I believe that they are entitled to the truth. It is not enough to blame it on unknown State Department personnel. Major policy on issues such as Cuban security is made at the highest levels - in the National Security Council and elsewhere - and it is the party in power which must accept full responsibility for this disaster.', 'The story of the transformation of Cuba from a friendly ally to a Communist base is - in large measure - the story of a government in Washington which lacked the imagination and compassion to understand the needs of the Cuban people - which lacked the leadership and vigor to move forward to meet those needs - and which lacked the foresight and vision to see the inevitable results of its own failures.', 'And it is a tragic irony that even while these policies of failure here were being pursued our policymakers received repeated and urgent warnings that international communism was becoming a moving force behind Mr. Castro and the revolution - that our interest and the interests of freedom were in danger - that a new Soviet satellite was in the making.', 'Our Ambassador to Cuba in the early days of the revolution - Arthur Gardner - repeatedly warned the administration that communism was a moving force in the Castro leadership. Testifying recently before a Senate committee, he was asked if he had not reported ""that Castro talked and acted like a Communist and should not be supported by the United States."" ""That was absolutely correct,"" he replied, and he went on to say: ""We all knew * * * that Raul Castro was a Communist;"" but his warnings, he testified, were ignored, overlooked, or circumvented as the menace of Cuban communism grew.', 'Our Ambassador to Cuba in the closing years of the revolution - Earl Smith - also warned us that communism threatened Cuba. He, too, was asked by the same Senate committee if he had been warning ""that Castro was a Marxist."" ""Yes, sir,"" he replied; but his warnings also had been consistently ignored.', 'And the State Department itself, in a paper issued little more than a month ago - belatedly admitted that ""Communist influence existed in the early days of the revolution.""', 'But, if we are not to imitate the partisan irresponsibility of others, we must do more than charge that these storm signals were ignored. The real question is: What should we have done? What did we do wrong? How did we permit the Communists to establish this foothold 90 miles away?', 'The answer is fourfold.', 'First, we refused to help Cuba meet its desperate need for economic progress. In 1953 the average Cuban family had an income of $6 a week. Fifteen to twenty percent of the labor force was chronically unemployed.', 'Only a third of the homes in the island even had running water, and in the years which preceded the Castro revolution this abysmal standard of living was driven still lower as population expansion out-distanced economic growth.', ""Only 90 miles away stood the United States - their good neighbor - the richest Nation on earth - its radios and newspapers and movies spreading the story of America's material wealth and surplus crops."", 'But instead of holding out a helping hand of friendship to the desperate people of Cuba, nearly all our aid was in the form of weapons assistance - assistance which merely strengthened the Batista dictatorship - assistance which completely failed to advance the economic welfare of the Cuban people - assistance which enabled Castro and the Communists to encourage the growing belief that America was indifferent to Cuban aspirations for a decent life.', 'This year Mr. Nixon admitted that if we had formulated a program of Latin American economic development 5 years ago: ""It might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Castro takeover."" But what Mr. Nixon neglects to mention is the fact that he was in Cuba 5 years ago himself - gaining experience. He saw the conditions. He talked with the leaders. He knew what our aid program consisted of. But his only conclusion as stated in a Havana press conference, was his statement that he was ""very much impressed with the competence and stability"" of the Batista dictatorship.', 'Mr. Nixon could not see then what should have been obvious - and which should have been even more obvious when he made his ill-fated Latin American trip in 1958 - that unless the Cuban people, with our help, made substantial economic progress, trouble was on its way. If this is the kind of experience Mr. Nixon claims entitles him to be President, then I would say that the American people cannot afford many more such experiences.', ""Secondly, in a manner certain to antagonize the Cuban people, we used the influence of our Government to advance the interests of and increase the profits of the private American companies, which dominated the island's economy. At the beginning of 1959 U.S. companies owned about 40 percent of the Cuban sugar lands - almost all the cattle ranches - 90 percent of the mines and mineral concessions - 80 percent of the utilities - and practically all the oil industry - and supplied two-thirds of Cuba's imports."", 'Of course, our private investment did much to help Cuba. But our action too often gave the impression that this country was more interested in taking money from the Cuban people than in helping them build a strong and diversified economy of their own.', ""The symbol of this shortsighted attitude is now on display in a Havana museum. It is a solid gold telephone presented to Batista by the American-owned Cuban telephone company. It is an expression of gratitude for the excessive telephone rate increase which the Cuban dictator had granted at the urging of our Government. But visitors to the museum are reminded that America made no expression at all over the other events which occurred on the same day this burdensome rate increase was granted, when 40 Cubans lost their lives in an assault on Batista's palace."", 'The third, and perhaps most disastrous of our failures, was the decision to give stature and support to one of the most bloody and repressive dictatorships in the long history of Latin American repression. Fulgencio Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in 7 years - a greater proportion of the Cuban population than the proportion of Americans who died in both World Wars, and he turned democratic Cuba into a complete police state - destroying every individual liberty.', 'Yet, our aid to his regime, and the ineptness of our policies, enabled Batista to invoke the name of the United States in support of his reign of terror.', 'Administration spokesmen publicly praised Batista - hailed him as a stanch ally and a good friend - at a time when Batista was murdering thousands, destroying the last vestiges of freedom, and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from the Cuban people, and we failed to press for free elections.', 'In October 1958 just a few days before Batista held a rigged and fraudulent election - Secretary of State Dulles was the guest of honor at a reception held by the Batista Embassy in Washington. The reception made only the social pages in Washington; but it made the Havana--and it was used by Batista to show how America favored his rule.', 'We stepped up a constant stream of weapons and munitions to Batista - justified in the name of hemispheric defense, when, in fact, their only real use was to crush the dictator\'s opposition, and even when the Cuban civil war was raging - until March of 1958 - the administration continued to send arms to Batista which were turned against the rebels - increasing anti-American feeling and helping to strengthen the influence of the Communists. For example, in Santa Clara, Cuba, today there is an exhibit commemorating the devastation of that city by Batista\'s planes in December of 1958. The star item in that exhibit is a collection of bomb fragments inscribed with a handshake and the words: ""Mutual Defense - made in U.S.A.""', ""Even when our Government had finally stopped sending arms, our military missions stayed to train Batista's soldiers for the fight against the revolution - refusing to leave until Castro's forces were actually in the streets of Havana."", 'Finally, while we were allowing Batista to place us on the side of tyranny, we did nothing to persuade the people of Cuba and Latin America that we wanted to be on the side of freedom. In 1953 we eliminated all regular Spanish language broadcasts of the Voice of America. Except for the 6 months of the Hungarian crisis we did not beam a single continuous program to South America at any time in the critical years between 1953 and 1960. And less than 500 students a year were brought here from all Latin America during these years when our prestige was so sharply dropping.', 'It is no wonder, in short, that during these years of American indifference the Cuban people began to doubt the sincerity of our dedication to democracy. They began to feel that we were more interested in maintaining Batista than we were in maintaining freedom - that we were more interested in protecting our investments than we were in protecting their liberty - that we wanted to lead a crusade against communism abroad but not against tyranny at home. Thus, it was our own policies - not Castro\'s - that first began to turn our former good neighbors against us. And Fidel Castro seized on this rising anti-American feeling, and exploited it, to persuade the Cuban people that America was the enemy of democracy - until the slogan of the revolution became ""Cuba, Si, Yanqui, No"" - and Soviet imperialism had captured a movement which had originally sprung from the ideals of our own American Revolution.', 'The great tragedy today is that we are repeating many of the same mistakes throughout Latin America. The same grievances - the same poverty and discontent and distrust of America which Castro rode to power are smoldering in almost every Latin Nation.', ""For we have not only supported a dictatorship in Cuba - we have propped up dictators in Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic. We not only ignored poverty and distress in Cuba - we have failed in the past 8 years to relieve poverty and distress throughout the hemisphere. For despite the bleak poverty that grips nearly all of Latin America - with an average income of less than $285 a year - with an exploding population that threatens even this meager standard of living - yet our aid programs have continued to concentrate on wasteful military assistance until we made a sudden recognition of their needs for development capital practically at the point of Mr. Castro's gun."", 'Today time is running out in Latin America. Our once firm friends are drifting away. Our historic ties are straining under our failure to understand their aspirations. And although the cold war will not be won in Latin America, it could very well be lost there.', 'If we continue to repeat our past errors - if we continue to care more for the support of regimes than the friendship of people - if we continue to devote greater effort to the support of dictators than to the fight against poverty and hunger - then rising discontent will provide fertile ground for Castro and his Communist friends.', ""What can a new administration do to reverse these trends? For the present Cuba is gone. Our policies of neglect and indifference have let it slip behind the Iron Curtain - and for the present no magic formula will bring it back. I have no basic disagreement with the President's policies of recent months - for the time to save Cuba was some time ago."", 'Hopefully, events may once again bring us an opportunity to bring our influence strongly to bear on behalf of the cause of freedom in Cuba. But in the meantime we can constantly express our friendship for the Cuban people - our sympathy with their economic problems - our determination that they will again be free. At the same time we must firmly resist further Communist encroachment in this hemisphere - working through a strengthened organization of the American States - and encouraging those liberty-loving Cubans who are leading the resistance to Castro. And we must make it clear to Mr. Castro once and for all that we will defend our naval base at Guantanamo under all circumstances - and continue to seek reparation for his seizures of American property.', 'But whatever we do in Cuba itself, ultimately the road to freedom in Havana runs through Rio and Buenos Aires and Mexico City. For if we are to halt the advance of Latin communism, we must create a Latin America where freedom can flourish - where long enduring people know, at last, that they are moving toward a better life for themselves and their children - where steady economic advance is a framework for stable, democratic Government - and where tyranny, isolated and despised, eventually withers on the vine.', 'These are difficult problems - problems requiring a program which I will soon discuss in a major address on Latin American policy. But only if we extend the hand of American friendship in a common effort to wipe out the poverty and discontent and hopelessness on which communism feeds - only then will we drive back tyranny until it ultimately perishes in the streets of Havana.', 'And, so tonight, I address myself not only to the people of Ohio and the people of America, but also to the people of Cuba. And to our friends - the Cuban people - I recall the scriptural injunction: ""Be of stout heart. Be not dismayed."" The road ahead will not be easy.', 'The perils and hardships will be many. But here in America we pledge ourselves to raise high the light of freedom - until it burns brightly from the Arctic to Cape Horn - and one day that light will shine again.']"
238,John F. Kennedy ,"October 06, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor DiSalle, John Weithe, Mr. Garrett, ladies, and Gentlemen, I come here in 1960, to this State of Ohio, seeking the election as President of the United States, recognizing that the responsibilities and burdens of the next President will be greater than any since 1860 and 1861. I do not run for the Presidency after 14 years in the Congress without full recognition that, as Harry Truman used to say, on his desk there was a sign ""The buck stops here.""', 'In my judgment, the great questions of war and peace, of full employment, of economic growth, of a stronger society, of equal opportunity for all, will depend in the final analysis upon the President of the United States. [Applause.] Not upon the House and not upon the Senate. Congressmen speak for one district. Members of the U.S. Senate speak for one State - I speak for Massachusetts and Senator Engle speaks for California - but only the President of the United States speaks for Massachusetts and California. And the question which Cincinnati and Ohio must decide for themselves is which President, which party, which political philosophy you want to govern in the Office of the President of the United States, because there are very sharp differences, there are very sharp differences between Mr. Nixon and myself. [Applause.] They have been written, and there are in 1960, as there have been in other periods of our history, very sharp differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', 'Cincinatti has voted - it is called Cincinnati in Boston, and I am from Boston [Laughter and applause] - we are going to explain to you how to pronounce it [laughter]. This city [laughter] - this city has supported the Republican candidate for the office of the Presidency ever since 1936. I think it is time you changed. [Applause.]', ""I think that this country needs a New Deal for the Democratic Party and the United States. [Applause.] I don't believe that this city and the State of Ohio wants for a President of the United States in 1961, a man who thinks a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour for someone working in interstate commerce is extreme. I don't believe that anyone who believes in Federal aid to education, and to make sure that our teachers are well compensated - anyone who believes that that is extreme, I don't believe the American people are going to endorse that leadership. [Applause.]"", ""I don't believe that the American people are going to give their endorsement to the leadership which believes that medical care for our older citizens, financed under social security, is extreme, and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately - which he does not always do me. [Applause.] I don't believe in an administration whose economic and fiscal policies, whose devotion to high interest rates have helped bring the recession of 1954 and a recession of 1958, and bring a leveling off in 1960, that is ominous for 1961. The men and women in this audience who work in our factories, the small businessmen who depend on credit and on a moving economy to make his living, the children who go to over-crowded schools [response from the audience] the people who are looking to retirement, I think they are going to vote in 1960 as this country has voted in other years, in favor of a party of progress and a country of progress. [Applause.]"", 'And all this in the most dangerous time in the life of our country. All this has significance to the position of the United States and the world around us. If the United States stands still, if it does not show vision and vitality in its policy here at home, how does anyone think it is going to show vision and vitality in our policy abroad?', 'The United States last June offered 300 scholarships to the Congo because of the crisis. That was more scholarships than we had offered the 2 preceding years to all of Africa. When we broke off the sugar quota from Cuba last June, we offered economic aid to Latin America. Mr. Nixon, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said that if we had developed that program 5 years ago, perhaps we could have prevented Castro from seizing power in Cuba. Well, this administration was in power Syears ago. We ignored Latin America. We have given more aid to Yugoslavia since the end of World War II than all of Latin America combined. There is not a present American statesman who is quoted by any African leader today. They stand on the razoredge of decision. They wonder whether the world and the future belongs to the Communists or belongs to us. A Gallup poll taken in February among 10 countries of the world, in which the people were asked a simple question - which country, the Soviet Union or the United States, will be first in military and scientific power in 1970. The Soviet Union, which 40 years ago was the most backward country of Europe, was asked and a majority of the citizens of every country but one said the Soviet Union would be first, both militarily and scientifically. Why do they think so? Why have we fallen behind? Why do they believe that they will be stronger than we are? We have an economy twice theirs. We have a long history of scientific progress. Why in the short space of 40 years has the Soviet Union been able to capture the imagination of the peeple? Why are we second in outer space and second in the minds of many of the people of Africa and beginning to be second in the minds of many of the people of Latin America? Why was it necessary for a presidential candidate, in Brazil, in the middle of his campaign, to pay a visit to Castro? Why was the United States unable to get an indictment of Castro by name at the last meeting of the Organization of American States?', 'Because the power and prestige of the United States, relative to that of the Communist world, has diminished in the last decade; because these people wonder whether the future belongs to the Castros and the Khrushchevs and the neutralists who are turning to hostility. They wonder whether the future belongs to freedom.', ""That is the great issue of 1961 and 1962. I must say I don't think we can capture the imagination of the world, we cannot capture the imagination of our own people, unless we have an administration manned by men and women who look to the future, who recognize that this is a changing and a revolutionary world, and that what was good enough 10 or 15 years ago is no longer good enough."", 'I want Africans and Latin Americans not to quote Roosevelt or Lincoln or Jefferson; I want them to be quoting the next President of the United States. [Applause.] I want us to stand for freedom. I want us to demonstrate in this country, as we sit on a most conspicuous stage, that we are a strong and vital country, that we and the cause of freedom are closely identified, that we want a better life for our people, that we do not in this country practice discrimination of any kind, that all we want is the best talent we can get. That is the kind of society we can build, and what we do here and what we are will speak far louder than what we say over the Voice of America.', ""Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States. I believe that in the 1960's the United States can once again capture the imagination of the world. We can once again be the wonder of those who seek to follow freedom's road. Freedom's road begins in Washington, but it stretches around the globe. We want people to join us. The future belongs to the United States, and those who believe as we do. Our high noon is yet to come. The Communist system is as old as Egypt, and if we do our job, if we demonstrate vigor and vitality here, we can radiate it around the world until finally all those who wish to be free will finally come with us. That is the opportunity. That is our chance. [Applause.]"", 'I ask your support in this campaign, not promising a life of ease, but promising the U.S. leadership which leads, leadership which sets before us our unfinished business, leadership which will get this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
239,John F. Kennedy ,"October 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Robinson, Congressman Bolling, Mrs. Lawson, Mr. Reeves, ladies, and gentlemen, I regret that the Republican member has not shown up as yet to debate with Congressman Bolling or Mr. Nixon. I would like to present their case for them. [Laughter.] But I would rather speak for our case. I would also rather address myself to the matter which is before you. I am confident that Congressman Bolling has done this effectivdy because I know no one in the Congress over a long period of time, even before his period in the Congress, who has shown greater responsibility and vigor in extending the benefits of our constitutional system to all Americans. Therefore, I am delighted and honored that he would represent us here tonight. [Applause.]', 'A political campaign is an important time because it gives the American people an opportunity to make a judgment as to which course of action they want to follow, which leadership, which viewpoint, which political philosophy, and it is also an important time for political parties, because it does give the political party an opportunity not merely to live off its past successes, but also consider where it is going in the future, what contribution it can make. That responsibility falls particularly heavily on a minority party, a party out of power, because it is its function under our system to present alternatives, to suggest better ways of accomplishing the goals which all America seeks, and I believe this responsibility falls particularly heavily in 1960, because we face many problems here and abroad which I believe transcend any since 1932, since the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, and in many ways transcends any that we have faced since the administration of Lincoln 100 years ago.', 'The great question, of course, is can we make freedom work here and around the world. Can we sustain it? Can we demonstrate over a long period of time that our system represents the best means of organizing human society? The hard, tough question for the next decade, and indeed for the rest of the century, is whether we in this country with our freedom of choice, our breadth of opportunity, our range of alternatives, can we mobilize sufficient strength, can we set a sufficient example, can we extend the hand of friendship with sufficient warmth that we can mobilize and not only endure but prevail over a Communist system?', ""In order to maintain our freedom, to meet our commitments, to the Constitution, to the great moral principles enunciated by this country's leaders, we have to, as I say tonight, set a high example, and I believe it is the function of our party, the Democratic Party, in the early days of the l960's to move this country closer toward that example."", ""I said last week on television and gave some statistics which I don't think most Americans know or believe strongly enough; the prospects, percentagewise, of a Negro child getting through high school, of that child getting to college, of that child becoming a professional man, of that child when it is born owning its house, of that child being unemployed or the average income that that child will have, or the prospect of whether that child goes to work for the Government, what his rating will be, whether he will be a district judge, and now we have only 1 that is a Negro out of some 200, the chances of that child getting through high school are about a third. The same percent getting through college is one-quarter of a white baby being born in the house next door, the chance of owning his house is far less of a percentage, and the chances of being unemployed are far greater."", ""I think we cannot afford in 1960 to waste any talent which we have. It is a matter of our natonal survival as well as a matter of national principle, and I believe that the President of the United States must take the leadership in setting the moral tone, the unfinished business, in setting the sights of Americans to the goal realizing the talents in an equal way of every American. Every American's talents are not equal. Every American will not finish school or college or own a house, but that should be on the basis of his contribution to society, his energy, his vitality, his intelligence, his motivations, not based on the color of his skin. That is the goal of the society which I think we should work toward in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'Let me say I think the President of the United States has a great opportunity. This is a place preeminently for moral leadership as Franklin Roosevelt said, and I believe if the President of the United States indicates his strong support of the extension of equal constitutional rights to all Americans wherever they may live, if he stands strongly behind the principle of equality of opportunity of education and employment, I believe this country will then recognize the moral imperative behind the laws which the Congress has passed, or which the Constitution promotes.', 'Secondly, I believe the Congress has a responsibility. Title 3, I believe, would be important as it would give the Attorney General the right as you know to carry out suits as he now has in the case of voting, but which I believe he has not carried out with vigor. I believe in equality in opportunity of employment which is extremely important and then I believe we have to improve our educational standards for all children, regardless of their color, all children, white and Negro. We are producing about half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. We have to improve our educational system as a whole, and we have to improve our economics as a whole.', ""If we attempt to patch up those areas in our national life where equality of opportunity is not provided, if we give force and vigor to the concept of that equality, if we sustain it with laws, if we sustain it by executive action, if we sustain it by moral force and if we lift the economy of the whole and all Americans, then I believe we will be meeting our responsibility to the 1960's."", 'Also we have a clear reminder that we who are white are a minority in this global world, and all those over the world who are colored are now reaching greater and greater power, the whole course of history for the past 150 years has been toward freedom.', ""I have had a basic disagreement not only with the administration's policy in the past 8 years, but also on the question of colonialism versus freedom. I spoke of this matter when it involved Indochina and the Democrats and Algeria and the Republicans. I spoke as it involves all of Africa, Latin America and Asia. We have the desires of these people to be free. If there is any experience that should give us courage, it is not that one-quarter of the nations of Africa are neutral. We were neutral for 125 years in our own history. The fact is they are free and independent. They have now won their freedom and they do not choose to lose it, provided they are given an opportunity to develop their resources under a system of freedom. Man's desire to be free is the strongest force not only in this country but around the world. We should associate ourselves with it."", 'I said tonight when we offered 300 scholarships to the Congo, we offered only 200 to Africa. You cannot educate a man in the Congo overnight. Education is a long process that takes years and experience and we should have been looking at Latin America and Asia years and years ago and not moving into these areas where you think you can pour in money and educate them for leadership overnight. [Applause.]', 'Finally, let me say that I believe that the contribution that the Democratic Party can best make is not merely in the contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. The question is, What is the viewpoint of those who sustain us? I believe the viewpoint of those who sustain us, of the central channel of the party which I represent was carried out at the convention and was carried out on the platform. I believe it is carried out on the record of the Congress. That record is not perfect, and there are shortcomings in any two-party system, but I believe the central movement forward of the Democratic Party in this century has been full. It has been willing to meet new problems in new ways. It has been willing to break new ground. It has been willing to mobilize the best talent we have got and I think it can do it in the sixties, and can do it better than it did it before because the needs are greater.', 'Let me say your needs are great. There is no need for providing the right to vote in some States where Negroes are denied the vote unless they vote to the fullest. [Applause.] Unless in those communities where they are given their rights to participate in the political process they do it as free individuals, not part of some great organization or other, but speaking as individuals giving their considered judgment on what is best for their country and what is best for themselves and what is best for the cause of freedom. So it is, I believe, that you have a chance to make a singular contribution to the life of this country.', 'Every educated man or woman who is a Negro has not only the opportunity to advance their own private interests - and I think this is true of every American - but they have the obligation to advance the common cause, advance the interests of their own people because in doing that I think they advance the interests of their country. [Applause.]', 'I hope it will be possible for more and more of them to serve the United States outside our boundaries, in the Foreign Service, in the information services, as doctors and nurses, not just in Africa, but in Europe, Asia, Africa, freely in areas and indicating our great contribution, our strong belief that we want to use all the talent that we can get. Actually a far greater responsibility rests upon the Negro leadership than it does upon the leadership of almost any other group, and I believe that by meetings such as this you are meeting that responsibility.', ""We emphasize always the public interest, to emphasize the necessity for it in a responsible, steady way, and I believe in the 1960's we can move in this area. We can provide a better life for our people, that we can provide better, stronger human rights for all American and I want to make it clear win or lose in this election, the is and I regard it as a close, hard fought election, the issues will probably be down to the end, but my own judgment is win or lose, I can assure you that the Democratic Party in the future, as it has in its great moments in the past, particularly when it has had a President to speak for it - I believe the Democratic Party can in the future be identified with the cause of a better life for all Americans of all sections of the United States regardless of any circumstances of their race or religion and that they will hold any office to which they aspire based on their competence and ability and strong feeling for this country.

That is Western Kentucky State College in the winter and the Democratic Party in November. [Applause.]', 'I am delighted to be in this community with two distinguished colleges and universities, a center of education and where there is a look to the future. Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body of Bowling Green Business University or Western Kentucky is here today, which third of the student body is here today, but I am confident that I am talking to the future rulers of America. [Applause.] In the sense that all educated citizens participate in the discipline of self-government.', 'I come today as a candidate for the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party, which is the only national party in the United States [applause] and which was founded when Thomas Jefferson and James Madison went up in the early part of the 19th century, traveled up the Hudson River on a botanical expedition, hunting butterflies and catching fish, and they came down the Hudson River and they stopped in New York and met Aaron Burr and the knights of Tammany, and founded the coalition which then developed between the rural South and the industrial North. That tradition has been maintained to the present day.', 'I come today from Massachusetts, not hunting butterflies, but asking Kentucky to rejoin the Democratic Party. [Applause.] Here in this State which has been represented by great Democratic Senators in the past, which sent Fred Vinson to the Senate, which sent Alben Barkley to the Vice Presidency, I believe in 1960, Kentucky and the country are going to say ""Yes"" to the future, ""Yes"" to the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', 'The history of this country moves in rhythms, back and forth, between progress and standing still, between liberalism and conservation, and I believe in 1960 the choice for the United States is forward. I cannot believe that in the most revolutionary age that the world has ever known, in science, technology, in outer space, in the minds of men around the globe, I cannot believe that the American people are going to give their endorsement to a political party which says, ""You have never had it so good,"" which endorses the status quo, which endorses the past, which says that everything that is necessary to be done is being done. I cannot believe that the American people will not say that in these changing times, in these times of revolution, in these times of forward motion around the world - I believe that the Democratic Party is best suited to lead in those times. [Applause.]', 'I believe the record is clear. No democratic candidate for the Presidency ever said that party labels are unimportant. Every Republican candidate every 4 years says, ""Don\'t pay any attention to the record of our parties."" No Democratic President ever called TVA ""creeping socialism."" [Applause.] No Democratic President ever ran on a record of repealing social security. No Democratic President ever vetoed a tobacco bill. [Applause.] No Democratic President in this century has presided over the temporary liquidation of American agriculture which has seen a drop in corn in the last 8 years of nearly 30 percent, which has seen livestock go down 23 percent in the last 8 years, and which puts forward an agricultural program, a complete repetition of Mr. Benson - and why not. Nixon called Mr. Benson the most remarkable Secretary of Agriculture in the history of the United States.', '(Response from the audience.)', ""Senator KENNEDY. And I must agree. He has spent more money than any Secretary of Agriculture, or all of them, in the history of the United States. He has piled up higher surpluses. He has dropped farmers income more sharply and after 8 years in office he still blames it on the Democrats. He is the most remarkable Secretary of Agriculture in history. But I cannot believe that this country is going to give their endorsement to a program which continues Mr. Benson's policy of tying the support price on agricultural commodities, tying the support price to the market price of the last 8 years, which will provide a steady drop in agricultural income. This is a serious time, and I believe that the United States if it is to meet its manifest destiny, must build its strength here at home."", 'The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. And I know of no better example of the partnership which can exist between local groups and States and the National Government than the development of the Tennessee Valley, and I do not know any project in this long history of ours that has had a more lasting effect all over the globe, in eastern Persia, in the Indus River, in the country of Colombia, in South America - every country now is trying to duplicate what the Tennessee Valley did. And it is a source of satisfaction to me that the Tennessee Valley received its greatest impetus in the twenties not from a man who represented the people of this area, but from George Norris and the State of Nebraska, 1,000 miles away, who recognized the national interest, who put the Tennessee Valley, with Franklin Roosevelt and the rest, in over the opposition of the Republican Party and built this valley until it is now one of the richest in the Nation. [Applause.]', 'I say that party labels do mean something, if the party stands for something. No political party is of any use to the people, nor is any politician if he does not stand for definite principles and the principles that I stand for in this century are the same principles that Woodrow Wilson stood for in 1912, and which Franklin Roosevelt stood for in 1932, and which President Truman campaigned on in 1948, and my judgment is that their success abroad, the success of the foreign policies of those three Presidents, were directly tied to the success of their policies here in the United States. The 14 points of Woodrow Wilson were tied to the new freedom of Woodrow Wilson. The good neighbor policy was tied to the New Deal. And the Marshall plan, NATO and the Truman doctrine and point 4 all had their domestic counterpart in the efforts which President Truman made to lift our country forward.', 'I come in the most somber time in the history of our country, when in 1960 our steel production is at 54 of capacity. Last week the Soviet Union outproduced the United States in steel capacity, with one-half of our potential. By 1975 the Soviet Union will be equal to the United States in hydrocapacity, and 10 years ago they were about a third of us. By 1980, according to Allen Dulles, of the CIA, if the present rate of economic growth continues, and theirs is from two to three times as great as ours, by 1980 the lines will cross, and unless we begin to move ahead at a faster rate, they will begin to outproduce us.', 'Today they produce about 44 p ercent of what we produce, and yet they maintain a Communist defensive, a great military power, and increasing their power in Africa, Asia and Latin America. I come as a citizen of the United States and say that what we are doing is not good enough. It is my responsibility as leader of the opposition party in 1960 to state that the decision which the American people will make in 1960 is between a political party which looking at the world around us and at our country says it is good enough, and a political party looking at the world around us and our own country which says it is not good enough. Our effort is not good enough. We are not moving ahead fast enough. We are not building our strength in relation to that of the Communists with sufficient vigor. That is a decision which you as voters of the State of Kentucky will have to address yourselves to, to which party, to which political philosophy, to which viewpoint, do you believe, after making your own careful judgment?', 'This is not a view of mine. It has been expressed by commission after commission appointed in the last 8 years, by distinguished Republican after distinguished Republican, by general after general, who has warned that the relative power of the United States and of the free world is not rising as fast as it must, if we are to maintain ourselves and the cause of freedom around the globe.', 'I take no pleasure in this message. Whether I win or lose, however, this message is going to be given, that what we are doing now is not good enough, that this is a strong country which must be stronger. It is a powerful country which must be more powerful, and it is on your judgment and your sense of responsibility, and your willingness to face the future which is looming in front of us, in a crowded and turbulent world, it is on the good judgment of the people of Kentucky that I rest my case. I believe as in other days and other years, in other great crises, that the Democratic Party, old as it is, stretching back in history as it does, I believe it is the most vigorous, the most modern, the most up to date, the most vital, the most in touch with the changing world around us. So I come here today and ask your support. I ask your support not only for our candidates, but I ask your support and your enlistment in the great cause of building the strength of the great Republic. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
241,John F. Kennedy ,"October 08, 1960","['SENATOR KENNEDY. Governor Combs, Congressman Stubblefield, Congressman Chelf, Lt. Gov. Wilson Wyatt, Governor Weatherby, your next U.S. Senator, Keen Johnson, fellow Democrats: It is an honor to come to Paducah, and it is an honor to come to the land of Mr. Barkley. What is impressive about Senator Barkley\'s career is that he came to the Congress of the United States in the administration of Woodrow Wilson. He bore the burdens in the heat of the day in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. He served Harry Truman as Vice President, and I had the honor of serving with him in his last days in the U.S. Senate in 1955 and 1956. His career covered the administration of three great Democratic Presidents of this century, and I must say that Alben Barkley, when he came before the Democratic Convention in 1948, and they played that song ""My Old Kentucky Home,"" and he lifted a defeated convention to the heights, he spoke for the Democratic Party like I do today. [Applause.]', ""Alben Barkley nor Harry Truman, nor Franklin Roosevelt, nor Woodrow Wilson, ever said party labels don't matter. We know that party labels do matter. [Applause.] A party label tells you something about the candidate that that party presents. The Republican Party never would have nominated me and they never would have nominated Senator Barkley and they never would have nominated Franklin Roosevelt, and they never would have nominated Woodrow Wilson, and they certainly would not have nominated Harry Truman. Their candidates were different then as they are now. They went to the McKinleys and the Landons and the Coolidges and the Hoovers and the Deweys and the Nixons. [Laughter.]"", 'They stood in the past still and they stand today still, and I cannot believe that Paducah, living as it does in the tradition of Democracy, living as it does on a great natural resource, living as it does in an area which has been developed by the partnership of the people of this area and by an effective National Government, can possibly give their endorsement to a Republican leadership which has opposed the development of these natural resources, which looks to the past, which even in the most dangerous days of our time, the most dangerous days of our national history, still says ""You have never had it so good."" Mr. Khrushchev runs on that slogan. We can do better. We run on the slogan that this is a great people and a great country, but we run on the slogan and the view that it is the Republicans who downgrade this country. It is the Republicans who are unwilling to set before us our national agenda. It is the Republicans who do not have confidence that this country can fulfill a far greater role in our own national life and in the world than it does today. I think this is an important election, and I think the decision is very clear, and I think the issues are very sharp.', 'Mr. Nixon and I could not disagree more. This is not a contest where there are two candidates in general agreement. We disagree on the goals for the United States and we disagree on the means of achieving those goals, as we have disagreed in the great crises of our country stretching back to the days of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon said in Louisville the other day that Lyndon Johnson and I were not of the tradition of Jefferson and Jackson. Thomas Jefferson when he made the Louisiana Purchase almost was impeached by the Republicans of those days, the Federalist Party. Senator John Quincy Adams from my State of Massachusetts, who was a Federalist, who supported Thomas Jefferson, was forced to resign from the Senate, so bitter was the feeling against Jefferson. Andrew Jackson, when he seized and broke the power of the second Bank of America was the only President of the United States to ever be censured by the U.S. Senate, by the Whigs of that day, the forefathers of the Republican Party. Woodrow Wilson's aim to bring us into the League of Nations, which might have averted World War II was blocked by a Republican dominated Senate. We are not of the tradition, they say, of Wilson and Jefferson and Jackson."", 'Well, Mr. Nixon is of the tradition of McKinley, Coolidge and Harding. [Applause.]', ""We stand where our other great leaders of the Democratic Party have stood in their day, looking forward. We do not expect that we can win this election by easy phrases, and by presenting vague national goals. I don't run for the Presidency saying that if I am elected life will be easy. But I run for the office of the Presidency with the greatest faith in this country, with a realization, whether Mr. Nixon says so or not, whether our national leadership now recognizes it or not, that the United States is moving in the sixties through the most difficult and hazardous period of our country's history, more hazardous, indeed, than any that the cause of freedom has ever faced. And I do not believe that the tide is going in our direction. I do not believe that our prestige and strength is increasing. I am not satisfied to have Mr. Castro not only raise the banner of revolt in Cuba against us, but all over Latin America. I am not satisfied to have Ghana and Africa, an independent country - Mr. Nixon visited it in 1957 gaining experience. Now, a week ago, Mr. Herter said it has moved into the Communist orbit in foreign policy. Laos, where we poured out the money, is now moving sharply in the direction of the Communists. Anyone who says that the power of the United States is increasing fast enough, that we are doing everything we should be doing, that we are developing our resources and our strength and our military potential and our economic growth as fast as we should do so, I believe does not serve his country. I think we serve this country, and our party serves the country, when we tell the truth, when we present the facts, honest and clearly, and give the American people an opportunity to make their judgment. The decision is yours, not ours. [Applause.]"", ""You must decide what kind of a country you want. Your judgment is just as good as anyone else's in the world around us. There are no secrets today. Everyone can make their assessment of our national peril, of our national strength, whether the tide comes in for us or whether the tide goes out. But I don't want anyone to say after this election, win or lose, that the Democratic Party did not meet its commitment, and I believe its commitment is to present the people of this country with a sober assessment of our national opportunity and our national peril."", 'This is, as Dickens said a century ago, the best of times and the worst of times. It is the best of times because science and technology and energy can change the life of every person in the world for the better in the next 10 or 20 years. We will get fresh water from salt water. We will double and triple our production. We will harness our rivers, the atom will bring a better life all around the globe.', 'And it is the worst of times, because we and the Communists are locked in deadly embrace all around the globe. The best of times, the worst of times, it is our function and our responsibility to make the best of the best times, and to meet the worst times with courage and fortitude and perseverance. Every generation of Americans has had to meet the same responsibility, in 1900, in 1917, in 1941, and again and again Americans have been willing to participate in the maintenance of freedom here and around the world. I come here today and ask your support in this campaign. I ask your help, not merely for our party, but for our country. [Applause.]', 'Here in this community which depends upon the harnessing of the rivers, which depends upon the breaking of the atom, which depends upon the maintenance of an effective agricultural program, I believe that you here in Kentucky, in the dark and bloody ground of history, you in Kentucky join me in looking forward out of this wellspring of American vitality and scenes of history, I believe that you say now in 1960 that it is time that the United States started moving again; it is time that we had in Washington once again an administration which will set before us the unfinished business, the agenda of our day, and which will start this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
242,John F. Kennedy ,"October 08, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Keen Johnson, the next U.S. Senator from the State of Kentucky [applause], Congressman Watts, present and future Congressman from this district [applause], Governor Chandler, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the chance to visit this community, and again this State of Kentucky. About 3 years ago I was appointed chairman of a committee of the Senate which was given the responsibility of picking the five most outstanding Senators that ever served in the U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan committe composed of three Democrats and two Republicans. After nearly a year - that is a proper proportion [laughter] - and after a year, and after consulting historians all over the country, our first and unanimous choice was a gradute of Transylvania College, a distinguished citizen of this community, of course, Abraham Lincoln's beau ideal, Henry Clay. [Applause.]"", ""The contribution which I felt and which we all felt, and which gives Henry Clay a place in the Senate reception room, and his portrait, was because though he was a loyal son of Kentucky, his whole life was devoted to the preservation of the Union, to the expansion of the power and prestige of the United States, for his concern with our relations to the south of us, his concern with the development of our natural resources, his concern with maintaining American unity, and it is a source of satisfaction to me that 110 years ago, when Henry Clay, then aging, after having been in the Congress for nearly 40 years, at the twilight of his career, presented this third compromise to hold together the American Union, it was an aging Senator from my State, then in the twilight of his career, after 40 years in the Congress, a competitor on three separate occasions for the Presidency of the United States with Henry Clay, who came and sustained Henry Clay on March 7, 1850, with the greatest speech in the history of the U.S. Senate. I refer to the Compromise of 1850. And Senator Daniel Webster's support of it ruined his political position in Massachusetts."", 'Clay and Webster, from different sections of the United States, had a common desire to see the power and prestige of the United States built up, and they spoke what they thought.', 'I come in 1960 as the nominee of the Democratic Party for the election of the United States, and I know no Democrat in this century or any other who ever said that party labels don\'t mean something. They believe that party labels [applause] do mean something. Party labels do not tell us anything if the parties don\'t stand for something. But in my judgment, in this century, party labels have stood for something. They have stood for the American program of the 20th century. They have stood for the development of American resources in this century. They have stood for developing the land and the cities and the towns of this country. They have, like Henry Clay, more than a century ago, looked south to the American Hemisphere, and they have looked around the world. I stand in succession to three great Democratic Presidents, and I believe in this century you can tell the difference between our two parties in the slogans that they have used in their campaigns. No Democratic President ever ran on a program of ""Stand pat with McKinley"" or ""Return to normalcy with Harding"" or ""Keep cool with Coolidge"" or ""Repeal social security with Alf Landon"" or in 1948 - I dont know what Dewey ran on and neither did he. [Applause.] And no Democratic President in 1960 in this dangerous time in the life of our country, when all around us is stretching out the possibilities of upheaval and revolt, and subterranean changes - no Democratic President would ever run on the slogan ""You never had it so good.""', 'We ran on the New Freedom. We ran on the New Deal. We ran on the Fair Deal and this year we run on the New Frontiers. [Applause.]', ""In the 1930's Stanley Baldwin, speaking at a comparable time in the life of England, said that English frontiers were on the Rhine. Now in 1960, American frontiers are on the Rhine and the Mekong and Tigres and the Euphrates and the Amazon. There is no place in the world that is not of concern to all of us. And any candidate and any voter must think of every action which affects this State and district, and the United States, must think of that in relationship to the world around us."", 'The struggle that we are engaged in is as serious as any that freedom has ever been engaged in for the last 2,000 years. We are responsible not only to ourselves; we are responsible not only to the State and country; we are responsible for the maintenance of freedom all around the globe. My chief argument with this administration, my chief disagreement, is that in a changing time they have not changed; in a time that required foresight and innovation, they have relied on old policies, some of which have been long outdated. In a time which has seen in the last decade the emergence of Africa from 300 years to a modern continent, with one-quarter of all the votes in the General Assembly. This country has been totally indifferent to this revolutionary change. Only 2 percent of the Department of State personnel have been stationed in Africa. Only 200 scholarships were offered last year to all of Africa. And yet when the crisis came to the Congo, we suddenly offered 300.', 'No Voice of America program was beamed to Latin America during the last 8 years in Spanish, not one, except for the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis. We have rewarded those who have sustained us with indifference. We have not recognized that this is an entirely different world in which we live than 10 or 15 years ago. When Stalin died, John Foster Dulles said, ""The age of Stalin is over, and the age of Eisenhower begins."" I am not wholly convinced that that will be the verdict of history over the last 7 or 8 years. I believe that this has been an entirely new period. Just as when you stand by the ocean you cannot see the tide come in or go out, but if you leave it for a few hours, you can see which way it is moving, so historians for the perspective of 1970 and 1980 may draw a different conclusion about the last 8 years. How much imprint have we left on our times? If you read the debates of the United Nations, if you read the position that the new nations of the world are taking in those discussions, you realize that the relative power and influence of the United States is not increasing, as Mr. Nixon suggests; all is not well in the world. We move with danger every day, and I believe the choice for the American people is between a party which believes that all is well and a party which rings the alarm bell. In my judgment it is our function as members of the minority party in these hazardous days to ring the alarm bell. I believe this is a time of danger. I do not believe we can drift as usual. I don\'t believe we can waste our natural resources. I do not believe we can continue agricultural policies which drive down farm income. I do not believe we can use our steel production, the great source of natural wealth, 50 percent of capacity. I am not pleased to see the Soviet Union equal us by 1975 in hydroelectric capacity. I am not pleased to see countries around the world, when asked who will be first, say the Soviet Union in outer space, in science, in military power, in the next 10 years. I am not satisfied to have the balance of power begin to shift against us. That is the alternative that the people of this community must face. That is the prospect and that is the decision. Do you wish to continue that leadership which has not only brought us to our present peril but which also does not recognize the peril? Mr. Nixon accuses me of downgrading the United States. I make no criticism as serious and severe as Governor Rockefeller made last June, or as General Ridgway has made [applause] before he began to graze contentedly in Richard Nixon\'s pasture. His indictments were far greater than mine, and the indictments of fact are more serious than any statement I could make. This is not a partisan issue. All Americans share a common devotion to their ry. What I downgrade is our leadership and its prospects for the future. [Applause.] I come here to this community where the land has been good to the people and where I hope a new administration will be fair to the land, where the tobacco program [applause] which has served us well and which has been carried on by a Democratic Congress I hope can be carried into other agricultural commodities, so that supply and demand will protect the interests of the farmer. I hope the natural resources of this State, which has been blessed by resources, will be harnessed for the purposes of the State and the country.', 'I ask for a national revival of our spirit. There is not a student here - and it is nice to talk to 18- and 19-year-old students who have the right to vote [applause] there is not a student here who will not live in the most hazardous time in the life of our country. And I hope that they will assume the burdens which go with the great responsibilities of maintaining freedom. We do not want it said of them what Queen Victoria said of Lord John Russell. He was interested in nothing but the Revolution of 1688 and himself.', 'We want students and graduates to recognize that this college of the University of Kentucky, and Transylvania and all the rest, have not been built up, have not been developed, merely to advance the private economic interest of its graduates. They have a greater purpose in mind. No college graduate can go out from any college today without being a man of his Nation and a man of his time, without pursuing in his own life, not only his private interest, but the welfare of his country. In this dangerous and hazardous time, I believe the Democratic Party, stretching its roots deeper than any political party in the world today, going all the way to the wellsprings of Thomas Jefferson and Madison, I believe that once again this old party, still the youngest from the point of view of vitality and energy, once more will be called upon to serve the great Republic, and in serving the great Republic will serve the cause of liberty. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
243,John F. Kennedy ,"October 08, 1960","['It is a long way from the troubled streets of the Congo to this peaceful lawn in Kentucky. But it was a great son of Kentucky - Henry Clay - who first taught us that, however great the distance, our future was bound up in the future of the world around us.', 'More than any man of his time, Henry Clay understood the vast potential of the American continent. It was his efforts in the Congress which finally opened up the West to settlement.', 'But Henry Clay also knew, what few men of his time could understand - that it was not enough to build our own strength alone - to conquer just our own frontiers. For our security and the security of freedom depended on the strength and friendship of other nations. Thus, as Secretary of State, he sought to draw all the nations of the Americas closer together - triumphing in this effort when he was finally able to send the first American delegate to the first Pan-American Conference.', ""Today, one of Henry Clay's dreams has been achieved - the western frontier has long been conquered - the land cleared and the dangers overcome. But Henry Clay's other vision - the vision of an America bound in strong and enduring friendship with all the nations of the world - that vision was never in greater danger than it is today in the vast and restless continent of Africa."", 'When the crisis in the Congo recently erupted across the front pages of our newspapers it dramatized not only the dangers we face in Africa - but it also dramatized the failures of American policy which created those dangers.', 'It was only the intervention of the United Nations which prevented the immediate establishment of a Soviet satellite in the heart of Africa. Yet assembled here on this lawn is enough talent and skill, knowledge and education to have saved the Congo from chaos and confusion - permitting an orderly transition to independence - and halting the threat of Communist subversion without intervention.', 'But the Congo did not have the skills of the people assembled here. Instead the Belgians left behind them a country of 8 million people with less than a dozen college graduates - a country with only a single 21-year-old Government officer with a degree from a European university - a country which had never been given the education needed to run a nation. The result was inevitable - and it happened - we are still paying the high price on our failure to educate the people of the Congo.', 'To understand these failures - we must understand modern Africa.', 'In 1776, the year of the first successful revolt against colonial rule, Tom Paine wrote that ""A flame has arisen not to be extinguished."" Today that same flame of freedom burns brightly across the once ""Dark Continent,"" creating new nations and driving old powers from the scene - kindling in men the desire to shape their own destinies as freemen.', 'Each of these newly emerging nations has, in varying degrees, the same problems, the same needs, and the same dangers as now beset the Congo. And in each of them wait the same tireless and implacable agents of communism watching for the opportunity to transform poverty or hunger or ignorance into revolt and Communist rule.', 'The new African nations are determined to emerge from their poverty and hunger. They are determined to build a modern and growing economy with a constantly rising standard of living. They are determined to educate their people - maintain their independence - and receive the respect of all the world.', 'The only real question is whether Africa will look West or East - to Moscow or Washington - for help and guidance in this effort.', 'This choice may well determine the course of the cold war - whether the world shifts toward communism or toward democracy - toward freedom or toward slavery in the years to come.', 'I believe that Africa will look to the West - that it will choose freedom.', 'For it was the American Revolution - not the Russian - which began man\'s struggle for national independence, individual liberty and freedom from colonial rule. When the African National Congress in Northern Rhodesia called for reform and justice - it threatened a ""Boston Tea Party"" - not a Bolshevik bomb plot. African leader Tom Mboya invokes the ""American dream"" - not the Communist manifesto.', 'And in the most remote bushlands of central Africa there are children named Thomas Jefferson and George Washington - but there are none named Lenin or Stalin or Trotsky. And those ties of history and spirit are strengthened by our common goals. What we want in Africa is what the nations of Africa want for themselves. We want an Africa where the standard of living is constantly increasing - where the economy is moving forward - where malnutrition and ignorance are disappearing.', 'And this is what Africa wants.', 'We want an Africa where there is a community of stable and independent and protected countries and where men are given the opportunity to choose their own national course, free from the dictates or coercion of any other country.', 'And this is what Africa wants.', 'We want an Africa which is not a pawn in the cold war or a battleground between East and West.', 'And this, too, is what the people of Africa want.', 'Yet - despite these powerful bonds - America is losing ground in Africa: The newly independent country of Guinea has moved steadily toward the Communist bloc - importing Soviet technicians, borrowing Soviet money, and signing trade agreements with Eastern Europe.', ""The newly independent country of Ghana has moved away from the West - and recently the President of the nation sent troops to the Congo by Soviet jet. In the strife-torn, newly independent country of the Congo one of the most powerful factions - that of Premier Lumumba - is pro-Russian and anti-American. And throughout Africa there is growing uneasiness about America's role and American motives."", 'We have lost ground in Africa because - in the past 8 years - we have neglected and ignored the needs and aspirations of the African people. We failed to foresee the growing importance of Africa. We failed to ally ourselves with the cause of independence and freedom.', 'We failed to help the Africans develop the stable economy and the educated population on which their growth, stability and freedom depend. These were failures of vision, of leadership and of will.', ""Although by 1952 it was obvious that new African nations would soon be a growing force on the world scene - our State Department did not establish a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957 - and, that same year, we sent more Foreign Service officers to Western Germany than to all of Africa. Even today less than 5 percent of all our Foreign Service officers are in Africa - and there are five newly independent nations that have no State Department representation at all. One reason that communism succeeded in Guinea is that we didn't bother to send an Ambassador there until 8 months after independence. However, the Soviet representative arrived on Independence Day."", 'Although the emerging nations of Africa desperately need the development capital which is essential to the creation of a growing economy - through the end of 1957 we had granted Africa less than two-tenths of 1 percent of our total foreign assistance. And as late as 1959, Africa was receiving only 5 percent of all our foreign aid - and only 2 percent of all the money spent by the Development Loan Fund - a fund which was specifically created to help the underdeveloped countries.', 'Although there are only a handful of college graduates in many African countries - and less than 1 percent of all Africans entering the primary grades ever finish high school - we are doing almost nothing to help educate the African people. Today our Government is aiding less than 200 African students in this country - and yet this is the largest number we have ever helped. Nor are we supplying the books and the technicians which could help the Africans train themselves - less than 5 percent of our technical help is allotted to Africa south of the Sahara.', 'This Republican record of neglect and indifference - of drift and failure and retreat - has resulted in a steady decline in American prestige in Africa - and a steady growth of Soviet influence.', 'If we are to create an atmosphere in Africa in which freedom can flourish - where long - enduring people can hope for a better life for themselves and their children - where men are winning the fight against ignorance and hunger and disease - then we must embark on a bold and imaginative new program for the development of Africa.', ""First, we must ally ourselves with the rising tide of nationalism in Africa. The desire to be independent of foreign rule - the desire for self-determination - is the most powerful force of the modern world. It has destroyed old empires - created scores of new nations - and redrawn the maps of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. It is vital that we unequivocally place ourselves on the side of man's right to govern himself, because those are our historic principles - because the ultimate triumph of nationalism is inevitable - and also because nationalism is the one force with the strength and endurance to threaten the integrity of the Communist empire itself."", 'Second, we must make the United Nations the central instrument of our energies and policies in Africa. With limited resources and personnel, the United Nations has accomplished wonders in Africa - not only in the Congo, but in Togoland, and the Cameroons and Ruanda-Urundi and Tanganyika. The U.N. has eased the transition to judependence for many African nations - and has won the support and confidence of most of the African people. By centering many of our activities in the U.N. we demonstrate that our principal desire is to build a strong and free Africa - rather than to use the African nations as pawns in the cold war.', 'We will cooperate fully in U.N. economic aid and technical assistance programs. We will send first-rate men to staff our own U.N. mission - and encourage talented Americans to work for the Secretariat.', ""But it will take time to establish effective United Nations programs over the delays, harassment, and opposition of the Soviet Union. And Africa's needs will not wait."", 'Third, to meet the need for education, we must greatly increase the number of African students - future African leaders - brought to this country for university training. And we must establish a multination African educational development fund. This fund - in which the African states would be full partners - will map the long-range educational needs of Africa, helping to build the school systems and universities which will ultimately permit Africans to educate their own people.', 'And while Africa builds its own educational system we will send a stream of experts and educators - engineers and technicians - to train Africa in the tools of modern production and modern agriculture and in the skills and knowledge essential to the conduct of government.', 'Fourth, we must help provide the development capital which can transform the resources of Africa - the least productive area of the world - into a higher standard of living for the African people. We should establish a multilateral development loan fund - a fund directed by Western and African nations - a fund whose expense would be borne by all the Western allies - a fund which would make the long-term capital loans necessary to develop the roads, the power the water, the hospitals, and all the other public needs which are vital to an industrial economy.', ""Fifth, we must stimulate private investment in Africa. For the capital needs of Africa are far too great ever to be met by government alone. Therefore we must expand our consular services - and use the resources of the Development Loan Fund to educate private industry to Africa's enormous economic potential."", 'With this program we can begin to reverse the disastrous errors and neglect of the past 8 years - we can begin to rebuild the strength of the cause of freedom in Africa - and we can begin to restore our historic ties with the people in Africa.', 'In a recent American film, ""The Defiant Ones,"" two men, a white man and a Negro chained together, fall into a deep pit. The only way out is for one to stand on the shoulders of the other. But since they were chained - after the first had climbed over the top of the pit, he had to pull the other out after him - if either one was to be free.', ""Today, Africa and America, black men and white men, new nations and old, are bound together. Our challenges rush to meet us. If we are to achieve our goals - if we are to fulfill man's eternal quest for peace and freedom - we must do it together - and together we can and will succeed.""]"

But it was never like this. I know you are going to return him to Congress with a wide majority as he deserves.

[Applause.]', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I want to make it very clear that I come to Ohio on this occasion as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party, and I say very clearly that there are sharp differences between the Republican spokesman and myself. In his own way the differences are sharp and important and as significant as they were between Roosevelt and Hoover. [Applause.] And Roosevelt and Landon, and Truman and Dewey. Where did they get those candidates? The Republican Party for 25 years has put up candidates, and, as a party, has taken the position against every piece of progressive legislation that serves the people, from minimum wage to unemployment compensation, to better housing, to aid for education, to more equal rights for all Americans, for a stronger defense for a stronger and more vital society. The Republican Party, ever since it drove Theodore Roosevelt into the wilderness 50 years ago, has stood still. We have dragged them ahead, and Mr. Nixon goes through the country making speeches which a Democrat might have run on 15 years ago. They are always behind. They are always waiting for us to take the leadership. [Applause.] What is the issue in this campaign? What is it that Mr. Nixon and I differ on? It is this: He believes that the United States is doing everything it should do to maintain its position in the world. He believes that our prestige is steadily rising around the world, and 3 weeks ago, after a vote in the United Nations which was 70 to nothing, he said that is pretty good score in a ball game and a pretty good score at the United Nations. Well, if he wants to make it on that basis, I will give him the score yesterday.', 'Yesterday at the United Nations the issue came up which most directly affected the power and prestige and influence of the United States. It was on the question of the matter of whether the admission of Red China would be brought to the docket of the United Nations. And here is the vote, and if this does not tell the story, if this does not demonstrate that our prestige is not increasing, if this does not demonstrate that the United States is not growing in power, I would like to know what does.', 'Here they are: On the question of whether this matter would be brought to a vote and, therefore, whether Red China would be admitted to the United Nations, in the case of Africa, a key area in the world only two countries voted with us, Liberia and the Union of South Africa. Eight voted against us, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Sudan. All countries that had gained their independence in this past decade. Every one of them voted against us. Liberia has been associated with us for 140 years. The Union of South Africa domestic policy and its treatment of Negroes has made it opposed by every African nation, and yet Liberia and the Union of South Africa were the only two nations in all of Africa who voted with us. And eight voted against us. Not 1 of the 15 new nations admitted to the United Nations in the last 2 months voted with us.', 'Nine countries of Asia supported the United States. Ten countries of Asia voted against us, and three Asian countries abstained. Voting against the United States were such longtime friends as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.', 'I just want to make it clear that any American who reads that record, who sees our steel mills going at 44 percent of capacity, who sees our farm income driven down 20 percent, who sees our power and prestige and vigor standing still around the world and at home, any American who can make a judgment, their own judgment - you don\'t have to be in the Pentagon. You can stay in Warren, Ohio, and read the papers, and look at television, and you know which way the tide is going. You know whether this administration is meeting its responsibilities. You know whether we are doing everything that must be done if we are going to survive. You know what is happening in Latin America. You know that a candidate for President of Brazil had to make a trip and visit Castro during his election so that he would get the Castro vote in Brazil. You know that 8 years ago in 1952, seven countries, only seven countries in the world voted for the admission of Red China. Yesterday 34. Mr. Nixon says the tide is riding in our favor. If you think this administration has given attention to the problems of the United Nations in opposition - Khrushchev has stayed here for nearly a month. The President of the United States visited it for 2 days. I believe this country can do better and I don\'t want anyone on November 8, when you finally come to vote, to go into the polls and say ""They both stand for the same things."" I don\'t. I don\'t stand where Mr. Nixon stands. I don\'t take his view about [applause] - I don\'t say that $1.25 minimum wage is extreme. I don\'t lead a party that voted nearly unanimously against 25 cents minimum wage. I don\'t go around saying 4.5 million Americans unemployed is insignificant, is necessary. I am not part of an administration which vetoed the depressed area bill twice, and then makes promises about it at election time. I am not part of an administration which killed a housing bill, vetoed it twice last year. I am not part of an administration which vetoed a bill to clean our rivers from pollution. I am part of a party which in this century stood with Woodrow Wilson and stood with Franklin Roosevelt and stood with Harry Truman for a better life for all of us. [Applause.]', ""I don't want African leaders or Latin American leaders or Asian leaders - because that is where this straggle is going to be fought out - which system carries with it the most vigor? Which system do they want to duplicate? Do they want to follow the hammer and sickle, or do they want to follow us on the road to freedom? My judgment is that they want to be free, that they want to follow us. But if the trumpet blows uncertain sounds, who will prepare for the battle, as the Bible tells us, and we have been blowing a mighty uncertain sound in recent months and years. We have been living off our fat. I call upon you for help. I call upon you regardless of party. I call upon all those who are not contented, who are not satisfied, who want to move again. I call upon all those who have devotion to their country, who want to see it fulfill its destiny, who want to see us go ahead. I call upon all those who, regardless of age, are young in spirit. I call upon all those who want to cross in the sixties the new frontiers."", 'I call upon you. I ask your help in this election, and I can assure you that if we win on November 8, that this country will stand once again for the great symbol of freedom for all people, for a better life for all people here in this country, for justice for all Americans, regardless of their race or their creed or their color, or their religion, and I can assure you, I can assure you that the United States [applause] - that in Africa, Latin America and Asia once again they will be reading not merely what Mr. Khrushchev is doing, or Castro, but what the President of the United States and the United States are doing.', 'Away back nearly 100 years ago, in the campaign of 1860, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God, and that He hates injustice.

I want Mr. Nixon to come to this square and tell the people of Youngstown---', '[Response from the audience.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. I want him to tell the people of this valley, ""You never had it so good.""

Yes, we must do better. Yes, we must move forward.""

Well, I read in this morning's paper and last week's paper and 2 weeks, 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months ago, the steel capacity of this community is 44 percent of capacity."", '[Response from the audience.]', 'Senator KENNEDY.

In 1864, Abraham Lincoln, when awaiting the returns in the election of 1864, finally heard that Ohio had voted for him, and he sent out a word, ""Thank God, Ohio has saved the Union."" I hope on November 8, 1960, we can send out the same wire. I hope Ohio will go Democratic. [Applause.]', 'The people of Ohio need no speeches. I believe the issues are crystal clear, and they are very sharp and very different. They all go to the picture which the two candidates and the two parties see in America. Mr. Nixon sees a strong America, increasing in vitality and energy, spreading its influence throughout the world, the tide of freedom rising, all men turning to the United States for encouragement and assistance and example.', 'I see a strong and great country, but I see a country that must he stronger, I see a powerful country that must be more powerful, I see a people full of vitality and energy, but I see a leadership that has been standing still.

Here in this community which should be the pulsebeat of the United States, which is the American Ruhr Valley, which is the source of energy for the United States along the Ohio Valley - when you go 44 percent of capacity in October, at the very time when the automobile industry is tooling up and making its most cars for the year, if you are 44 percent of capacity now, what will it be in December, January, February, and March, if this administration continues its policies that have led us to this position, not only here in Youngstown, but all over the United States; not only in the United States, but all over the world?"", 'About 3 weeks ago, after a vote in the United Nations, and, indeed, on last Friday, Mr. Nixon said, ""Look what has been happening in the United Nations if you want to see how our prestige has grown."" I looked at that vote yesterday on the admission of Red China. In 1952, there were seven votes for the admission of Red China into the United Nations. Yesterday there were 34. How many African nations voted with us yesterday? How many of the new nations voted with the United States or voted with the Chinese Communists? How many abstained? How long will they abstain?', ""Mr. Khrushchev does not stay in New York because he enjoys New York. He stays there because he is carrying out his consistent campaign to destroy us. I do not believe that the American people in 1960, faced with the most serious challenge in our long history, are going to choose to buy the line that we are doing everythmg that must be done, that everything is moving forward as it should move, that we are moving in national and international strength as never before. I don't agree with it, and I want it clearly understood that I do not agree with this administration's leadership; that I downgrade not the United States, but the Republican leadership; that I do not consider the philosophy which Mr. Nixon is expressing in this campaign to represent the real needs of the United States, and I do not believe the Republican Party will serve the people and the cause of freedom as it must be served if we are not only to endure but to prevail. Our disagreements are deep."", 'I come from a party which believes in $1.25 minimum wage. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon leads a party which in 1935 voted 99 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage. And Mr. Nixon last week said $1.25 minimum wage is inflationary. I would like to see any American get along who lives in political life, from the President, Vice President, to the two candidates, on $1.25 an hour.', '(Response from the audience.)', 'Mr. Nixon considers medical care for the aged tied to social security to be, and I quote him accurately, ""too extreme.""

There are 17 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of $78 a month. There are 9 million of them that have less than $1,000 a year. What kind of housing do they live in with less than $1,000 a year? What kind of food do they eat? Beans. What kind of clothes do they have? And when they get sick, when their wife has a heart attack and needs daily nursing care, where do they go? They come here for public assistance, and under the bill which the President signed, they must take a pauper\'s oath. They must say that they are medically indigent before they can get help. What do we propose? We propose putting it under social security, which has served our people for 25 years. It will cost each working man and woman under social security less than 3 cents a day. And when they are 65, if they are men, and 62 if they are women, and they become ill, they will receive back what they put in. They will pay their own way. They will live in dignity. They will be protected, and that is what we stand for. [Applause.]', 'These are the issues: What kind of a country are we going to build? How are we going to stimulate the economy of this country? What monetary and fiscal policies will we follow, which will provide full employment for our people? How will we protect their unemployment compensation if they are out of work? How will we be sure that they are adequately cared for when they are searching for work? How will we take care of our children and make sure that they have the best educational system in the world?', ""Those of you who work for a living know that your children must be well educated if they are going to work their way in the 1960's and the 1970's. Industry is changing-steel and all the rest. And only the best educated can be sure of the good jobs. Sixty to seventy percent of Negro children never finish high school. What kind of jobs will they get? What will their housing be like? What are their chances of being unemployed if they are working as laborers? Unless they finish high school, unless they have a chance to go to college, if they have the talent to go to college, if they have the ability and motivation, how are they going to pay for their way through life; how are they going to meet their responsibilities? Thirty-five percent of all children, our brightest children, in the top half of your high school classes, do not go to college. Why? Because under our society we have not been able to work out a system where the best can be educated, and in these changing times, when science and automation and technology is changing the face of our country, is changing your work, is changing your lives, I believe we have to recognize the new problems and those new responsibilities."", 'I run in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.] But I recognize also in 1960 that we are going to face problems that they never dreamed of, and it is our responsibility, as an entirely new generation, to bring new solutions to new problems, so I come here today and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to help build America. I ask you to join in building a stronger country. I ask you to join us in caring for the sick, in educating our children, in providing full employment for those who want to work, in building America where there is no discrimination, where there is a chance for all who have talent and for all who want to work. That is the ancient Democratic position in this century, and I am proud to be associated with it.', 'The division is clear. It is between those who stand still and those who move forward, between those who look to the past, between those who want to protect a special position or special interest, and those who work for the people.

Congressman Hays, Governor Di Salle, County Chairman Gosney, Democratic Chairman Bill Coleman, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my regrets to all of you for having kept you. I want to express my thanks to all of you for having stayed. We did the best we could. We were not out walking. We were out working here in the State of Ohio, and I am delighted to be here now. [Applause.]', 'Salem, Ohio, is 1,000 miles from Salem, Mass., but they are sisters under the skin. They are part of an America, and they stand in a great American tradition, which it is our responsibility in these times and in our generation to maintain. The motto of the city of Salem in Massachusetts is a palm tree, an Indian, and the motto is ""To the farthest islands of the Indies,"" because Salem, Mass., and the young men who sailed from that port, sailed to the East Indies to make their fortunes. The East Indies. Salem, Mass., and Salem. Ohio, are all bound together in 1960. We rise or fall together. We rise or fall as freedom is maintained in this Ohio Valley, on the shores of Massachusetts, and on the farthest island of the Indies. I come tonight as the standard hearer of the Democratic Party to tell you that you in Ohio and the people of the United States have a very clear choice to make, and that is whether in their judgment the leadership of this country, its vigor and vitality, in the great problems that face us, will maintain that freedom, whether here or in the Far East. I want to make it very clear that there are sharp issues which divide Mr. Nixon and myself, which divide the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and they are in our concept of what is happening to our country. He has run on the slogan, ""We have never had it so good"" and I run on the slogan ""We must do better."" I come here to this valley, which has seen a steel crisis, which has seen one-third of the steelworkers in the United States, either unemployed or working part time, I come to an America that must maintain its strength, not only because it must defend the welfare of its people, but also because it must defend freedom. This is no time for the United States to misjudge the course of events. And I disagree wholly with the interpretation which the Vice President gives to the course of events in this country and around the world. In our Friday night debate, in talking about whether the power and prestige of the United States has risen or declined, Mr. Nixon said, ""Look at the voting in the United Nations over the past 7 years. This is the test of prestige.""', 'There is the quote. Now, look at that for just one minute. You who are here tonight, who must live in these years of our days, and who must face up to the sober responsibilities that go with being a citizen of the United States, yesterday we had a vote. The most important vote in the United Nations this year. And I am ready to rest my case in my issue with the Vice President as to what is happening to our country on that vote yesterday, the vote, as Mr. Nixon said, in the United Nations.', ""The question was on the admission of Red China, and we have fought it for many years. The United States won by the narrowest margin we ever had. In yesterday's vote, 34 countries voted against us. But that was not what was alarming. In Africa, which will constitute by 1963 one-quarter of all the nations of the General Assembly, which is the great center of a struggle today between communism and freedom, only two African nations voted with us. One was South Africa, which is disliked cordially on the continent and the other was Liberia which has had intimate American ties for 150 years. Two nations in all of Africa voted with us yesterday, and the decline has been steady year by year."", 'In 1952 85 percent of the General Assembly voted with us. In 1953, it was 81. In 1954, it was 79. In 1955, it was 77. In 1956, it was 66. In 1957, it was 63. In 1958, it was 61. In 1959, it was 60 percent. This year it was 56 percent. Two nations in all of Africa voted with us yesterday on Red China. How many nations in all of Asia voted with us? Seven. The remaining either abstained or voted against us. More nations voted against us in Africa and Asia yesterday than voted with us. If Mr. Nixon wants to use that as the test of the United States prestige, I will use it.', 'Last week, in the United Nations, there was another test, and that was on the motion of the five neutral countries to force a meeting between Khrushchev and President Eisenhower, against the wishes of President Eisenhower and in accordance with the wishes of Mr. Khrushchev, we won that vote only because a two-thirds vote was necessary. Actually we got beaten, 37 to 41. Not a single country in Africa on that vote voted with us. They either abstained or they voted against us.', 'I agree with Mr. Nixon that these votes are a test of our prestige. But I can take no satisfaction in them. I can take no satisfaction in coming to this valley and seeing pottery mills, seeing steel mills working part time, seeing rivers that are polluted, seeing an administration which has twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill, which has vetoed a hill to clean our rivers, which has vetoed twice in the last 12 months a housing bill, which considers $1.25 minimum wage an extreme, which considers medical care for the aged as extreme, and I quote Mr. Nixon accurately. I stand tonight in this city of Salem, in the State of Ohio, where Franklin Roosevelt stood and Woodrow Wilson, and I come here tonight and ask your help in this campaign. I ask your help in building the strength of our country. This is a great country, but it is our obligation as long as we bear responsibility, it is our obligation to make a greater country. And this is a powerful country, but it is our obligation to make it a more powerful one. There are no secrets in this campaign. You who live in Salem can make your own judgment as to whether you believe that the course of events in the world and the force and vigor of our country is moving us where it should move us or whether history will record that in the last years of the fifties the tide began to go against us, the tide began to ebb. That is the question which you have to decide. What kind of leadership do you want? Do you want leadership which tells you that all is well? That never before have we been so secure? Two thousand years ago, Demosthenes in orating to the Athenians, against the onrushes of Philip of Macedonia, said, ""Our peril is from people who tell us what pleases us, rather than what causes our peril."" And I do not come here tonight to say what pleases, because I believe that we have 3 weeks to present our case and to make it clear that if you join with us it is because you believe we can do better. It is because you believe we must do better. And, therefore, I come here tonight to this city, and ask your support in this election. I ask you to join us in rebuilding the spirit of this country, the sense of national destiny, so that African leaders and Latin American leaders and Asians will once more turn to the great Republic for inspiration and example. We want them to be quoting the next President of the United States. I don\'t want them only to quote Lincoln and Jefferson and Wilson and Roosevelt. I want them to look to the future with us. I want to prove Khrushchev wrong, when he says that our society is a sick, and dying, and faltering horse. I stand for the future. I believe our opponents stand for the present, and they have made it very clear that they consider necessary for our survival. I disagree, and on that basis, the issue is joined. [Applause.] I am glad to come to this district which has been ably served in the House of Representatives by Congressman Wayne Hays, who came to the House in 1948, and who served as a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, who has spoken for the interests of this district but also for the interests of the United States, and we stand on the program of the future. I come here today from a part of the United States which has close ties with this part, but I come here in the spirit of asking your help, asking you to join us, asking you to get this country moving again, asking you to look to the future. That is why we are going to win. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
249,John F. Kennedy ,"October 09, 1960","['The sharpest issue in the world today - not only for this campaign, but for the decades to come, not only for America, but for Africa and Asia and Latin America - is the question of whether this country is moving ahead fast enough compared to the Soviet Union.', 'Mr. Nixon is satisfied. He has said that our prestige has never been higher. I am not satisfied. I think we can do much better. I think we must move ahead much faster if we are to hold our lead, if we are to gather around us all the free nations of the world. For the test is not mere survival. The test is leadership for the decade of the sixties.', 'In our debate last Friday, Mr. Nixon said:', '\n  Look at the voting in the United Nations over the past 7 years. That is a test of prestige.\n', 'I have looked at the voting in the United Nations over the past 7 years. And if that is a test of prestige, then this country is in serious trouble.', ""Yesterday the United Nations General Assembly voted on the question of admitting Red China. The United States won but by the narrowest margin we have ever had. In yesterday's vote 34 countries voted against us. In 1952, only 7 countries voted against us. We have gone from 7 votes against us to 34 votes against us. And the decline has been progressive. In 1952 we had 85 percent of the vote with us. In 1953 it was 81. In 1954 it was 79. In 1955 it was 77. In 1956 it was 66. In 1957 it was 63. In 1958 it was 61. In 1959 it was 60 percent. This year it was 56 percent."", ""And of the 44 percent against us, the new nations of Africa and of Asia, the nations of the future, were especially heavy in voting against the American position. In yesterday's vote, only two African countries voted for us; 8 voted against and 14 abstained. Out of 24 nations on the newest continent 22 were against us."", 'Last week in the United Nations there was another similar test - a vote on a proposal by the neutralist nations to force a meeting between the President and Mr. Khrushchev. We won that vote but only because a two-thirds majority was required. We mustered 37 votes on our side. Forty-one countries, not including any Communist nations, voted against us. Not a single one of the new countries of Africa voted with the United States. More than a score of African countries voted against us.', 'I agree with Mr. Nixon that those votes are a test of American prestige. But I can take no satisfaction from them. I think they are hand-writing on the wall. I think they point the way to the road to disaster. I think that the direction must be reversed. I think that the shift in the balance of power must be pushed the other way. For what is at stake is not just a show of hands in the United Nations. What is at stake is the struggle between the principles of freedom and the principles of communism. What is at stake is the difference between the clear sunlight of freedom, and the dark arctic night of the Communists. What is at stake, in short, is the destiny of the world. And I say that smug and contented men must not be allowed to play fast and loose with the destines of free people.', 'I believe that the time has come for a fundamental change. We must not only face up to the Russians. We must face up to the facts - as we have done in all the glorious moments of our history from Valley Forge to the jungles of the South Pacific.']"
250,John F. Kennedy ,"October 09, 1960","['In 1952 Adlai Stevenson stood on this very spot and pointed out that after 20 years of Democratic rule, our basic industry, steel, was working at 104 percent of capacity. In 1960 I come here as the Democratic candidate for President, and I must point out that after 8 years of Republican rule, steel is at 54 percent of capacity.', 'The decline in steel has had shattering consequences for thousands of Americans, the consequences of idle men, and worried women, and hapless dependents and broken hopes. A third of all the organized workers in steel are working only part time. Over 100,000 steelworkers are unemployed. And many major communities - Buffalo, and Erie, and Pittsburgh as well as Youngstown - have been knocked flat.', 'The time has come to recognize that there is a steel crisis in America. And the crisis of our basic industry is an economic headache for the whole nation, not only in 1960, but in all likelihood for the decade to come.', 'General economic factors account for some of the trouble. There has been a continuing switch from steel to the newer metals. Modernization has made it possible to produce far more steel with little, if any, increase in the working force. Declines in auto production, which uses rolled steel, and in the domestic oil industry, which uses steel pipe, have hit some areas, areas such as Youngstown, especially hard.', 'But the Republican administration is not free from blame. It must shoulder the responsibility for the harsh impact of the steel decline on steelworkers and on steel towns. By failing to maintain full employment and maximum growth in the economy at large, by failing to encourage diversification in the steel towns, by failing to accept the depressed areas bill, the administration has sharpened, not softened, the cutting edge of the steel crisis.', 'The Democratic Party has a program to deal with this crisis, both on an immediate and long-term basis. The next Democratic administration will address itself seriously to the steel problem, and it will move to ease the impact on communities and on individuals everywhere.', 'First, we will maintain policies of full employment and maximum growth for the whole economy. By easing tight-money policies, we will give stimulus to every business activity, including those which consume steel. By expanding highway programs, housing programs and school construction programs we will increase directly the existing market for steel products. And by creating a climate of growth we will foster development of new industries to fill the void now being left by a declining steel industry.', 'Second, we will repass and put into effect the depressed area legislation twice vetoed by the Republicans. This measure channels economic recovery programs in the direction of areas that have been hardest hit by declining production, and makes available means for attraction of new industry, and for retraining workers forced from their jobs by technological change.', 'Third, we will move ahead on programs for urban renewal and slum clearance. For besides consuming steel, these programs act to make possible reconstruction of the blighted areas that disfigure so many of our industrial centers. Spacious, new downtown areas are essential as magnets for the new industries that alone can replace those steel plants that have become outmoded or marginal.', 'Fourth, we will extend and apply practical programs to ease the lot of persons caught up in the steel crisis. Those forced to rely on unemployment insurance should receive more adequate benefits for a more adequate period. Those forced to rely on surplus food packages should receive a more balanced, nourishing diet. And to meet the pressing problem confronting men past working age, and their families, we must put through an effective program of medical care for the aged under the social security system.', 'The present medical care program will not send one penny to needy persons without further action by the Congress and the State legislatures. It imposes an ugly needs test-a ""pauper\'s oath"" - for eligibility.', 'We can do better-and the next Congress will.', 'The steel crisis cannot be ignored. It cannot be concealed by glib reassurances. It is here but it can be met. It can be alleviated. Its hardships can be reduced. But it will take a party and a President and a Congress that believes in action.']"

I am glad to be in a city, the home of the University of South Carolina, which honored me in 1957, and I am glad to be the first Democratic candidate in the history of South Carolina to come to this State and ask your help. [Applause.]', ""What did the Republicans ever do for South Carolina? [Response from the audience.] Actually, I am here to pay tribute to a great South Carolinian who speaks unknown to every American, the New York Yankee's Bobby Richardson. [Laughter.] Apparently he is one Yankee who has your blessing and I am here to gain them, too."", 'Actually, baseball and politics are different. The other day with the Boston Red Sox, Ted Williams retired. They said he was too old at 42. Perhaps experience does not count. [Laughter.]', 'I want to express my regrets for being late, and more than I can say. They told me 5 days ago a storm was coming up here, so we waited. [Laughter.] But there is a storm coming up here next November 8 that is going to sweep Mr. Nixon all the way back to California. [Applause.] Actually I was not playing golf in Georgia; I was at Warm Springs. [Laughter and applause.] I was at Warm Springs visiting the home of a great Democratic President, Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.]', 'For 8 years in the U.S. Senate I have occupied a seat which was once held in the Senate, from Massachusetts, by a distinguished Senator, Senator Daniel Webster. He served in the time before 1850, when the Senate was at its height, and included within its ranks Lewis Cass, Clay, Douglas, Benton, and all the rest. But none of these were considered by Daniel Webster to match the talents and the character of the Senator from South Carolina, John C. Calhoun. [Applause.] They were both born in the same year; Calhoun was a native of Abingdon, S.C. They both went to college in New England, one to Yale and the other to Dartmouth. They had both entered Congress as young men, and they stayed in Congress for 40 years, until they died in 1850, John Calhoun, and in 1852 Senator Daniel Webster. They worked together on foreign relations, the development of the United States, fiscal improvements. Each served in the House as well as in the Senate. Each was Secretary of State. And yet through most of their lives, they also differed on great questions. But to his dying day, Senator Daniel Webster said of John C. Calhoun, ""He was much the ablest man I ever knew. He could have demolished Newton, Calvin, or Locke as a logician."" He admired above all his powerful mind and his courage.', 'Sitting as I do in the U.S. Senate, succeeding Senator Webster in succession, I have also admired John C. Calhoun. When I was selected as chairman of a commitee to pick five outstanding Senators in the history of this country, John C. Calhoun\'s name led all the rest, and his painting is now in the Senate reception room. [Applause.] And when I wrote a book about courageous Senators, I mentioned John C. Calhoun. I am not here in South Carolina to make glittering promises or glowing predictions, but to express the hope that in 1960, South Carolina and the Nation will be guided by the spirit of Calhoun and his courage. ""I never know what South Carolina thinks of a measure,"" he once said. ""I act to the best of my judgment and according to my conscience. If she approves, well and good. If she does not, and wishes anyone to take my place, I am ready to vacate. We are even.""', 'He demonstrated this in 1816 when he voted to raise the pay of Congressman from $6 a day to the munificent sum of $1,500 a year. Congressman after Congressman was defeated. And yet John C. Calhoun, speaking in the House, spoke words that I invoke today. ""This House is at liberty to decide on this question according to the dictates of its best judgment. Are we bound in all cases to do what is popular? Have the people of this country snatched the power of deliberation from this body? If we act in Opposition to conscience and reason, are political errors, once prevalent, never to be corrected?""', 'That is the spirit of the Democratic Party, that is the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Are we bound in all cases to do what is popular? In 1960, the people of the United States have a very clear choice to make between Mr. Nixon and myself. We see America in different terms, and we see the future in entirely different terms. He runs on a slogan of ""You have never had it so good."" I run on the slogan, ""This is a great country that must be greater."" [Applause.] I think we can do better. [Applause.]', 'We must say as John Calhoun said, that we must appeal to conscience and reason, and not merely to what is popular. Mr. Nixon has taken a different course, for he does not belong as I do to the party of Calhoun. He belongs to the party of Herbert Hoover, who promised a chicken for every pot. He belongs to the party that kept cool with Coolidge, that returned to normalcy with Harding, that tried to repeal social security with Landon, that ran Dewey. We never did that. [Laughter.] Mr. Nixon is true to the traditions of his party. Popularity, not logic, is his standard. He promises a vast new program of aid to education. He promises in the last 2 weeks a great and vast housing program and he promises to outdo the Democrats in agriculture, public works, foreign aid, defense, and all the rest. But then he journeys South and he talks to you and he comes out against the Federal bureaucracy, he comes out against the spending, he comes out against the Democratic Party because we support these programs.', ""I believe the American people and the people of South Carolina and the South and the North should be dealt with more frankly. I believe that the American people are wise enough to know that these promises are either election-year oratory, or they will require funds and effort by the Federal Government. I am just as opposed as Mr. Nixon to unbalanced budgets and to Federal deficits. The largest deficit in the history of this country was in 1958, $12 billion. I do not believe that Washington should be the center of all action. We do not know as much about your problems as you do. There is no magic in tax money that comes to Washington and then is spent by us. But I must say that I believe not in big government for big government's sake, but I believe in effective government, and I believe there is a responsibility for the National Government. The farmers in this State who grow cotton, they cannot protect themselves without a national policy. The textile workers of this State who are working in some cases 2, 3, or 4 days, they cannot protect themselves against the imports that may destroy them, without national action. We cannot develop the Tennessee Valley without the people working together. There is a place for action on every level, and those who say that they are against action, I believe, are against the United States moving ahead in the 1960's. [Applause.] And instead of talking out of both sides of our mouth, I think every candidate should take his stand with Lyndon Johnson of Texas, who said he talks not as a Texan, not as a southerner, not as a white man, but as an American in a united country, and I speak in that spirit today. [Applause.]"", 'The test of popularity, rather than Calhoun\'s test of conscience, has also been applied by my opponent in the sensitive area of civil rights. He makes a great show of discussing this subject when he comes south, but it is hardly the same speech he delivered in New York City last week. Up north he talks about legislation. Down here he emphasizes that laws alone are not enough. Up there he stresses how quickly he will act in all these areas. Down here he says, ""I know this is a difficult problem."" Up there he criticizes the Democratic Party for having nominated a southerner on the ticket. Down here he omits the civil rights plank in his own platform.', ""I don't think Mr. Nixon is fooling anyone, north or south. I think it is clear [applause] that if we are to have progress in this area, and we must have progress to be true to our ideals and responsibilities, then Presidential leadership is necessary so that every American can enjoy his full constitutional rights. Some of you may disagree with that view, but at least I have not changed that view in an election year, or according to where I am standing. [Applause.]"", ""I don't send Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania to campaign for me in the North and Senator Barry Goldwater to come South, and say we don't need any of this. [Applause.] All these are important issues, but I must say what is most important is that the United States recognize in the 1960's that these are difficult and dangerous times, that it is going to require the best of all of us, whether we live in Massachusetts or whether we live in South Carolina. I do not go to the American people - and it is upon your shoulders that the great decision will rest - promising that if I am elected life will be easy. I think to be a citizen of the United States in the 1960's is going to be a burdensome and hazardous occupation. But I have the greatest confidence in this country. I have the greatest confidence in our system of government. I know we can meet our responsibilities. And I do not agree with those who say that we downgrade the United States when we downgrade Republican leadership. [Applause.] I am not satisfied, in our most dangerous years, to have our steel mills working 50 percent, to have 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never get to college, to be turning out half as many doctors and nurses as we now need, to find the largest agricultural surplus, $9 billion, stored away rotting while more than 5 million Americans go to bed every night on a substandard diet of 5 cents a day of surplus foods. I am not satisfied to see the United States stand still, to see farmers' income driven down and given only for relief the same promises of Mr. Benson, applied with new lighting and new makeup. [Applause.]"", ""These are dangerous days, but it is upon us that the hope of freedom lies; it is upon the United States, it is upon our vitality and our vigor and our willingness to embrace the future. I come as the candidate of the oldest political party on earth, in direct succession from Thomas Jefferson, in direct succession and standing where Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman stood in this century, and saying that we also in our day have a rendezvous with destiny. Our generation of Americans must meet its responsibility, not only to ourselves, but to all those who wish to trod on freedom's road. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has taken over in this country, men who fought in Italy and the South Pacific in order to maintain this country's freedom, men who have the greatest confidence in our country, men who want to see it move again, men who want to set it going again. And I come to South Carolina and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in building a stronger America, an America which will serve as an example to a watching world as we sit on a most conspicuous stage. We will give leadership if we are successful, and I can promise you this country will start to move again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
252,John F. Kennedy ,"October 10, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, Mayor Barr, Senator Clark, Congressman Powell, Dr. McClelland, Dave Roberts, Members of the Congress, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Shriners, guests [laughter], I am grateful to the Governor for his introduction and for putting it right on the line. Mr. Nixon said in one of his franker moments, ""I am a conservative at home and a risktaker abroad,"" and I don\'t think the American people want either in 1960. [Applause.] I think the American people in 1960 want somebody who is liberal at home and who is careful abroad. I think they want somebody who builds the strength of this country, who carries a big stick and speaks softly around the world. [Applause.]', 'During my visit to Pittsburgh, I have seen pictures of Mr. Khrushchev with Mr. Nixon\'s finger under his nose. Friday night, after the debate, when I went over to shake hands with Mr. Nixon, and the photographers came, suddenly the finger came up in my nose. [Laughter.] I thought, here it comes; he is going to tell me how wrong I am about the plight of America, and do you know what he said? ""Senator, I hear you have been getting better crowds than I have in Cleveland."" [Applause.] That isn\'t what the American people want in 1960. I think they want someone and a party that stands for the truth, north, south, east, and west, that runs on a record, not on leap year liberalism every 4 years, like the Republican candidates always run. [Applause.] I wonder when he put his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s nose whether he was saying, which he said on that interview, ""I know you are ahead of us in rockets, Mr. Khrushchev, but we are ahead of you in color television."" [Laughter and applause.] I would just as soon look at television black and white and be ahead of them in rockets. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon was in Oregon the other day. He said we had been downgrading America. He said, ""Look at the shopping center, the biggest in the world. Have the Russians got anything like that?"" They have rockets, they are turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. Their economy, according to Mr. Dulles, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, is moving ahead at twice to three times the rate of ours.', ""I suggest to Mr. Nixon to read the record and that he bring Senator Scott home to study the truth. [Applause.] I suggest that instead of Senator Scott traveling around the United States in a truth squad which could not stand a lie detector [laughter] that he come back to Pennsylvania and look at the problems of his people that he is paid to represent. To tell Mr. Nixon, who said on Friday night there is not going to be a recession, that the Wall Street Journal, which every Republican candidate is committed by his platform to read every morning [applause] - they said several weeks ago that there is a recession, but the only question is when is it going to end. There is a recession, and those who work part time - one-third of the steelworkers of the United States who work part time or don't work at all, the 100,000 of them, I want him to tell them there is no recession. I want him to come and tell them they have never had it so good. [Applause.] I want him to tell the thousands of families in Pennsylvania who wait every month for a surplus food package from the Government, which is some rice, some flour, some dried eggs, all adding up to $6.25 for a family of four every 30 days, 5 cents per person in the State of Pennsylvania, not India, not Russia, not Latin America but here in Pennsylvania and West Virginia - nearly 5 million Americans wait every month for those packages, and finally this summer they added lard to it."", 'And when we attempted to pass a bill for food stamps, when I offered a bill to put the distribution of surplus food in the Department of HEW, and add some meat, chicken, and milk, this administration opposed it. I believe the American people in 1960 are going to move them out. I believe they are sending Mr. Nixon right back to California. [Applause.]', 'I think the American people are tired of a party which sends Barry Goldwater through the South calling for the repeal of social security, saying they don\'t mean anything of this at all on civil rights, and sending Senator Scott traveling through the North committing them to all kinds of programs. I think the American people want a party which stands on the record. I think they want a party which says, ""I believe in a party. I believe a party should stand for something,"" instead of a candidate who says, ""Party labels don\'t mean anything."" I don\'t blame the Republicans for saying that; I would say it myself [laughter and applause] because that record is written on the books in the last 25 years. Will you tell me one single piece of progressive legislation ever suggested by the Republican Party in the last 25 years?', '(Response from the audience.)', 'Mr. KENNEDY. I asked someone in Cleveland that and the next day the Cleveland paper said, ""Senator, you are so wrong. You forgot what President Taft did on child labor in 1903.""', ""Well, I was wrong. What have they done since President Taft? What have they done on social secunty and minimum wages and housing and resource development, on which they run and issue papers today? Where do they stand when those measures were proposed? Where do they stand in 1960 when we tried to move the minimum wage from $1 an hour to $1.25? Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme. When we try to provide medical care for the aged on social security, instead they pass a bill by which you have to take a pauper's oath before you are entitled to medical care."", 'What do they do on resource development? Their policy was officially called ""No new starts."" I cannot believe in the most dangerous time in the history of this country, in 1960, when if there was ever a time when we had to begin to move - I cannot believe that they would put their confidence in a bankrupt political leadership, and I believe the Republican Party\'s leadership relative to the needs of our people is bankrupt. [Applause.]', ""I cannot believe that they are going to put their confidence in a party which in 1952 came to Pittsburgh and promised liberation for Eastern Europe, and now has a Communist satellite 90 miles off the coast of Florida. I cannot believe they are putting their confidence in a political party and leader who commits us to the defense of Quemoy and Matsu even though he says in the same statement that the people don't count, even though it is admitted that it is indefensible, even though he states that the Chiefs of Staff, which is a fact, will not defend it under certain conditions, but will under others, and two rocks 6 miles off the coast of China - this is the party of peace and prosperity? By their fruits you shall know them, and I think the American people know them, and I believe they [applause] - Friday night in the debate Mr. Nixon said our prestige has never been higher. Look at the votes in the United Nations. It just so happens that the next day's vote was the best vote of all, and look at our prestige. On the question of admission of Red China into the United Nations, do you know how many African nations voted with us? Two, Liberia, which has been tied to us for a century, and the Union of South Africa, which does not represent African opinion. Two nations. Nine nations in Asia voted against us, eight for us, and the rest abstained. Not one of the new nations admitted from August on into the United Nations, and there were 15 or so, not one of them voted with us. What about our prestige? If that is the test, the United Nations. Why is it that they decided to want to move in that direction and not with us? Why is it that the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil felt it necessary to visit Castro during his campaign? Why was it necessary for both candidates in Brazil to take an anti-American position? How many Latin American politicians in the next 5 years will do likewise in order to prove that they are good Latins? How popular is it to be associated with the United States? What is our image around the world? What are we identified with? The status quo? The past? The special few in the interests in a few countries? Those on their way out? Or are we identified with the fight against poverty and hunger and the aspiration of the people? What would we stand for in this country? Do we stand for a better chance for all our people? Do we practice what we preach? And I agree what we preach is difficult to practice, but we do preach it and we must practice it."", 'The Communists do not practice what they preach and they preach a different doctrine. But we preach the best doctrine ever known, the equality of man, the Government gets consent from the governed, and that everyone is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and we will maintain that position. [Applause.]', 'I came from Warm Springs, Ga., this morning, the house where Franklin Roosevelt died, and I come to Pittsburgh, Pa., and invoke his spirit. I think it is incumbent upon us to continue a long fight, which has gone on since this country began, which was divided from the beginning.', 'We are the heirs of Jefferson. We could not conserve and look backward if we tried. We must look forward. The Democratic Party is the party of progress, and I cannot believe, in 1960, when the world is in revolution, when all is movement, that here in the United States we are going to say it is good enough what we are doing, there are no challenges left, no unfinished business. It is merely a question of administration.', 'I think it is a question of force and vision and foresight and vitality and energy, and I come here to Pittsburgh and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.]', 'Two thousand years ago, after the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans were wiped out by all the Persians, they carved above the graves a sign in the rock which said, ""Passerby: Tell Sparta we fell faithful to her service."" Now, in 1960, in another crisis of freedom, we are asked to live faithful to the service of the United States and the things for which she stands, and that is our commitment and that is the commitment of the Democratic Party. I can assure you that if we are successful on November 8 we are going to set before this country its unfinished business, the agenda for the American people in the sixties, to build our strength, to maintain our freedom, to reestablish our position as a source and inspiration and friend of freedom around the globe, as a good neighbor to all those who wish to trod on freedom\'s road.', 'I come here to Pittsburgh and commit ourselves to leading this country on November 8, if we are given the mandate, and if we lead, we are going to get America moving again. Thank you.', '[Standing ovation.]']"
253,John F. Kennedy ,"October 10, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a source of satisfaction to me as the standard bearer for the oldest political party in the world to come to a State which in good times and bad, in sunshine and adversity, has been the most loyal Democratic State in the United States. [Applause.] And it is also a source of satisfaction to me that my colleagues in the House and Senate and your distinguished Governor, your former Governors, your neighboring Governor, have been generous enough to join us today. I am grateful to all of them. [Applause.] All of us are proud to be here at Warm Springs today. No American, no Democrat, especially no Democrat who aspires to lead his party and his country, can come to this spot without a sense of gratitude and a sense of appreciation, and a sense of admiration, admiration for the man who lived here, gratitude for the spirit which he showed, which helped give us our great country as it is today, and also a source of pride in the banner which he raised for all Americans, a banner which we raise again in 1960. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt was the champion of the aged and of children and of the handicapped and of the farmer, of those who had been forgotten, of those who had not been remembered, of those who needed a helping hand, of those who needed a good neighbor. The basic force in all of this was not his party or his intellect, but it was his spirit, a spirit which he breathed into our party, a spirit which we carry on today. [Applause.] It was not the spirit of condescension; it was the spirit of compassion. It was the compassion of a man who had suffered deeply himself, and through his own suffering had identified himself with the needs of his fellow men and women in this country. It was the compassion of a man who was never poor but who held a helping hand out to his needy Americans. He expressed that sentiment best in his second acceptance speech before 100,000 people, speaking in Philadelphia, and in that speech he said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. [Applause.]\n', 'Franklin Roosevelt knew who had been omitted and ignored, and he knew who had omitted and ignored them, and he set about to help the forgotten man, to light the farms, to help the aged, to protect the worker, to open new doors to the Negroes, to care for the needs of millions of Americans in thousands of different ways. He was challenged on every front by those who said he was destroying the country, by those who said he would bankrupt it those who fought the New Deal as they fight progress in 1960. But can anyone in this country who now lives, whatever party they may be a member of, can they imagine America without the accomplishments of the New Deal, of social security, of care for the aged, of protection for bank deposits, protection for investments, of help for the farmers, development of our natural resources? Can they image an America without all these things being done, not easily but over opposition, reluctantly, but moving this country steadily forward? That was his great accomplishment and that was the spirit which he breathed into our party as Thomas Jefferson did when he founded it.', 'There were many conferences on all these programs held here at Warm Springs. President Roosevelt used to talk about the spirit of Warm Springs, the general feeling that we were all part of a family. It was here in Warm Springs that the idea of REA came to him when he found that his electric light bills were four times as much as he had paid at Hyde Park, and he realized then without the cooperation of the people of these States, and a National Government that cared, we would never light the farms of America. Today they are lit, and it was due to Warm Springs. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt did not believe there was any magic in tax money flowing from Georgia or any other State to Washington to be spent. He did not believe that Government should do things that the people or local government or local community could do better. But he believed that there were some things that must be done by the people, acting together, for the very simple reason, he said, that if the Government does not do it, nobody else can or will. And even in the field of health, which we have seen the benefits of private action in, under the leadership of the people who make this foundation possible, even in the field of health he saw the need for cooperative effort by the private sources of this country and also by the National Government. Illness is a national problem. It knows neither barriers of region or race or religion or creed, for the protections of our Government must be given to every American who needs the attention of our people, who needs the attention of vigorous national action. As I have said in every part of this country, all over the Nation, if this Nation is to be true to its ideals and obligations, we must make it possible for all to participate fully in our national life. We must assure every citizen of the full protection of his constitutional rights, and equal opportunity to participate with every other American in every phase of our national life.', ""Franklin Roosevelt's record in this area and in the field of health, and in all the others, has left a great impact. But he did not rest on what he found. He had served in the administration of Woodrow Wilson. He was a supporter of the new freedom. But he realized in 1932 that the new freedom was not enough, and now in 1960, in the most perilous time in the life of our country, in a time of maximum danger, in a time of maximum opportunity, we who invoke the name of Franklin Roosevelt know that the accomplishments of his administration are not enough, if the United States is going to not only endure, but prevail. [Applause.]"", 'I do not run for the Presidency under any expectation that life will be easy for the next President of the United States or easy for the citizens of the United States. To be a citizen of this country is to live with great responsibility and great burdens. The United States must be true to itself; if must meet its own responsiblities. It must build greater strength in this country because it alone defends freedom all around the globe. [Applause.]', 'My judgment is that unless this country begins to move again, unless we realize the full importance of the times in which we live unless we are ready to say to those who say ""You have never had it so good,"" that we can do better, unless we are willing to recognize that a great country must be greater, unless we in our day and generation recognize that we have unfinished business, then we will not be true to this country, we will not maintain our freedom, we will not meet our responsibilities, and history will record that in the 1960\'s when the world exploded and when the world moved, the United States stood still. Unless we build a strong country here, we are not going to be strong around the world. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States, because he cared for the people living here. [Applause.] Because he developed the natural resources of this country, of the Tennessee Valley. He let people all around the world know that they could do it also. Because he cared for people who worked, because he protected the rights of people who worked in our textile mills, because he protected the rights of the cotton farmer, because he moved this country forward in his tune, the United States was a source of inspiration around the world. Very few people in the world to the south of us, in Latin America and Africa and Asia, ever quoted modern American statesmen. They quote Jefferson and Lincoln or Wilson or Roosevelt. But the United States has ceased to be a source of inspiration to them, a source of energy, a source of vitality and example. I believe it our function to so build our society here, to so reinvigorate it, to so move it, that people around the globe ought to wonder how they can follow our role, what the President of the United States is doing, not merely what they are doing in the Far East, and what Mr. Khrushchev is saying or doing. [Applause.]', 'That is the issue which this country and Georgia faces, whether what we are doing now is good enough, whether any American can read his papers and determine that everything that must be done is being done, whether our strength is as great as our obligations, whether the tide of history is moving with us or whether historians will record 10 years from now, with the perspective of a decade, that in the late fifties the tide began to run out for us.', 'It is because I believe that this is the most important election, it is because there are sharp differences between us, it is because there are two different philosophies, now contending for the attention of the American people, those who stand still and those who move forward, those who say we must move in the sixties, and those who say ""The good old days,"" that is the great decision that the people of this country must face, and it is the most serious decision that they have faced since 1932. [Applause.]', ""And I could not leave here today, this great source of national strength here in Warm Springs, without reminding all of us that there is still unfinished business before us in the health field, that there are still over 18 million Americans over the age of 65 who live out their lives without assistance, without a recognition of the great problems that they face in the field of health, and I believe it incumbent upon the next Congress and the next administration to permit them to participate in the development of a trust fund which will provide protection in their old age without their having to take, as they now take, a pauper's oath before they can receive medical assistance and medical care. [Applause.]"", ""Second, we must provide for the development of doctors and nurses. We are graduating 7,500 doctors a year, 7,500 doctors, and yet our population is increasing over 3 million a year. We don't have enough doctors to maintain our present population, and we shall need half again as many by 1975. This will require at least 20 new medical schools and yet our efforts so provide those schools and those doctors for your people and your children has been held back in the last years."", 'Third, we must provide loans and scholarships to those who want to study. It costs $12,500, as well as years of work, to become a doctor. How many families can afford to send their sons and daughters through medical school today only 1 out of every 10 gets a scholarship of any kind, and the scholarship averaged less than $500 per person. Low interest loans and fellowships will make it possible for us to meet our responsibility in this area, and in some cities there is 1 doctor for every 250 people. And in some rural communities, in my State and in your State, there is 1 doctor for every 3,000 people. I think we can do better and I think we must do better. [Applause.]', 'And then finally I think we must provide the kind of stimulus to long-term research, the kind of long-term research which has meant so much to so many people who might otherwise have been stricken by polio, an example of what could be done by a private foundation. I suggest in the future in cancer, in heart disease, diseases of the nerves, psychiatric diseases, all the rest, can all be attacked in the same way that polio was, by the cooperation of private foundations, doctors working, and by a government which provides stimulus to this research which will make the lives of our people happy. [Applause.]', 'Finally, let me say that there are 2 million handicapped and disabled Americans in our country today. We are providing for about 88,000 and the rest of them live out their lives when they could live usefully, without hope, life passing them by. There are many areas of unfinished business for our society in the next years, and it all comes down to the kind of country we want, the kind of vision that we have of a strong America, the kind of society that we want to build here. I want to build a society here in the United States that provides a better life for our people, that maintains our freedom within our own country, that maintains the energies of a private enterprise system, that maintains a stronger country, moving ahead, meeting its problems, providing employment for its people, developing its resources, so that by the year 2000, when the question will then be decided whether the world will exist half slave or half free, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery or in the direction of freedom, it will say, ""We want to be free. We want to do what they have done. We want to follow in their road. We want to move with freedom. We want to move with the United States."" That is the opportunity before us. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt said in his second inaugural address ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" I believe in 1960 a new generation of Americans who fought for freedom on all fronts in World War II have now come to where they have a rendezvous with destiny, that their generation must bear its responsibilities of leadership. I want Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has assumed the leadership, a generation of Americans [applause] that is not satisfied to be second best, that wants to be first, not first, if, but, when, or sometime, but first, period. [Applause.]', 'So I come here to old Georgia and ask Georgia to join with us again in 1960, in building a better State here, in building a better country [applause] recognizing in the last words of Franklin Roosevelt that the only limitations of our realizations of tomorrow are our fears and doubts of today. I think we must move. I think we must push the United States ahead again. I think we must give this country leadership. I think America must move again. Thank you. [Applause]']"

But of all these, none was considered by Daniel Webster to match the talent of the man he often opposed in debate: John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.', 'They were both born in the same year, 1782, Calhoun a native of Abbeville County here in the South Carolina uplands. They had both been educated in New England. They had both entered Congress as young men and served almost continuously, until they died within a few years of each other - while the Union they had labored to preserve was still intact. They worked together on foreign relations, fiscal policies, internal improvements, and the development of national transportation and public lands.', 'Each had served in the House as well as the Senate. Each had served as Secretary of State. They had many disagreements. They were on the opposite sides of many issues. But to his dying day, Daniel Webster considered John C. Calhoun to be ""much the ablest man in the Senate"" - as a man who ""could have demolished Newton, Calvin, or even John Locke as a logician."" He admired his powerful mind, his disciplined speeches, and his rugged courage.', ""And sitting as I do in the seat of Daniel Webster, I have shared his admiration for this great South Carolinian. When I wrote a book on profiles in courage, I cited the courage of Calhoun in refusing to repudiate an unpopular congressional pay raise. When I chaired a committee to select the five outstanding Senators in the Nation's history, the name of John C. Calhoun led all the rest. And I am here in South Carolina today - not to make vague promises or glittering predictions - but to express the hope that, in this election and in the years to come, the people of South Carolina and the people of every State will be guided by the spirit and the courage of John C. Calhoun."", '\n  I never know what South Carolina thinks of a measure---\n', 'he once told the Senate.', '\n  I act to the best of my judgment and according to my conscience. If she approves, well and good. If she does not, and wishes anyone to take my place, I am ready to vacate. We are even.\n', 'He demonstrated this as early as 1816, when an astounding wave of protest swept out of office almost every Congressman who had dared to raise his pay from $6 a day to the generous sum of $1,500 a year. Young Congressman Calhoun refused to promise repeal and was reelected anyway. And when other Members scrambled to denounce the measure, Calhoun shamed them all with these words:', '\n  This House is at liberty to decide on this question according to the dictates of its best judgment. Are we bound in all cases to do what is popular? Have the people of this country snatched the power of deliberation from this body? [If we act] * * * in opposition to conscience and reason * * * how are political errors, once prevalent, ever to be corrected?\n', 'That is the spirit of John C. Calhoun, the spirit of our greatest Democratic leaders, from Jefferson and Jackson to Roosevelt and Truman. That is the spirit in which I ask your help today. ""Are we bound in all cases to do what is popular?"" In the 1960\'s I do not see how we can. I do not see how, with our very survival at stake, with the cause of freedom endangered around the world, with new problems pressing in upon us both at home and abroad, what we must do as a Nation cannot always be made to coincide with what we would prefer to do as individuals.', 'The truth may not always be as pleasant as fiction, the right course may not always be the easiest. But if the political errors now prevalent are ever to be corrected, we must act according to the dictates of our best judgment as John Caldwell Calhoun recommended. And we must place in the seats of leadership those who appeal to conscience and reason, not merely to what is popular.', 'My opponent, Mr. Nixon, has taken a different course. For he does not belong to the party of Calhoun. He belongs to the party of Herbert Hoover, promising a chicken in every pot, to the party of Warren Harding, promising that America would go ""back to normalcy,"" to the party of Dewey and Landon and Coolidge and McKinley.', 'Mr. Nixon is true to the tradition of his party. Popularity, not logic, is his standard. He promises a vast new Federal program for housing. He calls for a vast new Federal program for education. He pledges a vast new Federal program for health. He promises to outdo anything the Democrats can do in agriculture, public works, reclamation, foreign aid, defense, and all the rest. But then he journeys South and says that he is against Federal spending, against Federal bureaucracy, and against the Democratic Party because we are supporting these programs.', 'I believe the American people ought to be dealt with more frankly. I believe the American people are wise enough to know that either these promises are election year oratory - or they will require funds and effort by the Federal Government. I am just as opposed as Mr. Nixon to unbalanced budgets and centralized government. I do not believe that Washington should do for the people what they can do for themselves through local and private effort. There is no magic attached to tax dollars that have been to Washington and back. No expert in the Nation\'s Capital knows as much about your local problems and how to meet them as you do. Big government is just as much a threat to our liberties as too little government. But I said in Warm Springs this morning that I shared Franklin Roosevelt\'s belief that the Federal Government, representing all the people, must meet its responsibility in its area - ""for the very simple reason,"" as he told a press conference there in 1934, ""that if the Government does not do it, nobody else will or can.""', ""I believe we must move ahead in this country, to strengthen our defenses, to build our alliances, to help our farmers, to care for the aged and infirm, to wage a full-scale attack on poverty and illiteracy and disease. I want as much of this done without Federal intervention as possible. I am against big government but I am for effective government. But only the Federal Government can build atomic weapons and interstate highways. Only the Federal Government can maintain a national tobacco program, a tariff on cotton, social security for retired mill workers, and protection for all Americans of every race in the enjoyment of their full constitutional rights - and only the President of the United States can provide the national leadership we must have in the 1960's to meet these and other needs."", 'These same campaign techniques - these same vague promises that refuse to face facts - have been tried by Mr. Nixon in many areas. He wants the United States committed to the defense of every rock and island around the world, but he is unwilling to admit that this may involve American boys in an unnecessary or futile war, as he sought to have us involved in Indochina in 1954. He feeds us reassuring sirup about the state of our defenses, our economic growth and our relations with other nations without any recognition of the cost, the dangers, and the difficulties which current Republican policies have brought us.', 'But the one area above all others where his campaign promises are based on popularity rather than validity is the area of American agriculture.', 'He has dressed it up with new, appealing slogans: Operation Consume and Operation Safeguard. He talks vaguely about the ideals of the free market. But his basic proposal, that of basing price supports on a percentage of the market price during the preceding years, can only mean lower and lower income for the farmer, just as it did when Mr. Benson proposed it for corn.', 'In short, this is not a new Nixon program. It is the old Benson program with new lighting and makeup.', 'Mr. Nixon also proposes an enormous soil bank program - a program which has already cost the American taxpayer more than anything of its kind in history, without making any appreciable difference in the surplus - and without any appreciable help to either the farmer or the consumer.', 'I believe it is time that we faced up to the facts of our farm situation. We cannot go on storing $9 billion worth of food and fibers, depressing market prices, and discouraging needy peoples throughout this Nation and world. I have proposed, therefore, a wholly new approach to the farm situation - a universally enforced program of supply management which will bring supply and demand into balance, while assuring our farmers of full parity income.', 'Mr. Nixon has complained about the effect of this program on the consumer. He does not know what the effect will be just as he does not mention the effect of his program on either the consumer or the taxpayer. But even if cotton prices were increased 20 percent by my program, the price of a $4 shirt would go up no more than 6 cents, for the cotton farmer gets only 29 cents out of that $4 shirt today.', 'I believe the cotton farmers and other farmers of South Carolina and the Nation know that it is time the laws of supply and demand were put to work for the farmer instead of always working against him. There are new problems in the cost of running a farm, new competition in the world market, new inroads by synthetic fibers. And it will take a new party in power to meet these problems while giving our farmers a parity income return.', ""On all of these issues, there will be disagreement. But we in the Democratic Party have learned to disagree constructivly and with dignity, to disagree within the party, just as John Calhoun wanted South Carolina to disagree within the Union. Daniel Webster recognized Calhoun's vision and dedication when he said:"", '\n  There was nothing groveling or low, or nearly selfish that came near the head - or the heart - of Mr. Calhoun.\n', 'And Calhoun himself demonstrated his belief in bonds which were stronger than disagreement when he said of that other great member of the Senate triumvirate:', ""\n  I don't like Henry Clay. I would not speak to him. But, by God, I love him.\n"", 'I have confidence in South Carolina today - confidence in the decision you will make in November - because this is a great Democratic State - and because you joined in the formation of this Nation and will join in its preservation. I firmly believe that you will respect now, as you did five generations ago, a man who acts according to his best judgment and conscience. I believe you will have more confidence in a leader now, as you did then, who does not feel he is ""bound in all cases to do what is popular."" And should I be successful, I would ask from history nothing more than the judgment which one of our greatest historians, Allen Nevins, has placed on Calhoun of South Carolina, when he wrote:', '\n  Of all the Senators in the 19th century, he did the most to make men think clearly and carefully on fundamental political questions.\n']"
257,John F. Kennedy ,"October 10, 1960","['In the past weeks, I have talked in more than half the States of our Union about new frontiers for America. The frontier of which I speak tonight is the new urban frontier, which exists in every city in America and in its suburbs.', 'Aristotle said, ""Men come together in cities in order to live; they remain together in order to live the good life.""', ""The good life is still just a dream for too many of the people who live in cities. But our cities are doing something about it. I have just come from the Gateway Center, that magnificent symbol of the Pittsburgh renaissance, and of the administrations of two great mayors, Dave Lawrence and Joe Barr. On the lower hill of Pittsburgh, the slums are going and a great arena is rising in their stead. I have seen exciting changes in Dick Lee's city of New Haven - and in scores of other communities and I salute the mayors who are here today for their effective leadership."", 'There is no limit to what we can do - there is no limit to what could already have been done - if we had only had the same kind of leadership on urban problems down in Washington.', 'I think we can provide that leadership.', 'I propose that we act - beginning next January 20.', 'What stands between our people and the good life of which Aristotle spoke is not any lack of ability to produce consumer goods. That problem, for America, has been solved. What have not been solved are those problems which lie largely in the realm of public action - bad housing, poverty, recessions, unemployment, discrimination, crowded and obsolete schools and hospitals and libraries, inadequate recreation, the breakdown of mass transportation, polluted air and water, juvenile delinquency.', 'These problems are compounded as we become more and more an urban nation.', 'But when the cities turned to Washington for help, how have they been received? The Republican administration has taken a position as consistent as it is negative. You know their record:', 'On urban renewal - stall it.', 'On low-rent public housing - kill it.', 'On moderate-income private housing - bury it.', 'On aid for public school - block it.', 'On aid for hospitals - reduce it.', 'On mass transportation - ignore it.', 'On control of stream pollution - abandon it.', 'On air pollution control - study it.', 'On alleviating juvenile delinquency - research it.', 'This is the 8-year Republican record of neglect. It is a shameful record. It is a record we must bring to an end on November 8.', 'Of course, this is an election year - and now the Republican candidate contends that he, too, has an urban program. It was presented in a position paper 2 weeks ago. That paper fills three columns of a newspaper. But what it says is very little. Mr. Nixon says, for example, that ""the transportation problem is * * * complex."" But he does not suggest doing anything about it.', 'He says ""the Housing Act of 1949 worked well."" But if he had his way, there would not even be a Housing Act of 1949 - because in that year he fought and voted against it. I remember well, because I was fighting for it. He says that he is now in favor of low-rent housing, after voting against it in Congress every time he had the chance. But he would cut back on urban renewal assistance. And he still opposes any middle-income housing program. Finally, he is for higher interest rates - as though increasing the monthly payment for home buyers is the way to build and sell more homes.', ""Mr. Nixon's urban program is an empty shell."", 'Our Democratic Party does have a program for housing and other city problems. That program is expressed in our platform and in our record in the Congress over the years. If the people want to move forward in these fields - as I am sure they do - they had better buy the genuine democratic article and not the counterfeit that Mr. Nixon suddenly coined in the middle of the campaign.', 'I propose that we create a new and vital partnership between the National Government and the communities of America. Each community will plan its own future, but it will be helped to get there by the combined resources of cities, States and Nation.', 'I propose a 10-year Federal-local action program to eradicate slums and blight and help solve the problems of explosive metropolitan growth. This 10-year program will emphasize five approaches:', '1. Urban renewal: This program has shown what wonders can be worked through Federal-city partnership. Before there was a national program, there were almost no local programs - Pittsburgh being a conspicuous exception. Now almost 500 communities, large and small, have more than 800 projects underway. Federal action has not stifled local initiative - as the Republican orators love to claim. Far from it, Federal action has stimulated local initiative, released local energies, making it possible for local leaders to do what they want to do, and what they know needs to be done. An expended urban renewal program should be made effective in conserving and restoring older areas, as well as in clearing and rebuilding areas that are beyond conserving. The National Government should give a long-term commitment to urban renewal - in place of the present year-to-year approach - so that cities can make long-term plans with the assurance that aid will not be suddenly cut off.', '2. Housing: Our housing programs should be brought into a better balance - so that they will be designed to build homes not only for higher income families but also for lower income and middle income, not only in the newer suburbs hut also in our older cities. We should be building half again as many homes every year as are being built this year. We need a new, effective middle income housing program. We should meet the neglected needs of the elderly and of minority groups. And let us improve the help we are giving to those families and businesses that are displaced by redevelopment and other governmental programs. The cost of projects which benefit a whole community should not be disproportionately borne by a few.', '3. Mass transportation: Almost every metropolitan region has a transportation crisis, but few have the resources to meet it unaided. I supported the bill the Senate passed this year to provide assistance for metropolitan transportation planning and facilities. We have extensive Federal aid for highways but none for commuter railroads, bus and streetcar service. Continuation of this unbalanced policy-or lack of policy - can only mean still further decline of mass transportation facilities and still more bumper-to-bumper automobile traffic - in a vicious circle which has no end short of paving all our cities over. Unified transportation planning should be a condition and a goal of Federal assistance.', '4. Pollution: The pollution of our air and water has reached the proportions of a national disgrace. It endangers our health. It limits our business opportunities. It destroys recreation. Yet the Republican administration selected the program of Federal aid to cleanse our streams and rivers as one Democratic program which should be abandoned. I proposed to go the other way-to provide the indispensable element of national leadership to develop comprehensive conservation plans for all of our great interstate river basins.', '5. Recreational facilities: In every plan for urban redevelopment, parks and recreation must have their proper place. We must act to preserve and protect open spaces along our rivers, lakes, and seashores and on the edges of our expanding metropolitan areas. And we must act quickly - for with every passing day, the available open spaces shrink and their cost increases. In addition to expansion of the national park system, aid to the States for these purposes should be inaugurated.', 'These are five areas in which a new partnership of community and National Government can lead us across the urban frontier. To co-ordinate its own participation the Federal Government should raise to that status of Cabinet department all of its activities relating to urban development and metropolitan planning. The cities and suburbs of America deserve a seat at the Cabinet table.', 'The Department of Agriculture was created 98 years ago to serve rural America. It is time the people who live in urban areas receive equal representation.', 'Some may say that all these things will cost too much. But the cost to the taxpayer will be far less than the present enormous cost of slums, traffic jams, crime and delinquency, and the economic decline of downtown areas. And the entire Federal share will actually be less than just one item in the Federal budget - the excessive interest costs on the national debt that have been added by the high-interest policies of the Republican administration.', 'Thomas Jefferson told us that our ""laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind."" But in this area of urban affairs, our laws and institutions have lagged behind what our minds tell us we can do. There is a civil renaissance, an awakening of public spirit and will, throughout our cities. We see it in the Golden Triangle in Pittsburgh, at Lincoln Square in New York, at Charles Center in Baltimore. Let us hope that that spirit of confidence and enterprise now arising in the cities of America will sweep next year into the Capital of the United States. Then the Federal Government will join in partnership with its States and its cities - and together we will move forward to realize in our cities the good life that can be ours.']"
258,John F. Kennedy ,"October 10, 1960","['It is a deep privilege to speak here in Warm Springs.', 'No Democrat - and particularly no Democrat who aspires to be President - can stand on this spot without mingled feelings of awe and gratitude - awe for the great man who lived here, worked here, and died here, for the greatness of his works and the greatness of his soul - and gratitude that he raised a Democratic banner that we can be proud to raise today - a banner that summons all Americans, in every section, in every walk of life, in every race and creed.', 'Franklin Roosevelt was the champion of little children and the champion of the aged. He understood the needs of the farmer and the worker, the big city and the small town. His heart went out to those who were handicapped as he had been, and to those who were poor as he had never been.', 'The basic force in all this was not so much his party or his intellect - it was his spirit - a spirit he breathed into our National Government - a spirit he breathed into our party - a spirit which did not die when he died, but must be carried on by those of us who invoke his name today.', 'It was a spirit of strength and progress - to get America moving. And it was a spirit of compassion - not condescension, but compassion.', 'It was the compassion of a man who had suffered deeply himself and who, through his own ordeal, had learned to identify himself with the suffering of others - the man who said, in accepting his second nomination in 1936:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'Franklin Roosevelt knew who had been ignored and omitted by 12 years of Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. And he set about to help them - to remember the forgotten man, to light the farms, to help the aged, to protect the worker, to open new doors to the Negro, to care for the needs of millions of Americans in a thousand different ways.', ""Those who had previously held a monopoly on the Government's attention denounced the New Deal as the road to socialism and bankruptcy. They are still making those charges today. But can anyone here really imagine an America without the New Deal? Can anyone imagine this Nation without social security, without unemployment compensation and old-age assistance, without minimum wages and maximum working hours, without Federal guarantees of collective bargaining, without regulation of security issues and stock exchanges, without the guarantee of bank deposits, without protection for our farmers?"", 'There were many conferences on all these programs held here at Warm Springs. President Roosevelt used to talk about the ""spirit of Warm Springs * * * the general feeling that we are all part of a family."" It was here, for example, that the REA was born - because it was here that he discovered his electric bill was four times as large as his bill at Hyde Park - and he realized that rural areas would never get adequate low-cost electricity unless the Federal Government provided some leadership.', ""Franklin Roosevelt did not believe Government was the answer to everything. None of us attaches any magic to dollars that go to Washington and return, if local and private efforts can do the job. The conquest of polio - one of F.D.R.'s fondest dreams - is a vivid testimonial of the work which private research and foundations can do, backed by Federal funds only where necessary."", 'But here in Warm Springs, he told a press conference in 1934 that he was going to continue his fight to help the needy people of this country "" * * * for the very simple reason that if the Government does not do it nobody else will or can."" And even in the field of health, Franklin Roosevelt was not afraid to pioneer in governmental efforts wherever he found ""nobody else will or can.\' He cared greatly about what he once called ""the war against the crippling of our men and women and, especially, of children.""', 'Illness is a national problem. It recognizes no barriers of race or religion or region, and its conquest must be a national effort benefiting all Americans - for the protections of our Government in every field must be extended without regard to artificial distinctions, and full participation in our national life must be open to all.', 'As I have said in every part of the country, this Nation - if it is to be true to its ideals and obligations - must assure every citizen full protection of his constitutional rights and his equal opportunity to participate with every other American in every phase of our national life.', ""Franklin Roosevelt's record in the advancement of health was tremendous. But he would not be content if he felt our concern today was merely in preserving his accomplishments. F.D.R. was never a man to rest on the record of the past. He had served in the administration of Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom. But he knew in 1932 that the New Freedom was no longer enough - and he moved boldly to the New Deal. And so must we, in 1960, recognize that there are problems which were not solved or not even contemplated by the New Deal - and we must boldly move forward to meet the needs of 1960's new frontiers."", 'In no area is progress more vitally needed than the area of health. The cost of medical care has skyrocketed beyond the reach of many citizens, particularly our older citizens - and yet the present administration requires them to take a ""pauper\'s oath"" before they can receive assistance. There are too few doctors, too few nurses, and too few hospitals. Too few of our handicapped are being rehabilitated - too many medical research projects are financially starved - too many rivers are dangerously polluted. Drugs are too expensive - insurance plans are too limited.', 'Unfortunately these problems have been neglected for 8 years by a party ""frozen in the ice of its own indifference."" It\'s election year now - and their candidate has come out with a grand new ""program to combat disease in the 1960\'s."" But where was he in the 1950\'s - when his party cut back our efforts for TB control, for water-pollution control, for new hospitals, for medical research, for medical education, for cancer research, and for services to crippled children? Whatever progress was made in this field was made by a Democratic Congress over the foot-dragging opposition of the Republican Party. For him to boast now of the increase in funds for medical research-funds his party opposed all the way - is the height of election-year hypocrisy.', 'But more important than the past is the question: What do we do now? Anyone who can visit Warm Springs, as I have, will be reminded that every year we delay will cause unnecessary suffering. I propose for immediate action the following program for the new frontiers of health:', 'First, we must provide a more adequate program of medical care for the aged - a system which enables a man, during his working days, to set aside in a trust fund the cost of health insurance after retirement, so he can receive care then as a matter of right, not charity - without burdening his children and without taking a humiliating ""pauper\'s oath.""', ""Second, we must provide Federal grants for the construction, expansion, and modernization of medical schools, dental schools, and schools of public health. We are graduating only 7,500 doctors a year in the entire country - our hospitals and other facilities are under-staffed - most doctors' offices are overcrowded - and even to maintain the present ratio, we shall need nearly half again as many by 1975. This will require at least 20 new schools as well as expanding present facilities - and had the Republicans not blocked this project in 1955, those schools could be training new doctors today."", 'Third, we must provide loans and scholarships for medical students. There are one-third fewer applicants to our medical schools today than there were in 1950 - even though the need for their services is much greater. The reason is that a medical education has become too expensive for most young people and their parents - nearly $12,000, not counting the years in undergraduate work before and internship or special studies afterward. Only 1 out of 10 has any kind of scholarship - and the average scholarship is only $500. Low-interest loans and fellowships must be made available by the Federal Government - converting them into scholarships for those willing to devote their talents to fighting disease in the underdeveloped nations - for which we need a new World Health Center - and those willing to devote their talents in this country to those rural and other areas with a shocking lack of doctors. In some cities, there is a doctor for every 250 people. In some counties, there is 1 for every 3,000 people. I think we can do better. We can take these steps to get more doctors - and more nurses as well.', 'Fourth, we must provide grants for renovating our older hospitals. The Hill-Burton Act has been responsible for the construction of new hospitals with some 200,000 beds. Every year the Republicans try to cut this appropriation back-and every year the Democrats increase it-70 percent more than the Republicans wanted in the last 3 years. But new hospitals are not enough. Most of our older cities have older hospitals which could be renovated, modernized, and expanded to help meet the load - and grants for this purpose, along with research into improved hospital operation and administration, could bring the cost and the shortage down at the same time.', ""Fifth, we must provide long-term grants for increased medical research, including basic research. What has already been accomplished in polio and TB shows what might soon be accomplished for cancer, mental illness, arteriosclerosis, and new ways of prolonging man's productive days instead of just prolonging his life. All of this and more is underway. I am proud that we have resisted each year the Republican attempts to cut back medical research from the levels recommended by experts. I am proud to have sponsored the increase in basic research - less dramatic but equally needed - and the new U.S. Medical Library, which saves time, money and suffering by helping coordinate research all over the country. But now we must do more - not only more money, but longer commitments so that experiments can be planned and equipment bought."", 'Sixth and finally, we must expand our efforts for rehabilitation. We see here what can be done. But the tragic fact of the matter is that for the Nation as a whole, very little is being done. Two million handicapped or disabled people in America today could be rehabilitated if the funds and services were available - but instead we are providing for 88,000. We can do better - we must do better - if we are to live up to ""the spirit of Warm Springs.""', ""This is not a program for socialized medicine - it is a program to prevent socialized medicine, by meeting our critical needs in a manner consistent with our obligation to freedom and the doctor's obligation to humanity. In meeting these problems - as in meeting all the problems that press in upon us in the sixties, problems of falling farm income, unemployment, race relations, housing, education, and, above all, problems of war and peace - our task is not light. Our responsibilities are many. Our crities will be strong."", ""But I ask you to remember that, here at Warm Springs, they found among Franklin Roosevelt's papers a speech he had written but never delivered - and it closed with these words:"", '\n  The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith.\n']"
259,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['Mr. CLAUSER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. We have quite a few questions. Senator Kennedy has agreed to answer a few of them. We have about 10 minutes.', 'The first question is one which you touched on quite a bit in your talk, but it concerns so many of our editors, those editors who are editors of magazines representing industries, specific industries. Here is the question:', 'Several of our editors, reflecting concern about their particular industries, advanced questions regarding the damaging effects of imports from low-wage areas such as Japan. Pottery, glass, shoes, textiles and electronic products are among those mentioned. What specific steps would you take to cope with these problems, such as tighter import controls, or would protection for the New England shoe industry, for example, be reactionary and contrary to the foreign trade policy of both parties?', 'Senator KENNEDY. As I said in my speech, the balance of payments, as all of you know, on exports, was in our favor in the last 12 months. The difficulty, of course, is that in order to sustain our commitments around the world, aid, payment of our troops, bases, all the rest, we have to have more than just a balance between exports and imports. The balance of trade really has to be in our favor. That is the first point.', ""Now, on this question, of course, we have been particularly hard hit by imports in some areas, and pottery certainly is one, fish is another that was not mentioned, textiles is another. Frequently imports may be only a relatively small percentage of our domestic market, 2 or 3 percent, but it breaks the price for the other 97 percent. My own judgment and experience has been that we have laws, of course, on the books, the peril point, and others, for agricultural commodities and industrial commodities, which have given protection to any industry which is excessively damaged by imports. As you know, on many occasions, the Tariff Commission has found that imports in a particular industry have had an excessive effect on the industry, that it has reached the peril point, and I have supported those provisions in our reciprocal trade to protect domestic industry from this excessive damage. But as you also know, because of international requirements, because of the President's responsibility for national security and because of other reasons, the President on a far greater majority of occasions has overridden the Tariff Commission. The number of times that he sustained the Tariff Commission have been relatively few. Therefore, the industry has been left to experience the damage."", 'In addition, in the case of Japan, we have a foreign policy responsibility to maintain Japan as a great source of strength in the Far East. Actually I think the Japanese have lived up reasonably well to the voluntary agreement on the importation of textiles. Hong Kong happens to be a place where textiles in the last few years have been coming from in the greatest quantities, at least with the greatest percentage of increase. So in answer to your question, because we must maintain our reciprocal trade policy, because we must sell abroad more than we take in, because the United States cannot take the lead in restricting trade, in fact, I emphasize that we should take the lead in persuading other countries to lessen their barriers against us, I believe that we can protect our domestic industry within present laws, with Presidential leadership, with a knowledge of the problem, with effective workings between the President and the State Department and countries abroad, and with the provisions in present reciprocal trade laws if vigorously, effectively, and responsibly administered.', 'Those are all large orders, but I believe that we can meet our responsibility. We are able, for example, within the powers of the President, without writing any law, to persuade the Japanese to a voluntary limitation. We can do many things, if the President of the United States is interested, if he is knowledgeable about the problems, if he works closely with the Congress, if he keeps in touch with the working of the Tariff Commission, if he studies the legitimate complaints of industry as opposed to those that may be excessive.', 'I believe that we can meet our responsibilities in this area more satisfactorily than we have. In addition, I have supported in the Congress legislation to assist those industries which are hard pressed by imports, but which have not been given relief because of overriding national reasons. If, for example, the President of the United States overrides the Tariff Commission when there is a clear case that the industry is being adversely affected, in fact, maybe almost liquidated because of imports, but he is unable to give them relief because he feels it would endanger our national security, we have in the past left the industry pretty much to strangle on the vine. I believe there is a need for a supplemental policy in these areas, which would provide loans to the businessmen involved, which would provide vocational retraining for the workers, assistance of one kind or another, because if that industry is being forced to bear a burden because of international responsibilities, it is a national problem.', 'I remember a particular case involving fish where the Tariff Commission recommended fish relief for our industry in New England, and because the Icelanders threatened to end our airbase concessions there if we took any action against the excessive importation of fish from Iceland, the President was forced to move against, I believe, the unanimous judgment of the Tariff Commission that the fishing industry was adversely affected. The fishing industry got no assistance from the Government for bearing that burden of international policy.', 'There is a problem that I think falls upon us. What is true of fish, which I happen to live with, is true of many other industries. So let me say in answer to your question that there are laws on the books for the protection of agriculture and for domestic industry. I hope we will have a President of the United States who is knowledgeable about those laws, who is interested in them, who is concerned about them, who works with the Congress on these subjects, and also uses his great powers and influence here and abroad in order to stimulate successful trade.', 'Mr. CLAUSER. Do you believe further regulatory or legislative action is needed to prevent the use or abuse of labor union power such as Mike Quill exercised in shutting down the Pennsylvania Railroad? Putting the question more broadly, do you believe management and union powers are presently in proper balance?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I would feel that it would be most helpful if in the basic industries we could persuade each industry and the union to set up procedures where strikes could be limited, where there would be a method of settling disputes without resorting to strikes which damage the entire economy. We have to pay a price for freedom, and, therefore, I have never supported compulsory arbitration in the great basic disputes, nor did Senator Taft in the 1947 National Labor-Management Act. He did attempt under that act to set up certain procedures which would permit a cooling off. Those procedures in my opinion are not satisfactory. I believe we should rewrite the national emergency section of the Taft-Hartley Act which provides today merely for an injunction for 80 days against the union.', 'One of the problems I thought in the steel strike was that the company knew that the injunction would be issued. They were extremely hopeful that the injunction would break the strike, and, therefore, there was not an incentive on their part to engage in true collective bargaining. It was not until the injunction had been issued and exhausted that they were then persuaded in December to accept an agreement which they could have gotten in July.', 'I think the President should have a wider arsenal of weapons so that neither the union nor the company would be assured his intervention would benefit one side or the other and therefore it would stimulate them to reach an agreement on their own.', 'In addition, I felt that in the case of the steel strike the Taylor Committee really did an outstanding job, set up under the national emergency provisions. But the President stated that he did not have the power to have the Taylor Committee make a recommendation. I am not suggesting that that recommendation should be compulsory, but I do believe that among the powers that the President should have in national emergency cases should be the power to set up a board of examination, isolate the issues, isolate the bargaining positions of both sides, so that public opinion could be brought to bear in an informed way.', 'In my speech I said I did not think the powers of the Presidency had been used very effectively in national emergency cases. It does not do any good for the President to make a rather vague, general speech about holding the line. What you have to do is break down the position of the two parties so that then we know what the union really wants, we know what the company will offer, we know what its effect will be on the prices. Those are the three things that we really want to know about a case. Then public opinion can be brought to bear and the influence of the Presidency.', 'So I would suggest that the President be given wider powers, a more varied arsenal, including this power that I have just asked, so that we can bring to bear public opinion in a more effective way in national emergency cases. I think it is a complicated subject, but after 14 years on the Labor Committee I am quite hopeful that in the coming sessions of Congress, regardless of my own fate, we could perhaps rewrite the national emergency section without doing it under the gun of the steel strike, but one that represents a cool judgment of what is in the best interest in the long run.', 'Finally, let me say that strikes are painful, but I am sure if you think of the complete alternative, which would be compulsory arbitration by the Government, I am sure that no one would really feel that that is a very happy solution. So you pay some price for strikes. Some are responsible and some are irresponsible. But I do believe we can increase the powers of the Government, we can compel the companies and the unions in the basic industries to think more carefully of their problems and responsibilities and of the public interest.', 'Mr. CLAUSER. Senator Kennedy, we have received several questions from people who are deeply concerned with the so-called Galbraith and Schlesinger pieces, that the Nation needs to divert spending from consumer goods and services, that a tax on advertising would serve to divert more spending to social and public services. Do you accept this doctrine, and would your administration take steps to execute it?', 'Senator KENNEDY. I am not informed in detail of the proposed tax on advertising and nobody has ever discussed the matter with me and I have never proposed it. Therefore, I would be opposed to it under the present conditions unless somebody could give me a better argument than at least I have heard superficially.', ""I don't think that anybody suggests that we should divert. After all, we are underconsuming today. I think what I am interested in, and, after all, I am running - what I am interested in is having us concern ourselves with the problems in not only the private sector, but also the public sector, that we concern ourselves with schools and hospitals and parks and recreational facilities and highways and urban problems, development of our national resources, and the solution is not to divert at this present time of a rather low-rate economy, spending from the private sector. The point is I would like to have us emphasize that we are in a deathly struggle with the Communist system, that we do have a responsibility to the next generation, that we must provide for effective government."", ""Now, all these people who object to effective government are the ones who come to us and ask us to drain their rivers and cleanse their rivers, and ask us to take action to protect their industries and all the rest. You have to have consistent public policy, and I think that Mr. Galbraith and Mr. Schlesinger, who have carried on an effort for a number of years, are emphasizing our public responsibilities. I don't know how you could divert from the private sector at the present time additional money that is going into the private sector unless you are talking about a tax increase. I have talked about the problem of taxes on social security. I have talked about redoing or relooking at our entire tax system in order to stimulate growth and provide sufficient revenue. But what I want to emphasize is that if I am successful we must concern ourselves with maintaining our strength in the United States and maintaining our freedom and have a responsibility to the public interest as well as to the private interest. But you must realize, those of you who work with business, that no President of the United States can be successful unless we have full employment, and we are not going to have full employment unless business is moving ahead. And you are not going to have business moving ahead unless it is providing for capital investment. Therefore, I must say that I think we waste an awful lot of time talking about things that really are not the issues. The issue is, can our private economy sustain itself? Can we consume what we produce? Can we attempt to carry on a greater rate of growth? Can we meet our responsibilities in the public sector to maintain our strength and freedom? Can we educate our children? Can we care for our problem of those who are ill? Can we develop our resources? Can we meet the problems of these metropolitan complexes? These are the things I want to emphasize, and I think in that, in the great sense, there really is not any disagreement between us.""]"
260,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Humphrey, Mrs. Roosevelt, Senator Lehman, Mayor Wagner, Governor Harriman, Senator Morse, Mr. Reeves, Mr. Nash, Congressman Celler, Governor Williams, Senator Hart, Mrs. Price, Mr. Williams - whom have we omitted. [Laughter.] So many chiefs are assembled with so few Indians, up here and in the audience. [Laughter.]', 'I am grateful to all of you. I am grateful to Senator Humphrey. He permitted me to grab his coattails once more in Minnesota by coming east. I must say to take time out in an intense campaign, which involves his future greatly and which is hard fought in Minnesota, to give up 2 days at this crucial point in the campaign I think first indicates how strongly he believes in this cause and also how great a man he is. [Applause.]', ""You can tell who isn't running for office by that relaxed posture that they assume up here. Hubert and I are the only ones on edge. [Laughter.] Andy Desellerelli is not running; he just puts out his name. [Laughter.]"", 'I am particularly grateful to Mrs. Roosevelt for her generosity and for Members of the Senate, Wayne Morse, who has been carrying the banner for the United States in the last few weeks at the United Nations, and for all the rest of you who came so many miles, from over 42 States. to take part in this Conference on Constitutional Rights and American Freedom. As Hubert said this morning, as Mrs. Roosevelt said last night, and he said, this is the kind of conference which could have been so usefully called in 1954 and 1955. I hope this is not the end. This is a long business that we are engaged in, and, therefore, other conferences should be held - I hope after election - I hope if we are successful in this election in the days after that - so that the best information, the best consensus, the moral imperative behind this whole great issue can be brought to bear constantly.', 'I therefore feel that this is a welcome precedent that comes in the middle of this campaign, and which I think establishes an important principle of consultation between those who bear responsibility in the Government and those who live as citizens and work in the field and know it and feel it and, therefore, this is only the beginning of what I hope will be a long series of conferences in and out of the White House, in and out of the Government, in New York and around the United States. [Applause.]', 'I must say on this issue as in so many others we do not walk into this campaign with a banner that bears a large question mark, a question mark in some cases in the other party which is still there. The Democratic platform pointed the way on the great issue of constitutional rights and on other issues. The task of the new Democratic administration will be to turn it into a reality to translate it into action, into legislative and executive action. I asked several weeks ago Senator Clark in the Senate and Congressman Celler in the House to join together and Organize a committee of the House and Senate Members to prepare legislation for the new year to implement the commitments made in the platform. I think that their experience in this conference will be most helpful. I have had assurances from both of them that their work is progressing and that they will continue during this fall to work on this most important and responsible assignment.', 'I assure you that the new Democratic Congress, and I hope a new Democratic administration, will press for action to implement their work. [Applause.]', 'To me it is not merely for legislation. It is also for executive leadership aud executive action. And I think the division of labor in this conference has been most significant. Two conferences on executive action and one on legislative action. Two panels that indicate, I think, the importance and the broad range of opportunity which is open to the next President of the United States. The Constitution is a wonderful document and it gives great powers to the President and great influence. It is, as Franklin Roosevelt said, above all a place for moral leadership, and as this is a moral question, it is upon the President the central responsibility will bear. [Applause.]', ""As you have indicated, many things can be done by a stroke of the Presidential pen. An Executive order for equal opportunity in housing, such as the Commission on Civil Rights, I believe, unanimously recommended over a year ago, executive reorganization of Mr. Nixon's Government Contracts Commission to turn it from what your testimony and the facts indicate has been a do-nothing agency, which has carried out only two cases involving very minor action in the District of Columbia, into an effective instrument against discrimination in the handling of Government contracts, a matter on which there must be general agreement throughout the United States; executive initiative on a hold and large scale area to use the power already given by the Congress to protect the rights of voters, and this, as Hubert Humphrey said, of course, is basic."", 'Moral and persuasive leadership by the President to create the conditions in which compliance with the constitutional requirements of school desegregation takes place; this is the kind of leadership I intend to give, the kind of action that we shall take. [Applause.]', 'By coming here, by giving your ideas, by discussing, by participating in discussions, by exchange of views, we help lay the groundwork for action in the future. If there is anything that history has taught us, it is that the great accomplishments of Woodrow Wilson and of Franklin Roosevelt were made in the early days, months, and years of their administrations. That was the time for maximum action. And unless the groundwork is laid now for action in a whole variety of areas if we are successful, then our success cannot mean as much. Now is the time to prepare for what we must do in the winter of 1961, to advance the opportunity for all Americans, to protect their security, to strengthen our country, and, therefore, October is the month to prepare for action in January, February, and March. [Applause.]', ""In the campaign I tried to lay the groundwork for such action. I have stated again and again the obvious truth, that freedom is indivisible, and is not it an ironic fact that that has been brought home to us in the last month, when Africans who have come here as part of the United Nations delegation have talked about some of their difficulties in housing, when African diplomats have come to Washington and have discussed some of the difficulties that they have had in getting good facilities for their people. They do not get those facilities for their people because some of our own people don't get those facilities and as soon as our own people get those facilities, then they will get them. They are closely linked. It is interchangeable. The effect on our foreign policy in Africa, as I am sure Senator Morse and others in the United Nations have said, all of these failures are serious. The indivisibility of progress here and around the world, has never been more significantly indicated than in the last 5 or 6 weeks. Because we have not been interested in education in our own country, we have not been interested in education for those overseas. Because we have not practiced what we have preached in our own country, we have not been able to practice it in their experience in visiting our shores. The tie is intimate, and as long as this is a struggle in which we are engaged, as long as this is a matter on which we have set a high standard for ourselves fortunately, then, of course, we have to move forward, or otherwise stand condemned as unwilling to meet the letter and the spirit of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. [Applause.] Freedom is indivisible, too, in all its aspects. To provide equal rights for all requires that we respect the liberties of speech and belief and assembly, guaranteed by the Constitution, and these liberties in turn are hollow mockeries unless they are maintained also by a decent economic life. That is why Franklin Roosevelt linked freedom from want and freedom from fear with freedom to believe and freedom to speak. Those who are too poor, uninformed, too uneducated to enjoy their constitutional freedoms of choice, do not really possess those freedoms. That is why we fight so hard for minimum wage legislation, for better housing, for social security protection in illness in old age. In order to participate in the other great freedoms we have to have a standard of living for our people so that they can enjoy them. If the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week, then the other benefits that we may guarantee them of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and all the rest, do not have the significance that they would have if they were participating fully in the economic life of our country. [Applause.] These are the indispensible foundations of a free society, and I am concerned with what is on the other side of the moon, but I am also concerned, as we all are, with the condition or life of the man or woman on the other side of the street. [Applause.]"", 'In America there must be only citizens, not divided by grade, first and second, but citizens, east, west, north, and south, voting, schooling, housing, and jobs, and all the resources of the Government must be pledged to that end, the resources of our people. There is more power in the Presidency than to let things drift, and then suddenly to call out the troops. The President is more than the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. President Truman showed what could be done by Executive order in the desegregation of the Armed Forces of the United States. We have lost valuable years by a failure of the Presidential leadership, by a failure of moral leadership. Three years ago there was an unrehearsed radio symposium in Little Rock. The participants were white and Negro students. A remarkable thing occurred. The white students became convinced during the program that desegregation of schooling was right and feasible. When the moderator asked one of the white students what her parents would say to this, she replied, ""I think I will have a long talk with my parents."" How tragic that the long talk had to come from a teenage girl, that it did not come in the center of responsibility, the center of responsibility as provided by the Constitution and by events, the White House, the President of the United States! [Applause.]', 'Can you imagine the long talk that President Roosevelt would have had with the parents of the country and with all the centers of good will that are waiting to be stirred? It is this kind of leadership that we need again. It is that high standard and that great goal that we commit ourselves to. It is the interest of the forces of construction, of reason, of action that we convene this conference.', 'The task is just beginning, but I thank you for joining us in this great beginning. I thank all of you who came here. I think the work that we have done here on this occasion can have lasting significance in the months to come, and I look forward to your company as we have this Nation move into the great new frontiers that await us all. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]']"
261,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend, your county chairman, Jack English, Mr. Nickerson, your Congressman-to-be, John Drewry, Julius Rosen, and Otis Pike, your assemblyman, and fellow Democrats, you know, Mr. Nixon never begins his speeches ""Fellow Republicans"" and I don\'t blame him. [Laughter.] He says party labels are not significant. Friday night he said in the debate what really counts is the man, not the party. I think what counts is the man the party puts forward, because the party tells us what the man stands for. [Applause.]', 'And I must say that on the great issues which separate our country, the great issues which face the United States, the great issues which face the next generation of Americans, there are very sharp differences between Mr. Nixon and myself, and very sharp differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. And I think those who live in this county and who live in New York State and those who live in the United States should ponder carefully these issues, because I believe on the solution to the challenges which face the United States, the vigor and vitality with which we attack them, our ability to recognize them, lies the future not only of this country but of the cause of freedom.', ""This is an important election. This election does matter and there isn't anyone today standing in this park regardless of their age, regardless of the circumstances, whose life will not be affected one way or the other by the judgment, the vision, the good sense, the sense of progress of the next President of the United States. This is an important election. [Applause.]"", 'I say that party labels have significance because at campaign time candidates make many speeches and talk about many things. But if those programs are going to become reality, if those matters to which we now address ourselves are going to be accomplished, it will be by the day-to-day work of a Congress and the executive branch working closely together. I must say that I come as a candidate for this ancient party in the most dangerous and promising and significant and ominous time in the long life of the great Republic; 1960, 1965, and 1970 will he the most changing for good or bad years in the life of our country.', 'I talk about American prestige dropping, and your distinguished Governor said that while he did not agree wholly with Mr. Nixon, he thinks perhaps we talk too much about whether people love us. That is not the issue, whether they love us. The question is whether people around the world want to follow the same system of freedom that has so benefited us. That is the great issue, not whether we are loved. [Applause.]', 'I am not so interested so much in whether they like Americans personally. What I want is whether they are interested in loving freedom, whether they like the same kind of system that has been so generous to us, and whether we meet our obligations, whether we move forward. On that great issue will hang the future of freedom in this country and around the world. [Applause.]', 'The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in the United States, and the reason he was a good neighbor around the world, was because of what he did here, because he was moving this country, because he had a compassionate understanding of the needs of our time, and the foresight and energy to push forward. He became a symbol to people all around the globe whose life was not as happy as they wished it to be.', 'Now in 1960, people all over the globe are determined to better their lives, and the great question of the 1960\'s, the great question of our time, is whether they will follow our example and our road, or whether they will move to the East, whether they will determine that Mr. Khrushchev and the Chinese Communists have the system and secret of organizing society so that it benefits all people. That is why what we do here and the kind of society we build here and the vitality and force of our national life really will affect the cause of freedom all around the globe. That is why I disagree with Mr. Nixon, when he says that everything we are now doing is as good as we can do, when he runs on the slogan ""You\'ve Never Had It So Good.""', 'I run on the slogan we must do better and I run with the full knowledge that we can do better. [Applause.]', 'This is a rich country and we have been treated generously by nature. But can we afford to waste 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who never go to college? Can we afford to have a Negro baby and a white baby born side by side and merely because of his skin, not because of his talent and motivation, can we afford the prospect that 60 to 70 percent of those Negroes will drop out of school before they finish high school? They have one-third as much chance, that Negro baby, of getting through college, as the white baby has, or one-fourth as much chance of being a professional man, owning his own house, four times as much chance that he will be out of work, much more chance that he will spend his life in manual labor. Can we afford to waste a talent?', 'All men are created equal. They may not be equal in talent, they may not be of equal in motivation, they may not be equal in their ability to accomplish things, but they should be equal in their chance and that is what we stand for. [Applause.]', 'As long as there are 15 million American homes substandard, as long as there are 5 million Americans who live on a surplus food package from the Government which amounts to 5 cents a day, as long as there are millions of Americans who are denied the protection of even $1 minimum wage, as long as there are Americans who do not enjoy their full constitutional rights in every sense, as long as America has ceased to be a source of inspiration to all those who wish to be free, as long as in the United Nations and elsewhere there are serious indications that we have lost the imagination of the world, as long as there is unfinished business for our generation, so long is there need for the Democratic Party and so long is their need for us to win this election. [Applause.]', ""I come here to this county, which is not known as the strongest Democratic county in the United States [laughter] and I come here and ask your help. We have 1 month from yesterday to this election. We will win or lose depending on what happens on your street, in your county, in your State. The next President of the United States will carry New York because the next President of the United States cannot be elected unless he wins New York's 45 votes."", 'This is not a contest merely between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is not really a contest between, in a great sense, just the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. It is a contest between the contented and those who wish to move ahead, between those who are satisfied and those who want to do better, between those who look back and those who say ""It is time America moved again.""', 'Thank you.

[Applause.]', 'I am delighted to come and visit. Behind the fact of Castro coming to this hotel, Khrushchev coming to Castro, there is another great traveler in the world, and that is the travel of a world revolution, a world in turmoil. I am delighted to come to Harlem and I think the whole world should come here and the whole world should recognize that we all live right next to each other, whether here in Harlem or on the other side of the globe. [Applause.]', 'We should be glad they came to the United States. We should not fear the 20th century, for this worldwide revolution which we see all around us is part of the original American Revolution. When the Indonesians revolted after the end of World War II, they scrawled on the walls, ""Give me liberty or give me death."" They scrawled on the walls ""All men are created equal."" Not Russian slogans but American slogans. When they had a meeting for independence in Northern Rhodesia, they called it a Boston Tea Party. They quoted Jefferson, they quoted Jackson, they quoted Franklin Roosevelt. They don\'t quote any American statesmen today. There are children in Africa called George Washington. There are children in Africa called Thomas Jefferson. There are none called Lenin or Trotsky or Stalin in the Congo, or Nixon. [Laughter.] There may be a couple called Adam Powell. [Laughter.]', ""But we have to prove what they hear we are talking about, what we are preaching about, what the Declaration of Independence says, what the Constitution says. We have to prove that we mean it, not last year, not 10 years ago, not during Roosevelt's administration, but today, 1960, the years after. If we are going to live by these high words we are going to have to live it every day. We can't turn it on and off. [Applause.]"", 'Here in New York today we just concluded a conference on constitutional rights and American freedom. People who work in this field for years have come here from all parts of the country and they sit right here today. They did not begin to work on it today or last week. They worked on it years ago and they are going to continue to work on it for years to come, and it is a source of satisfaction to me as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party that here in front are the men and women of all parts of the country who led this fight, and you know them all. [Applause.]', 'When the vote comes in the House and Senate, as Adam Powell knows and Senator Lehman knows, who provides the majority of the votes on every issue, on civil rights, on housing, and minimum wage, sickness, health, good days and bad, who provides the majority of the votes, who offers the amendments, who tries to get them through? A majority of the Democrats. And the record shows that the majority of those who oppose are Republicans and on all the issues.', ""I don't lead a party which believes $1.25 an hour is extreme. Mr. Nixon said that on the debate a week ago. That is the same party that voted 90 percent against 25 cents minimum wage. I don't lead a party which voted 90 percent against social security, which ran a presidential candidate, Alf Landon, in 1936, calling for the repeal of social security, and yet that is the same party in 1960 that voted against medical care for the aged. I think the record tells us something. By their fruits you shall know them. [Applause.]"", 'Nineteen hundred and sixty has brought up a real difference. Everyone talks about civil rights now, but the Republican candidate is the only one who talks about rights and talks about human rights in the North and States rights in the South, the only one who has a Negro traveling with him in the North but not in the South, the only one who sent Senator Scott of Pennsylvania to represent him in the North instead of Barry Goldwater who represents him in the South.', 'There is only one candidate, and I hope that is me, who is willing to talk about his record on civil rights. I never concealed my votes for FEPC, for title III, for majority rule in the Senate. Mr. Nixon talks of what will be done in the future, not what he has done for his party has done in the past, for his past is a record of opposition to FEPC, both as a Congressman and as a Senator, and as a consistent do-nothing policy as Chairman of the Government Contracts Commission. After all the Government spends a lot of money and there are a lot of companies involved. How many times have they really acted in order to compel them to provide that when they spend the money they should spend it in a way that people are treated fairly. That is all we ask.', ""This is Mr. Nixon's record, and I think it is a record that we should consider in the next 4 weeks. I want to make it clear that all this is important, not only to ourselves, but all those who look to us in the cause of freedom. When an African diplomat cannot get a good house in Washington, it isn't because he is an African. It is because his own people, the Afro-Americans in this country, cannot get good housing."", ""This isn't a matter that we turn on and off. What we are speaks louder than our words, and if we are building a better society here, if we are treating our people fairly, regardless of their race or their religion, then everyone who comes to our country will see what we are and go away impressed. [Laughter.]"", 'This is the unfinished business that we have. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, each of their generations met their responsibilities. Now it is ours. Now it is ours to finish the job. Last Saturday at the vote of the United Nations, do you know how many African nations voted with us on the question of Red China? Two. Do you know which ones they were? Liberia and the Union of South Africa. None of the rest voted with us. More countries voted against us in Asia than voted with us last Saturday on the admission of Red China. What has happened to America? We are the great revolutionarv people. We believe in freedom. We believe in independence. The Communists do not. They preach a doctrine. They are colonialists, and we are not, and yet for some reason we have lost the imagination of a people and they are beginning to gain it. What is wrong? I believe it is important that the President of the United States personify the ideals of our society, speak out on this, associate ourselves with the great fight for equality. [Applause.]', ""The white people are a minority in the world. We want to hold our hand out in friendship. We want to be as Franklin Roosevelt was, a good neighbor to Latin America by being a good neighbor in the United States. [Applause.] If a Negro baby is born here and a white baby is born next door, that Negro baby's chance of finishing high school is about 60 percent of the white baby. This baby's chance of getting through college is about a third of that baby's. His chance of being unemployed is four times that baby's. His chance of owning a house is one-third. His chance of educating his children is that much less. His chance of being a Federal district judge is non-existent because there aren't any. They point to those who work in the Federal service, messengers, laborers, clerks, typists. How many heads of departments? How many members of the Foreign Service are of African descent? There are over 6,000 people involved in the whole Foreign Servic - 23 out of 6,000. That is not very many, when Africa will poll one-fourth of all the votes in the General Assembly by 1962. One-fourth of all the votes of the General Assembly by 1962 will be African."", 'Again, he will have the same vote as the United States in the General Assembly. We want them to join us in moving forward. We want to move forward ourselves. We want to build a stronger America. We want to provide equality of opportunity for that child and that child. Whatever ability they have, whatever motivation they have, they will have a chance to develop that equally, but it is a doctrine and we stand for it, and we are going to move ahead on it, whether we win or lose this election. This I can tell you. [Applause.]', 'So I come to Harlem today to ask you to join us, to register this week, to vote, to stand for progress, to move, to go forward, until the United States achieves this great goal of practicing what it preaches.

263,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['I want to talk with you today about American economic policy. No topic could be of more importance at this or any other time. Unless the economy is functioning properly, our people will not be employed at good wages, our businessmen will not produce efficiently and profitably, our farmers will not receive fair prices, and our Nation will lack funds for defense, schools, roads and other public services, and the means to help strengthen the cause of world freedom.', 'Today, as never before, America needs a strong economy - not only to sustain our defenses - but also to demonstrate to other nations - particularly those wavering between our system and the Communists - that the way of freedom is the way to strength and security - that their future lies with us and not with the Soviet Union. That is the basic issue of 1960-and that is why each candidate must make clear his views on economic policy.', ""I do not know whether to regard with alarm or indignation the common assumption of an inevitable conflict between the business community and the Democratic Party. That is one of the great political myths of our time, carefully fostered. The business community has well served the Democratic Party - and I believe the Democratic Party has well served the business community. Ours is a national party. It draws its support from all segments of the community. Over the years it has benefited greatly by the public and political service, support, advice and assistance of American business leaders. As the party's standard bearer today, I need - and I ask - the suport and help of our businessmen, and I would do the same in a new Democratic administration. It will not be a businessmen's administration but neither will it be a labor administration - or a farmers' administration. It will be an administration representing, and seeking to serve, all Americans."", 'Just as the Democratic Party has benefited from the contributions of business leaders, so has the business community benefited from the contributions of business leaders, so has the business community benefited from the contributions of the Democratic Party.', 'And I also believe that the business community - and our basic economic system - have well served the American people. They have provided a very large proportion of our people with a very high and constantly improving standard of living. They have provided the sinew and sustenance to make us the first nation of the world. They have brought a wide array of modern goods within the income of most of our people.', 'In short, why should my party, if successful, want to change the fundamental structure of a system which has performed so well? Where the performance is inadequate, we would hope to improve it. Where there are economic injustices, we would hope to correct them.', 'But this would be basically true regardless of who wins. No President - Democratic or Republican - will be satisfied with growing unemployment, lagging economic growth or excessive price inflation that adversely affects our trade with other nations as well as our stability here at home.', 'And both candidates are also equally opposed to excessive, unjustified or unnecessary government intervention in the economy - to needlessly unbalanced budgets and centralized government. I do not believe that Washington should do for the people what they can do for themselves through local and private effort. There is no magic attached to tax dollars that have been to Washington and back.', 'In short, big government is not an issue - not at a time when the party which last made it an issue has expanded the Federal payroll to an all-time high, operated at an $18 billion deficit, increased the debt limit five times, caused the highest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States, and spent two-thirds as much money as all of the previous administrations put together.', 'I do not believe in big government - but I believe in effective government - in a government which meets its appropriate responsibilities, and meets them effectively. Economic policy can result from governmental inaction as well as governmental action. What you are entitled to hear from me is: Why is a change necessary - and what changes would I adopt?', 'I start from the premise that the performance of the Republican Party has been inadequate in at least five areas of economic policy.', '1. The first and most comprehensive failure in our performance has been in our rate of economic growth. From 1953 until the end of last year, our average annual increase in output - the real rate of growth - has been only 2.4 percent per year. The rate of increase in the Soviet Union, on the testimony of Mr. Allen Dulles, of the CIA, has been better than 7 percent.', 'It is easy to juggle these figures, or dismiss them as ""growthmanship."" It is easy to say that comparisons with the Soviet Union are not valid, because of the difference in base and method. But the fact remains that our growth rate is too low - that it was higher in the years 1947 to 1953 - and I think this is perhaps of most significance - that it is below that not only of the Soviet Union but of the more mature industrialized economies of Western Europe and Japan, Germany, France, and Italy. That should concern us all.', '2. My second concern is unemployment. Between November 1957 and August 1960 the rate of jobless workers, seasonally adjusted, has been below 5 percent of the labor force in only 3 months out of 34. Last month it was 5.9 percent. Adding those who are on short time, this means that the total of unemployment and underemployment is not less than 7 percent of the labor force. And in some areas - in Detroit, San Diego, in steel, coal, and textile towns - the proportion is much higher.', '3. Third, I am concerned about the periodic recurrence of recessions. There have been two recessions since 1952 and, as the Wall Street Journal has warned, a third could now be underway. During a recession, as unemployment rises, profits decline, and farmers and small businessmen suffer especially, the growth of the gross national product slows to a halt, and public revenues shrink. A free economy cannot have a perfectly regular rate of growth. But we cannot continue to view these sharp periodic setbacks with equanimity when we could ease their severity and slow their duration.', ""4. I am concerned with the steady upward drift in prices since World War II. Industrial prices have been stable only during weak spots - the 1953-54 and 1957-58 recessions and the recent months of downward drift. The Consumers' Price Index would have risen even more sharply if farm prices had not declined during the same period. During the decade of the 1950's, industrial prices increased, on the average, nearly 30 percent - some increasing still more. Steel prices, for example, have been approximately doubling themselves every decade."", 'I believe that reasonable stability in the price level is a vital goal of economic policy. By pursuing this goal we keep faith with those who save; we protect those who live on a fixed income; and we build world confidence in the soundness and integrity of the dollar. It is equally urgent that we do not achieve this kind of stability at the expense of any one group in the economy, such as farmers - or at the price of recessions, unemployment, and stagnation. I believe we can keep our prices stable while maintaining higher and more stable levels of production and employment.', '5. Finally, there is proper concern about our balance of payments and the recent drain of gold. It is vital that we keep our exports well ahead of our imports in order to cover our commitments abroad - our military forces around the world, our diplomatic obligations, our military aid, and our assistance to underdeveloped nations. But there is still no substitute - for the Nation as well as the individual - for a good cash position; and the difference between our exports and imports today (although somewhat better than last year) is still not enough to meet our obligations around the world.', 'It is in these five areas of concern - economic growth, unemployment, the business cycle, price stability, and our balance of payments - that I think we can do better, that I think we must do better. And I believe that most businessmen share my concern - and share my belief that we can do better.', 'What changes are needed? What policies would be successful?', 'First, a Democratic administration would use monetary policies more flexibly than the Republicans. The Republicans adopted the seemingly simple and easy policy of tightening interest rates when demand was strong and prices were rising - a principle that requires allowing rates to fall when the economy needed stimulation. But the facts of the matter are that each successive peak and each successive valley in the economy has ended with higher and higher interest rates - with the result that paradoxically high rates accompanied heavy unemployment, low production, and a slack economy.', ""For this policy has not worked. By periodically cutting back on investment, it has held back on a normal, healthy rate of growth. By staying tight too long, as it did in the fall of 1957 when the storm signals were already flying for the recession of 1958 - by the Federal Reserve Board's tight credit - by the defense stretchout of 1958 - it helped to bring on that and other recessions. And, by penalizing most those who must borrow from banks for investment or homebuilding, it is weighted in favor of the larger corporations, which have access to the open market or which can invest from their own earnings."", 'A Democratic administration would not rdy upon lopsided monetary policy. It would maintain greater flexibility for investment, expansion and growth. It would not raise interest rates as an end in itself. Without rejecting monetary stringency as a potential method of curbing extravagant booms, we would make more use of other tools.', 'Secondly, and in this connection, we would use the budget as an instrument of economic stabilization. I believe that the budget should normally be balanced. The exception apart from a serious or extraordinary threat to the national security is serious unemployment. In boom times we should run a surplus and retire the debt. When men and plant are unemployed in serious numbers, the opposite policies are in order. We should seek a balanced budget over the course of the business cycle with surpluses during good times more than offsetting the deficits which may be incurred during slumps.', 'I submit that this is not a radical fiscal policy. It is a conservative policy.', 'But we must have a flexible, balanced and, above all, coordinated monetary and fiscal policy. I do not, let me make clear, advocate any changes in the constitution of the Federal Reserve System. It is important to keep the day-to-day operations of the Federal Reserve removed from political pressures.', ""The President's responsibility - if he is to lead - includes longer range coordination an a direction of economic policies, subject to our system of checks and balances. And I believe the Federal Reserve Board - which during the last 8 years has cooperated closely with this administration - would also cooperate with future strong and well considered Presidential leadership which expresses the responsible will of Congress and the people."", 'Third, I believe that the next administration must work sympathetically and closely with labor and management to develop wage and price policies that are consistent with stability. We can no longer afford the large erratic movements in prices which jeopardize domestic price stability and our balance of payments abroad. Nor is there a place for the kind of ad hoc last-minute intervention which settled the steel strike.', 'Without resorting to the compulsion of wage or price controls, the President of the United States must actively use the powers of leadership in pursuit of well-defined goals of price stability. For those powers - of reason, moral suasion, and informed public opinion, influencing public opinion - have by no means been exhausted to date.', 'Fourth, we must make certain that there is proper encouragement to plant modernization. Postwar Europe has a new and modern industrial plant. So has the Soviet Union. We cannot compete if our plants are out of date or second rate. Wherever we can be certain that tax revision, including accelerated depreciation, will encourage the modernization of our capital plant - and not be a disguise for tax avoidance - we should proceed with such revision. It is sound, liberal policy to see that our productive plant is the best and most modern in the world.', 'And a combination of these policies with policies of full employment can help us realize the full promise of automation. Taxes affect not only revenue but also growth and a new administration must review carefully but with imagination our entire tax policy to see that these objectives are being met.', 'Fifth, we must pay equal attention to the men that man the plant. Growth requires that we have the best trained and best educated labor force in the world. Investment in manpower is just as important as investment in facilities. Yet today we waste precious resources when the bright youngster, who should have been a skilled draftsman or able scientist or engineer must remain a pick-and-shovel worker because he never had a chance to develop his talents. It is time we geared our educational systems to meet the increased demand of modern industry - strengthening our public schools, our colleges, and our vocational programs for retraining unemployed workers.', 'Finally, we must remember that, in the long run, the public development of natural resources too vast for private capital - and federally encouraged research, especially basic research - are both sources of tremendous economic progress.', 'In all of these areas, I believe we can do a better job. If our economy is vigorous, efficient, and expanding, and if our prices are stable and competitive, then business will create the jobs necessary for full employment and recover our old position in world and domestic markets. And as we continue to invest in other countries, other countries I hope will invest here. Our balance of payments will be strong, and we can cease to worry about the outflow of gold. I do not minimize the importance of the outflow of gold, especially in the short run, especially at the present time. And I would never want us in the position of being forced to tinker with the dollar in order to maintain our competitive position in the world export market. Our balance-of-payments position must be recognized in framing our domestic economic policies. It is a problem we must face, with all its implications. It affects our monetary policy as well as our wage and price policy, and they are all affected by our competitive position with the free world, the underdeveloped world, and with the managed economy of the Soviet world itself.', 'This will involve the policies of other nations as well. For most of the world still relives the days of the dollar shortage. Though it no longer exists, the habit of behaving as though it did exist - of saving dollars by discriminating against American goods - has not yet disappeared. Our goods are still subject to special restrictions in many markets. We must work hard to get these restrictions removed. We should explore market and credit reports as methods of encouraging exports.', 'And we should work with the creation of the larger trading units in Europe - the Common Market and the free trade area. These will strengthen Europe; they need not divide it. But it is a development of long-range importance to the United States and Latin America. Is there a chance that the trend toward these trading communities is passing us by - that we will awaken one day to find ourselves the great outsider? I would like to be certain that this is not happening.', 'We must also take a new look at our programs of economic aid. I firmly support such aid - but we must be sure that it is well and efficiently used - and increasingly, we must make assistance to the under-developed nations a cooperative endeavor of the well-to-do developed lands, cooperatively financed, those lands we assisted after World War II.', 'Here, as so often, economies and economics merge with foreign policy. After World War II the United States could have taken advantage of its extraordinary financial position; but in the interest of the free world we used imagination and restraint. Today, could we not fairly ask our friends to show similar restraint in dealing with gold and in helping to carry, according to their ability, a larger share of the financial burden of defending the free world and aiding the underdeveloped nations?', 'In this age, when capitalism is on trial, we cannot have a policy that is less than the best. Indeed, we can perpetuate capitalism only by making it work - by serving it as well as it has served us. This, I think, is the economic issue in this campaign.', 'It is between the contented and the concerned; between the inert and the active; between those who look back in satisfaction and those who look forward with hope. I am proud to be the candidate of the concerned, of the hopeful, and of those who look for progress. I am proud to be the candidate of my party.']"
264,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['Four hundred and sixty-eight years ago today a Genoese mariner watched the sun rise over a small Caribbean island, and happily informed his crew that they had finally discovered the westward route to India.', 'But Columbus had not reached India - he had reached America. He had not rediscovered an old land - he had discovered a new hemisphere. He had not reopened old ties of commerce and friendship - he had begun to forego the links between Europe and a new world.', 'But if Columbus discovered one continent - his journey - in large measure - resulted in the loss of another. For almost a century the course of the European empire had moved southward - along the coast of Africa, and around the Cape of Good Hope to the east. With the discovery of America, the kings, the generals, and the traders turned westward, leaving Africa to become the neglected and undeveloped province of a few European nations.', 'Today, more than four centuries later, the work of Columbus is being reversed. The nations of the West once more look toward Africa. And Africa itself is struggling for the freedom and the economic progress which centuries of neglect have denied it.', ""But if the voyages of Columbus led to history's retreat from Africa they also were the first step toward the emergence of modern Africa."", 'For it was in the new world of Columbus that man began his first rebellion against control by ancient empires. In 1776, the year of the American Revolution, Tom Paine wrote that ""A flame has arisen not to be extinguished.""', 'Today that same flame of freedom burns brightly across the once ""dark continent,"" creating new nations - driving old powers from the scene - and kindling in the African people the desire to shape their own destinies as free men. In 1953, three nations of Africa south of the Sahara were independent; today there are 19 free nations. And freedom soon will cover the whole continent.', 'Each of these newly emerging African nations has, in varying degree, the same basic problems, the same needs, and the same dangers. And in each of them wait the same tireless and implacable agents of communism - watching for the opportunity to transform hunger, or poverty, or ignorance into revolt and Communist domination.', 'The new nations of Africa are determined to emerge from the poverty and hunger which now blanket much of that vast continent.', 'They are determined to build a modern and growing economy with a constantly rising standard of living. They are determined to educate their people - maintain their independence - and receive the respect of all the world.', 'There can be no question about this determination. The only real question is whether these new nations will look West or East - to Moscow or Washington - for sympathy, help, and guidance in their great effort to recapitulate, in a few decades, the entire history of modern Europe and America.', 'I believe that if we meet our responsibilities - if we extend the hand of friendship - if we live up to the ideals of our own revolution - then the course of the African revolution in the next decade will be toward democracy and freedom, rather than toward communism and slavery.', 'For it was the American Revolution - not the Russian - which began man\'s struggle for national independence and individual liberty. When the African national congress in Northern Rhodesia called for reform and justice, it threatened a ""Boston Tea Party,"" not a Bolshevik bomb plot. African leader Tom Mboya invokes the ""American Dream"" - not the Communist manifesto. And in the most remote bushlands of central Africa there are children named Thomas Jefferson and George Washington - but there are none named Lenin or Stalin or Trotsky.', ""And our ties with Africa are not merely the ties of history and spirit. For our goals for today's Africa are the goals of the Africans themselves."", 'We want an Africa where the abysmally low standard of living is constantly rising - where industry and business are growing - where malnutrition and ignorance are disappearing.', 'And this is what Africa wants.', 'We want an Africa which is made up of a community of stable and independent governments - where the human rights of Negroes and white men alike are valued and protected - where men are given the opportunity to choose their own national course, free from the dictates or coercion of any other country', 'We want an Africa which is not a pawn in the cold war - or a battleground between East and West.', 'And this too is what the African people want.', 'And none of these goals is a goal of the Communists - who wish only to perpetuate the want and chaos on which Communist domination can be built.', 'Under such circumstances we would suppose that there was no place for communism in Africa - and that the new nations of Africa would increasingly look to the West and to America, for help.', 'But the harsh facts of the matter are that the cause of freedom has been steadily losing ground in Africa - and communism has been gaining. The newly independent country of Guinea has moved toward the Soviet bloc - importing Soviet technicians, borrowing Soviet money, and signing trade agreements with Eastern Europe. The newly independent country of Ghana has moved away from the West - and its troops were sent to the Congo in Soviet, not American, jet planes. In the strife torn, newly independent country of the Congo, one of the most powerful factions - that of Premier Lumumba - is pro-Russian and anti-American and as chairman of the Senate Committee on Africa I have watched with alarm the growing Soviet influence - and growing uneasiness about American intentions and motives throughout all of Africa.', 'This is a defeat for the cause of freedom - a defeat which is the product of 8 years of neglect and failure. We have lost ground in Africa because we have neglected and ignored the needs and the aspirations of the African people - because we failed to foresee the emergence of Africa - and ally ourselves with the cause of independence and because we failed to help the Africans develop the stable economy and the educated population on which their growth and freedom depends. And today we are still making the same mistakes and experiencing the same failures.', ""Although Africa's single greatest need is for educated men - men to man the factories, staff the movemment, and form the core of the educated electorate on which the success of democracy depends, we have done almost nothing to help educate the African people. There are only a handful of college graduates in the entire continent, and less than 1 percent of all Africans who enter primary grades ever finish high schools. Yet today we are aiding less than 200 African students to study in this country - we are supplying virtually no books or teachers to Africa - and less than 5 percent of all our foreign technical assistance goes to Africa south of the Sahara."", 'It was this sort of failure which caused the chaos in the Congo - a country of 8 million people with less than a dozen colleges, which did not have the education to run a nation, and which as a result has been unable to maintain a stable independence.', 'Although Africa is the poorest and least productive area on earth, we have done little to provide the development capital which is essential to a growing economy. Through the end of 1957 we had granted Africa less than two-tenths of 1 percent of all our foreign assistance. And in 1959 Africa received only 2 percent of all the money spent by the Development Loan Fund, a fund specifically created to help underdeveloped countries.', 'Although by 1952 it was obvious that the new African nations would be a growing force on the world scene, we ignored these nations until events forced them upon us. Our State Department did not even establish a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957 - and that same year we sent more Foreign Service officers to West Germany than all of Africa. Even today, barely 5 percent of our Foreign Service personnel is stationed in Africa - and five newly independent countries have no representation at all.', ""When Guinea became independent it took us 2 months to recognize the new Government, and 8 months to send an Ambassador. However, Russia's Ambassador was there on Independence Day with offers of trade and aid - and today Guinea has moved toward the Communist bloc because of our neglect."", 'These failures, and many more like them, this record of neglect and indifference, of failure and retreat, has created a steady decline of American prestige in Africa - and a steady growth of Soviet influence.', 'If we are to create an atmosphere in Africa where freedom can flourish, where long enduring people hope for a better life for themselves and their children, where men are winning the fight against ignorance and hunger and disease, then we must embark on a bold and imaginative new program for the development of Africa.', 'First, to meet the need for education we must greatly increase the number for African students - future African leaders - brought to this country for university training. But training new leaders is not enough. We must help the African nations mount a large-scale attack on mass ignorance and illiteracy through the establishment of a multination African educational development fund. This fund, in which the African nations would be full partners, will plan for the long-range educational needs of Africa, helping to build the schools and universities with which the African nations can educate their own people.', 'At the same time we will send an increasing stream of experts and educators - engineers and technicians - to train Africa in the tools of modern production and science, and in the skills and knowledge essential to the conduct of government.', ""Second, we must use our surpluses and our technology to meet the critical African need for food. Three-quarters of the African people struggle to survive on subsistence farms, and malnutrition is Africa's greatest health problem. Our agricultural experts must train African farmers to use modern methods to increase food production - freeing labor and capital for industry, and putting an end to hunger. And while productivity is being increased we will use our surplus food to combat the threat of immediate famine - to provide security against starvation."", 'Third, we must provide the development capital which alone can transform limited resources into a higher standard of living for the African people. We should establish a multilateral development loan fund, directed by both Western and African nations, which would make the long-term capital loans essential to develop the roads, the power, the water, the hospitals, and all the other public needs which are vital to an industrial economy.', ""At the same time we must stimulate private investment in Africa, through expanded consular services - and a program to educate industry to Africa's enormous economic potential."", 'Fourth, we must make the United Nations the central instrument of our effort in Africa. To the African nations, the U.N. is the central hope of world peace. By centering many of our activities in the United Nations we demonstrate that our principal desire is to build a strong and free Africa - rather than to use the African nations as pawns in the cold war.', 'Thus we must cooperate fully in U.N. economic aid and technical assistance programs - and send capable and dedicated Americans to staff our own U.N. mission and to work in the Secretariat. And we must strive tirelessly to overcome the Soviet opposition which now stifles many of the U.N. activities in Africa.', ""Fifth, we must ally ourselves with the rising tide of nationalism in Africa. The desire to be free of foreign rule - the desire for self-determination - is the most powerful force in the modern world. It has destroyed old empires - created scores of new nations - and redrawn the maps of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. America must be on the side of man's right to govern himself, because these are our historic principles - because the ultimate triumph of nationalism is inevitable - and because nationalism is the one force with the strength and endurance to threaten the integrity of the Communist empire itself."", 'Sixth, we must wipe out all traces of discrimination and prejudice against Negroes at home, if we are to win the respect and friendship of the Negro peoples of Africa. Every instance of racial intolerance, every act of hatred or bigotry, which takes place in America, finds its way to the front pages of African newspapers, and into the Communist propaganda mill. The New York Times has reported that there are more than 600 African and Asian students who cannot find decent housing - here in New York - because of their color. And African diplomats have similar difficulties finding homes in Washington. What picture of America will these leaders and future leaders bring back to their own land? We cannot be the champion of democracy abroad unless we practice it at home.', 'If we carry out this program for Africa with vigor and imagination, then I believe that we can begin to reverse the disastrous errors and neglect of the past 8 years - we can begin to rebuild the cause of freedom in Africa - and we can begin to restore our historic bonds with the people of Africa.', 'In a recent film, ""The Defiant Ones"" two men - a white man and a Negro - chained together, fall into a deep pit. The only way out is for one to stand on the shoulders of the other. But, since they were chained, after the first had climbed over the top of the pit, he had to pull the other out after him, if either one was to be free.', ""Today, Africa and America, black men and white men, new nations and old, are bound together. Our challenges rush to meet us. If we are to achieve our goals - if we are to fulfill man's eternal quest for peace and freedom - we must do it together. And together we can and will succeed.""]"
265,John F. Kennedy ,"October 12, 1960","['I want to talk with you tonight about the issue closest to the heart of every American - the issue of war or peace.', 'I am a candidate for the office of the Presidency - and any President, as Commander in Chief, faces no more solemn decision than whether to send American troops into battle, knowing they will not all return.', 'The next President will know, moreover, that any local conflict may suddenly spread into a massive nuclear holocaust, wiping out whole populations and contaminating entire regions - not only in Europe, or Asia, or far-off lands - but here, in America, in our own homes.', 'I know something of what it means to be responsible for the lives of other men. And if there is one pledge to the American people which I would make above all others, it would be this:', 'Should I become your President, I will take whatever steps are necessary to defend our security and to maintain the cause of world freedom - but I will not risk American lives and a nuclear war by permitting any other nation to drag us into the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time through an unwise commitment that is unsound militarily, unnecessary to our security, and unsupported by our allies.', 'That is the pledge I make to you tonight - and that is the basic issue between Mr. Nixon and myself concerning the islands of Quemoy and Matsu.', 'These names are not now in the headlines, as they were in 1955 and 1958, but they pose a key question in 1960 - a key decision for the next Prsident - in 1961 and 1962 or whenever the Chinese Communists decide for political or military reasons, that they want to put us under pressure.', 'For these two little islands are closer to the Chinese mainland than Staten Island is to this dinner. Communist artillery can pound them at will, at any time they please. Any time they want to create a crisis - any time they want to frighten world opinion by bringing us to the brink of war, or please world opinion by then halting bombardment - the Communists can decide whether to launch an attack on these islands - including a full-scale attack to take them over from the Chinese Nationalists.', 'Why should we keep this constant temptation beneath their very eyes? Why should we give them this convenient valve with which to turn on and off the pressure on our forces? Why should Mr. Nixon now want to draw our line of commitment to include these two little islands so vulnerable to Communist take-over?', 'It is not because these islands are essential to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. This Nation is clearly pledged to that defense, and I want to make it clear that if I have anything to say about it, the next administration will stand by that pledge. For there our security is clearly involved. There our prestige is clearly at stake. There our commitment is precise.', 'But Quemoy and Matsu, according to the best military judgment expressed, are not of any strategic value. They are not essential to the defense of Formosa some hundred miles away. They are not essential to any reinvasion of the mainland, if any - and they are not even defensible themselves against a full-scale invasion, except by attacking the mainland, and thus initiating all-out war.', 'I do not ask you to take my word for this. It was Christian Herter who said these islands ""are not strategically defensible in the defense of Formosa."" It was General Ridgway who said it ""would be an unwarranted and tragic mistake to go to war"" over these islands ""not useful"" to our security.', 'It was General Collins and Admiral Spruance who said they were strategically worthless both for the defense of Formosa and the reinvasion of the mainland. It was John Foster Dulles and Gen. Maxwell Taylor who indicated similar views. And it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said:', '""Fundamentally anyone can see that the two islands as of themselves, as two pieces of territory, are not greatly vital to Formosa.""', ""The President's original policy, as I understand it, was to seek a way of stabilizing our line of defense in the Far East and its most logical and defensible line, and while that policy has not been vigorously pursued in recent years, it has had my full support."", 'But Mr. Nixon disagrees with the views I have just quoted. The conclusions of our top military experts represent what he calls ""woolly thinking."" He regards his military judgment about the importance of these island to Formosa and a ""chain reaction"" as superior to theirs.', 'He emphasizes, moreover, that ""it is the principle involved"" - not ""these two little pieces of real estate. They are unimportant. It isn\'t the few people who live on them,"" he said, ""they are not too important. It is the principle involved.""', 'The principle, he says, is pulling back from two islands now ""in the area of freedom."" But if it is bad principle to persuade the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate these islands - in order to save their lives and prevent a war - why was it not equally bad principle when the administration he serves took exactly the same course for exactly the same reasons on the neighboring offshore islands of Tachen in exactly the same situation?', 'After our fleet helped Chiang evacuate this island, they passed from the ""area of freedom"" to the area of communism. But Mr. Nixon didn\'t say a word that was ever publicly recorded.', ""Even more incredible, he didn't say a word when the Communists took power in Cuba - not 4 miles off their shores, but only 90 miles off our shores."", 'Mr. Nixon saw what was happening in Cuba. The warning about a coming Communist take-over and a growing anti-Americanism were sounded long before it was too late. But Mr. Nixon apparently did not see any ""principle involved"" on the once-friendly island of Cuba.', ""In 1959, when the Red Chinese were moving into India's northern border, he said he was unconcerned."", 'And in the last 8 years the Communists have penetrated heavily in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East, in Laos and elsewhere in Asia, in Guinea and elsewhere in Africa. Tibet passed from the area of freedom. The city of Budapest after a brief, brave reappearance in the area of freedom was crushed back into the Communist camp with ugly brutality. The Chinese island of Ichiang was captured by the Communists.', 'But during all these losses to the area of freedom, Mr. Nixon never once invoked the principle he now cites.', 'Why, then, is he suddenly determined to pledge our troops to the defense of these two tiny islands on the Chinese coast? Are they more valuable because Chiang Kai-shek has moved his forces in there without our approval? President Eisenhower said that buildup was ""not a good thing to do."" Secretary Dulles called it ""foolish.""', 'Our top military and diplomatic leaders tried first to prevent the buildup and then to reduce it - and Chiang at one time agreed to a reduction, despite what Mr. Herter calls\' his ""almost pathological interest"" in keeping the islands.', 'But I recall that in 1955 an amendment to the Formosa resolution - that would have drawn our lines clearly and thus prevented this buildup - was introduced by a great U.S. Senator, Herbert Lehman. I supported that resolution - and I did not regard that policy of caution as appeasement then and I do not regard it as appeasement now.', 'But Mr. Nixon is not interested in policies of caution in world affairs. He boasts that he is a ""risk taker"" abroad and a conservative at home. But I am neither. And the American people had a sufficient glimpse of the kind of risks he would take when he said in 1954, ""We must take the risk now of putting our boys in"" Indochina on the side of the French if needed to ""avoid further Communist expansion"" there. If ever there was a war where we would have been engaged in a hopeless struggle without allies, for an unpopular colonialist cause, it was the 1954 war in Indochina.', 'The only war that would make less sense would be a nuclear war over Quemoy and Matsu. The American people know this. When their letters of protest were reported by the State Department at the time of the 1958 crisis, Mr. Nixon complained that this was ""sabotage"" by a mere ""State Department subordinate.""', ""But that was not the voice of a State Department subordinate. That was the voice of a peace-loving people - and in the perilous 1960's, when we will walk the razor edge of danger, a peace-loving people do not want a trigger-happy President in the White House."", 'Mr. Nixon says that the people who live on those islands ""are not too important."" I think they are important. I think the lives of the Americans who would be sent to die on these islands are important. I think the American homes and cities which might be wiped out if we were trapped into attacking the Chinese mainland are important.', ""For it's not Mr. Nixon's life that will be on the fighting line out there. It's not my life. But it will be the lives of America's sons and brothers and husbands who Mr. Nixon would send to fight for what he calls two unimportant little pieces of real estate."", 'I know something about the difficulty of landing men on these exposed islands and then keeping them supplied. And at a time when we have been steadily reducing our conventional forces and inviting a lag in missile power. I do not intend to let Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists decide whether our troops shall fight on those islands.', 'The Red Chinese, let us remember, are going through a dangerous, aggressive, Stalinist phase. We are not going to let them dominate the Far East - we are not going to appease or retreat under pressure; but neither can we reasonably expect them to ignore the presence of hostile troops on islands just off their shores.', 'The question is no longer whether a line should be drawn - the question is where the line should be drawn. I draw it around Formosa and the Pescadores - the area essential to our security. That keeps the peace.', 'But Mr. Nixon invites war by drawing it with precision where it has never been drawn with precision before - around Quemoy and Matsu Islands, regardless of whether an attack on these islands is related to an all-out attack on Formosa.', 'This is now policy - for, as the President stated in 1955, his policy did not enlarge our ""defensive obligations beyond Formosa and the Pescadores.""', ""Mr. Nixon, in short, makes a commitment where we have no commitment now, where he is all alone in his view, and where we would be all alone in war. For only Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek shares Mr. Nixon's view as to where that line should be drawn."", 'That is a foolhardy and reckless decision. If he follows through on it, it would mean a tragic disaster. If he backs down on it, it would mean retreat under Communist pressure.', ""How much wiser it would be to follow the President's original recommendation - to persuade the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate all military personnel and any civilians who wish to go - now when we would not be seeming to yield under Communist pressure, before real pressure is put on again."", 'Perhaps the United Nations could work out a plan for neutralization, demilitarization or trusteeship for the islands. Perhaps we could negotiate for the release of American captives in Chinese prisons. But to commit ourselves rigidly to defending these indefensible islands only ties our hands, plays into Communist hands and brings the whole world closer to war.', 'I do not think the American people will accept such a position. I do not think they will support such trigger-happy leadership. I believe they want peace - that they want us to make only these commitments which can be honored, which our allies will support, and which we have the arms to back up.', '""These islands,"" said Admiral Yarnell, former commander of our Asiatic Fleet, ""are not worth the bones of a single American."" And I intend to see that not a single American dies on those islands - that firmness and reason characterize our stand around the world - and that we accept the Biblical injunction to ""pursue peace.""']"
266,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Williams, Senator McNamara, Congressman-to-be Dan Reid, Joseph Minolfo, your next Governor, John Swainson, Mrs. Price, ladies and gentlemen, about a week ago I visited the house that Franklin Roosevelt was staying in at the time that he died in April 1944. You will recall that on the day that he died, he was working on a speech which he was to deliver the next day, which finished with the lines which suggested that the only limit to our realization of tomorrow was our doubts and fears of today. About a month before that, I visited Hyde Park, N.Y., and I saw where Franklin Roosevelt was born and where he lived much of his life. It is interesting to recall that in his first inaugural speech, he used words almost similar to those that he used the day before he died, that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.', ""I must say that that confidence in this country, that feeling when the American people are given leadership, when they have pointed out the unfinished business of our society that they can accomplish anything, I believe is strong in the Democratic Party today. [Applause.] And I think it is strong in your distinguished Governor and I think that is what has made him a great Governor of the great State of Michigan. [Applause.] And it is strong in Pat McNamara, who I have sat next to in the Senate for many years, and who has voted for the people, and I hope the people of Michigan will compare his voting record with that of his opponent on the great issues which face this country. [Applause.] And John Swainson, a distinguished veteran of the last war, who follows in Mennen Williams' footsteps, I believe he will be a great Governor and a great leader of the Democratic Party in this State and in the country, and I am glad to run [applause] - and Dan Reid, who I am hopeful will be your Congressman. We need some good Congressmen from Michigan, from all over the country. [Applause.]"", 'Franklin Roosevelt in accepting his second nomination before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, said in that speech:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'And I am asking you in 1960, in making a determination between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, between Mr. Nixon and myself, to consider whose record and which record is frozen in the ice of its own indifference. [Applause.]', 'I will now quote Mr. Nixon. I have in my hand a document. I know how Mr. Nixon feels about having the record quoted against him. [Laughter and applause.] He is very much opposed to it. He regards it as underhanded. But I am going to quote him tonight and I am going to quote him accurately. Here is what Mr. Nixon said; making one of his speeches to Republican businessmen in Hot Springs, Va., here is what he said: ""Unless unemployment goes over 4.5 million,"" Mr. Nixon says, ""Unless unemployment goes over 4.5 million, it cannot become a significant issue in the minds of a great many people. There must, after all, be some unemployment."" [Response from the audience.]', 'I would think it would become a significant issue to the 4,499,000 people who might be unemployed who might be less than 4,500,000 before it would become significant to Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.]', ""About 2 weeks ago he attacked Senator McNamara and myself for supporting medical care for the aged in social security. Mr. Nixon's criticism was that this would take care of a lot of wealthy people. That is the tiredest, oldest argument used against social security. Even Alf Landon has forgotten that one. [Applause.]"", 'Just 1 percent of our population over the age of 65 has an income of over $10,000, just 1 percent. So Mr. Nixon uses that old argument to prevent 99 percent of the people over 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $78 a month from getting medical care after they have retired - frozen in the ice of its own indifference, Mr. Nixon is. [Applause.]', 'About 2 weeks ago, Mr. Nixon and I met in a debate and in that we discussed $1.25 minimum wage. Senators are paid much more than that, and so are Vice Presidents. But Mr. Nixon stated that he regarded $1.25 minimum wage for those businesses making more than $1 million in interstate commerce as ""extreme."" He regarded a bill which passed the U.S. Senate, aid to education, he regarded that bill, and I quote him again, as ""extreme.""', ""In my judgment, Mr. Nixon fits very well the description which Franklin Roosevelt gave in 1936 about governments frozen in the ice of their own indifference. [Applause.] And I think especially that that is true of the 900,000 Americans who in this rich country have been out of work for more than 15 weeks already. I think it is a matter of great importance, and I think the people of Michigan, in making a judgment as to which candidate and which party they wish to entrust the Presidency, they want a responsible, and I hope, far-sighted leader with judgment, but they also want one who looks at America, who looks at what America can be, who looks at the problems of his fellow Americans as Franklin Roosevelt looked at them in the 1930's. That is what we are going to try to do in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'I think that the most important domestic problem which will face the next President of the United States is the decline in agricultural income and the attrition in jobs, the loss of jobs, our inability to maintain full employment in the United States. It is the most serious problem that we face. It is one of the most complicated problems that any free society can face. But it is a problem which we must face, because if our society is unable to keep our people working, we know that we have made a failure. And I cannot believe that this country can possibly agree to a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, a partial recession in 1960, with the prospect of a serious recession, if the economy should go down further in the winter of 1961. Nearly 250,000 people in the State of Michigan are out of work, over 4 million people out of work in this country, 3 million working part time, and the prospects for the future uncertain. That is the problem that the United States faces, and it is a problem that this administration has not approached with the vigor required and the compassion required if we are going to maintain full employment in this country. I want to make it clear that a Democratic administration will do the following things in order to stimulate employment:', 'First, we will not rely on a monetary policy that puts its emphasis on tight money and high interest rates. [Applause.] The fact of the matter is as Frank Church said in his keynote speech; if Rip Van Winkle went to sleep and he woke up and he wanted to know whether the Republicans or the Democrats were in office, he would just say, ""How high are the interest rates?"" [Laughter.]', 'If you bought a house today for $10,000, $15,000, and you have a 30-year mortgage on it, you pay about seven or eight thousand dollars more than you would have paid 10 years ago just for the interest on that investment. That is what the high interest rate policy of this administration has cost. You pay nearly $3 billion more in taxes to sustain our debt because this administration has put its reliance on a monetary policy which has been deflationary and which has had a serious effect in the last 3 years. I believe we can do better, and I believe the central responsibility of the adininistration that is coming in in January is to maintain full employment. [Applause.]', 'I would far rather, secondly, use the Federal budget and use fiscal policy as a method of controlling inflation than I would be to rely on the tools that this administration has used, used in my opinion at the wrong time in the wrong place, in the wrong way, in such a way as to increase the recession of 1958 and the prospects of recession in 1960.', 'Third, this administration has relied in the development of our natural resources on a policy of no new starts. You cannot possibly move ahead in this country, we cannot possibly develop our resources, we cannot possibly develop our strength unless we make the best use we can of the land, the water, the minerals, that have been given to us and which have made our country great. [Applause.]', 'I can assure you that in addition to this we will make the best possible use of our people, and that is wherever they may live, and regardless of their race or their creed. We have to use all the talent that we have in this country. There is no excuse in the world for bright boys and girls who graduate from high school to fail to get into college. There is no reason at all that a young boy or girl of talent, merely because their skin is a different color, should be denied an opportunity to realize their talents. That is what this is about. [Applause.]', 'All things are possible, in my opinion, to this country if once we determine where we want to go and what we must do in order to get there. Lincoln said 100 years ago, ""The times are new and the perils are new. We must disentangle ourselves from the past."" And I believe we must in 1960. The problems are entirely new and the solutions must be as new. But I believe the same spirit which in other days and in other years and in other times served this country so well, the spirit of the 1930\'s, must motivate this country in the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', 'I call upon all of those of you who have on other occasions supported the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates to once more join with us in one great effort to move this country off dead center, to start this country on the upward trail, to try to demonstrate in this country that a free society cannot only be free but strong. And I believe it is incumbent upon the American people to make a careful judgment between the Republicans and their policies of the last 8 years, and the promise of the future that is ours if we are given the opportunity to lead.', ""It is no easy task to lead the United States in the 1960's. Upon every decision hangs the welfare and perhaps the survival of this country. But in my judgment the job can be done. In my judgment the job must be done, and I do not have the slightest doubt in the world that we can do the job infinitely better than Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party. Of that I am sure. [Applause.]"", ""And if I had had the slightest doubt about that before this campaign I do not have it now. I believe this is an important election. I believe it is important for this country that the Democratic Party be successful. I believe it is important that this country have new leadership, and I can assure you that if we have anything to say about it in the next 25 days, we are going to point out the record. We are going to indicate Mr. Nixon's positions of the last 14 years on the issues which affect the security of the people of this country and their welfare, and in my judgment, come November 8, the people of the United States are going to determine that they have no place in the White House for a government and a President frozen in the ice of their own indifference. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
267,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, the first presidential candidate to come here to Ann Arbor was Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Woodrow Wilson was not running on a platform of experience. The only place that he had learned to stand firm was as a college professor at Princeton University for a number of years.', 'The next presidential candidate to come here was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. [Applause.]', 'Three times during this century the Democratic Party has elected Presidents, one was Woodrow Wilson, No.2 was Franklin Roosevelt, and No.3 was President Truman in 1948. On many different occasions the other party has elected Presidents, Mr. McKinley, Mr. Harding, Mr. Coolidge. They ran Mr. Landon. They ran Mr. Dewey. And we come to 1960. I believe that parties are important. I believe that the kind of men that parties pick are important. I believe that the party label tells us something about the candidate, something about the things for which they stand, something of their political philosophy. And I stand here with some pride and satisfaction as the direct successor to the Democratic Presidents who in this century carried the banner of the new freedom, the New Deal and the Fair Deal. [Applause.]', 'In my judgment, Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman were successful in their foreign policy because it fitted in exactly with what they were trying to do here in the United States; the 14 points of Woodrow Wilson were the international counterpart of the new freedom; the four freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt were directly tied to the aspirations of the New Deal; and the Marshall plan, NATO, the Truman doctrine and point 4 were directly tied to the kind of America that President Truman was trying to build; you cannot run as a risktaker abroad, as Mr. Nixon has said, and a conservative at home. There has to be a country moving here in the United States if we are going to be moving around the world. [Applause.]', ""Now, let's see, where were we? [Laughter.] Anyway, the point of the matter is that the United States in the 1960's is going to have to build a society with sufficient vigor, develop its resources with sufficient energy, provide a better life for our people with fair opportunity, with a sufficient sense of justice, if the United States is going to be in fact the leader of the free world. What we are speaks far louder than what we say we are. [Applause.] All of the Voice of America, all of the radio broadcasts, all of the books we send abroad, pale in significance to the kind of society that we are building here in the United States. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor here in the United States. Therefore, I come as the candidate for the Democratic Party. I come here asking you to join in building a stronger country, asking you to demonstrate, as we sit, in Edmund Burke's words, on a most conspicuous stage, in the most trying and difficult time in the history of the free world, I ask you to help in building here the kind of society which will serve as an example to those who wish to trod on freedom's road. I come here to Ann Arbor, Mich., and I ask your support. Last Saturday, Michigan beat Duke. [Applause.] And I think on November 8, Michigan and the United States will beat Duke's favorite son and alumnus, Mr. Richard Nixon. [Applause.] Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
268,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Lt. Gov. John Swainson, who is going to be the next Governor of Michigan, Pat McNamara, who sits next to me in the U.S. Senate, and who I am confident will speak for Michigan again in the future, for liberal, progressive government in this State and country, my friend and colleague, Pat McNamara [applause], and your next Congressman, Sam Clark [applause], and my name is Kennedy. [Applause.]', 'I appreciate the chance to come here to Battle Creek and also to the State of Michigan in this campaign for the Presidency of the United States. I believe that this is an important election, and I believe that there are great issues which separate our parties, separate the candidates, issues which divide not the United States, but which indicate a different philosophy for the future. My philosophy is a progressive one. I stand in direct succession to Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt who in their day and generation recognized that there was a responsibility for the people as a whole, working through their government, to move this country ahead, and I stand in that tradition.', 'I come here to this community and to this State, and I come here and ask your support. The decision which you must make between now and November 8 is whether you put your confidence, whether you put your future, in the Democratic Party or in the Republican Party, in Mr. Nixon or myself and I do not believe that that should be a difficult decision, because Mr. Nixon and I are sharply divided. We do not agree on the basic questions which face our society, and, therefore, as all of you must have some vision of this country\'s future, as all of you must share some concern, you must be able to decide whether you agree with the candidate who runs on a slogan of ""You never had it so good"" or a candidate who runs on a slogan that this country is going to have to do better if we are going to meet our responsibilities at home and abroad.', 'The question is not merely who can argue with Mr. Khrushchev. It is a far more difficult question than that. Mr. Khrnshchev has spent his life in arguments. The question is, Which candidate and which political party can mobilize the resources of the United States and the resources of the entire free world to turn the tide of freedom against the Communists? That is the issue. It is not a debate. It is a matter of consistent work, of setting before the American people the unfinished business of our society. I do not believe that this administration has met its responsibilities in the great areas of freedom. Do you know that there were more foreign students studying in the United States 10 years ago from all the countries of the world than there are today? We have less scholarships given to students to study here in the United States from abroad so that they can learn something about our country than we did a decade ago. Do you know there are less students from the Sudan and Yemen and Guinea and Ghana here in the United States than there are in Moscow? Do you know that there are five countries of Africa where there is no American representative today, newly independent countries that are members of the United Nations and yet do not have even a single Foreign Service officer there? Do you know that Africa will have one-quarter of all the nations of the General Assembly as votes in the next 2 years, and we have 26 Negroes out of 6,000 in our Foreign Service?', 'Do you know that there are countries in Africa - in fact, in all of Africa a year ago we had less Foreign Service representatives than we did in Western Germany? Do you know that the United States did not even establish a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957, even though Africa was in turmoil and change, and even though it is the center of one of the great struggles of history, to see which direction it will move in?', 'We are second in space and we are becoming second in other areas. We have an economic growth almost a third that of the Soviet Union. By 1975 their hydroelectric capacity will be greater than ours. And the question is whether you feel that this administration, in all of the changing areas of life, has shown sufficient intellectual vitality, has brought to Washington men of foresight and judgment in all these areas, and I think on that question the issue stands. I spent some months in England in the 1930\'s, and I heard Winston Churchill speak again and again about the perils that England faced. And I heard Stanley Baldwin and Chamberlain run on programs of ""Never had it so good,"" that everything was being done in its proper time and in its proper place. I believe that those who serve freedom in 1960 should tell the American people that this is the best of times, but it is also then a time of hazard, that the United States is not meeting its responsibility, that the tide is not moving in our favor, that the power of the Communists relative to ours is mounting, and that we cannot afford to lose more time in the fight for freedom around the globe. Castro is only the beginning of the struggle which will take the next decade in Latin America, whether the people of Latin America will continue to identify themselves with us or whether they will decide that the only way to lick poverty and ignorance and disease is to move in the direction of Castro.', 'Why did the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil decide to go to Cuba and call on Castro during the campaign? It was because he recognized the strength of Castro in his own country. I do not come as the candidate of the Democratic Party in 1960 saying to you that the future is black, but I do say to you that what we are doing today is not good enough. [Applause.]', ""Here in Michigan, here in the country, unless we move ahead, unless we provide employment for our people, unless we treat all of our people with fairness, unless we make sure that our brightest boys and girls get to college and get an education, and nearly 35 percent of them never go to college today - 35 percent of our best students in high school never get a college education - unless we are sure that those who seek jobs can find them, unless we are sure we are developing our resources, unless we are sure we are concerned with what is on the other side of the moon and also in the life of the people across the street, I don't believe the United States is meeting its responsibilities to itself. So I come to Battle Creek and I ask your support in this campaign, not in my campaign, but I believe in a campaign in which you are intimately associated, and that is for a stronger country, for identifying ourselves more strongly with the cause of freedom, persuading all those millions of people to the south of us that we represent the way of the future. Castro, what is happening in Africa, what is happening in Asia, can be stopped if the United States once more stands as the great champion of liberty. All over Africa there are boys named Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and Roosevelt. I want them to be named after American statesmen of the sixties and seventies. Up to now there are no Lenins in Africa no Trotskys, no Stalins. We want to make sure that the United States, which has always stood for freedom, continues to be identified in their minds as a revolutionary country, believing in the most drastic doctrine that mankind has ever known, government by the consent of the governed."", 'I come today to ask you to join in this effort to strengthen our country, to strengthen freedom, and extend our hand around the world in friendship. [Applause.] During the campaign of 1860, when the issue was much the same as it is today, whether the country would exist half slave or half free, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God and He hates injustice. I see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later, when the issue in a wider sense is still whether the world will exist half slave and half free, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I think you do so because you realize that this is an important election, and that the decisions that the American people must make on November 8 go to the life, the fortunes, and the future of every man and woman in this square, every man and woman in the State of Michigan, every man and woman in the United States. This is one of the great critical election periods of American history, because we have two parties and two candidates with different historical views of the United States, and different views of our present peril, and different views of the problems that we must face in the United States in the future.', 'I come here in 1960 as a candidate for the Presidency in the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country. I come here to Grand Rapids, which was the home of Senator Arthur Vandenburg, who was the father of the bipartisan foreign policy which secured the United States at the end of World War II. Let me make it clear that I regard bipartisanship not as a means of stifling debate, not as a means of preventing discussion of the problems that face us, but I regard bipartisanship as putting the interest of our country first. And I can assure you that in this campaign when we discuss the foreign and domestic opportunities and responsibilities which are facing our country, we do so from the best interest not of our party but of our country, which is the obligation of all of us. [Applause.]', 'I want to make it clear that I think this State and country will face entirely different problems in the next few years than it has ever faced before. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years if every man and woman in this country who wants a job can find one, and we are going to have to do that at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men, when one machine can take the job of 10 men. What is going to happen to those 10 men?', 'I am running for the office of the Presidency during a period of time when the whole balance of power in the world is shifting today. Why do you think Mr. Khrushchev spent a month at the U.N.? The reason he stayed at the U.N. was not because he thought that today he had the votes, because he wanted to impress on every country there that he is on the march, that he is confident of the future, that he is determined it shall be Communist, and that any country and any people and any system that stands in his way will be crushed.', ""Why do you think it was a week ago Saturday that only two countries in Africa voted with us on the admission of Red China? And all those other countries either voted against us or abstained. Why did those countries vote against us on the resolution 3 days before that? Only two countries voted with us. What impression did Mr. Khrushchev make at the United Nations? The only way I think that we can record present history is to study the history of the 1930's. I was in England and saw Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Chamberlain. They were fine Englishmen, but Hitler was on the move. He was mobilizing the resources of his country. He was indicating to all powers that if they stood in his way they would be crushed."", 'Now, that is the problem that we face as Americans. We have only ourselves to depend on for our security. We have to build in this country a strong enough society so that we can protect our own people and so that those who stand today in Latin America and Africa and Asia and Western Europe and Eastern Europe, who stand today on the razor edge of decision, wondering which way they should go, wondering which side represents the way of the future, they will be persuaded that we do, we are on the march, that Mr. Khrushchev is wrong when he says we are a sick society that is about to collapse.', 'He said before the Foreign Relations Committee a year ago, on which I serve, ""You people are not Communists, but your children will be."" Are we as confident that his children will be freemen, as he is that ours will be Communist? I believe we can be, but we cannot possibly do that, we cannot possibly meet our obligations, we cannot possibly build a strong society, we cannot possibly find jobs for our people, we cannot possibly impress the world that we are a society on the march, unless we recognize where we stand and what we must do in order to prevail, and that is the dispute between Mr. Nixon and myself. [Applause.]', 'He runs on the slogan, ""You have never had it so good."" I run on the slogan that this is a great Country but it must be greater, and it is a powerful country but it must be more powerful. [Applause.] And I am not, as a citizen of the United States, after 18 years, in the service of this country, I am not about to take anyone\'s word that we are going to be ""first, if,"" ""first, but,"" ""first, when."" I want us to be first, period, strong, powerful, moving, going ahead. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher. Cuba, Ghana, Guinea, Laos - the tide rises against us, and anyone who does not recognize, any one who does not realize that a greater effort is now required from us all, regardless of our party, anyone who does not believe it is time we moved again, I believe should not lead the United States in the sixties, and that is the issue and you must decide it. [Applause.]', 'If you feel that everything that must be done is being done in good time, that in outer space, in education, in jobs, in industrial growth, in our influence around the world, in our prestige, we are on the tide, the tide is coming in, we are moving ahead, then vote for Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.] But if you think -if you recall the sober lessons of history, if you realize with some perspective that in these difficult days only the best is good enough, then under those conditions I ask your help.

I come here as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party in the campaign of 1960. Many of the problems which we discuss here in this campaign, which we ordinarily would consider domestic problems, also have their implications in our position around the world. The Tennessee Valley, which Franklin Roosevelt developed in the thirties, was a great asset to the Tennessee Valley, but it also has demonstrated since that time to people all over the world how a free people can harness their resources, and now in Persia and now in the Indus River and now in Colombia in South America other free people are building Tennessee Valleys. The same is true of education here in the United States.', ""About 10 years ago the United States graduated from two to three times as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. Last year the Soviet Union graduated twice as many scientists and engineers as we did. The long-range implication of that concentration, of that ability to speed up when they thought it was needed, indicates how serious is the competition in which we are now engaged. I want to make it very clear that I believe that the United States must have an educational system second to none, and I believe that the Federal Government has a responsibility in this area for school construction and for teachers' salaries, and it is on this issue, I believe, that the Republican Party and the Democratic Party--------- [Applause.]"", 'The question which is frequently asked is, is it possible for the Federal Government to assist education without the Federal Government controlling education? All of you who live in Michigan live in what was originally the Northwest Territory, and all of you know that in the original Northwest Ordinance at the end of the 18th century, one-sixteenth of all of the land was set aside by the National Government for education at the beginning of our country, by Thomas Jefferson and by John Adams. All of you know of the University of Michigan, and of the other State universities and colleges in this State. The University of Michigan was established around 1837, and it was financed by lands of this State to support education. The Land Grant Act of 1862 set aside land by the Federal Government, public land, belonging to all the people, in order to support public education in the States of the United States.', 'The Federal Government is now paying out money for vocational training. It is also paying out money for schools in areas where there is a defense impact. My feeling is that this should be more orderly, that the Federal Government should assist in school construction. It should give funds to local communities and they should make the judgment how the money should be spent in cooperation with their own expenditures.', 'I believe the Federal Government must provide loan funds for students who wish to go to college. [Applause.] Over 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. Can we afford to waste that talent in the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country? [Response from the audience.]', 'This issue separates Mr. Nixon and myself and it separates the Republican and Democratic Parties. We have stood on this program for many years, and we stand on it now, and will stand on it next year. [Applause.] This is only one of many problems which we face. But education is going to be necessary if the young men and women in this audience are going to get good jobs. They are going to have to be well educated. If the boys and girls of this country are going to meet their responsibilities as Americans, if they are going to find employment and decent wages, if they are going to maintain the freedoms of this country we are going to have to have the best educational system in the world.', 'Our lack of interest in intellectual pursuits is reflected in the fact that 10 years ago there were more foreign students studying sponsored by the Government in the United States than there are today. Last year we gave 200 scholarships to all of Africa to come here to the United States. In the Congo, 8 or 9 million people, who could go Communist at any time, there are 12 college graduates, in all of the Congo. In all of Africa, 1 percent or less have finished high school, and yet we expect them to maintain a free society? And the U.S. Government did not even establish a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957.', 'We see two independent countries, Guinea, independent in 1958, now supports the Communist position at the U.N. Ghana, independent in 1958, now supports the Communist position at the U.N. Do you know when Guinea became independent the Soviet Ambassador showed up that day. We did not recognize Guinea for 2 months and did not send an ambassador there for 8 months. I think the issues are very clear, not merely whether it is Mr. Nixon or myself. It is two different philosophies. It is two different views of the necessity for vigorous, foresighted, farsighted action. [Applause.]', 'Do you know what position the United States holds in radio propaganda broadcasts today? Fourth in the world. Moscow is ahead of us, Peiping is ahead of us, Radio Cairo is ahead of us, and we are a poor fourth. Do you know how many programs we send to Latin America, the basic defense area of the United States, in Spanish? None in the last 8 years. These are all serious problems. They affect the education here, they affect our employment here, they affect the ability of Michigan to meet competition in the sixties. They affect security of the United States, and I believe that this country has to once again determine what it wants to be. In my judgment, it wants to be not only a great country, which it is; it wants to be a greater country. It wants to protect not only its own people, but it wants to serve as an example and inspiration to all these who wish to move along the road of freedom. So I come here today as the nominee for the oldest political party on earth, the Democratic Party, founded [applause] founded by the most extraordinary individual of the 18th century, the most gifted, the most farsighted, Thomas Jefferson, and I come in 1960 and say that we need men of intellectual curiosity, farsighted, concerned, interested, who want this country to be what it can and must be. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
271,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, the Senator from the State of Michigan, and I hope the next U.S. Senator, Senator Pat McNamara [applause], John Swainson, the candidate for Governor, and I hope the next Governor of Michigan [applause], Sam Clark, the next Congressman from this district [applause], ladies and gentlemen: If you just stay up there until November 9 we can settle this whole matter. [Laughter.]', 'I want to express my thanks to you for coming down to the station. Whistlestopping is an old American tradition, stretching all the way back to the first campaign at the turn of the century. I come here to this community to ask your support in this election. I come as the Democratic candidate, as the leader of the opposition, as the leader of a party which in good times and bad I believe has been willing to press forward, and I believe in 1960, unlike other years in our history, this is a time when we must press forward, when we need a political party, and when we need a President, and when we need a Congress which can make a correct assessment of our times, our needs, our perils and our opportunities.', 'Two thousand years ago, Demosthenes in his address to the Athenians, at the time of the invasion of Philip of Macedonia, said, ""Our trouble is from those who would please us rather than those who would serve us."" I do not come here today in 1960 saying that this is an easy time in the life of our country, saying that the job of the next President of the United States will be easy. I think in many ways it will be the most difficult since the administration of Abraham Lincoln. And because of the danger of weapons, because the problems are increasing in complexity, I think in many ways it may he the most difficult since the first administration of General Washington.', 'But I run for the Presidency because the Presidency under the American constitutional system is the center of action It is as Franklin Roosevelt said, above all a place for moral leadership. Only the President speaks for the country. I speak for Massachusetts, Senator McNamara speaks for Michigan, Senator Engle for California. But only the President of the United States can speak for Massachusetts and Michigan and California. And I think the job of the next President of the United States is to tell the American people the sober facts of life, to ask of them a greater effort, to suggest that it is incumbent upon us to build our strength here in this country, if we are going to maintain ourselves. I do not want it said of the United States by historians in 1970 or 1975 or 1980, after a perspective of a decade over our present time, that it was in these years, at the end of the fifties, that the balance of power in the world began to swing against us. Eastern Europe, Russia, and China are now assembled against us. If India should fail to maintain its economic viability and its democracy, if it should decide that the only way it can solve its problems is to follow the example of the Chinese, then the balance of power would turn against us. Guinea and Ghana have begun to indicate in Africa that that is their decision. Cuba already has. Laos may in the next week or two. Iraq is in danger. The Congo is in danger - all these countries which stand poised, facing overwhelming problems, trying to determine whether the way of the future is with us or with the Communists, and within the next decade they will begin to make up their minds. That is why I think this election is so important. That is why I think the times in which we live are so important. In the next 10 years, the balance of power in the would may begin to move either inevitably in the direction of the Communists or in the direction of freedom. And I want to be sure that in these changing years, in these years so fraught with opportunity and so fraught with peril, the United States meets its responsibilities that it has leadership sensitive to these problems, that we associate ourselves with these people, that we build our strength here at home, and that we hold out a hand to all those who wish to follow our example.', 'In the last 8 years, the Voice of America made Spanish broadcasts to Latin America only during the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis. We offered two or three or four hundred scholarships a year to all of Latin America, for young leaders to come and study in this country, less than 200 to all of Africa. Only 5 percent of all the people in our Foreign Service are now stationed in Africa. A year ago more were stationed in Western Germany than in all of Africa. And yet by 1962, Africa will have one-quarter of the votes of the General Assembly.', 'We are now the fourth country in the world in radio propaganda broadcasts; Moscow is 1, Peking 2, Cairo 3 - Radio Cairo Egypt 3 - the United States, 4. The question which you have to decide is whether the view of the world which I hold or the view of the world which Mr. Nixon holds is the one that you hold, that you believe the United States should hold. Do you believe we are meeting our responsibilities? Do you believe that we are sensitive to the changes that are taking place around us? I said last night in the debate we have less than 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament - 100 people on the most complicated, perhaps important and perhaps fruitful responsibility which the Government now faces. I believe we can do better, and I believe we must do better if we are going to maintain our own freedom and the freedom of all those around the world who want to be free. So I come to Marshall, not the biggest city in the world, but a city and town which must make the same decision that every other American must make, not merely between Mr. Nixon and I as personalities. The issue is, What is your view of our country? What is your view of the future? What is you view of our own? On that basis I ask your support. On that basis I believe the United States is going to choose on November 8 to march forward. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
272,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY: I have seen that face someplace, but I don't know exactly where [laughter]. I have seen that one, too. [Laughter.] In 1952. [Laughter.]"", 'Governor Williams, John Swainson, the next Governor of the State of Michigan [applause], my friend and colleague and valuable Senator in the United States Senate, Pat McNamara [applause], the candidate for Congress from this district [applause], ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my thanks to all of you, particularly those of you who are college students who can\'t vote, who came down here anyway. [Applause.] I recognize that the sacrifice is not extensive as I am doing the work this morning and you are not in class. [Laughter.] I am glad that you are participating actively in the political process. Artemus Ward 50 years ago said, ""I am not a politician and my other habits are good."" [Laughter.] I believe all of us recognize now in a free society that we are all politicians, in a sense we are all officeholders, in a sense we all bear part of the burden of maintaining free government. And this election of 1960, I believe, is one of the most significant elections of the 20th century, because we have candidates and political parties who divide sharply over the responsibility which the United States must bear, the burdens it must assume, the obligations it must meet in the next decade, if we are not only going to endure but prevail.', 'I hold the view that in these difficult and dangerous times it is the function of the opposition, if it is going to meet its responsibility as a party, to try to suggest alternative courses of action. I do not downgrade the United States. I have the greatest confidence in it. I have the greatest confidence that it can meet its responsibilities. But I do downgrade its present leadership. [Applause.] I do believe that this leadership and the leadership which is suggested by the Republicans for the future falls to take into account the sober problems which the United States faces at home and abroad. You come from the State of Michigan. Here in this State which is one of the great industrial complexes of the United States, you are going to see in the next 5 and 10 years the problem of maintaining full employment at a time of automation, at a time when we have increased our productive capacity more than our ability to consume, and to maintain full employment and prosperity in this State and country in the next decade will take far greater imagination, and far greater vigor, and a far greater sense of what is needed than this administration has shown. [Applause.]', 'If the United States is going to maintain its position of being a friend of freedom in Latin America, if we are going to be successful in this struggle which is now going on, not merely on the island of Cuba, but all over Latin America, we have to be identified, not merely in the fight against communism, but in the fight against poverty and disease, in the fight that those people are waging for a better life for themselves, and in my judgment the United States is not now in their minds identified with that fight.', 'If we lose that psychological struggle, if Castro or his counterparts in other countries of Latin America are able to suggest that we are indifferent, that we are rich, that we are prosperous, that we do not look at their problems, I believe the future of Latin America will be far different than it could be if we identify ourselves as Franklin Roosevelt did with their problems, with their opportunities and join with them. [Applause.]', 'Those of you who may be supporters of the opposition party [response from the audience] - supporters of Mr. Nixon and Mr. Lodge, you should take scant comfort in the fact and Mr. Nixon in the debate before the one last night referred to our votes in the United Nations as a source of strength and prestige, and the next day, the Saturday after the Friday on the question of the admission of Red China, two African nations voted on the same side as we did, Liberia, which after all we helped found, and the Union of South Africa, which is outside the compartment of the rest of Africa because of its policies toward its Negroes. The rest of Africa - Guinea, Ghana, all the rest - none voted with us. More countries in Asia voted against us than voted with us. How can you take satisfaction, as young Republicans, in the record of our country in the last 8 years in outer space? How can you take satisfaction in the fact that in 1959 the United States not only had a lower economic growth than the Soviet Union, but one-half of that of Western Germany, less than Italy, less than France, less than Japan? [Response from the audience.]', 'Percentage points? Economic growth, economic growth, finding jobs for people. There are 7 million Americans today, only 2 years after the recession of 1958, that are either unemployed or working 2 or 3 days a week. If you feel that that is a good record, if you feel that the United States has shown sufficient vision, sufficient foresight, sufficient recognition of the changing nature of our time, then you should stay with the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.] But if you believe that the United States has to demonstrate a whole new concept in our relations abroad, if we have to associate ourselves intimately with the problems of these people, if you are not satisfied to have the United States offer the Congo 300 scholarships last June and the year before 200 for all Africa - do you know how many of those Congolese students are here in the United States now as the result of those scholarships? Seven. If you think that is a good record, stick with Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.]', ""Well, I want to say to you five girls, I appreciate that. [Laughter.] In any case, Republican or Democrat, success or failure in November, this is a great country. I don't think there is a disagreement on that. The whole question really in this election is, What must the United States do what must the leadership set before the American people as the unfinished business, what responsibilities must we meet? What philosophy of government, what philosophy of our times, must motivate our President and our Congress? I hold with the Democratic Party on this occasion. I think this year we serve the national interest. I have bad news for you, gentlemen. I think we might even beat you in Michigan. [Response from the audience.] Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Lieutenant Governor and the next Governor of Michigan, John Swainson [applause], my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, Pat McNamara, the next U.S. Senator from Michigan [applause] Mennen Williams, ladies and gentlemen and here is Tom Payne, your next Congressman from this district. [Applause.]', 'This community is celebrated, as John Swainson said, as one of the two birthplaces of the Republican Party, and the reason, of course, was because when the Republican Party was founded on this occasion, it served a great national purpose. It is the function of politicians and of political parties to serve a national purpose. Grover Cleveland once said - Grover Cleveland once said what good is a politician unless he stands for something. And I say what good is a political party unless it stands for something. [Applause.] The question which the people of this community and the people of the State of Michigan and the people of the United States must decide is which political party in 1960 serves a great national purpose.', ""Mr. Nixon has said that party labels don't mean very much, what counts is the man. I believe what counts is the man the party nominates, what counts are the things for which the party stands, and I believe in 1960, as in 1860 in this community, the Republican Party stood for something. I believe in 1960 in the community the Democratic Party stands for something. [Applause.]"", 'I believe we stand for a great national purpose. I believe that we stand for rebuilding the United States, for developing our economy, for moving ahead here at home, and building our strength around the world. We look to the future in the same way as in other days and in other years Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson looked to the future.', 'I run against a candidate, Mr. Nixon, who runs on the slogan ""You never had it so good."" I want him to run on that slogan in the State of Michigan. I want him to run on that slogan in this community. I want him to run on that slogan all over the State. The State of Michigan has not recovered from the recession of 1958. Over 7 percent of its people are out of work. And now at this hme,in October, when the auto industry is at its height, what is going to happen in January, February, March? What is the winter of 1961 going to be like here in this State, and here in the United States? As long as in the fall of 1960 we are using only 50 percent of our steel capacity, as long as 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls never go to college, as long as there are things which are left to be done, I think it is the function of the Democratic Party to complete the unfinished business of this society, to get our country moving again, to provide jobs for our people.', 'In the next 10 years we are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years. Which political party do you think could do that better, which political party has stood for full employment? [Response from the audience.] We are going to have to build from 200,000 to 300,000 more homes every year than we are now building. Which party do you think stands for that? [Response from the audience. We are going to have to make it possible for every boy and girl who is qualified to go to college, who has talent, to go to college. Which party has stood for that issue in the past and in the future. [Response from the audience.]', 'We are going to have to have to make it possible for every American, regardless of his race or his religion, or the color of his skin, to realize his talents, and we stand for that.', ""So I come to this community which 100 years ago, 104 years ago saw the birth of a great party, and I come in 1960 to that same community and say that on this occasion, in this year, in these dangerous times, we in the Democratic Party serve the national interest and the national purpose. I come here and ask your support, not merely to build this State of Michigan, not merely to strengthen this community, but to strengthen the United States, to move it forward, to have it stand once again as an inspiration to all those who wish to be free. And I do that shoulder to shoulder with Tom Payne, Pat McNamara, John Swainson, and all those who believe that the years of the 1960's can be the brightest in our history. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
274,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Are there any questions? We may have a couple before we pull out.', '(Question from the audience.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is ""What about inflation?""', 'In the last 8 years we have had in the cost of industrial goods nearly a 30-percent rise. Of course, farm income dropped during that same period. The overall increase in the cost of living has been only about 22 percent. For medical care it has been 35 percent, for rent 30 percent, for the general costs, particularly in the heavy industries, it has gone up more than 30 percent. This is a serious problem, not only to our own people who are adversely affected by a steady increase in their cost of living, but it is also a serious problem in our attempts to compete in other markets, in automobiles, in steel, in heavy construction. We have to try to provide a full economy. If we are only using 50 percent of our capacity in steel, if other capacity which we now have is being unused then it is difficult to have sufficient competition in our system to maintain price stability. I believe it must be the responsibility of the next President of the United States and the next administration, by monetary and fiscal policy, by a recognition by both labor and management, that they have a stake in maintaining the soundness of the dollar. I believe it is important that we maintain full use of our economy, but that we also concentrate our attention in making sure that any increases are not derived because of deterioration in the value of the dollar.', '(Question from the audience.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is whether we will defend Quemoy and Matsu, if it is part of an attack on the island of Formosa.', 'In my judgment, if the attack on Quemoy and Matsu is part of an attack on the Pescadores and Formosa, then in my opinion the entire area will become an area of war, unfortunately. The problem really is should the line be drawn at the islands themselves, should the line be drawn as the treaty now draws it and as the administration, at the Pescadores. If the action which takes place on the other side of the line is part of a general attack on the Formosa-Pescadores area, then not only those islands, but also the entire area would become an area of military action and I sustain that.', '(Question from the audience.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. I think the question of what weapons ought to be used ought to await the kind of attack and all the rest of it.', '(Question from the audience.)', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is ""What should I tell my parents who don\'t want to vote for you because of"" - because of my religion.', 'Well, I would ask them first to study what I have stated on the matter, to study what I have said in regard to separation of church and state, to realize that I have served in the Congress for 14 years, that I vote to sustain the Constitution, and then I would tell them to read the U.S. Constitution, which says there shall be no religious test for office. [Applause.]']"
275,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Senator MeNamara, Governor Williams, Congressman-to-be O'Rourke, Governor-to-be Swainson, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I first of all want to express my appreciation at the courtesy of the Governor of this State, my friend and colleague, Mennen Williams, with whom I have worked closely in recent months in building a stronger and more responsible Democratic Party. [Applause.]"", 'I believe that the record that he has made in this State will last, and I think the things for which he has fought in Michigan, better education, fair equality for Americans, regardless of their race or their color, the movement forward of the State of Michigan - I think those things will last and so will his reputation, as a distinguished public servant. I am delighted to salute him on the occasion of visiting his State Capitol - Governor Williams. [Applause.]', 'And I am delighted to tour the State of Michigan with my colleague in the U.S. Senate Senator McNamara. Senator McNamara has been chairman of the Committee on Aging of the Senate. There are 17 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $78 a month. Many of them live, at least 9 million of them live, on less than $1,000 a year, and until Senator McNamara began to turn the spotlight of public attention on this problem, they were forgotten. I salute him for a job well done, a job still unfinished. [Applause.] And this job will not be finished until we provide medical care for the aged under social security.', 'Finally, let me say that I am glad to be here with a young and progressive figure from the State of Michigan, who I believe will succeed Mennen Williams as a great Governor, who will lead Michigan forward - John Swainson. [Applause.]', ""And lastly I want to pay tribute to what I hope will be the Congressman from this district, Congressman-to-be O'Rourke. [Applause.] I knew him when I was a member of the Rackets Committee and he was carrying out courageous actions against those who lived off the reputation of labor and management. He is a young man of courage and even though this ticket may be overbalanced with some Irish names, O'Rourke, Kennedy, and McNamara, nevertheless, I hope you will support him. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'The State of Michigan has many problems and so does the United States, but most of the problems a Michigan has are the same problems that our country has. If someone in this country of ours finds their income drop in Connecticut, and they decide that they will not buy a new car this year, you feel it in Lansing, and you feel it all over the State of Michigan. If our steel industry produces at 50 percent of capacity, you feel it here in Michigan. If we build 200,000 less homes a year than we should, which we are now doing, you feel it here in Michigan. Michigan is a great industrial State, and it is sensitive to the rises and falls of the American economy. Michigan, itself, can only move forward - you can provide employment for the 180,000 of the citizens of this State who are now out of work only if the economy of the United States is on the rise. Fifty percent of our capacity in steel is unused. One-third of our steel-workers are part time or out of work. Seven percent of the labor force of Michigan is unemployed. Michigan in a very real sense and the United States never fully recovered from the recessions of 1958. Unless this country is able to stimulate the economy of the United States to move ahead 4 percent or 5 percent a year, we are not going to find jobs for all the young men and women of this State who get out of high school and college next year.', 'Where are they going to find work in Michigan or in the United States if there are 4 million people unemployed and 3 million employed part time? We have to do better than that. We have to do better than that, not only because we should adopt the national goal of full employment, but also if the U.S. economy drags, we are not able to maintain our strength as a nation, and if we do not maintain our strength as a nation, all those who look to us with confidence and hope for leadership turn in another direction. The place to start is here in the United States. The place to build our prestige in the world is here in the United States. The place to build strength for freedom is here in the United States. If we are on the upward move, if the wave of our vitality and energy as a nation is coming in, if we are providing employment for our people, if we are consuming all that we produce, if we are able to provide a better distribution of the great wealth of this country than we have in the past, then the United States is strong, and when the United States is strong, the world is strong, the chance of freedom is strong, the U.S. influence is strong, our prestige is greater. [Applause.]', 'I do not suggest in any way that the problem ot maintaining full employment, the problem of solving automation, the problem of stimulating our housing industry, the problem of increasing educational opportunities, the problem of caring for our aged, the problem of balancing supply and demand in agriculture, the problem of maintaining our military strength, the problem of disarming, if we can disarm, under safe conditions - I do not suggest that there are easy answers to the most difficult and complicated problems that this country has ever faced. The only question is, Has this administration, and has Mr. Nixon, my opponent, and has the Republican Party not only indicated the problems but has it attacked them with vigor in recent years? [Response from the audience.]', ""That is the decision which you must make. Have we done what needs to be done? Do you feel as an American that this country is meeting its responsibilities at home and abroad in full measure? Do you feel we can do better? Do you feel we must do better? It is upon your judgment of that great question that the decision of November 8, 1960, will be made. I believe an election time serves more than to have candidates make speeches. I hope it is a chance, as it has been in our history, for the United States to make a determination as to what it wants to be and what it must do. It was true in 1932, it was true in 1912. I think in 1960 that the people of this country are coming to a conclusion that if this State and country are going to maintain their freedom, if we are going to occupy a position of leadership in the world, then we have to move again. I believe that will be the result of the election of 1960, which, in many ways, will transcend the results of any party's success. I believe in part as a result of this campaign, in part by the force of events and the pressure of history, that the United States in the 1960's will fulfill its destiny as the leader of the free world. This country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Those of you who live in this State, those of you who are citizens of the United States, know that this is a most important election in a most important time in the life of our country. There are 180,000 citizens of this State who are out of work, who want to find a job. But it is not just in Michigan. It is in West Virginia and Kentucky and Massachusetts and Pennsylvania and southern Illinois and southern Ohio, and the reason is that because the United States has a tremendous capacity to produce goods, but it is not able to consume at a decent price all that we are able to put into the market.', 'The result has been that in 1954 and in 1958, and now in 1960, our economy has stood still. There are going to have to be found in the next 10 years 25,000 new jobs every week for the next 10 years, if everybody searching for a job is going to find one. Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. Here in Michigan, here in the United States, in the next 10 years, we are going to have to build more college dormitory and classrooms than we have built all the rest of the time in the history of this country put together, so great is the increase in our population, so great is the increase in the number of boys and girls who will be going to college. And some should go to college who really have not had a chance to go.', 'So great are the problems facing the United States, so great is the dependence of people all over the globe upon us, that I believe nothing less than our best would be good enough. I come as the standard bearer of the oldest political party in the history of the world. I come at a difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country, and I say that while this is a great country, I believe it must be a greater country, and while it is a powerful country, I believe it must be more powerful. Every American who seeks a job should have an opportunity to find one.', 'I spent a month in West Virginia running in the primary. There are 100,000 families in West Virginia who live on surplus food packages from the Government which average for a family of four in the United States, not 500 miles from this State, $6.50 per month per family of four, which comes to 5 cents a day, per individual.', '(Response from the audience.)', ""You can boo it, but don't eat it. [Applause.] Let me say that you can't possibly dispose of problems, of need, of unemployment, of Americans who are experiencing difficulty, by booing. You have to do something about it. That is what this election is all about. The decision is not mine alone. You can decide what you want to do. The decision is yours. Boos, shouts, screams, applause on November 8 you have to make a judgment as to what kind of a country you want, whether you feel what we are doing now is good enough, whether you feel that the prestige and power of the United States in the world is rising fast enough, whether you are satisfied to see the United States - and Cuba, 90 miles from the shores of the United States, dominated by a Communist satellite, whether you are satisfied to see two countries of Africa independent in the last 2 years now supporting the Communist Party, whether you are satisfied to see Laos, upon whom the future of all Indochina may rest, now slipping, tonight, not a year ago, tonight, and the next few days, maybe slipping beyond the Iron Curtain."", 'These are not matters that any American in 1960 can boo about. They can think about them. They can decide what they want to do. They can decide if what we are doing now is good enough. I think it is not. I think the United States, if it is going to maintain its independence, if it is going to maintain the independence of those who look to us, I don\'t want to see the United States - or historians say that in 1960 we stood still, that we accepted a second position, that we did not meet our responsibilities as free citizens, that we did not make a careful judgment in this election. Of what the two alternatives are, and let me make them clear, they are between a party which runs on a slogan ""You never had it so good"" and a party which I represent which runs on the slogan we must do better. [Applause.] And it is on that basis, after serving this country for 18 years, that I come to this community, rain, shine, day or night, and ask your support. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
277,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['In 1936, speaking before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, Franklin Roosevelt accepted the second Presidential nomination, and in that speech he said,', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'For the past 8 years this Nation has been subjected to the leadership of a party frozen in the ice of its own indifference. And nothing more clearly demonstrates the extent and depth and scope of that indifference than a statement which Mr. Nixon made this June to Republican businessmen in Hot Springs, Va.', '\n  Unless unemployment goes over 4.5 million it cannot become a significant issue in the minds of a great many people * * * there must be some unemployment.\n', 'I do not agree - and the Democratic Party has never agreed.', 'Unemployment is not inisignificant to the almost 4 million Americans who want to work, but who can\'t find work - almost a quarter of a million of them in Michigan alone - or to the almost 900,000 Americans who have been out of work for more than 15 weeks and who are now classified as ""long-term unemployed.""', 'Unemployment is not insignificant to the families of the unemployed - families who are forced to live in substandard homes and are unable to maintain even a subsistence of living in the richest country on earth.', 'Unemployment is not insignificant to the children of the unemployed who are deprived of decent clothing and a decent diet.', 'Unemployment is not insignificant to an America which desperately needs the skills and labor of all its citizens if it is to rebuild the strength which alone can maintain the cause of peace and freedom in a perilous and changing world.', 'And unemployment is not insignificant to the Democratic Party - which has always pursued a policy of full employment - which has never said that there ""must be some unemployment"" and which is going to see that there are jobs for all Americans in the sixties.', 'In fact, unemployment is only insignificant to Mr. Nixon and a Republican Party which has opposed every Democratic effort to put men back to work in the past 8 years - which has complacently stood by while unemployment rose from less than 2 million in 1952 to 4 million today and while Michigan lost more than 100,000 jobs despite an expanding population. For I believe that the American people are going to reject a party which - again in Mr. Nixon\'s words - believes that ""unemployment is inevitable,"" a party which lacks faith in the capacity of a strong and growing America to provide jobs for all its people, a party which, in the most fundamental sense, is letting America run down because it is failing to build America up, a party whose candidate is all too ready to threaten war but is unwilling to build up the strength which is the only guarantee of peace, who is always willing to speak loudly, but is unwilling to be sure that America carries a big stick.', 'The Republican slowdown of the American economy is reflected in the record of the past 30 years. Mr. Nixon has carefully selected facts and figures, he has carefully chosen years of comparison - the few years favorable to the Republicans - in an effort to show that Americans have done better than ever under the Republican Party.', 'But the harsh fact of the matter is that almost every index of has decreased in the past 8 years - every index of productivity has fallen back. Our entire economy has slowed down. And we can see the Republican failures not by looking at part of the record - not by looking at some years and not at others - but by looking at the whole record of performance of both parties.', 'Under the Democrats, from 1933-52, the average annual increase in personal income was 10 percent. Under the Republicans it has been less than 5 percent.', 'Under the Democrats, the average annual increase in industrial productivity was more than 10 percent. Under the Republicans, it has been 2.7 percent.', 'Under the Democrats, the average annual increase in farm income was 13.8 percent. Under the Republicans, annual farm income has decreased 1.4 percent.', 'Under the Democrats, our economy grew at a rate of 5.8 percent a year. Under the Republicans, it has slowed down to 2.4 percent.', 'In fact, under the Republicans, the only figures which have mounted are those which show an increase in interest income figures which banks receive from those who must borrow money - and those which show an increase in the cost of living. These are complete figures. They tell the whole story. They are not distorted. But neither are they essential to a comparison of the performance of our two parties. For every man and woman in this audience - every man and woman in America - who has lived through the past 30 years - who remembers this country in 1930 - who remembers that Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Party did help them receive better incomes, live in better homes, and maintain a higher standard of living - in the lives and welfare of those people is clearly written the story of the leadership of the Democratic Party and its capacity and determination to meet the needs of the American people.', 'Last night, in our debate, Mr. Nixon was asked to give his program for economic growth - what he intended to do to put idle plants and idle men back to work - to move America toward new heights of production and strength - to provide new jobs for an expanding population. But Mr. Nixon had no new program, no new approach; just the same old tired policies which have resulted in a doubling of unemployment and in a slowing down of our growth until, today, we are growing more slowly than every other industrial nation in the world - policies which have resulted in a steel industry operating at only 50 percent of capacity - an automobile industry which has laid off thousands of men - and a State of Michigan where more than 200,000 men are unemployed and which has never emerged from the Republican recession of 1958.', 'But the Democratic Party does have a program - a program which will reverse the downward trend of the past 8 years - which will put men back to work and move America toward new heights of productivity and abundance - which will build the stronger America on which the cause of freedom depends.', 'First, we must help our economy generate the funds for investment - the supply of money - which is vital to business growth and expansion. If the industry and small business of Michigan cannot get the money it needs in order to survive and expand, then Michigan will not have new jobs for your unemployed and for your constantly expanding labor force. And what is true for Michigan is true for America. Yet in the past 8 years the Republican Party has intervened in the normal operation of our economy in order to maintain artificially high interest rates, drying up the supply of money and stifling investment. By reversing these disastrous policies we will once again channel our wealth into investment in a growing America.', 'Second, we must once again use fiscal policies - the management of our national budget - to stimulate growth and halt the constant rise in our cost of living. For example, by maintaining a budget surplus in times of prosperity we can keep prices down without discouraging investment, thus using the Federal budget as an instrument to create jobs and protect the incomes of our workers.', 'Third, we must develop our great natural resources - material resources and resources of the mind - to provide a sound basis for a growing economy. In the past 8 years those resources have been neglected. Mr. Nixon has followed a policy of ""no new starts"" for our natural resources and ""no help for new schools"" or for underpaid teachers. As a result, our economy has faltered. For industry cannot hope to expand without power to drive its factories, roads to transport its goods, water to supply its plants, and increased skills and knowledge to deal with the growing complexities of modern production and supply the flow of new ideas and inventive talent which has been the source of our past greatness.', 'Only governments - the combined efforts of Federal, State, and local governments - can build the dams and highways and schools on which the strength of our free enterprise economy depends.', 'Fourth, we must move to meet the growing crisis of automation - the replacement of men by machines - which has already thrown thousands of men out of work here in Michigan and which threatens the jobs of millions of men throughout the country. In the past 8 years nothing has been done to harness automation to serve the welfare of all our people, rather than permitting it to become an instrument of economic distress and unemployment. In 1961, a Democratic President will call a conference of leaders of industry and labor to formulate new programs for dealing with the problems of automation. At the same time we must begin to retrain displaced workers, to provide employment opportunities by broadening the activities of the U.S. Employment Service, and providing technical assistance to help businesses which are trying to modernize without throwing men out.', 'Fifth, we must use the full moral and legal authority of the Federal Government to make sure that no American is denied a job because of his race or religion. If America is to grow and prosper it needs the talents and skills of all its citizens and talent and skill knows no barrier of race or creed. Michigan has pioneered in this effort, and now our Federal Government must also work to insure that all Americans have equal access to job opportunities. For I believe that we must act to eliminate discrimination in employment if a growing America is to serve as a living example of freedom to all the world.', 'Sixth, we must formulate special programs to those areas of our country which are suffering from severe economic distress and chronic unemployment. Today, the country has 126 areas of substantial labor surplus - areas like Bay City, Flint, and the Iron Range - areas of declining industry - where there is poverty and hunger - where men have been searching for work, but cannot find work.', 'Unemployment in any of these areas harms the entire Nation, depriving all our industry of markets, decreasing total purchasing power, and depriving us of needed production. The distress may be regional ,but the problem is a national problem.', 'Twice a Democratic Congress has passed legislation to provide the long-term development loans and technical assistance which can put our distressed areas back on their feet and put men back to work; loans and assistance which will help the underdeve]oped areas of America just as we are trying to help the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa and Latin America. And twice these bills have been vetoed by the Republicans. In 1961, this legislation will become law, along with an effective trade adjustment program to help areas suffering under the impact of increased foreign imports.', 'Seventh, we must establish a committee on national economic goals, a committee composed of leaders of industry and labor as well as the best economic talent of our universities and research institutes. This committee will assess our potential productive capacity and the needs of our Nation and help the President to formulate the broad goals of our free economy.', ""With the advice of such a broadly based group, the President will be able to set our Nation's unfinished business before the Nation, the President will be able to set our Nation's unfinished business before the Nation, not to direct our economy, but to help and encourage our people to direct their untapped capacities and the untapped capacities of our free enterprise system in a great national effort to revitalize our strength and bring employment to all Americans."", 'In the past, America has met its responsibilities to its own people and to world freedom. For we are, by tradition and capacity, a vital and growing nation. But in the past 8 years the hand of timidity and retreat, of little faith and little vision, has reached out and intervened in our economy to halt our long historic march toward a greater and stronger America. America cannot afford such intervention by its governments. We do not lack faith; we do not believe in intervention which stifles and retards. Rather we seek to liberate our economy and our people, to free them to do what they want to do and what they have the strength to do. If we can succeed in this then the horizons of the future are limitless.']"
278,John F. Kennedy ,"October 14, 1960","['A nation which seeks to lead the world must put its own house in order. We have fallen seriously behind in two areas of our national life - in the education of our young people and the medical care of our old people.', ""Under Governor Williams leadership, you here in Michigan have moved promptly to take advantage of the meager benefits for the elderly under new Federal legislation. But the Federal program is wholly inadequate - in Michigan it will cover only 60,000 new people, only one-seventh of the number that would have been covered under the Democratic bill that tied medical care to social security without a pauper's oath."", 'Here in Michigan you have led the Nation in your educational programs. But you are still short an estimated 10,000 classrooms and 7,000 fully certified teachers. And every year tens of thousands of new children are entering your public schools. But Republican obstructionism in Congress has denied help to our communities - and practically the whole burden must be borne by a property tax that is already overburdened.', ""Ten years ago we in the United States graduated 52,000 engineers from our universities while the Russians graduated 28,000. Last year they graduated 106,000, more than twice as many as our 47,000. Ten years ago Russians were already spreading their new colonialism throughout Asia and Africa and working hand in glove with the Red Chinese. To this day few American universities teach the Chinese language and the African tongues that soon will fall every day on Western ears. But we must improve our education, not only to compete with the Russians but for the sake of education itself. We must teach not only engineering but the humanities, for in our world, engineering skill has outrun philosophical wisdom and moral judgment and human understanding. We must encourage that free spirit of inquiry which alone produces new ideas - the bold new thinking that we need in our brave new world. We must cultivate brainpower as well as airpower. Above all, we must improve our educational system for the sake of our children. For if one child's mind is not improved, is not cultivated to the utmost, we have wasted our most precious national resource."", 'I am concerned, and deeply concerned, because too many children are attending double-shift schools, too many children are not given the incentive to finish high school, too few teachers are at work in our school systems, and too many teachers are underpaid. Too many mothers spend their days chauffeuring back and forth their children who have to go to school in shifts.', 'My opponent says now he, too, is concerned. But what did he say before this election campaign began? Speaking for the Republican administration, he said, on February 15, 1960:', '\n  We believe that the Federal Government should limit its aid in the case of education to construction * * * if the approach of the Congress * * * is one which provides direct subsidies to teachers, there will be no aid to education this year.\n', ""And how did he vote? In February he refused to vote to break a tie in the Senate on an amendment which would have authorized $25 per school-age child or $1.1 billion per year for school construction and teachers' salaries. And then he voted to table a motion to reconsider the measure."", 'Mr. Nixon pretends he opposes Federal funds for teachers\' salaries because he fears ""Government control"" over education. I say this is an artificial, irrelevant, unjustified, false issue.', 'The U.S. Office of Education is already spending hundreds of millions to aid local education - $33 million for vocational education, $2 1/2 million for land-grant colleges, $63 million for construction, and $187 million for maintenance and operation of schools in federally affected areas - and the Federal Government has not sought to impose any unreasonable controls.', 'Moreover, Federal aid to education is nothing new. Throughout our history, the Federal Government has helped to finance educational systems at times when local resources were unequal to the task. The land ordinance of 1785 provided that the 16th section of each township of public lands should be granted to the States for the benefit of common schools. No so-called Federal controls resulted.', 'The Morrill Act of 1862 gave to the States public lands to aid in establishing agricultural colleges. As a result, agricultural colleges have been established in every State - and no so-called Federal controls resulted.', ""Through the years special land grants have been given by the Federal Government to endow normal schools, schools of mines, military institutes, reform schools, and girls' colleges - the total acreage granted by the Federal Government for educational purposes is 118 million acres of public lands, an area four times the size of New York State - and no so-called Federal controls have resulted."", 'Your own great University of Michigan, the first of the Western State universities, was rechartered by the State in 1837 and endowed with proceeds from the educational land reserves - and no so-called Federal controls resulted.', ""Today, if safeguards are needed, they are simple to erect. The Congress can appropriate funds to be distributed to local school boards and used by those boards to construct more classrooms or pay teachers' salaries, according to their own local needs and at their own local discretion. And if further assurances are deemed desirable, the Congress can specifically declare that the Federal Government shall exercise no control over textbook content, curriculum, teacher selection and tenure, and the like; it can renounce Federal authority in such matters and place authority in the hands of local boards."", 'This is a simple matter, and Mr. Nixon knows it.', 'The Republican leaders have always opposed progress in such areas. In 1935 they fought social security every step of the way. They pretended to believe social security would ""Sovietize"" America. But the truth was that they were against social security. Today they pretend to believe that aid to education will result in ""Federal controls"" and that medical care for the aged must be ""voluntary"" and under State control. But the truth is that they are simply against progress.']"
279,John F. Kennedy ,"October 15, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor, my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, Joe Clark, and your able and distinguished Congressman from this district, Congressman Frank Clark, whom I know you are going to reelect [applause], when I came to Washington to the U.S. Senate at first in January, 1953, I brought down a number of young ladies from Boston, Mass - when I came down in January 1953, I brought a number of young ladies from Massachusetts to be secretaries. They all got married. One of them married a young man from this town. I would like to have you meet my former secretary, Jean McGonigle, now Mrs. Lannox of this community. [Applause.]', 'Then I got a whole new set of girls and they got married. So if many of you girls feel the prospects are limited to this community, come to Washington and work for Senator Clark and myself.', ""Then I got married and then the whole office - we don't just tend to business down in Washington. I want you to understand that. [Laughter.] I am delighted to come here this morning and to carry our Democratic campaign to this community. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. Nixon is out in Los Angeles, Mr. Lodge is in Pittsburgh. Mr. Lodge made a speech one day in the North pledging a Negro in the Cabinet and the next day he said he had no right to make any pledges when he was down south. Mr. Nixon sent Senator Goldwater down south to talk about civil rights and say he does not mean anything by it, and then he sent Senator Scott to the North to assure the Negroes he is with them all the way.', 'The Democratic Party stands for one program and one platform, North and South, East and West. [Applause.] I think Senator Scott, who has been traveling around the United States as a member of the truth squad of the Republican Party, should come home to Pennsylvania and look after his people and worry about the truth in this State.. Five hundred thousand people in the State of Pennsylvania get food packages from the Federal Government. Do you know what those packages consist of? Dried eggs, some rice, some cornmeal, for a family of four people in this rich country, $6.25 a month, 5 cents a day per person, half a million people in the State of Pennsylvania. And the administration, Mr. Nixon, runs on a slogan of ""You never had it so good.""', 'I want him to run on that slogan in Pennsylvania. I want him to tell the people in this area, where there is over 9 percent of the people out of work, a quarter of them for more than 15 weeks, I want him to come on that slogan of peace and prosperity. [Applause.]', 'People of Pennsylvania and people of the country are not interested in deathbed conversion, election time commitments. They want a candidate and a party who stand on the issues day in and day out, year in and year out, as your Congressman does, your Senator does, and your Governor does. There is not an old Governor Lawrence and a new one, like there is an old and a new Mr. Nixon. There is a Democrat who stands for the Democratic Party and the things for which the Democratic Party stands. [Applause.]', 'The Democratic Party\'s candidates in this century never ran on slogans like ""Stand Pat With McKinley,\' ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge,"" and ""Two Chickens in Every Pot With Hoover."" [Laughter.] I don\'t know what Dewey\'s slogan was because he never worked it out. [Laughter.] We know what Truman\'s slogan is. But there are children in the audience, as the Vice President would say. [Laughter.] Our slogans have meaning. Woodrow Wilson\'s New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt\'s New Deal, Harry Truman\'s Fair Deal, and today, we stand on the threshold of a New Frontier, for all Americans. [Applause.]', 'We commit ourselves to a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour. We commit ourselves to medical care for the aged tied to social security, which has worked for 25 years. [Applause.] We commit ourselves to a fight against the problems as suggested by automation. I spent a month running in the primary in West Virginia. You have seen it in Pennsylvania, a machine comes in, it takes the job of 10 men. What happens to those 10 men? Where do they go to work? They may be 45, they may be 50. They may have worked in a steel mill or in a coal mine. Where do they get a job in the United States when there are more than 4 1/2 million people out of work? Too young to retire, too young to die, too old to work, and this administration has never discussed the problem of automation. I believe the President of the United States in January 1961 should recognize this as a national problem and in every basic industry set up committees of labor, management, and the Government. [Applause.]', 'I do not suggest these problems are new. Those of you who work in this area know the steel industry. We are going 50 percent of capacity, and yet we are producing almost as much steel as we did 6 years ago. So great has our capacity increased, and yet we are employing less people than we did 5 years ago.', 'What is happening in coal, steel, paper, pottery, printing - name it. It is going to happen in every industry across the United States in the next 10 years. Machines are coming in. I visited factories in recent weeks where three or four men - a tremendous factory over an acre, all machines. This is a problem which is going to face this rich country of ours. It is the kind of problem which is new, different. It is the kind of problem that is difficult of solution, but it is the kind of problem that the Republicans never think about. They have never concerned themselves in the last 25 years with the problems of employment, of social security, of housing, of minimum wage, of social justice, of equality of treatment, of aid to education, of a stronger better America, to which we are committed.', ""So I come here to Pennsylvania a State which has not gone Democratic in a presidential election for 20 years, and I come here and ask your belp in this campaign. [Applause.] The U.S. Senate is going to be Democratic. If we lost every Senate seat this year the Democrats would still control the Senate. It would take the greatest landslide since 1952 for the House to be Republican. So you are going to have the Senate Democratic and the House Democratic, and people are thinking of electing a Republican who stands in opposition to everything that the majority of the Democrats in the House and Senate stand for. And divide our country between the executive - the President and the Congress for 4 years, the most difficult years in our history. If there was ever a formula for inaction, for standing still, for those Americans who don't want anything done, that is the solution. But for those Americans who recognize that this is the most dangerous time in the life of our country, that we must build our strength here, that we must develop our resources, that we must begin to move off dead center, then I ask you to join us in moving this country ahead, in giving this country new leadership. [Applause.]"", 'During the American Constitutional Convention there was behind the desk of General Washington, a painting of a sun, low on the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising sun or a setting sun. And at the conclusion, Benjamin Franklin, of Pennsylvania, stood up. ""We now know that because of what we have done here today it is a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I think in 1960, if we choose progress, it can be a rising sun for this country and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
280,John F. Kennedy ,"October 15, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Frank Clark, who has served this district well and also served the United States; Senator Joseph Clark, my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate; your distinguished Governor, Gov. David Lawrence, members of the Pirates baseball team [laughter], ladies and gentlemen, the Pirates have the biggest squad in the United States, about 10 million people. [Laughter.]', 'I come here today as the Democratic candidate - can you hear? Can you hear the word ""Democratic"" out there? [Response from the audience.] Then we are all tuned in. I shouldn\'t really make a Democratic speech outside of that wonderful hotel. [Laughter.]', ""I run as the Democratic candidate and I know that it seems to me that in this election all of us as Americans face two different sets of opportunities and two different sets of problems. One, I believe, is the responsibility of all of us, those of us who serve in the Congress, those of us who may serve in the Presidency or in the executive branch, to bring up to date, to make modern, those programs which have been part of our political life, part of our national life, for 20 or 25 or 30 years. In other words, to pass a minimum wage bill which brings wages up to date. The first minimum wage bill in 1935 was 25 cents an hour. So you cannot say that everything that had to be done was done in the Roosevelt administration or in the Truman administration or in the Eisenhower administration. Every administration and every 3 or 4 years, this country has to recognize that we must move ahead. So there is one set of opportunities which will be open to the next President and the next Congress, minimum wage of $1.25 an hour, medical care for the aged tied to social security, aid to education, stimulation of housing, urban renewal. These are all programs which have been part of our life for a great many years, really since Franklin Roosevelt's first administration. But there are a second set of opportunities and a second set of problems which are entirely new, which are new to our time, which were never thought of in the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, or President Eisenhower, and it is to these problems that I think we should devote particular attention now."", 'One is the problem of automation. It is going to be a problem for every citizen of the country, as it has been a problem for every citizen of Pennsylvania.', ""Pennsylvania relies on two industries basically: coal mining and steelmaking. Both of these industries have experienced automation, and it is the reason that there is unemployment of 9 percent in this general area of these counties in western Pennsylvania, 9 percent. You have not really recovered in a very real way in the State of Pennsylvania from the recession of 1958. Your steel mills in this State are working at 50 percent of capacity, and yet they produce almost as much steel as they did in 1952 and 1951. The reason is automation. And what is true of steel is true of coal. There are literally a half million people, 750,000, in the State of Pennsylvania that get food packages from the Government every month. They amount to 5 cents a day per person to keep them alive, and many of them are people who worked in the coal mines. Those coal mines are mining more coal than they ever mined before in history. But they don't need the people because 1 machine has taken the job of 10 men."", 'So I would say of the new problems which were not problems years ago, but which are going to be problems in the sixties, I would say one is automation. The second problem is economic growth, which we talk about so much but which means whether your children are going to get jobs. We have to get 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years in order to have full employment in the United States, and we do that at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men.', 'Therefore, my criticism of this administration in this area has been that for the last 8 years we have moved ahead each year, growing at about 2.5 percent each year. The Soviet Union grows at about 7.5 percent each year. Western Germany grows at about 5 to 6 percent a year. Italy grows from 4 to 5 percent a year. France about 4 percent a year. We had the lowest rate of economic growth last year, 1959, not a depression year, of any major industrialized society in the world. And unless we move ahead, unless we can stimulate our economic growth, there are not going to be jobs. There are going to be more and more machines and fewer and fewer jobs. That is why I believe that this is an entirely new time that is coming out in 1961, 1962, 1963. The problems are entirely changing.', 'The old slogans, the old battles still have to be fought but the problems in many ways are going to be new. The third problem, of course is the kind of image which we present abroard. I criticized this administration as a citizen and as the standard bearer of the opposition party, because I believe in the last few years the United States has ceased to present an image of an advancing and vigorous society to a watching world. You know for the last 8 years we have not had in the Voice of America a single Spanish-speaking program to all of Latin America, for the last 8 years. Do you know we brought more foreign students to study here 10 years ago, by the U.S. Government, than study here today.', 'At the time of the Congo crisis in June, in the whole of the Congo there were only 12 college graduates and 7 or 8 million people. We offered them 300 scholarships. That is more scholarships than we offered to all of Africa the year before.', ""Do you know that with the Voice of America, our radio broadcasts, we are fourth in the world now? Moscow is ahead of us, China, Peiping is ahead of us, Radio Cairo in Egypt - more broadcasts come from Radio Cairo than from the Voice of America. We had in 1959 last year - in 1957, we had more of our foreign service personnel stationed in Western Germany than in all of Africa. We did not even have a Bureau of African Affairs until 1957, and Africa contains one-fourth of all the votes in the General Assembly now. So I don't believe that this administration and our country has recognized its responsibilities that the world is changing as fast as it is."", 'Mr. Castro is only a symptom. He is not a freak. He is the kind of problem we are going to face in country after country in the next 10 years. Ghana and Guinea in Africa, newly independent 2 years ago, both vote with the Soviet Union in the United Nations.', ""It isn't going to be just Guinea and Ghana and Cuba, but we are going to meet that problem in every country in the world in the future. Unless young leaders in those countries feel that we are on the move, that the future belongs to the free world, that the Communist system which is as old as Egypt is finally going to collapse. If they feel that they are moving, that they have the solutions to the future, and we are standing still, then they would decide that there is the direction they ought to go and not with us."", 'Let me make it clear. I think this is a great country. I have served it for 14 years in the Congress and in the service 4 years before that. But I believe that if we are going to maintain our strength, if we are going to maintain not only our freedom but the freedom of all those who look to us, we are going to have to do better, and that is the issue of this campaign. [Applause.]', 'And it is serious. Those of you who are Republicans, those of you who are Democrats, and those of you who are independent should understand this is not a personal controversy between Mr. Nixon and myself. We represent two political views of the direction our country should take, two different views of the needs of our time. You have to decide as voters which is your view, with which philosophy do you wish to be associated, which comes closest to meeting your decisions as to what your needs are. Those who run for office on the slogans that we never had it so good, who say our prestige has never been higher, who say that our strength is growing, who say that the balance of power is moving with us, if you decide that then you should vote for Mr. Nixon. But if you take the view which I take, and I take it as a dedicated citizen of this country, that the balance of power is not shifting in our direction, that our economy is not growing as fast as it must, that we are not catching the imagination of the people around the world, that we do not give the appearance of a society on the move, then I ask your help in this campaign. That is the issue. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
281,John F. Kennedy ,"October 15, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator-to-be, I hope, Donald Oesterling, William Patten, who I hope is going to be elected the Congressman from this district, Wade Reeser, Lewis Poundstone, candidate for the State legislature, my colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator Clark, your distinguished Governor, David Lawrence, ladies and gentlemen, I understand that there are a few Republicans who live in this community. [Laughter and applause.] We ought to have a testimonal now. How many Republicans do we have here today? Would you hold up your hands. [Response from the audience.] Well, we are going to talk to you.', 'We do have one of their representatives here today and we appreciate her coming. We have a few Democrats. We have a few people in 1960 who believe it is time that the United States began to move forward, and I am glad - [applause].', 'We are divided, as you know, in this country into two parties. One is the Republican Party and one is the Democratic Party, and at different times in the history of our country a majority of the American people have put their confidence in one party, and then on other occasions they put their confidence in another. And I think the reason they choose one party at one time and another party at another is because history and events and the mood of history swings like a pendulum back and forth. I believe that in 1912, the pendulum swung for the New Freedom of Woodrow Wilson, and in 1932, certainly a majority of the American people decided it was time they began to move ahead again, and they voted for Franklin Roosevelt. Now the question which you have to decide in 1960 is which mood of the world, which kind of a world, which place in world history are we in today, and which political party happens to fit the needs of our country. And that is the question which you as citizens of this country must decide.', 'It is not merely a question saying, ""I am a Democrat, and I vote Democratic,"" or being a Republican, ""I vote Republican,"" but which candidate in your judgment fits the needs of our country in 1961 and 1962. [Response from the audience.]', 'I want to make it clear so that you can make your judgment how I stand on the great issues which face our country in 1960. My own judgment is that what we are now doing in this country is not good enough, that when Mr. Nixon runs on a slogan of ""You\'ve never had it so good,"" that isn\'t a good enough slogan in my opinion, because what we are now doing in this country, what is now happening in the State of Pennsylvania, what is now happening around the world, is not good enough from the point of view of our own security, and on this issue Mr. Nixon and I separate. [Applause.]', ""Secondly, I do not believe that the United States is increasing its economic growth and development at a fast enough rate to provide full employment in the State of Pennsylvania and full employment in the United States. This matter of so-called growth is at the heart of your job. This country has grown in the last 8 years on the average of 2 1/2 percent a year. That means that we have increased our strength each year 2 1/2 percent, but because machinery has come in, because our productivity has increased at a faster rate even than our economic growth, it means that we have in 1960 4 1/2 million people out of work. We are going to face the same problem in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964 and 1965. Some of you may work in the glass factory. You know that every year we increase the productivity capacity of our glass factories, and if we don't provide economic growth at least twice what we now have, you are not going to find as many people working in the United States as work today. We have 50 percent of our steel mills producing, 50 percent stand idle, and yet we produce almost as much steel today as we did with 100 percent of capacity 7 years ago. The reason is that new machines make it possible to produce more steel. Therefore, not as many men are needed, and, therefore, 100,000 steelworkers are out of work."", ""Now, Mr. Nixon and I have discussed economic growth on these debates. I have pointed out that the Soviet Union is growing two and a half times as fast as us. But that is not the most ominous sign. The fact is that Western Germany, which is a great competitor of the United States in all the markets of the world, is growing at twice the rate we are. Italy, which we helped on its feet in 1947, 1948 and 1949 is now growing at a faster rate than we are. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years in order to maintain full employment in this country, and, therefore, I don't think what we are now doing is good enough. I don't think the monetary and fiscal policies which this administration has followed are good enough. I believe that when they stand against the minimum wage of $1.25 an hour, I think they are standing in the way of progress. We have high interest rates and as a partial result we built this year 200,000 less homes than we needed in this country to stay up with our population. We are going to double the population of the United States in the next 40 years, and yet slums are developing faster than we are building new homes, and partly because of the high interest rate policy that this administration has followed which has held our economy back. So the first difference with Mr. Nixon and the Republicans, and this is the question you have to decide, are you satisfied with the rate of growth in this country, do you feel that we are moving ahead fast enough, do you feel that our strength is increasing, do you feel we must do better? [Response from the audience; applause.]"", ""The second matter that I think is of great importance to us as citizens is in our security around the world. I believe that we face two problems in our security around the world, and they both affect your decision on November 8. One is the question of whether we have and are developing sufficient military strength. I believe that the present rate of growth of the Soviet Union in military strength, particularly in long-range missiles, is greater than ours, and while I believe that today the United States is secure, I believe there is a danger in 1962, 1963 and 1964, that unless we move ahead at a greater rate, we won't meet it. That is only one of the dangers. The other danger is that the Soviet Union and the Communist system will move into these areas of the world like they did in Cuba, like they are now doing today in Laos, and will extend their influence without any military action."", ""In the last 2 years, five countries, once independent, now support the Communist foreign policy line, Cuba, Guinea, Ghana, Iraq, and there is every evidence in the next week that it will include Laos. Five countries that the Communists now control in the fields of foreign policy that 3 years ago they did not influence. In other words, there is every chance that the pattern of conquest of the Communists will not be military action, but will be by subversion, by fear, by persuading the people of those countries and their leaders that the Communist system represents the way of the future. I don't believe the administration has recognized that danger. I don't believe that our influence has increased as fast in recent years abroad as that of the Communists. When we had the issue in the United Nations a week ago on the admission of Red China, only two nations in Africa voted with us. When we had that same issue, more countries in Asia voted against us. We have lost about 10 votes in the last 4 years on that one issue, and I think all this indicates that our position in the world is not as strong as it needs to be if we are going to maintain our security. So I want to make it clear that on these two issues, the development of the economy of the United States, the problem of full employment, the problem of increasing our economic growth, and the problem of maintaining freedom around the world on these two issues, the parties disagree."", ""Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher. I say it isn't high enough. I say the tide is not moving in our direction. We haven't beamed a single program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last 8 years, except during the Hungarian revolution. We bring less students to the United States than we did 10 years ago. We offered more scholarships to the Congo in one day, we offered them 300 last June, than we gave to all of Africa the year before. We have the Development Loan Fund to assist the underdeveloped countries. We gave less than 2 percent of all of Africa from that Fund last year. We have ignored Africa. We are in danger of ignoring others. We have ignored Latin America and the result is that a candidate for the Presidency of Brazil felt it necessary to go to Havana and pay a call on Castro in order to secure the support of Castro supporters in the last election."", ""Now, these are problems that face you in this city. They go to the security of our children. They go to the future of freedom, not only here, but around the world. Therefore, let me say in conclusion, the question you have to decide on November 8 is, Is it good enough? Are you satisfied? If you look at this State, this country, and the world, and decide that the foresight and vision and long-range planning that this administration has carried out and that Mr. Nixon promises to continue is good enough - I don't think it is, and if you don't think it is, I want your support. If you think it is you should vote for Mr. Nixon. That is the issue that you have to decide on November 8."", 'Let me say finally that I appreciate your coming. This is an important election. These are serious issues. They involve us all, and regardless of whether a Republican President or Democratic President wins on November 8, this country is going to move through difficult times which will require the best of all of us. As the leader of the party in the minority, I present to you our belief that in these serious days this country has the last great hope of freedom, but we must move. I can assure you that if we are successful on November 8, this country will move again. [Applause.]']"

[Laughter and applause.] We are looking now. [Laughter.] Golf clubs - I will be all ready to be President. [Laughter.]', 'Yesterday, in fact this morning, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Nixon, in answer to a question, has defined his political philosophy by saying that he was a ""practical progressive."" Now, that is interesting, because last May, 5 months ago, writing to a conservative Republican, Mr. Nixon says ""I have consistently and outspokenly classified myself as an economic conservative,"" What is Mr. Nixon? [Laughter, response from the audience.] Is he a practical progressive? What Nixon are we voting for in 1960? The practical progressive? The outspoken conservative? The old Nixon? The new Nixon? The modern Republican? The old-fashioned Republican? Or are we voting for a man and a party that stand where they have always stood, for the people? [Response from the audience.]', 'If Mr. Nixon will make up his mind what he is and say it and live it and think it and vote it, then the American people will know what they are voting for. [Applause.] I never used to hear about the old Lincoln and the new Lincoln, the old Woodrow Wilson and the new Woodrow Wilson, the modern Franklin Roosevelt and the old-fashioned Franklin Roosevelt.', 'I am a Democrat, without prefix or suffix. [Applause.] Rather than all these definitions which Mr. Nixon and Madison Avenue developed, which are market tested and then put forth, I prefer to go by the old words of the Bible, ""By their fruits you shall know them."" [Applause.]', 'When a political party votes, in 1935, 98 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage, I know what the party stands for; and when that same political party in 1960 votes in the House of Representatives 85 percent against $1.25 minimum wage in 1960, I know the Republican Party stands where it has always stood-against; not for, but against.', 'Mr. Nixon leads a party which regards $1.25 minimum wage as extreme, which regards medical care for the aged tied to social security as extreme. Mr. Nixon leads a party which Alf Landon once led, from Pennsylvania. I went through his town. I thought I saw him out there cheering for us today. [Laughter and applause.] Even he could not stand the present policy of Mr. Nixon, because nobody knows what it is. He puts out papers on housing and education, and yet his party and he have voted against them or he last 14 years. They vote against the area distress bills, they veto them, and then Mr. Nixon calls for their passage during the campaign. People are not interested in leap year liberalism. Every 4 years at campaign time we hear the most glowing promises from the Republican Party and their candidates. But the record is written in the Congress, day in and day out. On medical care for the aged tied to social security, which would cost 3 cents a day per person, an average of $12 a year it would insure any person retiring that they would receive medical care, nursing care, the cost of their medicine.', ""Now, under the bill which the President signed, if you get sick and you are retired, and you have saved up $500 or $800, you have to first exhaust all of that for medical bills, then you take a pauper's oath that you are medically indigent. Then you receive some assistance."", 'Which is the American way? Which is the way we stand for? [Response from the audience.] The record is written. The record is written. Opposition to all these basic pieces of legislation which mean so much to the security of this country', 'I said about 2 weeks ago in Cleveland, Ohio, I could not think of one piece of original progressive legislation suggested by the Republicans in the last 25 years, and the papers said, ""You are wrong; what about President Taft\'s child labor in 1904?"" Well, what have they done since then? [Response from the audience.]', 'All this is important, because if this community, which now has 12 percent of its people out of work, which has never really gotten back on its feet economically with full employment since the recession of 1958, is going to move ahead, then we have to have policy that moves our country ahead, that pays a decent wage, that builds homes, that uses steel, that uses pottery. If you are building 200,000 homes fewer each year than you should be, you are not selling any pottery to those families. If you have an economic recession, people are not going to buy a new car and when they don\'t buy a new car, in Detroit, the steel mills in Pennsylvania don\'t work and the coal mines in Pennsylvania and West Virginia remain idle. The country is tied together, and a rising tide lifts all the boats. If our economy is moving upward, then people are working, but if we stand still, if we have an administration frozen in the ice of its own indifference, if we have an administration which is interested - Mr. Nixon spoke at White Sulphur, W. Va., to a group of businessmen in May. He said, ""As long as unemployment is under 4.5 million, it is not"" - and I quote him - ""a significant issue in the minds of the people."" I think it is. If you have 4.5 million people out of work, it is significant to them and their families, and it is significant to the rest of the Americans who are concerned that every American who seeks a job shall find one.', 'We are committed to that policy. I want to make it clear that this I believe is an important election. We are concerned about the security of the United States. We are concerned about the cause of freedom. But freedom and our security, and the things for which we stand, will never be strong, will never be safe, unless our country is strong. If we are building and moving ahead here in the United States, then we can meet our commitments around the globe. And we will meet those commitments. But if we are standing still, if people are out of work, if we are not moving into the sixties with the vigor that is required, then the United States stands still, and all those people who look to us as an inspiration wonder whether our high noon has passed, whether our brightest days were in the past, and whether the future belongs perhaps to those who live in the Communist system.', 'I don\'t believe it. Mr. Khrushchev says, ""Your children will be Communists."" He told us that on the Senate Foreigu Relations Committee a year ago. I believe his children can be free, but it depends on us. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon has said that he wants to spend the next 3 weeks discussing Quemoy and Matsu. I would be delighted to do so. If Mr. Nixon wants to engage the United States in military action 4 miles from the mainland of China, if he wants to commit us to the security of those islands which President Eisenhower has never been willing to do, I will talk about it from now on, because war and peace is the great issue. But I also want him to come here to New Castle. [Applause.] I want him to talk about Cuba, 90 miles off the coast off he United States. [Applause.] I want him to talk about what is happening to this country. I want him to talk about the record of his party. I want him to look at America. I want him to recognize that unless this country is strong, the cause of freedom is not strong. I am not so anxious that he take us into military action on the mainland of China as I am that we maintain our commitments, that we maintain our freedom. I spent long enough in the Pacific Ocean to know the difficulties with which Mr. Nixon is now facing the United States, if he has his way. [Applause.] And I do not want any young man in this community involved in a military action on islands that the admiral of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, said were not worth the bones of a single American soldier.

I have said on many occasions that Pennsylvania is key to the success of this election and also I believe Pennsylvania, a great industrial complex, has seen the effects of 8 years of Republican indifference to the needs of this State and the needs of this country. I believe that the people of Pennsylvania and the people of the United States, recognizing that this is a difficult time and an important election, are going to put their confidence in progress, which is our most important product.

I read a letter the other day that he wrote in May of 1960 saying he had been throughout his entire career not a liberal but an economic conservative. If he would make up his mind what he is, we could make a better judgment whether the people of this country want an economic conservative, a practical conservative, or a Democrat. I think they want a Democrat. [Applause.]', 'I think they want a candidate who does not have to issue statements every day saying what he is and what he is not, depending on what section of the country he is in, and which audience he is talking to.

I am delighted to do so. I am delighted to discuss this effort by a trigger-happy candidate to involve the United States in a commitment of these islands, 4 and 5 miles off the coast of China, a commitment which President Eisenhower never made in the treaty of 1955, and has not made until the present time.

[Applause.] Twice the Congress of the United States has passed legislation to aid areas where there is high unemployment. Senator Clark fought for the second bill, I was the floor manager for the first bill, the distressed area bill, the area redevelopment bill, and twice this administration vetoed that bill, which would have helped this county and would have helped Sharon. We passed two bills for housing and for urban renewal, which would have helped Pennsylvania. Twice this administration vetoed them.

Behind that sign up there [laughter] - behind that sign I hear that there is a slogan ""Experience counts.""

You can sum it up in five words: The Republicans have vetoed Pennsylvania.', 'The Democratic Congress passed two area development bills to help create jobs in areas of heavy and persistent unemployment.

That is 4,000 jobs every day, day in and day out, year after year.', 'Our economy has not been growing at that rate. And that is the trouble. There are today 1 million fewer jobs in manufacturing than the year this Republican administration took office. Jobs outside of manufacturing have not taken up that slack.

And while Mr. Nixon impressed the Cuban dictator, Batista, who has since been deposed Mr. Mikoyan impressed Castro and others now in control of the Cuban Government. Mr. Nixon calls his trip experience. But the American people cannot afford many more such experiences.', 'For the transformation of Cuba into a Communist base of operations a few minutes from our coast - by jet plane, missile, or submarine - is an incredibly dangerous development to have been permitted by our Republican policymakers. Havana - once a city bursting with admiration for Franklin Roosevelt, the good neighbor - is now a center of Communist press, propaganda, and broadcasts spreading anti-Yankee sentiment throughout Latin America. New groups of revolutionaries are being trained for undercover activities in other countries and the whole Western Hemisphere security system is drastically threatened.', ""This wouldn't have happened under Franklin Roosevelt, who warned the Nazis in 1940 to stay out of our hemisphere; this wouldn't have happened under Harry Truman who warned the Communists in 1947 to stay out of Greece and Turkey. And this would not have happened in Cuba if the Republican leadership Mr. Nixon represents every step which foresight and experience should have directed them to take - in order to prevent a Communist victory only 90 miles from our shores."", ""I do not know how Mr. Nixon can talk of firmness in view of his party's record in Cuba. I do not know how he can talk of experience in view of his party's experience in Cuba. I do not know how he can seek the Presidency and avoid explaining what happened in this major foreign policy disaster."", 'But it did happen - and the question now is, What do we do about Cuba and Castro now? What can a new administration do to end this drift?', '1. The first thing we have to do is let the Cuban people know our determination that they will someday again be free. We did not make clear to the Cubans our devotion to freedom during the brutal reign of the Batista dictatorship - and we are not making our position any clearer under the Castro dictatorship. We have no Cuban Voice of America broadcasts in Spanish at all, and only 1 hour a day in Spanish beamed in general to all Latin America. We must promptly initiate a major broadcast program for Cuba in particular, and more for the Americas in general.', '2. Secondly, we must end the harrassment, which this Government has carried on, of liberty-loving anti-Castro forces in Cuba and in other lands. While we cannot violate international law, we must recognize that these exiles and rebels represent the real voice of Cuba, and should not be constantly handicapped by our Immigration and Justice Department authorities.', '3. Third; we must let Mr. Castro know that we do not intend to be pushed around any longer and in particular do not intend to be pushed out of our naval base at Guantanamo, or denied fair compensation for American property he has seized.', '4. Fourth, we must let Mr. Khrushchev know that we are permitting no expansion of his foothold in our hemisphere - and that the Organization of American States will be given real strength and stature to resist any further Communist penetration by whatever means are necessary.', '5. Fifth and finally, we must strengthen the cause of freedom throughout all Latin America creating an atmosphere where liberty will flourish, and where Cuban communism will be resisted, isolated, and left to die on the vine', ""One road to Havana ultimately lies through Rio and Buenos Aires and Mexico City. If the rest of Latin America is unsure of our stand on native dictators as well as Communist dictators; if they feel we are concerned only with our Soviet enemies and not their enemies of poverty, hunger, and disease - if they feel we respond not to their requests but only to Mr. Castro's threats, then the same policies of drift and neglect that preceded Castro's rise to power will continue to weaken our influence and prestige."", 'We cannot write the Cuban people off as lost. Neither should we drive them inextricably into Soviet hands. But let us make the American Revolution the chief import of Latin America, not the Cuban Revolution. And if we do so then some day on the island of Cuba itself, there will be a government constituted to secure the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.']"
287,John F. Kennedy ,"October 16, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Thompson, ladies, and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming down here and greeting all of us. I particularly want to express my appreciation to Thorn Lord, who I hope you are going to elect as Senator from the State of New Jersey. [Applause.] We need a good Democratic Senator from this State, and I think Thorn can do the job. [Applause.] And Frank Thompson, our Congressman, who has been in charge of our registration drive in this campaign, who has registered 10 million new Democrats, I think, in the last 2 months. Stand up, please. [Applause.]', ""I come here today as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party in this most important election. Actually, there have been many significant elections in the history of this country, and it is my hope that as a result of this campaign, as a result of our efforts, that the people of this country, all of them, Republicans and Democrats, will come as a result of our effort of the last few months to some definite conclusions about what our country must do. I believe if this election is to serve a national purpose, the best purpose it can serve is to inform our people, not of all the things that are good about our country, because we know there are many things that are good about our country but the things that we must do if we are going to maintain our country's freedom. That is the purpose of this election. That is the purpose of our campaign, and I must say on this great issue which goes to the freedom of our country, the peace of the world, the success of freedom around the globe, I believe on this great issue Mr. Nixon and I have sharp disagreements, and they involve very definitely [applause] - Mr. Nixon's views are subject to change frequently, so I think we disagree on this question. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'Yesterday in Arizona he made a speech to a group that Senator Goldwater had gathered together, saying he is all for the Republican Party and all of its candidates, and then he spoke about an hour later and said ""Well, the party does not make much difference; it is the man."" [Applause.] Well, I think it is the man who the party selects that makes the difference. [Applause.]', 'Grover Cleveland said about 70 years ago, ""What good is a politician unless he stands for something?"" And I say what good is a political party unless it stands for something. And I want to make very clear where we stand in 1960. We say that this is a great country that must be greater. It is a powerful country that must be more powerful, and as an American citizen of this country, as well as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party, I want to make it clear that what we are doing now is not good enough. Mr. Nixon runs on a slogan ""We\'ve Never Had It So Good."" He says that our prestige in the world has never been as high. I don\'t agree with that. I don\'t agree with that. [Applause.]', 'As long as we are using only 50 percent of our capacity in the production of steel, as long as our economic growth is only one-third that of the Soviet Union, as long as 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never get to see the inside of a college, as long as the votes in the United Nations are beginning to move against us, as long as Castro is strong not only in Cuba but is spreading his influence throughout Latin America, I cannot say we have never had it so good. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon debates Quemoy and Matsu, and I am delighted to debate them with him, because I believe in strength and I believe in peace. But I also would like to hear him debate Cuba, Africa, Latin America, economic growth [applause] - I saw in the paper that he is going to discuss those two islands 4 miles from the coast of China for the next 3 weeks. I am delighted to discuss those islands and our responsibilities toward them an a toward peace and toward strength. But I would like to also hear his plans to prevent the communization of other areas of the world. What are his plans to prevent Africa from slipping, an area of poverty and disease, what is his plan? And what is the administration's plan to prevent Communist influence from growing in Africa? What is the program of this administration toward Latin America?"", ""Last June we offered 300 scholarships to the Congo. You know that was more scholarships than we had offered to all of Africa the year before? We had more people stationed in West Germany in our Foreign Service in 1957 than in all of Africa? There are four countries in Africa now members of the United Nations, and we don't even have an American representative in any of the four. In the vote on the admission of Red China into the United Nations, do you know how many African nations voted with us? Two - one, Liberia which we helped found, and the other the Union of South Africa. Every other country of Africa either voted against us or abstained. Do you know more countries voted against us on that issue from Asia than voted with us? Do you know why a candidate for the Presidency of Brazil took a trip to see Castro? Because he realized the popularity that Castro has been gaining in Latin America; because the United States is indifferent. We gave more aid in the last 10 years to Yugoslavia than we gave to all of Latin America combined."", 'These are the problems that we must discuss, because they go to the security of every person here. Everyone here knows that unless the balance of power in the world is moving in the direction of freedom, then the United States is in peril. As long as countries in Africa, and leaders, begin to feel that the future belongs to the Communists and not to us, as long as they begin to fear the Russians more than they trust us, as long as those people in Latin America think that we are uninterested in their fight against poverty and disease and ignorance, as long as they think we regard them merely as pawns in the cold war, then they begin to wonder whether they should do what Castro has done.', 'These are the struggles which we are going to face in the next 10 years. How could a free society increase its economic growth? There are a good many people here who work, whose children will be trying to get a job in the next 12 months. We are going to have to find in the next 10 years, 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years, to provide jobs for all the people in our country who want them, and we are going to have to do that at times when automation is taking the jobs of men, when 1 machine can do the jobs of 10 men, and yet we are going to have to provide full employment. We have 16 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $78 a month. How are they going to get by and find homes, shelter, and medical care? These are the problems that the United States must face.', ""I am delighted to discuss any problems that anyone wants to raise in this campaign, but I want to turn Mr. Nixon's attention not only to the coast of China but to the United States and New Jersey and the problems it faces and our people face. [Applause.]"", 'In different times in our history the American people have chosen the Republicans and at other times they have chosen the Democrats. I believe in 1960 that when we analyze our perils and our opportunities, because our opportunities are greater than our perils, I believe the American people are going to come to the conclusion that it is time this country started moving again. And that is the issue. [Applause.]', 'In 1912, Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey ran for the Presidency, and he ran on the slogan, ""The New Freedom."" I run in 1960 not saying that if I am elected life will be easy but saying that this is a great country which deserves the best from us all. This is a great country which deserves the best that all of us can do. It is a country which is the chief defender of freedom, and upon us and upon our willingness to meet our responsibilities rests not only our own security, but rests the hope of freedom all around the globe.', 'Abraham Lincoln said 100 years ago, ""This Nation cannot exist half slave and half free."" The question is whether the world can exist in 1960 half slave and half free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom or whether it will move in the direction of slavery, and upon us, upon our willingness to meet our responsibilities, hinges this great question. I come to New Jersey and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.] And I can assure you that if we are successful we will set before this country its unfinished business, and this country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
288,John F. Kennedy ,"October 16, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, girls.', 'Senator Allen Frear, Congressman McDowell, Governor-to-be Carvell, Mr. Potter, State chairman, national committeewoman, ladies and gentlemen, I want to apologize for keeping you waiting. I was not playing golf. We were over in New Jersey campaigning. [Laughter.] But I have come here for several reasons, first because I think the important thing that the citizens of Delaware return to the U.S. Senate Allen Frear who has been a responsible Senator, and who I know will fight for this State and country once he returns to Washington as a member of important committees in the Senate. So I join with him today and hope that you will support him at election time, November 8, and reelect him to the U.S. Senate. [Applause.]', 'And my friend and colleague in the House of Representatives, your Congressman from this State, who has served, as I did, on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who has brought to foreign policy a recognition that this country must begin to move forward, must extend its influence around the world with greater vigor, and I am confident that Delaware will reelect to the House of Representatives Harris McDowell. [Applause.]', 'And also reelect as Governor, the biggest Governor in the country and also from a small State of Delaware send a Governor who will speak for this State and fight for it. I know you will elect again as you did in 1948 your next Governor, Governor Carvell. [Applause.]', 'And when you have done all that - Kennedy is the name. [Applause.] I come here today, and I must confess that I am finding greater difficulty running against Mr. Nixon than I had imagined. The reason is not because he is such a magnificent debater and it is not because he is using new lighting, but because his positions change so fast that it is very difficult to know where he stands and, therefore, it is very difficult to know what policy he is advocating for our country in the future.', 'For example, for 10 days he took on the islands of Quemoy and Matsu an entirely different position than the President of the United States has taken since 1955. He attempted to involve us in a commitment of those islands as a matter of principle, when the fact of the matter is that the President of the United States and Mr. Dulles and Secretary Herter has never taken that position.', ""Now, if he agrees with the President and his view on Quemoy and Matsu, I agree with him, and have agreed with it for several years, and I am glad to have Mr. Nixon come back home. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon has campaigned around the country that parties don't mean very much; what counts is the man. And yet yesterday he went to Arizona and in the heartland of Senator Goldwater he said he is supporting the Republican ticket from top to bottom, and if there was a single Republican he could not support he would get out of the party. He is in the party. He is in the party and so is Mundt, Curtis, Dirksen, and Goldwater, and they are the people with whom we have a very sharp disagreement, a disagreement about the problems of our country, about what must be done if this country is going to remain secure."", ""I do not run for the office of the Presidency, and I don't come to this community or State and tell you that if I am elected life will be easy. I think to be a citizen of the United States in the next 10 years will require us to assume great responsibilities and great burdens. But I do believe that we have an obligation, not only to ourselves but to all those who wish to live their lives in freedom around the globe. During the American Revolution Thomas Paine said that the cause of America is the cause of all mankind. Now in 1960, in a very real sense, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. If we remain strong here in the country, if we are building a more vigorous society, if we are meeting our responsibilities in this country and around the world, then we strengthen not only ourselves but we strengthen the cause of freedom. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States, because he believed that this society must not stand still, it must move, that we must provide greater opportunity for our people, that we must build our strength, and in building our strength, we strengthen the cause of freedom all around the globe wherever it hangs in doubt."", 'Now the issue which separates Mr. Nixon and myself, and on this issue the people of Delaware must make their own sober judgment, and I believe the issue is quite clear, whether the United States now is at the peak of its power. Mr. Nixon says and runs on the slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good."" He says our prestige in the world has never been so high, that our strength relative to the Communists is increasing. I hold a different view, and I believe it incumbent upon all of us who bear any position of responsibility that we state the facts. I do not believe our position is at a high, I do not believe our prestige is steadily growing. I do not believe that our strength is, relative to the Communists, steadily increasing. I believe we have to do better. It is that great question which you must decide yourselves, after looking here in this State and country, and making our own judgment of the stream of events around the world, you must decide. Do you think we are secure? Do you think we are doing enough? Do you think our prestige is higher than it has even been? Do you feel the balance of power in the world is shifting in our direction? Do you feel that the Communist threat is disappearing? Do you feel our position in Latin America is stronger than a decade ago, or that the balance of power in Africa is moving with us, or that we are meeting the problems of people all around the globe in expressing ourselves with vigor? Are we meeting the problems that we face in this country when we have 50 percent of our steel capacity unused? When nearly 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college? When the Soviet Union which, in 1950, was producing half as many scientists and engineers as we are now, produces twice as many, and its economic growth is three times ours? And ours is less not only than the Soviet Union, but of France, Germany, Italy. I believe the United States moves through a difficult time. I believe we can move through it successfully, but I certainly do not believe we can do so if we have leaders who do not tell us the facts, who say, as Demosthenes said 2,000 years ago, to the Athenians, ""Our peril comes from those who seek to please us, rather than serve us.""', 'I believe on this occasion we serve the people. [Applause.] Can you possibly say that our power is increasing when you know that next winter and next spring the United States will face a most serious crisis over Berlin at a time when our strength is not rising in relation to that of the Communists? Do you feel that this administration has solved the problem of unemployment, when we have more people out of work now, this fall, than any time except for the three postwar recessions? Do you feel that your children are going to get jobs when you realize that we have to find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 10 years in order to provide employment for our people?', 'I believe this country can meet its responsibilities, to its own citizens and those around the world, but I think we have to do better than we are doing and that is the issue. Do you agree? I think you do. I think as Americans you do agree. [Applause.]', 'This country is, as I said, the hope of freedom, but unless we show vigor, unless we show foresight, unless we are able to develop in the minds of people around the globe an image of ourselves as a society which is on the move, then it seems to me we have lost a most important struggle. Do you realize that the United States has not had a program in the ""Voice of America"" in Spanish to Latin America any time in the last 8 years except for the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis? Do you realize that we brought more foreign students to study in the United States 10 years ago that we do today?', 'Do you realize that we got less votes at the United Nations on the admission of Red China than ever before in our history and that in all of Africa only two countries voted with us 10 days ago? Mr. Nixon points to the votes at the U.N. as evidence of our high prestige. Two countries voted with us on the question of the admission of Red China: Liberia and the Union of South Africa. Every other country either voted against us or abstained.', 'Yesterday the New York Herald Tribune said we had given up hope that Laos would remain an independent country out of the Communist orbit. Mr. Nixon says he is going to spend the next 3 weeks talking about Quemoy and Matsu. I am delighted to engage him in discussion if it serves a national purpose. But I want him to address himself to the problems in this country, to our problems in Cuba, to our problems in Latin America, to our problems around the world and tell us how he is going. [Applause.] I am not interested in engaging in foreign policy debates in order to gain a partisan advantage. But as I said a week ago, I say today, those islands are not worth the bones, and I quote Admiral Yarnell, of a single American soldier. [Applause.]', 'The United States will meet its treaty commitments. I support the position of the President. Mr. Nixon says he does, too. Now, Mr. Nixon, let us talk about some of the real problems that this country faces. How are you going to move this economy ahead and provide employment for our people? How are you going to build the homes which need to be built? How are you going to provide for the implementation of the Supreme Court decision of 1954?', 'Mr. Nixon sent Senator Goldwater through the South saying he does not mean anything he says on civil rights, and Senator Scott of Pennsylvania through the North assuring the Negroes that he is with them all the way. He gives a commitment to the repeal of the Connally amendment and then when Senator Goldwater objects he puts forward new reservations. I stand where the Democratic Party has always stood, and I stand to make it very clear that I stand with pride as a Democrat in 1690. [Applause.]', 'I stand where Franklin Roosevelt stood in 1932, and where Woodrow Wilson stood in 1912, and where Harry Truman stood in 1948. [Applause.] I stand there because I believe that after 8 years, after the last 8 years, the United States is preparing, I believe, another great movement forward in our history, and I believe as we release our energy as a nation, the Democratic Party, with all of its vitality, with all recognition that it is an old party, I believe in 1960, the Democratic Party fits the needs of our time. We need progress, and I believe that progress is our most important commodity. I think we stood for progress and we stand for it in 1960. [Applause.]', 'So I come here today and ask your help. The Democrats have a majority in the State of Delaware but we have not always carried Delaware. Now, this year, I come up here and ask your assistance in this campaign. I do it not merely because I am the candidate, but because I really believe that this country is worthy of our best efforts. I really believe that we have a chance to serve the United States. I really believe that it is possible for us in the next 4 years to so indicate our vitality and strength to set before the American people our unfinished business, so that people around the world will once more feel that we are on the move again.', 'They stand today on the razor edge of decision, trying to decide whether the future belongs to us or to the Communists. I believe it belongs to us. But if it is going to belong to us, if people around the world are going to decide to follow our leadership, we must lead, we must set an example, we must meet our own problems, we must hold out a helping hand to them. That is our opportunity. I cannot believe that given that free choice the American people are going to decide to stand still. I think they are going to move. And I can assure you that if we are successful in this campaign, we will give leadership to the country and the United States will move forward again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
289,John F. Kennedy ,"October 16, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Lee, Mr. Parker, if we can get the voting age to 16, we are going to skip this election [applause] otherwise it might be close. Our two county Chairman, Senator Kefauver, Congressman Lankford, Congressman Foley, my old friend and colleague from the House of Representatives, Congressman Sasscer, distinguished Comptroller, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to the county officials and to all of you for your kindness in holding this rally tonight. We have been to New Jersey today and Delaware, and to the 51st State, as I call Meet the Press, and tonight we go to the State of Ohio [applause] and carry on this campaign in this State and Ohio for the next 3 weeks, until we win [applause].', 'This is an important campaign because the Office of the Presidency is important. Senator Kefauver and I have been in the Congress for a good many years, he, nearly 20 and 114. I think both of us would agree, after having been in the House and the Senate, that because of the Constitution and because of the force of events, more and more depends upon the vigor, the vitality, the good judgment, the sense of history, the sense of the future, the foresight of the next President of the United States. The Congress has an important function, but in a very real sense the Congress can block, but only the President of the United States can propose, and I am waiting now for 2 months to see what proposals Mr. Nixon would put forward for the great problems which disturb the tranquillity of this country. I know he feels strongly about Mr. Truman\'s use of the word ""hell,"" but otherwise, what is the issue? [Applause.]', 'Those of us who run in the Democratic Party in the names of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, not because we think the problems that we now face bear a great resemblance to the problems that they faced in their time but because we approached their different problems with a spirit which I think is common to the Democratic Party today.', 'Woodrow Wilson could run on the ""New Freedom"" and Franklin Roosevelt could serve in the administration of Woodrow Wilson and then run in 1932 on the ""New Deal,"" and Harry Truman could serve as a Senator in the thirties in the ""New Deal"" and run in 1948 on the ""Fair Deal,"" and I could serve in the Congress led by President Truman in 1947 and 1948, and run in 1960 on the ""Fair Deal."" The succession follows year after year, decade after decade, back through our history, and, though the problems change, I believe the spirit which motivates the Democratic Party is the same spirit of progress which motivated it when Thomas Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase. [Applause.]', ""I believe that we can divide, generally, the responsibilities which we will meet in the sixties into two categories. The first of those is to attempt to bring up to date those pieces of social legislation passed in the 1930's which still have great significance in the lives of our citizens today, and, therefore, while Franklin Roosevelt could propose in 1935 a 25-cent minimum wage, we proposed in 1960 a $1.25 minimum wage. Where Franklin Roosevelt proposed social security in 1935, we propose in 1960 medical care for the aged tied to social security. [Applause.]"", 'These problems of housing and social security, unemployment compensation, minimum wages, and the others fall into the general category of proposals put forward either in the administration of President Wilson or President Roosevelt, or President Truman. In that field, though in some ways it is a new problem, but an old one, I would include education because this country has been aiding education since the country began, since the Northwest Ordinance set aside one-sixteenth of the territory in order to help education, back when this country was founded, to the land grant colleges in 1862, to the vocational aids, to the aids to impacted districts. We have provided for aid to education since the beginning of this country and will continue to do so.', 'In spite of the fact that Mr. Nixon has stated that it would result in Federal control over education, the Federal Government, and the States, and the local communities have harmonized their respective responsibilities and we have begun to move ahead, though we still have great unfinished business in that area as well. But these are the traditional problems which have faced our country and the solutions fall into the general category with which we are familiar. However, there are, I believe, in 1961 a whole new set of problems that are coming on which are not common to the past, which will require new solutions, problems which our party must consider and problems which I believe we must address ourselves to in the coming months in order to prepare ourselves for action in 1961.', ""No.1: How is it possible for a free society to stimulate its economic growth, to provide for an economic growth at least twice that which we now have, to provide 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years at the very time when new machinery is taking the jobs of men in the basic industries. The result of the layoffs now is not merely that there is a general economic decline, but it is also due to the fact that one machine can do the job of five men. We produce now and use only 50 percent of our steel capacity and yet we produce almost as much steel as we did in 1952, with 100 percent of capacity. What are the prospects of hiring those steelworkers back? What are the prospects in a free enterprise system of maintaining full employment in the 1960's? What are the solutions for the problem of automation? That will be a problem for the next President of the United States, and I have not even heard it discussed in the last 8 years."", 'Secondly, how is it possible for the United States to provide for an orderly system of disarmament? How is it possible for us to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union which will permit a cessation of nuclear tests and begin to control outer space and prevent one power or another making a decisive breakthrough in those far distant regions? The United States in the last years has had less than 100 people working in the entire field of government on the highly sophisticated, highly technical, highly scientific subject of disarmament.', ""Mr. Nixon said the other night that they had quality, not quantity. I don't know who the geniuses are, but, 100 men, it is a terrible burden for them. [Applause.]"", 'Third, how is it possible for countries to the south of us, Latin America, Africa, Asia, how is it possible for those countries with an inadequate resource base, with a steadily increasing population, with widespread ignorance, misery, starvation, a lack of education, a lack of potential - how is it possible for them to maintain a free society? How is it possible for them to be devoted to freedom, particularly when they look to the example of the Soviet Union, which 40 years ago was the most backward country in Western Europe and now has passed even the great United States in some areas of science, in some areas of productivity, and which is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are each year? What is the example that these people will choose to follow and what inspiration have we offered to them? I think the most serious problem that the United States has faced in many ways, certainly the most undiscussed problem, is the problem of Ghana. Why did the people of Ghana and the leadership decide, even though an independent country, even with a great tradition of being tied to the British, even though they had every prospect of maintaining a society tied to the West, why have they in the last 3 years since they have been independent suddenly begun to tie their policies closely to that of the Soviet Union? It is not chaos. It is not a military seizure of power like Cuba. Yet, Mr. Herter said 3 weeks ago that Ghana is supporting the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. What made Nkrumah, who studied in Pennsylvania, who got his education in this country, who went to, I believe Lincoln College in Pennsylvania, what made him decide, even though he had as his economic advisor an Englishman, what made him decide that the Soviet Union had more to offer him than the West? And what effect will that have not only on Ghana, but the same experience in Guinea, and what effect will that have on the newly emerging countries of Africa, and what have we done about it?', 'In 1957, we had more Foreign Service personnel stationed in Western Germany than we did in all of Africa. We had more people coming to this country sponsored by the Federal Government 10 years ago, then we do today. We offered more scholarships to the Congo in June than we did to all of Africa the year before, and of the 300 scholarships that we offered to the Congo, less than 7 Congolese citizens are now studying in the United States. We gave more aid to Yugoslavia since the end of the war up to a year ago, then we gave to all Latin America, until the Inter-American Bank was founded, until we broke with Castro on the sugar quota and decided we had almost ignored the needs of this vital hemisphere. And why is it that the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil feels it incumbent upon him for his political safety to take a journey to see Castro, not the President of the United States, to see Castro, in order to build his political fences in Brazil?', 'Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher. Yet on the question of admission of Red China only two countries voted with us. The night before, in the debate, he called attention to the vote in the U.N. as evidence of our high prestige. The next day two countries in Africa voted with us, one Liberia, bound to us by ancient ties, and the other the Union of South Africa, hardly a country which enjoys close solidarity with the rest of Africa. More countries voted against us in Asia than voted for us.', 'I mention these things not because they are a source of satisfaction to any American, but because not only do I think we must do better, but I think we can do better. I do not hold the idea at all that there is any inevitability about this movement. I do not believe that the Communists have something to offer Africa, and Latin America, and Asia superior to what we offer. I believe that, in addition to freedom, our system does permit a development of the resources of the country. I believe with help India can prove it, and I believe it incumbent upon us to meet our responsibilities in this area through long-range loans of the kind that this administration has been unwilling to sponsor.', 'So, I would say the problems are difficult, but that should not faze a country which has passed through the experiences that we have had in our long history, but it certainly cannot say that the present leadership, based on its experience deserves another term.', 'I believe that, on that basis, the American people, who know just as well as anyone else the exact place in history that they are now occupying, who can judge the current of the tide of history as well as anyone else in the world, who know generally whether the tide is moving in their favor or not, who can look to outer space and look to the home across the street, know that this country is not meeting its maximum capability.', 'I do not downgrade America. [Applause.]', 'I do not downgrade America. I downgrade the prospective leadership which is offered by the Republican Party. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon says the party doesn't matter. At least, he said that yesterday, and he also said the party did matter in an earlier speech. But, whichever view you take, and you can have your pick, whichever view you take, I believe the party does matter, the kind of candidates the party puts forward. Estes Kefauver would never have run as a Republican, nor would Congressman Lankford, or Congressman Foley. There is a difference between the two parties. There is a difference in their judgment of the future. There is certainly a difference in their record of the past. [Applause.]"", 'And, therefore, the same political party which could vote nearly 90 to 1 against social security in 1935, could vote against medical care, with only 1 vote for it, in 1960, or the same party that voted 95 percent against the 25-cent minimum wage in 1935 could be opposed to $1.25 in 1960.', 'I believe that individuals and parties have characteristics and, therefore, the Republican candidates could run from the 20th century on slogans like ""Stand Pat With McKinley"" and ""Return to Normalcy With Harding"" and ""Keep Cool With Coolidge."" I don\'t know what Dewey\'s slogan was because he never worked it out. [Applause.]', 'In any case, I come tonight and ask your support in this very important campaign. I feel that this campaign has an opportunity to render a service and that is that when the campaign is over, in my judgment, the American people will have made their choice, and their choice will be progress. Their choice will be to move off dead center. Their choice will be to move into the 1960\'s. Their choice will be to assume the burdens and responsibilties of leadership. Their choice will be ""Yes"" to the next 10 years. Their choice will be the choice they have made in other great crises of our history. [Applause.]', 'In 1860 when the choice was somewhat similar in this country, the question of whether the world would exist and this country would exist half slave and half free, Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and that He hates unjustice. I see the storm coming and I know His hand and is in it, but, if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice and we see the storm coming and we see His hand in it, but, if he has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready.[Applause.]']"

I run against a man who on this desperate occasion in the life of the free world can say that our prestige has never been higher, that our strength has been unequaled, that this country is on the ascendency, that, if U.N. and other standards are used to test our prestige, it is secure and could not be better. I could not disagree more. [Applause.]', ""It seems to me that the basic responsibility for the next President of the United States is to do what Franklin Roosevelt did in the 1930's, to set before our country its unfinished business.

I represent Massachusetts in the Senate and Senator Engle represents California, but only the President of the United States speaks for Massachusetts and California, only the President of the United States speaks for the United States."", ""I believe it incumbent upon the next President to set before us the things we must do in order to maintain our strength, in order to build a more vigorous society, in order that the people of our country may express better the real opportunities of freedom, and in order that we may hold out ourselves to the world as an example as we sit on a most conspicuous stage of what freedom would really be. That is the assignment and the burden that all of us, as citizens of this country, must bear in the 1960's."", 'I do not run for the Presidency with any expectation that life will be easy for any of us, but I do run with the greatest possible confidence in the vitality of our system, in our ability to move forward, in our willingness to assume all challenges that come our way, once we are given the direction, once we are given the leadership, once we are informed of what our goals must be if we are going to protect ourselves and those who look to us for help.

In that speech he said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'And I believe, in the plight of our schools, the decline of American agriculture, our inability at this competetive time to maintain full employment and full use of our facilities, in our policy of no new starts in the development of our natural resources, in our willingness to accept a secondary position in the development of scientists and engineers, and the building of our cities, I believe that we have followed too often in this administration the words which T. S. Eliot wrote in his poem, ""The Rock"":', '\n  And the wind shall say: ""These were a decent people, their only monument the asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls.""\n', 'We can do better than that.

We come here and ask your help.', 'During the American Revolution of 1776, Thomas Paine said, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" Now, I believe in the 1960\'s we return that service and the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. I am confident that this country will move ahead. I am confident that the 1960\'s can be not as Dickens says, ""The worst days,"" but the best of days.', 'I am confident that the Democratic Party will be called once again to assume its historic task of providing leadership in a dangerous time in the life of our country.', 'Thank you.

291,John F. Kennedy ,"October 16, 1960","['Yesterday in the setting of Barry Goldwater Republicanism in Arizona, Vice President Nixon finally confessed to the Nation that he is a Republican and backs Republican candidates throughout the Nation.', ""The 1960's leading proponent of the theory that it is the man, not the party, let his hair down and said he was for every Republican candidate in the Nation and that any time he found one he couldn't support he would get out of the party. In this statement the Vice President frankly associated himself with the policies of Goldwater and Dirksen, Mundt and Curtis."", ""We welcome Mr. Nixon's candid confession at this late hour that he is a Republican. This is something we have been saying all along. The Nation should take this confession at its face value or it is Mr. Nixon and his party who have steadfastly opposed measures needed by the people of this country - who have fought raising the minimum wage to $1.25, who have vetoed adequate measures for housing and education, who have opposed the raising of teachers' salaries, who have fought the setting up of an adequate medical care plan under social security, who have twice vetoed bills destined to give America's depressed areas a chance. Mr. Nixon's statement in Phoenix is just another example of how he talks out of both sides of his mouth. One way in Goldwater land, another way in Rockefeller land, one way in the North, another way in the South, one way to bankers, and another way to the labor unions. The rainbowlike spectrum of his political beliefs defies description in either color or breadth. For an examination of Mr. Nixon's record reveals his special ability to stand on almost every issue during the 14 years of his career. The latest and most serious example being his trigger-happy stand on Quemoy and Matsu, on the one hand, and his fanatical clutching of President Eisenhower's position on Quemoy and Matsu, on the other.""]"
292,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. My close friend and just about first supporter, Governor Di Salle, Mayor Patterson, who I hope will be the next Congressman from the district [applause], Al Horstman, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time in 14 years of politics that I have ever heard of a Democratic meeting and the Rotary Club joining together. [Laughter and applause.] I don't know whether it means the Democrats are broadminded or the Rotary Club is broadminded, but I am all for it, because I believe that the kind of people we have in our party, the kind of men who are active in the Rotary Club, have many things in common. They start off by being citizens of the United States. They start off by recognizing that the next President of the United States will face difficult and dangerous burdens, that when he is in trouble the country is in trouble, when he is doing well the country is doing well. So we are all bound together, really, in a very real sense, Republicans and Democrats, Rotary Club members, and those of us in politics, all bound together by common aspirations for our country. We may differ on some occasions as to the means of achieving these goals, and these differences are quite important. We may sometimes differ on the goals. We may certainly differ on what our country may need for the future. We certainly differ between our parties today on the position of our country and the kind of leadership it is going to need in the sixties. But I am confident that when November 9 comes that whoever is elected President of the United States will have the good wishes, support and sympathy and right hand of every American, regardless of their party. [Applause.]"", ""Franklin Roosevelt started his campaign here in Ohio. I don't know what has happened to politics, but whenever I read about the 1932 campaign, Franklin Roosevelt stayed in Albany all winter, spring, sunmer, didn't go to the convention until he was nominated. He then took a boating trip up the coast of Maine with his son, started his campaign late in September, made some speeches and was elected by a tremendous majority. [Laughter.]"", ""It hasn't been quite that way in 1960. I have been on the road since January, and we don't know what is going to happen. But in any case, 1932 is a little different than 1960. But in some ways the problems are the same. That is the basic problem of how a country such as ours can maintain full employment, full employment not only of our people but also of our facilities. There has never been any question in my debates with Mr. Nixon about the economic growth of the United States. There has never been any question, I don't think, in any American's mind, that if we used our facilities, our man-power, our resources, our engineers and our scientists and our governmental influences to the maximum, that the Soviet Union would never catch us, regardless of whether their economic growth may be greater than ours today or not. The question has always been, how do we provide for that full use of our facilities? How do we provide for 100 percent use of our capacity in steel? How do we move ahead in the development of our hydroelectric capacity? How do we move ahead in providing that the atomic force shall be used for peaceful use? How do we provide that our scientists and engineers shall be used to the maximum of their talent? How do we provide all of the skilled personnel that we need?"", 'The question is how in our country with a private enterprise system we can stimulate our economic growth in order to maintain our pace. That is the great question which faces the next President of the United States and the people of this country domestically.', ""In my judgment, the record of the last 8 years is not satifactory enough. There is no sense in trying to compare it to what might have happened 15 or 20 years before. You have to compare what we are now doing with our needs, with our requirements, with what our adversary is doing. The situation changes continually. Therefore, we must always compare our effort with what needs to be done, not what might have been done before. Therefore, when we increase our economic growth on the average for the last 8 years 2.4 percent, and the Soviet Union's is 7 to 8 percent a year, and Western Germany's is nearly 6 percent a year, and Italy's is nearly 5 percent a year, and France is 5 percent a year, and we had the lowest rate of economic growth last year of any major industrialized society, it is a matter of concern to us all. Economic growth is not a technical term. It goes to the kind of profit which businessmen make. It goes to the question of whether our children will get jobs. It goes to the question of whether there will be full employment here in Dayton. We have to provide 25,000 new jobs every week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the country and we are going to have to do it at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men. This is a tremendously difficult challenge for us all."", ""Quite obviously, if we don't save it, if we don't maintain our people working, if we waste our facilities, if we provide a gradual paralysis of our economic growth and development, then quite obviously in one particular category our system has failed, and we cannot permit failure in the race of the sixties."", 'So I address myself to that problem and I feel very strongly about it. I think I disagreed with Mr. Nixon on it. He states that he is satisfied with what we are now doing. He referred to the term ""growthmanship,"" somewhat disparagingly. I think it is a very important matter, because it goes to the future of our position around the world. Now the question is what can we do to stimulate our growth.', 'One of the things which this administration has relied on in the fight against inflation, which has not been a particularly successful fight, has been, of course, a policy of high-interest rates. This is a rather technical subject but everyone of you in this room is involved in it. It has raised the rates as a result of relying on a high-interest rate policy, it has raised the rate on prime business loans in the last 8 years by 76 percent. That involves every businessman in this room. It has raised the rate on FHA, that is housing loans, by 34 percent. It has raised the rate on Treasury bills, that is the financing of the Government debt, 95 percent. It has raised the rate on long-term Government bonds by 52 percent. The result is that we are paying nearly $3 billion more in carrying charges on our Government debt, interest on our debt, than we did a decade ago. It has raised the rate on municipal bonds, in everything that you build for the community of Dayton. It has raised them, including building schools, by 45 percent. It has raised the rate on everything.', 'These are not mimbers. These are just people. They are involved very definitely in our home commitment and in life. The banks in the Federal Reserve System increased their earnings by 81 percent between 1952 and 1959. But what happened to the farmers who have to rely on credit to survive? What happened to the small businessman who must go into the open market for his financing? What happened to the homeowner who buys his home with a mortgage? How fared the student and the teacher and the parent? And I think the answer is plain; they did not fare as well as they should have.', 'Take the case of a farmer. He has to pay 6 to 7 percent now on his notes, maybe 8. With that money, he could buy new equipment or more land or more feed or new machinery. But instead he is paying off old debts. That is one of the reasons why farm income sagged nearly $4 billion in the last 7 years. That is why 700,000 family farm units have been liquidated in the last 7 years.', 'Take the case of the small businessman. He has to compete with the gigantic corporation. The gigantic corporations have no difficulty getting credit. They are prime borrowers. They can borrow out of their own funds or they can go to the bank and stand at the head of the line. The smaller businessman who is not as good a credit risk, who must finance his expansion out of loans, he is hit when he has to pay 5 or 6 percent instead of 4 percent. That is one reason why small business profits have been cut in half since 1947. That is why there were three times as many small business failures in 1959 as in 1947.', 'Take the case of a homeowner. The interest a man would have to pay on a $10,000 house with a 30-year mortgage rose by only 1 1/2 percent. That does not sound like much. But that means $3,000 more he pays for that house before he pays off his mortgage, and that is one reason why housing starts are off 20 percent this year, even though our population is increasing by 3 million a year. That is why there is unemployment in lumberyards and that is why some of our mills in Oregon are closing down.', 'In 1952, a typical school district wanting to build a million-dollar school faced interest on their bonds of $328,000. Now it would have to face charges of $628,000 in the short space of 8 years. I know of a school district in Hempstead, N.Y., that recently floated a $5 million school bond at an interest of 4.3 percent. If the 1952 rate had been in effect, that district would have saved $1,300,000, enough to build a school for 900 people. But the high interest rate was in effect, and it cost so much more to get started on your schools, and it costs so much more to provide for your State financing in the State of Ohio.', 'Mr. Nixon may be satisfied with what we are now doing. I am not. This is a subject which does not command great interest, but it should, because it is a factor in providing stimulation to our economic growth or providing limitation on our economic growth, and to concentration by the administration on monetary policy which has included high interest rates, in my opinion contributed to the recession of 1954, intensified the recession of 1958. Every businessman here knows that in the fall of 1957 the Federal Reserve with deflation coming on and recession coming on, instead of relaxing credit, intensified credit in September 1957, which intensified the recession of 1958. I do not say that monetary policy is the entire answer. There are other problems which go to economic growth. But I must say that I do not believe we have been so successful in our fight against an increase in the cost of living to warrant the reliance on this policy in the next 4 years. I feel that by a suitable adjustment of monetary and fiscal policies, particularly a fiscal policy which goes to the government obligations per year, our surplus on our expenditures and all the rest, I believe it is possible, to maintain a greater stimulation to our economy and at the same time provide a reasonable control over increase in inflation.', ""The fact of the matter is inflation would be far more apparent if it had not been for the sharp decline in farm income. Actually those of us who may be in business know that industrial costs have gone up nearly 30 percent in the last 8 years; some due to labor costs, some due to other reasons, but one of the reasons has been the monetary policy of this administration. It is one of the issues which separates Mr. Nixon and myself. And I believe that in attempting to make a judgment on what this country must do we consider our obligations at home and abroad, we consider the needs of our time, we consider the kind of judgment which has been rendered on the great questions which face our country, we consider what the candidates' view is of our peril and our opportunities, and I must say that in my opinion, after having been on the Foreign Relations Committee for a number of years and serving in the Congress, there is no doubt in my mind that the judgment reached by bipartisan committees of the best talents we have in the last 3 years, the Gaither committee, the Rockefeller Brothers report, Governor Rockefeller's own speeches, General Gavin, General Taylor, Ridgway and all the others, have held the view that the peril of the United States is increasing, and, therefore, any American who does not agree with that, who feels that the kind of leadership which we now have should be maintained, who feels that candidates who looking at the world around them are reassured - in my opinion the choice is between not merely the Republicans and the Democrats. It is between the concerned and the comfortable. [Applause.] I believe that this is not merely a contest, if I may say so, between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is a contest between a whole group of people on both sides. I hope that if we are successful in this campaign it will be possible for us to bring to governmental service the best talent we have in America, the best kind of talent we have in both parties, the kind of talent which is concerned about our position in the world, which looks to the future, that believes that the United States is due for another great surge forward."", 'I must say that the problems that we will face in the next 10 years are far more complex than any that Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman faced, particularly in the field of foreign policy. What has happened in the last 2 years in the field of foreign policy indicates a whole technique of subversion and infiltration which will be extremely hard to counter. The threat that Franklin Roosevelt faced and Harry Truman faced was the threat of military action across national boundaries, the kind of action taken by Hitler in Poland, the kind of action taken by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. That was a formidable challenge, but it represented a simple kind of challenge in the sense that it required us to mobilize our resources and go to work.', 'The same really was true at the time of the Truman doctrine, the same was true at the time of NATO and even the Marshall plan. Now, however, the experience of Cuba, the experience of Laos, the increasing Communist influence in Ghana, and Guinea the turmoil in the Congo, indicates the situation - the situation in Tibet - all of that indicates a technique of conquest which does not rely on direct military intervention across national boundaries. It relies in part on the threat of that intervention but not the reality. But instead relies on building cells within those countries, playing on the hostility to us, playing in some cases on our indifference to the problems of the people, playing on their poverty and disease and ignorance, playing on our wealth, playing on our sense of comfort, playing on the inadequacy on occasion of our representatives abroad, playing on the image of America as no longer a vital, vigorous, moving society, and, therefore, young men on the make turn often in many of those countries to the far left for aid and comfort, and what is true in Cuba is going to be a struggle all over Latin America. Every politician who is out, who seeks power, will decide whether the future lies with us or with the Castros and their running mates. Therefore, in my judgment, to fight that kind of intervention will require - that kind of conquest, will require a far greater subtlety, far more constant vigilance, far greater personnel, far greater foresight than we have ever shown before.', ""We spent more money in Laos than any other country. We have been paying the army of Laos for years. Yet according to the headlines of the last 2 or 3 days, Laos may slip behind the Bamboo Curtain. Three hundred million dollars went into Laos in the last few years, mostly in surplus military equipment, and yet when a captain of the paratroopers made his determinations, it may mean that Laos, which holds the key to much of Southeast Asia, may be lost. When a minor general of the Iraqui Army made his decision for power and seized control of Iraq against the forces of the West, it changed the whole balance of power in the Middle East. A bomb which might go off in Jordan ki]ling the King might change the whole balance of power in Jordan. So hazard is going to be our companion, and those who can find reassurance in present events in my opinion should not hold power in the 1960's. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
293,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Patterson and, I hope, the next Congressman Gov. Mike Di Salle, distinguished county officials, ladies and gentlemen; I want to express my appreciation to all of you for being kind enough to come out and welcome us today. I come here as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States. I come here in 1960, just 40 years after a young man, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., came in 1920, to this State, to this city, to visit Governor Cox, who had been nominated for the office of President of the United States. After Franklin Roosevelt and Governor Cox met in 1920, they journeyed to Washington and there called on President Woodrow Wilson, who was then old and sick and finishing as President of the United States. When President Wilson described to them his view of a world at peace, a world in which the United States assumed the burdens of world peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, ""President Wilson, we are with you 100 percent,"" and they ran on the Wilson program and were defeated. But they ran on that program because they felt it incumbent upon them to bear the burden of responsibility and to serve the Democratic Party for the people of this country. What good is a political party, Woodrow Wilson once said, unless it is fulfilling a great purpose for the Nation? And I want to make it clear, the basis upon which we run this year. Our argument with Mr. Nixon and the Republicans is very clear, and very important and very sharp and very distinct, and it involves the lives and the fortunes of everyone in this square. Mr. Nixon holds the view of the world which believes that the power of the United States is at its highest, that our power is steadily rising, that our influence is growing, and he points to our position at the United Nations, our position around the world, our military power, our economic growth, the strength of our educational system, our vitality as a Nation, to justify his argument that what we need is 4 more years of what we have had. [Response from the audience.]', 'I want to make it clear that I disagree with that view completely. [Applause.] I do not hold with the view that everything we are now doing is being done in good measure. I do not hold with the view that the relative power and influence of the United States is increasing in relation to that of the Communists. I do not hold with the view that we are growing sufficiently here at home to provide full employment for our people. I do not hold with the view that everything that should be done is being done, when 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. [Response from the audience.]', ""I do not hold with that view when I read this morning's paper from Cuba. I do not hold with that view when I look at the United Nations and see on the vote to admit Red China that we received the support of only two nations in all of Africa. I do not hold with that view that everything is proper and everything is secure when I see us using only 50 percent of our steel capacity. I hold the view that if we continue our present policies that the tide of American freedom will go out. I believe that this election is important, and I want to make it very clear that any American who, considering carefully our present position, who, considering carefully the needs of his State and the needs of his country and the position of freedom around the world, any American who can get reassurance from that view should vote for Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.]"", 'But any American who holds the view that I hold, that what we are now doing is not good enough, that this is a great country but it must be greater, it is a powerful country but it must be more powerful, who holds the view that the tide of history can only move in our favor if we move here at home, who holds the view that the power of the United States in recent years has not grown sufficient to our needs, who holds the view that the image of America as a strong and vital and revolutionary country has begun to fade around the world, and that too many leaders in too many countries begin to look now to the East for the solution of their problems - this is the issue. It is as important an issue as any this country has faced in the last 100 years. If Mr. Nixon honestly believes that this is the position of our country in the world, then in my opinion he is either misinformed or he misleads, because you cannot possibly be a citizen of the United States - as Governor Rockefeller pointed out so many times before the Republican Convention this country needs to go ahead, this country cannot be satisfied with being second best.', 'This country cannot settle for being first, if; first, but; first, when; first, maybe. We want to be first on the far side of the moon and here in this country, and that is the issue. [Applause.]', ""As long as there are Americans who want to work and can't find it, as long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard, as long as some of our brightest children never get to realize their opportunities, as long as there are some Americans who, because of their race or their color, are denied their chance to develop their talents, and that of their children, as long as those people to the south of us in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, who stand today on the razor edge of decision, and wonder whether they should move East or West, as long as the world stands poised as it now stands I believe there is need for action here in the United States, and I ask your help in that effort. [Applause.]"", ""Abraham Lincoln put the issue 100 years ago when he said the question was whether this Nation could exist half slave and half free. Now the question is whether the world will exist half slave and half free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery. And in the last 3 years, Cuba, now perhaps this week Laos, countries which have fallen into the sphere of Foreign influence, who fall into a position of supporting Communist policy, Guinea, to a degree Ghana, perhaps the Congo before we are finished in the fall - all this indicates a sense of vitality and motion in the Communist expansion which we have not matched. I hold the greatest possible confidence in this country. I do not believe that there are any problems which once set before us cannot be met. But what I object to is reassurances that everything is sound now and that no greater effort is needed. That is the issue which faces us. [Applause.] And you have an opportunity to choose. On November 8, you, individually, can make your judgment of what your country is, what it must be, what it should do, what responsibilities you are willing to assume, whether you feel individually - not because somebody says so, but because it is your judgment and you can make this judgment as well as anybody in the world - do you feel yourself that this country is moving the way it should? If you do, then, of course, there is no doubt of your decision. But if you hold with our view that action is required, the same kind of action that Franklin Roosevelt presented to the American people in the early years of the 1930's, the same kind of action which Woodrow Wilson presented to the American people in the new freedom away back in 1913 and 1914, if you hold with that view that the United States has stood still long enough and now once again we are about to begin a great march forward, on that basis I ask you to join with us. I ask you to join with us in moving this country forward again. [Applause.]"", ""Let me make it very clear that this country will not be in a position of influence around the world, we will not be the great defender of freedom around the globe, unless we are strong here in the United States, unless we are moving here in this country. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor here in the United States, because he set before our society its unfinished business. So I come to Dayton in the State of Ohio, which in the next 3 weeks will make the great judgment for the 1960's, and I come not with any alarm but with a sense of urgency, and ask you to join us, ask you to contribute to the welfare of this country, not merely as a great country, but also because what we do here, the vitality which we show here, then will really determine whether the world will exist free or slave."", 'One hundred years ago Lincoln wrote a friend, ""I know there is a God and that he hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and his hand is in it. But if he has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.""', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God, and we know he hates injustice, and we see the storm coming.

294,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Di Salle, our next Congressman-to-be Sullivan, we hope, ladies and gentlemen, there is a terrible rumor to the effect that this is a Republican community. I am sure it is not true. [Laughter.] But it would be interesting to know how many Republicans have we here today. Will you hold up your hands? [Response from the audience.] Let us see how many Republicans with an open mind we have got. Two. [Laughter.] Well, there is some prospect. [Laughter.]', 'I am delighted to be here today and whether you came as Democrats, Republicans, independents, convinced, unconvinced, I do appreciate the chance to speak with you.', ""This is an important election. Our role, Mr. Nixon's and mine, is important, because it is our function to present the position of our party on the great issues which face our country. We work hard from the time we are nominated until election day, November 8, and then you work, because then you make your judgment, and any citizen of this country who on this occasion takes that judgment lightly, of course, does not meet his responsibilities as a citizen. I would say the judgment you make on November 8, 1960, as to which candidate you select, not only for the Congress and for the various other offices, your judgment as to which political philosophy should lead our country, your judgment of the state of our national development, the state of our national opportunities, the state of our national peril, the state of our national challenge, all that meets on November 8 when you make your judgment as to who you want to be the President of the United States."", ""I know in these times, and through our history, that many people feel the whole trend of our history is due completely to our power as a nation, through the forces of history, and that human decisions and human personality and the judgment of the President do not really affect directly your lives, your fortunes. I don't think that is true in the 1960's."", 'The President of the United States has the great power not only of war and peace, not only of defending our commitments abroad, but also of setting before the American people the unfinished business of our society. I will give you two problems which face us as citizens and face the next President of the United States. One of them is called industrial employment in the State of Ohio and around the country and the other involves agriculture.', 'There are in this country now nearly 4 1/2 million people out of work. There are 3 million people who are working part time, and yet we had a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958; now, 2 years later we have a slowdown. We are using today only 50 percent of the capacity of our steel. The Soviet Union last week came close to outproducing us, even though they have only one-half of our capacity. The reason, of course, is that we can produce more than we can consume. We can produce more in our factories and more on the farms than we can consume at a decent price. Therefore, our steel mills work 50 percent, 100,000 steelworkers are out of work, it affects coal, chemicals, paper, everything. It affects Detroit. How can the next administration so provide an atmosphere for our economy where our country begins to move ahead, where our people work, where our facilities are used, particularly at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men?', 'Those of you who are farmers have seen that on your farms in the last 20 years. Those of you who live in the city know that a machine comes along and takes the jobs of 5 men or 10 men. We are going to have to provide, in order to get a job for every American who wants one, and this affects those of you who are on farms because many of you hold part-time jobs in the city - and if you are not finding full employment in the cities, you are the first to be laid off, because you have a part-time job. The fact of the matter is you are going to have to find in this country - the next President is going to have to give leadership - 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years, and we are going to have to do that if we are going to keep our people working, and we are going to have to do that if we are going to strengthen our country, and we are going to have to do that if we are going to protect our commitments around the world. We are going to have to move. We are going to have to provide an economy, an atmosphere and leadership which will provide full employment for our people. That is one problem.', 'The second problem is the decline in agricultural income. I believe that the decline in agricultural income is the most difficult and important domestic problem facing the United States, both because of its effect on farmers and because of its effect on industry. The farmers of the United States are the No.1 market for Detroit automobiles. When farm income drops, Detroit slows up. When Detroit slows up, Pittsburgh steel slows up, and we have lost in the last 8 years nearly $33 billion of farm income. This administration, and some of you are Republicans - you feel you want to vote for the Republicans because they run a careful, frugal, responsible government. Mr. Benson has spent more money in the last 8 years than all of the Secretaries of Agriculture in the history of our country, stretching back 100 years. We now have $9 billion of surplus food stored away in a hungry world. Our farm income has dropped nearly 23 percent in the last 18 months. The average wage for a dairy farmer in a State like this, or Wisconsin, is about 53 cents an hour. If a farmer was paid according to his hours, the money he has invested in his farm, and his managerial skill, farm prices would have to go up 60 percent, so low is his income.', 'Now, this decline is continuing, and the program that Mr. Nixon has put forward in my opinion will provide for a further decline in farm income, because he provides the same program that Mr. Benson provides, which is a support price for corn or wheat, soybeans, whatever it may be, which is tied to 90 percent of the average market price for the 3 previous years. Now, as the market price drops so drops the support price. Where you had $1.50 for corn 8 years ago, you may be, getting 90 cents for corn today, or 93 cents. That is the market price. Mr. Nixon will pay you 90 percent of that market price next year, and if it drops to 85 cents, he will pay you 90 percent of that, and that is the step, down, down, down, until farmers are driven off their farms in increasing numbers.', 'Now, you have to make a judgment whether you consider that policy to be in your interest. If you do, you should vote with Mr. Nixon. If you consider the position of the United States in the world improving, if you feel secure, if you think the possibilities of your children living in peace and freedom, if you look to the news in the morning paper of Mr. Castro\'s utter contempt for the United States, because that is what he was demonstrating, his indifference to our reaction, his conviction that time is on his side, not only in his own country, but throughout Latin America - if you can support a candidate who, in this most dangerous time, runs on the slogan, ""You never had itso good,"" then you should vote for Mr. Nixon.', 'But if you hold the view, whether you are a farmer, whether you are an industrial worker, whether you are a citizen, whether you have children in school who want and need a good education, whether you have a view of the United States as fulfilling a great destiny in a dangerous time in the life of freedom, then I ask you to join us. This is not a fight between Republicans and Democrats: this is a fight between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who look forward and those who stand still, between those who believe that all we have to do is what we are doing now and more, and those who believe it is time for a great movement forward for our country again. [Applause.]', 'So I come to London, Ohio, and I come to this Republican community, and I come here without any hesitation at all in asking your support. I come because [applause] because I believe that this country deserves the best that we have. I believe that this country requires leadership which will place before us the things we must do if we are going to maintain our freedom. Because I would like to see the United States, which sits on a most conspicuous stage, set an example of what freedom can mean, that freedom and prosperity go hand in hand, that liberty is the handmaiden of abundance, and that this great country of ours can be greater, this powerful country of ours can be more powerful, this country of ours can move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
295,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, Governor Di Salle, Chairman Holbrooke, distinguished Democrats, ladies and gentlemen, in the first place, I am grateful to the Governor for what he said. There used to be an old expression that Ohio is the mother of Presidents. You have run more candidates for the Presidency than any other State of the Union. But in a very real sense, I believe that Ohio has had a maternal effect on my candidacy. When the Governor announced his support for me last January, it was the first major support we had received after becoming a candidate, and his support and the support of the delegation in July, his present support and your support, and I hope the support of the State of Ohio, in November, I think will let us win. [Applause.]', 'I would like to congratulate the Butler County Democrats. This is about the size program that they have in New York City or Philadelphia, at some major evening meetings, at which all the important Democrats from around the country come up. But to do all this for breakfast in the morning, arrange this program, and for all of you to contribute the way you have, I think shows that you really believe that a political party should serve the Nation, and this time the Democratic Party can serve not merely ourselves as a political exercise, but is serving a great national purpose, and I believe that your contribution here in this county, here in the State of Ohio - I hope you will feel if we are successful that it has contributed to the well-being of our country, which is our object.', 'In addition, I have never seen this quotation of Andrew Jackson\'s. I think it is ideal for this campaign at this time. ""The eyes of the people are fast opening, fight on."" We will use that as our slogan for the next 3 weeks. [Applause.)', 'I assume that your presence here indicates that you are all politicians. Artemus Ward from Massachusetts, my own State, 50 years years ago, said, ""I am not a politician and my other habits are good, also."" [Laughter.] This time we are politicians. We are politicians in the sense that we believe political action through one of the political parties, in our case the Democratic Party, is the best means of achieving service for our country. By participating in the Democratic Party as you have done, and as the people before you in this county have done, you made a direct contribution to the success of Woodrow Wilson\'s new freedom. The Democrats like you in this county and State before made a direct contribution not merely to the election of Franklin Roosevelt, but all the things that flowed from that election. Those of you who participated in the election of President Truman in 1948, when he carried Ohio by 7,OOO votes, you contributed to the NATO, the Truman doctrine, the Marshall plan, point 4. These matters do not end on election day. All this is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and the end is service to our country, its well-being, its strength, its prosperity, jobs for our people, better homes, better working conditions, strengthening the cause of freedom. That is what we are engaged in. That is the purpose of our assembling together, and I congratulate you and I express my appreciation to you. [Applause.]', 'Forty years ago this year a young New Yorker journeyed to Ohio and called on your Governor, James Cox. He was, of course, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was running in 1920 for the Vice Presidency of the United States, with Governor Cox of Ohio. Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt then journeyed to Washington, D.C., and went to see Woodrow Wilson, sick, aging, and at the end of his career. After Woodrow Wilson talked for a few minutes however, with great feeling and great fire of his desire for a unified world and a world of peace, Governor Cox broke in and said, ""We are behind you 100 percent,"" and they fought that campaign in part to implement the ideal of Woodrow Wilson for the establishment of the League of Nations, and lost. But Governor Cox and Franklin Roosevelt in losing that election in 1920 held before themselves and the people their concept of the service that they can render in an election, of attempting to turn the attention of the people to the great issues that face us, and the great possibilities that lie in action in the future. And I believe in this election 40 years later we merely do not run for office, but we also seek to establish a basic point, that what this country is now doing is not good enough, that in the 1960\'s, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to meet our commitments at home and abroad, we have to do better, and that is the basic issue which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself. [Applause.]', 'They have not noted a sense of urgency, they have run on the slogan of peace and prosperity, they have run on the slogan of ""You never had it so good."" If Mr. Nixon honestly believes that, then in my judgment he has completely misread the trend of the times. If he does not believe it and runs on those slogans merely as a device for winning this election, then he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in 1935 in England, which cost the British so heavily and almost resulted in the enslavement of Europe. I believe that on this occasion this year, in this election the Democratic Party is on the side of right, because our basic feeling is that unless this country is prepared to move again in the 1960\'s, we will not lose only our position as the leaders of the free world, but we will also endanger our security. Therefore, being on the right side, win or lose, I believe we contribute to the well-being of this Nation and my judgment is we will win. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Governor Di Salle, candidates for Congress, Mr. State Chairman, State senator, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, during the contest between Lincoln and General McClellan in 1864, and when the issue was still in doubt as to who would be President in January 1865, he received word that Ohio had voted for him, and he sent word that night, ""Thank God, Ohio has saved the Union."" Well, on the night of November 8, I would like to send a similar wire, if that is all right with you. I would like to see Ohio go Democratic. [Applause.] I would like to send a wire to your distinguished Governor saying, ""Thank God, Ohio has gone Democratic again."" [Applause.]', 'When I was on ""Meet the Press"" last night, I was reminded that I had come to Ohio seven times in the last 3 months. That is a lot of times. But I come to Ohio because in my judgment this State may be decisive in the election of the next President of the United States, and on your judgment, on your sense of the future of this country, on your estimate of our present position and the needs of our country, may well hang the determination as to which party, which candidate, which political philosophy, will lead the United States in the dangerous years of the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon has stated - Mr. Nixon has said the goals of our two parties are the same. Where we differ are the means. I don't accept that view at all. We have disagreed. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon considers a minimum wage of $1.25 to be extreme. Mr. Nixon considers Federal aid to make sure that teachers are paid a decent salary to be extreme. Mr. Nixon believes a housing bill which will build homes for our people is extreme. Mr. Nixon believes that medical care for our older citizens tied to social security is extreme."", 'We disagree on the goals of our country and we disagree on the means of attaining these goals. And it is a source of interest to me that I feel that it would be in the interest of this country for Mr. Nixon and I to continue these discussions on TV, to have a fifth debate. [Applause.]', ""I received word today that Mr. Nixon would not agree to a fifth debate. I don't understand anyone who can stand up to Mr. Khrushchev, can argue with Mr. Khrushchev, can put his finger in Mr. Khrushchev's face, who isn't willing to meet his Democratic competitor here in the United States. [Applause.]"", '[Inaudible.]', 'Senator KENNEDY. Maybe it is easier to do it over there, but I think it would be advantageous for the people of this country to hear us on television to discuss how we shall win the peace and maintain our freedom, how we shall build the economy of this country, how we shall provide full employment for our people, how we shall carry on and turn the balance of power in our direction.', ""That certainly is worth an hour of Mr. Nixon's time in the last 18 days of the campaign. [Applause.]"", ""I stand tonight where Franklin Roosevelt began his campaign in 1932 for the Presidency of the United States, here in this State, in this very city. He came here and began the New Deal. He began the march forward that resulted in the progress of the thirties and the forties. He laid the groundwork on which we run now in 1960. During Franklin Roosevelt's second speech when he accepted the nomination for the second time, before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, in that speech he said:"", '\n  Governments can err Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'And that is the choice the people of this country have. Do you want a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference? Do you want a government that moves this country forward? That sets before the American people the unfinished agenda, the things we must do if we are going to maintain our freedom and the freedom of those who look to us for help? That is the issue and in my judgment it is as important an issue as this country ever faced. It is my judgment a question as to whether the United States is meeting its responsibilities here at home and abroad, whether the tide of history is moving in our favor or that of the Communists, whether our prestige has been at a record high, as Mr. Nixon says it is, and that of the Communists at a new low, or whether historians will say in 1970 that in these years the United States stood still, in these years the Communist advance increased, in these years in Latin America and Africa and Asia the image of the United States as a vital power began to fade.', 'That is the question that you must decide as voters. No one else will make that decision. You must determine whether in your judgment this country must do more in order to move ahead, whether what we are doing now is enough or whether we must do better. That is the basic question. It is on that question that we differ. It is on that question that our two parties divide, and it is a question that only you can answer on November 8.', 'I want to make it perfectly clear where I stand. I believe that this is a great country, but it must be greater. I believe this is a powerful country but it must be more powerful. I do not believe the tide of history is moving in our favor. I do not believe that we are doing enough. I do not believe that we occupy a position in Latin America and Africa and Asia as strong as we did a decade ago. I do not believe that our relative position in the world, militarily, vis-a-vis the Soviet Union, is as strong as it was a decade ago.', 'I am not satisfied as an American, where 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never get to college. I am not satisfied as an American to have the Soviet Union producing twice as many scientists and engineers as we are. I am not satisfied as an American to have them first on the moon, nor am I satisfied as an American to know that in the United States today we use only 50 percent of our steel capacity, and there are 100,000 steelworkers out of work. I am not satisfied with those things and you have to determine whether you are.

You can make a judgment that this country must go ahead. You can make a judgment to place responsibility on those who believe it must move. You can make a judgment to sustain us in this election, and on that basis I come here tonight and ask your help. [Applause.]', 'As long as there are 15 million Americans who live in substandard homes, as long as the average wage for laundry women in five large cities of the United States, and most of them are Negroes, is 65 cents for a 48-hour week, as long as the average unemployment compensation check in this rich country is less than $31 a week for a man out of work to support his family, as long as nearly 5 million Americans live on a surplus food package from the Government that amounts to 5 cents a day per person, as long as in Cuba and in other places in Latin America, as long as Africa, begins to turn against us, as long as we no longer possess an image in the world of a society on the move, so long is there need for our party on this occasion, and I come and ask your support.

[Laughter and applause.]', '""We do not want to take the cash and let the credit go, nor heed the rumble of a distant drum."" I can predict to you that if this country does not make a decision for progress on November 8, if we continue in our present sense of urgency, which is a lack of it if we select leadership which believes that everything is right in its time, then I believe that we will judge 4 years from now that we have made a serious error.', 'We have a chance to correct the future. We have a chance to participate in it. We have a chance to rejoin the world as a leader of the free world. We have a chance to build in this country the kind of society which people all over the world who want to be free say, ""This is the direction I want to go.""

297,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Di Salle, Congressman-to-be Mr. Sullivan, local candidates, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming today. This election is important and I think your presence today indicates that you recognize that upon your decision of November 8, upon the decision that you render as to which political party and which candidates and which political philosophy will lead this country, rests in good measure the position of the United States in the 1960's."", ""I come here today as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, and I divide the problems which our country will face in the 1960's into two parts. in the first place, we have our responsibilities toward our people in this country, toward the 15 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $78 a month. And yet this administration has refused to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security in the same way as they opposed social security itself 25 years ago."", ""But in this area, and in minimum wage and in housing and in social justice, we move in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] I want to emphasize that that is only one phase of our problems in the 1960's. The other phase deals with the problem that you and this community face every day, every day at this airbase, and it deals with what I consider to be a most important policy for the next President of the United States."", 'In 1941 Albert Einstein and several other people came to see Franklin Roosevelt and told him that an investment of over $2 billion would make the United States the strongest military power in the history of the world by cracking the atom. Franklin Roosevelt could have dismissed it, but the same man who saw in the Tennessee Valley an opportunity for harnessing the resources of that valley for the service of our country was the same man who said ""Yes"" to that long gamble and provided security for the United States in the last 20 years.', 'Now the same situation faced the United States in 1954 and 1955, and that was the question of how important it was to be first in outer space, and what answer did this administration give. It regarded it as a scientific experiment. Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Defense said he was not interested to know what was on the other side of the moon. He said money spent on basic research was unimportant because he was not interested to find out why fried potatoes turned brown.', ""The result is that the Soviet Union today is No.1 in outer space. The difference between Franklin Roosevelt's response at the beginning of World War II and this administration's response to this question in the middle fifties, in my opinion, indicates a basic difference between the two political philosophies that are now contending. I could not possibly say what the problems will be in the 1960's that are going to face the United States, that are going to be new. No one knows. Dwight Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson did not run on the question of outer space in 1952, nor did Wendell Willkie and Franklin Roosevelt run on harnessing the atom in 1940. There are going to be problems entirely new in space, in the air, in the water, under ground, in men's minds. In 1957 we had more people in West Germany in U.S. Embassies than we did in all of Africa, because no one imagined in 1953, 1954, and 1955, and 1956 that Africa would come to be one of the most important continents of the world. We have in the whole Foreign Service today 26 Negroes, out of 6,000 people. And yet a majority of the world is colored, and Africa will hold one-fourth of all the votes in the General Assembly."", 'Mr. Nixon went to Cuba in 1955. He praised the competence, and I quote him, ""and stability of the Batista regime."" Three years later Mr. Castro was to dominate Cuba. With all of the effects it has on our own security, the problem that you have to decide - you cannot tell what is going to happen in this country in the next 4 or 8 years. You have to make a judgment as to which candidates in discussing the problems that we now face, the problems that we now see, the responsibilities which the President and the Government and the people must meet, which candidate in your judgment and which party comes closest to being prepared to move into the 1960\'s. And on that basis I stand here as the descendant, politically, of Thomas Jefferson, who made the Louisiana Purchase, of Woodrow Wilson\'s new freedom, of Franklin Roosevelt, who extended the boundaries of our influence around the globe.', 'There are in Africa today children called Roosevelt, Washington, Jefferson. There are none called Mr. Nixon. [Laughter.] I do not say these problems are easy. The problem of full employment, of automation, of increasing educational opportunities, of providing for constitutional rights for all Americans so that every American can realize his talents, of providing an image around the world to Africa and Asia and Latin America of a vital and vigorous and revolutionary society - all that is incumbent upon us as citizens.', 'The question is which party, which candidate can best move this country, can best strengthen the cause of freedom, can best assemble the talent that is in our country to move to the far horizons of human experience and knowledge.', 'I come from the oldest political party on earth, the Democratic Party, but I come with a party which is young, which is willing, in my opinion, to move out,to move beyond, that does not run in 1960 on the platform of ""We\'ve never had it so good."" I run on a program that we must do better, that we owe it to ourselves and our country and our system to give it the best we have. I come here to Ohio today, as we move into the last 3 weeks of a great presidential campaign which involves a very basic decision by each of you: What do you see for yourselves? What responsibility would you like our country to bear? Do you feel the tide of history is moving with us? Do you feel we are riding the crest? Or do you feel that there is around the world a sense that America\'s high noon is past? I don\'t believe it. I hold the view that the tide and history can move with us, that those people who desire to be free outnumber those who are willing to sell their lives to the Communist system, but we have to give leadership. Therefore, I ask your support in this campaign, not saying that life will be easier, but promising that if we are successful this country and freedom will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
298,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['I have spoken many times this fall about the need for a new spirit in Washington - a spirit of dedication - an enthusiasm for progress - a willingness to meet new challenges on the New Frontier of the sixties. If we are successful this fall, such a program will be accomplished only with a government that is honest, a government that is efficient, a government that is dedicated solely to the public interest. I pledge that kind of government to the American people.', 'One cannot make such sweeping promises, however, without recognizing that the have been made before. Every challenger talks about a ""great crusade"" to end corruption - to obtain government ""clean as a hound\'s tooth."" But experience has shown that such promises are not enough. For ours is a government of men, not of promises - and some men yield to temptation - other men lack discrimination - and other men see no wrong in pursuing their private interest in their public capacities.', 'The problem is not merely one of vicuna coats or deep freezes. Less flamboyant but at least equally flagrant are the cases of those who use their office to obtain contracts for firms in which they have a financial interest - those who use their position to repay political or financial debts - those who extract profits from the information they receive or the power they wield.', 'These cases are not only tragic in the public sense - in terms of justice denied, or taxes wasted, or problems ignored. These tragedies have their private effects as well, for cheating in the government cannot help but lead to cheating in the classroom, or on the expense account, or on the quiz show.', 'The appointment of good men, moreover, is not a matter of morality alone. It may not be unethical to appoint an Ambassador who is not acquainted with the language or problems of the country to which he is sent, but it is harmful to the interests of our Nation. It may not be immoral to appoint to key positions men drawn only from the area of private business who intend to return to that business asoon as possible, but the national interest cannot be adequately maintained by top Defense Department officials with an average tenure of less than 1 year. It may not be improper to confine Presidential appointments to the members of one political party - but the whole Nation was the beneficiary from the bipartisan services of such men as Stimson, Knox, Forrestal, McCloy and Lovett.', ""And if we are to open employment opportunities in this country for members of all races and creeds, then the Federal Government must set an example as the Nation's largest employer - and the President, in his key appointments, must set the best example. I am not going to promise a Cabinet post or any other post to any race or ethnic group. That is racism in reverse at its worst. So I do not promise to consider race or religion in my appointments - I promise only that I will not consider them."", 'If we are to keep the cost of living in line and protect the interests of consumers, then those agencies which regulate the cost of public services must be dedicated to their mission, and not concern themselves with future employment or personal ties.', ""I am making no charges and mentioning no names. For history teaches us that no party has a monopoly on honesty. Both parties attract their share of crooks and weaklings. But that does not mean that these problems are incapable of solution. That does not mean that a campaign promise is enough. A new administration must screen out those who regard Government service as the door to power or wealth, those who cannot distinguish between private gains and public trust, and those who believe that old-fashioned honesty with the public's money is both old and out of fashion."", 'And the next President himself must set the moral tone - and I refer not to his language but to his actions in office. For the Presidency, as Franklin Roosevelt observed, ""is preeminently a place of moral leadership"" - and I intend to restore that kind of leadership and atmosphere beginning in 1961.', 'Should I be elected President, it would be my intention to ask the ablest men in the country to make whatever sacrifice is required to bring to the Government a ministry of the best available talent - men with a single-minded loyalty to the national interest - men who would regard ""public office as a public trust."" For no government is better than the men who compose it - and I want the best.', 'It would further be my intention, at the earliest opportunity, to submit to the Congress a single, comprehensive code on conflicts of interest, aimed at eliminating duplications, inadvertencies and gaps, at drawing a clearer line between propriety and impropriety, at protecting the public against unethical behavior without making it impossible for able and conscientious citizens to accept public service.', 'It would also be my intention, through Executive orders, the appointing power and legislation, to reform and streamline our lagging administrative agencies, their organization, and their procedures. Often cases are decided years after the controversy has arisen, years in which the public interest, which the agency is designed to protect, has been severely injured through the action of the regulated industry. For justice delayed is too often justice denied - and these agencies were designed to protect the public swiftly and effectively.', 'But I believe a candidate for President has an obligation to say more than promise new laws, new men and new procedures. I do not want anyone to support me without a clear understanding of the basic personnel principles and ethical practices which will characterize my administration from Inauguration Day on.', 'I would like to take this opportunity, therefore, to set forth the eight basic principles which I intend to use as guidelines to the appointment and conduct of those who will serve under a new administration. This list is not presented as a legal code, complete in detail - although some parts of it may well be spelled out in law, with civil and criminal sanctions. But it does - as a list of illustrations, if nothing else - attempt to inform prospective Federal appointees under a Kennedy administration what they have a right to expect - and it does tell the American voters what they have a right to know - and that is the kind of attitude which the next President himself must exemplify in setting the moral atmosphere in Washington.', 'First, no officer or employee of the executive branch shall use his official position for financial profit or personal gain, or reveal to others for their advantage confidential information acquired through his position. For he serves as a trustee for all the people.', ""Secondly, no officer or employee shall engage in any business transaction with, or hold any financial interest in, or accept any gift, favor, or substantial hospitality for himself or his family, from any enterprise or person who is doing business or seeking to do business with that unit of the Government which he serves or is able to influence, or who is subject to regulation, investigation or litigation under the jurisdiction of that unit. To be above criminality is not enough; I want my appointees, like Caesar's wife, to be above suspicion."", 'Third, all gifts which cannot appropriately be refused, such as gifts from public organizations or foreign governments to the President of the United States, shall immediately be assigned to the Smithsonian Institution or other Federal agencies for historical, scientific, or welfare uses. The President must set the example.', 'Fourth, no Federal appointee to any public regulatory agency shall represent any view other than the public interest. Appointments to such agencies shall be made with the advice of those knowledgeable in the field; but shall not be dictated by those with a vested interest in the appointment. As the constant increases in utility rates and the cost of living in general reveal, the consumer is the only man in our economy without a high-powered lobbyist in Washington. I intend to be that lobbyist.', 'Fifth, no member of any such agency, and no person who assists in its decision, shall entertain any ex parte communication from any person, including political pressure or requests originating within the executive or legislative branches, concerning any case or other proceeding which is determined solely upon matters of record, unless that communication is made a part of the record and every party at interest is given an opportunity to reply. As Finley Peter Dunne\'s Mr. Dooley used to say: ""Trust everyone - but cut the cards.""', 'Sixth, all appointments, both high and low, will be made on the basis of ability, without regard to race, creed, national origin, sex section, or occupation. Campaign contributions will not be regarded as a substitute for training and experience for diplomatic positions; and appointees shall be drawn from all segments of the country, wherever the best talent can be found. This will not be a businessman\'s administration, with ""business in the saddle,"" as Secretary McKay once described his mission, but neither will it be a labor administration, or a farmer\'s administration. It will be an administration of, for, and by the people.', 'Seventh, senior positions in the State Department, the Foreign Service and the Defense Department shall be filled by the best talent in both parties, and from the ranks of career diplomats and civil servants; and officials engaged primarily in the conduct of foreign and defense activities will not be permitted to participate actively in political campaigns. I do not want our politics colored by considerations of national security, and I do not want our national security colored by considerations of politics.', 'Eighth, preference in appointments will be given to those willing to commit themselves to stay on the job long enough to apply what they learn. The goal is a full time effort for the full tenure of the presidential term, without regard to any prior affiliation or prospective employment. The prospects for the Nation in the coming years are not easy; the tasks facing the President will not be easy; and no appointee should assume his life will be any easier.', 'These eight guidelines are not a magic formula for achieving a government perfect in all its parts. All human weakness cannot be avoided. All errors of judgment cannot be predicted. A code of ethics by itself, when confronted with a concrete case, may be found either too general to be meaningful or too specific to be enforceable.', 'But these guidelines can illustrate an atmosphere, a tone of government, an attitude which a new President will take. And they emphasize this basic principle: The essence of any government that belongs to the people must lie in the Biblical injunction: ""No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other."" All America seeks a government where no man holds to his own interest and despises the public interest, and where all men serve only the public, and love that master well.']"
299,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['Twenty-eight years ago, here in Ohio, Franklin Roosevelt launched the campaign that swept the Nation in 1932.', 'At that time the banks were closing and the soup kitchens were opening; the breadlines were forming and the dirt was being blown off the farms. Franklin Roosevelt put forward one of the programs that ended hard times - the program for a Securities Exchange Commission. And he said:', '\n  Our industrial and economic system is made for individual men and women * * * not individual men and women for the system.\n', 'I come to you today as the Democratic candidate for President in 1960. I think we are going to win in Ohio and in the Nation, the kind of victory Roosevelt won in 1932 - a victory for the principle that people are more important than the system.', 'For in 1960, as in 1932, people are in trouble. There may not be mass unemployment, but there is creeping unemployment - in steel, in textiles, in coal, in housing. There may not be soup kitchens, but there are depressed areas in Buffalo and Pittsburgh and West Virginia and Kentucky. There may not be dirt blowing off the land, but the small farmer is being blown off the farms by the thousand. There may not be Herbert Hoover, but there is Richard Nixon.', ""And sometimes I wish it were Mr. Hoover instead. For at least Mr. Hoover cared, at least he was concerned, at least he tried to do something. But Mr. Nixon says he's satisfied. He says we've never had it so good."", ""I'm not satisfied. I think we can do better. I think we can do better in making America strong militarily. I think we can do better in raising our prestige abroad. I think we can do better in having friends, not foes, in Cuba, only 90 miles away. I think we can do better in practicing what we preach about equality before the law without regard to race, creed, or color. I think we can do better in improving and expanding our schools. And I think we can do better in the matter that Franklin Roosevelt touched here in Columbus 28 years ago - in the matter of monetary policy."", 'For 8 years - in season and out, in recession and out, in times of balanced budget and out - this administration has maintained a policy of high interest rates. It has raised the rate on prime business loans by 76 percent. It has raised the rate on FHA loans by 34 percent. It has raised the rate on Treasury bills by 95 percent. It has raised the rate on long-term Government bonds by 52 percent. It has raised the rate on municipal bonds - including bonds for building schools - by 45 percent. It has raised the rate on everything but the air we breathe.', 'And these are not just numbers - they are people. High interest may help the system. The banks in the Federal Reserve System increased their earnings by 81 percent between 1952 and 1959. They fared well. But what I want to know is how fared the farmer? How fared the small businessman? How fared the homeowner? How fared the student, and the teacher, and the parent? And I think the answer is pretty plain. They fared badly. They have been hurt.', ""Take the case of the farmer. He has to pay 6 and 7 percent on his notes. With that money he could buy new equipment, or more land, or more feed. But instead he's paying off old debts. That is why farm income sank $3.5 million in the past 7 years. That's why 700,000 farm units - mostly family farms - were liquidated in the past 7 years. That's why in western Ohio, almost every day, the rural papers announce forced sales of farmland."", ""Take the case of the small businessman. He has to compete with giant corporations. He needs funds for modernization and expansion. But he can't raise funds himself, and he doesn't get credit at the prime rate. He has to go to the bank and pay 5 and 6 percent for it. That's why small business is in bad straits across the country. That's why small business profits have been cut in half since 1947. That's why there were three times as many business failures in 1959 as there were in 1947."", ""Take the case of the homeowner. He needs a loan to build a house. But the rise in interest - tiny as it may seem - adds thousands of dollars to his costs. The interest a man would have to pay on a $10,000 house with a 30-year mortgage rose by only 1 1/2 percent; but that means $3,000 more in his costs. And that's why housing starts are off by 20 percent this year. That's why there is so much unemployment in the lumberyards, and in the companies that make lamps and refrigerators and cabinets and glass, and everything that goes into homes."", 'Take the case of the student, the teacher, and the parent. In 1952, a typical school district wanting to build a million dollar high school, faced payments of $328,000. Now it has to face charges of $628,000. I know of a school district in Hempstead, N.Y., which recently floated a $5 million school bond at an interest of 4.3 percent. If the 1952 rate had been in effect, that district would have saved $1.3 million - enough to build a school for 900 people. But the high interest rate is in effect. And that is why it costs so much to get started on new schools. And that is why so many of our schools are overcrowded, and so many of our teachers overworked.', 'Mr. Nixon may be satisfied. But I say that what hurts the farmer, the small businessman, the homeowner, and the schoolteacher hurts the country. I say that the rigid interest rates of the past 7 years have slowed up the economic growth of the whole Nation. I say that they worked to deepen the recessions of 1954 and 1958. I say that they have cost the taxpayers billions in added interest charges. And I say that I am not satisfied with that.', 'I believe in sound finance. I believe in the balanced budget. I believe in an independent Federal Reserve. But I oppose rigid management of the money system in any special interest. I believe that in the management of our monetary system there must be a balance between many interests.', 'First, account must be taken of the national interest in economic growth. For economic growth is the spring from which there flow high living standards and all public services, including defense. And an interest rate which slows down economic growth ill serves the cause of America and of freedom.', 'Second, account must be taken of the national interest in a sound dollar. Inflation robs every man, but especially the pensioner and the civil servant on fixed incomes of the fruits of hard work. An interest rate that precipitates inflation is no friend of America and the cause of freedom either.', 'Third, account must be taken of the national interest in a stable economy. The economic roller coaster of the past 8 years - the starts and stops and ups and down - has slowed down our overall rate of growth, and done great harm to thousands of individuals caught on the upswing or the downswing. A satisfactory monetary policy is one that would aim at a steady prosperity.', 'Fourth, account must be taken of the national interest in a balance of foreign payments. Low interest rates can cause a flight from the dollar with a resultant drain on our gold reserves. Strong as our economy is at bottom, we cannot afford indefinitely a gold drain. Thus our monetary policy must be geared with our production policies and our foreign policies to assure an overall balance of payments over the long run.', 'I believe a wholesome balance can be struck between these competing requirements. I do not say it will be easy, and I do not seek the Presidency because it is an easy job. I think the balance can be struck because I have faith in the American people - faith in their good sense, faith in their energy, faith in their willingness to make sacrifice for the national interest.', 'The men who first settled this section of the country were known as the men of the ""western waters,"" meaning they were free as the waters to seek their own destiny. I say that we are still free to write our own destiny. I say, as Franklin Roosevelt said here in 1932, that ""the future is ours to conquer and to hold.""']"
300,John F. Kennedy ,"October 17, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Doctor, Governor Di Salle, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Sullivan, distinguished guests, I am very grateful to your president for his warm welcome. This is an old university and has sheltered many ideas in its search for the truth, and today it shelters the Democratic candidate, and I hope with some effect. I come here today to ask you to join us in this campaign, with full recognition that as your president said, I seek the office of the Presidency in the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country, and I think it appropriate that I should bring this campaign to the campus of this distinguished university for two reasons: First, because the students who study here have the longest investment in life in our country. Secondly, because this university stands for freedom, for intellectual freedom, for the search for the truth, and we are all engaged in that great endeavor, and perhaps lastly because if this country is going to not only survive, to endure, but to prevail, at least its system, then there must be the closest cooperation between our universities and our politicians, between our academicians and intellectuals and those who guide our governmental life.', 'During the 19th century, America had many distinguished Senators, Presidents, Congressmen. Many of them have come down as the most celebrated political figures in the history of our country: Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, Henry Clay, Stephen Douglas, all the rest. But it is an interesting fact that most of these men dealt in their whole entire political life, which in the case of Calhoun, Clay, and Webster stretched over a period of 40 years, dealt with only four or five major problems: tariffs, the development of the West, the admission of new States, the role of slavery, the ending of slavery, our relations with England, our relations with France. It occupied them from the first day they went into politics until in the case of Webster he died 40 years later.', 'Now the problems swarm across the desk of the political leaders of this country: monetary and fiscal policy, the control of outer space, disarmament, nuclear cessations, control of agricultural surpluses, control of business cycles, automation, stimulation of our economy, the extension of the franchise to our citizens, the extension of our influence around the world, the struggle for a better world, the struggle for a stronger America, and unless there is the most intimate association between those who look to the far horizons and those who deal with our daily problems, then quite obviously we shall not pass through these stormy times with success, so I am delighted to come here today. I think it is appropriate we bring this campaign here. I hope the Republicans do likewise. And I hope whichever candidate is successful that the association will endure.', 'Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body of Wittenberg is here today, but I am confident I am talking to the future rulers of America in the sense that all educated citizens participate in government, and I am also pleased to see that there are students in this college who are availing themselves of the right of petition as expressed in the American Constitution, a petition for a most important cause, the extension of the franchise to all Americans. I join you in that effort. [Applause.]', 'Many Americans sometimes point out to those who criticize us from abroad that this is a great country, that we have a free system, that we are moving steadily forward in the implementation of our ideals, and then they are disappointed that they are not more impressed abroad. I think the reason is that we have set an extremely high standard for ourselves. We have set a higher standard than any other country, really, than any other system. The promise of the Declaration of Independeuc, the promise of the American Constitution, the words which have been used to implement it by Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Wilson and the rest, set a standard which we must live up to if we are going to extend our influence not only through our own country but if we are going to associate ourselves intimately with those who also seek the road of freedom, and, therefore, in carrying out your effort today you serve your country and you serve the cause of freedom. And let me make it clear, and there should be no disagreement between the two parties on this issue, I believe that every American, regardless of their race, their creed, or their color is entitled not only to vote, but to hold office in our country. [Applause.]', ""In considering what we shall do in the sixties, there is one subject that I have not discussed in this campaign, and that I have chosen to discuss here today. It involves the recognition that if we are to be successful in the days to come, if we are to implement a program for the 1960's, then we need the government that is honest, a government that is efficient a government that is dedicated, a government that is committed solely to the public interest. One cannot make such sweeping promises without recognizing that these promises have been made before. Every challenger for public office, especially for the Presidency, talks about a great crusade to end corruption; to obtain government clean as a hound's tooth. But experience has shown that promises are not enough. For ours is a government of men, not of promises, and some men yield to temptation. Other men lack discrimination, and other men see no wrong in pursuing their private interest in their public capacity. The problem is not merely one of deep freezes and vicuna coats. Less flamboyant but at least equally flagrant are the cases of those who use their office to obtain contracts for firms in which they have a financial interest. Those who use their position to repay political or financial debts, those who extract power from the information they receive, or the power they wield. These cases are not only tragic in the public sense, in terms of justice denied, of taxes wasted, of problems ignored. These tragedies have their private effects as well, for cheating in the Government cannot help but affect cheating in the classroom, on the quiz show, in the expense account. The appointment of good men, moreover is not a matter of morality alone. It may not be unethical to appoint an ambassador who is not acquainted with the language or the problems of the countries involved, but it is harmful to the interest of our Nation. It may not be immoral to appoint to key positions men drawn only from the area of private business who intend to return to that business as soon as possible. But the national interest cannot be maintained by men in our Defense Department with an average tenure of less than 1 year. [Applause.]"", 'It may not be improper to confine Presidential appointees to the members of one party, but the whole Nation was the beneficiary of the service of Stimson, Knox, Forrestal, McCloy, and Lovett, and I can not recall in the last 8 years a single major member of my party who has been appointed to a high position in the national security field, in Defense or in State, with the exception of one man, the Ambassador to Germany, Mr. David Bruce. [Applause.]', 'And if we are to open employment opportunities in this country for members of all races and creeds, then the Federal Government must set an example. There are 26 Negroes in the Foreign Service of the United States, and there are 6,000 members of the Foreign Service. There is not a district judge, Federal district judge, who is a Negro, in the United States, and there are more than 200. There are messengers, laborers, clerks, very few heads of departments. Very few of our facilities and people have been used in extending our influence around the world. It is an interesting fact today that Africa has one-fourth, or will shortly have, of all the votes of the General Assembly. And yet 26 Negroes, spread throughout the entire world, are speading for us as a source of democracy in this country. I believe we can do better. [Applause.]', 'The President himself must set the key example. I am not going to promise a Cabinet post or any other post to any race or ethnic group. That is racism in reverse at its worst. So I do not promise to consider race or religion in my appointments if I am successful. I promise only that I will not consider them. [Applause.]', ""If we are going to keep the cost of living in line and protect the interest of the consumers, then those agencies which regulate the cost of the public services must be dedicated to that mission and not concern themselves with future employment or personalities. I am making no charges and mentioning no names, for history teaches us that no political party has a monopoly on honesty. Both parties attract their share of crooks and weaklings. But that does not mean that these problems are incapable of solution. That does not mean that a campaign promise is enough. A new administration must screen out those who regard Government service as a door to power or wealth. Those who cannot distinguish between private gain and the public interest and those who believe that old-fashioned honesty with the public's money is both old and out of fashion. And the next President himself must set the moral tone and I refer not only to his language, but to his actions in office. [Applause.] For the Presidency, as Franklin Roosevelt himself has said, is preeminently a place of moral leadership. And I intend, if successful, to try to restore that leadership and atmosphere beginning in 1961. [Applause.]"", 'Should I be elected President, it would be my intention to ask the ablest men in the country to make whatever sacrifice is required to bring to the Government a ministry of the best talents available, men with a single-minded loyalty to the national interest, men who would regard public office as a public trust. For no government is better than the men who compose it, and I want the best, and we need the best, and we deserve the best. [Applause.]', 'It would further be my intention at the earliest possible opportunity to submit to the Congress a single comprehensive code on conflicts of interest, aimed at eliminating duplications, inadvertencies and gaps, and drawing a clearer line between propriety and impropriety, and protecting the public against the unethical behavior without making it impossible for the able and conscientious citizen to serve his Government.', 'It would also be my intention through Executive orders, the appointing power and legislation, to reform and streamline our lagging administrative agencies. Of all the undiscussed problems of this campaign, one of the most important is the fact that it takes from 1 year to 3 years for a businessman, a labor union, an interest involved, to get a decision out of our National Government, and justice delayed is justice denied. It would not have been necessary, perhaps, for us to have passed a labor-management reform bill a year ago if it did not require 3 years for the National Labor Relations Board to give the employer or the employee involved relief.', 'We have to do better than this if this great bureaucracy of ours, if this great Government of ours, is going to function in the sixties. We have to prepare it for motion, we have to prepare it to move, we have to get the best people we can get, and then we have to organize our structure so that they can act. And that is not the situation today. [Applause.]', 'I therefore take this opportunity to give you the eight basic principles which I would use if elected President as a guide to the appointment and conduct of those who would serve in a new administration. It is not complete, but I think it does suggest at least the spirit with which we shall move.', 'First, no officer or employee of the executive branch shall use his official position for financial profit or personal gain, or reveal to others confidential information acquired through his position.', 'Second, no officer or employee shall engage in any business transactions with, or hold any financial interest in, or accept any gift, favor, or substantial hospitality for himself and his family from any enterprise or person who is doing business or seeking to do business with that unit of the Government which he serves, or is able to influence, or who is subject to regulation, investigation, or litigation under the jurisdiction of that unit. To be above criminality is not enough. Good judgment is also required. [Applause.]', ""Third, all gifts which cannot appropriately be refused, such as gifts from public organizations or from foreign governments to the President of the United States, shall immediately be assigned to the Smithsonian Institution or other Federal agencies for historic, scientific, or welfare use. [Applause.] The President must set the example not only for those babes who Mr. Nixon described the other day, who were held up in mothers' arms at these meetings, who must be protected [laughter] but for all his subordinates as well."", 'Fourth, no Federal appointee to any public regulatory agency shall represent any view other than the public interest. Appointments to such agencies - and it has been unfortunate in both parties that these agencies which were manned at the beginning of the thirties by men of vision, men of conviction, men of vitality, men of interest, because public attention has passed away from the agencies, it is difficult to get the best talent to come to Washington and work. But we have to do it, because your future, the future of this country, is tied up with the quality of our leadership in all branches of our national service.', 'Fifth, no member of any such agency, and no person who assists in its decisions, shall entertain any ex parte communication from any person, including political pressure or requests originating within the executive or legislative branches. I think it would be a source of satisfaction to Congressmen if this principle were passed into law, that their intervention in these cases is not welcome, so that those people who come down and attempt to pressure Congressmen and Senators to write to executive agencies to gain special privilege for them, if the Congressman or Senator could say ""That day is past; from now on the agency will determine, unless there is abuse of the public trust."" [Applause.] And all communications from the executive branch or the legislative branch shall be made a part of the record, the public record, and every party in interest is given an opportunity to reply. As Finley Peter Dunne\'s ""Mr. Dooley"" used to say, ""Trust everyone, but cut the cards."" [Laughter.]', ""Sixth, all appointments, both high and low, will be made on the basis of ability, without regard to race, creed, national origin, sex, or occupation. Campaign contributions - and this may be bad news for us, at least for the next 3 weeks [laughter] - campaign contributions will not be regarded as a substitute for training and experience for diplomatic positions. [Applause.] And appointees shall be drawn from all segments of the community, wherever the best talent can be found. This will not be a businessman's administration with business in the saddle, as Secretary McKay once described his mission. But neither will it be a labor administration or a farmers' administration. It will be an administration for and by the people. [Applause.]"", 'Seventh, senior positions in the State Department, the Foreign Service, the Defense Department shall be filled by the best talent in both parties, and from the ranks of career diplomats and civil servants, and officials engaged primarily in the conduct of foreign and defense activities will not be permitted to participate actively in political campaigns. I do not want our politics colored by considerations of national security, and I do not want our national security colored by considerations of politics. [Applause.]', 'Eighth, and finally, preferences in appointments will be given to those willing to commit themselves to stay on the job long enough to learn what they must learn. The goal is a full-time effort for the full tenure of the Presidential term, without regard to any prior affiliation or prospective employment. The prospects for the Nation in the coming years are not easy. The tasks facing the President will not be easy, and no appointee should assume that his life will be any easier.', 'These eight guidelines are not a magic formula for achieving a government perfect in all its parts. All human weaknesses cannot be avoided. All errors of judgment can not be predicted. A code of ethics by itself may be found to be either too general to be meaningful or too specific to be enforceable. But these guidelines can illustrate the atmosphere, a tone of government, an attitude which the new President must take. We emphasize this basic principle. The essence of any government that belongs to the people must lie in the biblical injunction, ""No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate one and love the other, or else he will hold to one and despise the other."" All America seeks a government which no man holds to his own interest, and despises the public interest, and where all men serve only the public and love that master well. This is a problem which has disturbed our country for many years, and I do not suggest that the proposals that I have put forward will end the problem. But I do believe it incumbent upon any candidate for the Presidency to indicate in advance to all those who might serve in his office if he is successful, or in his administration, the standards which he will try to apply, which will be applied with vigor, will be applied with a sense of responsibility.', ""I hope, in closing, may I say that all of those of you who are students at this college will consider during your lifetime embarking on a career of public service. In the next 10 years we are going to try to develop in this country a sense of the public interest comparable or superior to what the Soviet Union is able to develop in its country by power of the police state. How many young students at this college are willing to spend part of their lives in Africa or Latin America or Asia, are willing to spend part of their time in this college learning not merely French or Spanish or Italian, but learning some of the esoteric dialects of India or Africa, learning something about those countries, preparing themselves as doctors or teachers or engineers or scientists, or nurses, or public health officials, or Foreign Service officers, to contribute part of your talents, part of the benefits of your education to society as a whole? This college was not founded and has not been maintained merely to give this school's graduates an economic advantage in the life struggle. There is a higher purpose. Prof. Woodrow Wilson said that every man sent out from a college should be a man of his time as well as a man of his nation. I ask you to consider how you can best use the talents which society is now helping develop in you in order to maintain that free society. All of us are involved in the discipline of self-government. All of us in this country, in a sense, are officeholders. All of us make an important decision as to what this country must be and how it must move and what its function shall be, and what its image shall be, and whether it shall stand still, as I believe it is now doing, or whether it shall once again move forward. [Applause.]"", 'I think the basic issue in this campaign is the very serious disagreement which Mr. Nixon and I have as to our relative position in the world today. He has argued that we have never had it so good, that our prestige is at the summit, that we merely have to look at the votes at the United Nations to see where our prestige may stand, that we are the strongest nation in the world, and all is being done in its own good time. I could not disagree more. So that you may have my position clearly when you mabe your judgment on November 8, I could not disagree more. [Applause.]', ""I do not believe when two countries only in Africa vote with us at the United Nations on the admission of Red China - Liberia and the Union of South Africa - I do not agree we are doing everything when we had more foreign students studying here in the United States 10 years ago under the Federal Government programs than we do today. I do not agree when we do not have a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America for the last 8 years, except for 2 months. I do not agree when there are 4 countries in Africa members of the United Nations without a single American diplomat now in occupancy in those countries. I do not agree when Africa, which is going to control one-fourth of all the votes of the General Assembly, receives less than 2 percent of all the development loan assistance that we have poured out for underdeveloped countries last year. I do not agree when West Germany in 1957 had more diplomats stationed within the frontiers of Germany than in all the countries of Africa. I don't agree that everything is being done in good measure."", 'That is the issue which separates Mr. Nixon and myself. If you do not believe that we are moving ahead that we are developing our strength here, that we are presenting an image to the world of a vital and vigorous society, then in my judgment you should support our cause. If you do agree, then I think you should support Mr. Nixon and hold on tight. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
301,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Smathers, my friend and colleague of many years in the House, your distinguished Congressman Charley Bennett, Mayor Burns, Senator Dickinson, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: I am grateful to Senator Smathers for his introduction of me tonight. I served with him in the Congress for over 14 years, and when I was married he stood up for me at my wedding. We are friends, and, therefore, I am honored by his introduction to you who have supported him on the several occasions for the Senate of the United States. I appreciate it, and I am glad to be in Jacksonville. [Applause.]', 'My older brother, who was in the U.S. Navy as a flier, graduated from the Jacksonville Air Base in 1942. My first sea duty was to take a motor torpedo boat from Rhode Island to the Hutchins Naval Base here in Jacksonville, where I stayed a month. So I am glad to be back in Jacksonville. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon had a few critical remarks to make in this same park, and one of them was about the Democratic Party. I love these Republicans who every 4 years say the party doesn't mean anything; what counts is the man. I think what counts is the man the party puts up. The Democratic Party never would have nominated - the Democratic Party never would have nominated Alf Landon. They never would have nominated Thomas E. Dewey, and they never would have nominated Richard Milhous Nixon. [Applause.]"", 'I don\'t understand Mr. Nixon. He journeys to Phoenix, Ariz., to call on his southern manager, Barry Goldwater, and there he says, ""I support the Republican Party from top to bottom. I am a Republican."" He writes to Clarence Budington Kelland, ""I am an economic conservative. I am all the way.""', 'Then he comes to Jacksonville and says, ""Party does not mean anything. What counts is the man."" ""I am a practical conservative"" - whatever that may be.', 'But I am a Democrat. I am a Democrat. [Applause.] The work of my party is not so bad that I have to deny it every 4 years. [Applause.] No Democratic candidate for the Presidency in this century ever ran on a slogan of ""Keep Cool with Coolidge\' [laughter], or ""Return to Normalcy"" (whatever that might be) with Warren G. Harding, or ""Two Chickens in Every Pot."" Where do they get those slogans and where do they get the candidates?', ""We ran on the slogan of the new freedom with Woodrow Wilson. We ran with Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. And we ran with Harry Truman and the Fair Deal. [Applause.] I don't say that parties are an end in themselves, and I don't say that anyone should select a man merely because he has a party label. But I believe in this difficult and dangerous time that the parties do mean something. He said we were not in the Jackson tradition. He goes down to Virginia and says we are not in the Jefferson tradition. Then he goes down and says we are not in the Woodrow Wilson tradition and then we are not in the Franklin Roosevelt tradition. Well, he is in the McKinley, Coolidge, Harding, Dewey tradition, right down the line. [Applause.]"", 'Let me make it clear that the Democratic Party is a national party. I am proud that Lyndon Johnson is running with me. I run as a Democrat. [Applause.] The Democratic Party will continue to serve our entire country. This State sends two U.S. Senators to the Senate. It sends every Congressman but one as a Democrat to the Congress. It is about to elect a Democratic Governor. Now, can you tell me why Florida puts its confidence in the Democratic Party, why I come here to Jacksonville and am introduced by your Senator, Senator Smathers? I sit here with your Congressman, Congressman Bennett. They have served with Mr. Nixon and they have served with me. They have served with Republicans and they have served with Democrats, and they have chosen to support our ticket. [Applause.]', 'Thomas Jefferson founded the Democratic Party when he went on a botanical expedition up the Hudson River with James Madison, searching for butterflies, and they met people in New York and they formed the tie between the rural South and the industrial North, and that tie has been maintained to the present time. I come to Jacksonville, not chasing butterflies, but coming here at this time and asking your support, and I come here and ask you to join, ask you to join us in serving our country.', ""Mr. Nixon said this morning that I should be ashamed of myself, to quote him, and that I should apologize - I don't know to whom - for saying that the United States is not doing as well as it must do economically and militarily. Well, I say it here right in the park, and I do not express the slightest bit of regret, because it is my function and it is my duty, as the standard bearer for my own party, to tell the American people the truth as we see it, and then let you make your honest judgment. [Applause]."", ""Mr. Nixon said this morning Mr. Khrushchev never fooled him. I did not invite Mr. Khrushchev to travel around the United States with Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge as a guest of the American people. [Applause.] I didn't invite him to Camp David. I was glad he came. I approved of his trip. But who does Mr. Nixon think he fools in the last 3 weeks of an election, who does he think he fools when he says we will have no more debates after this week, as he goes around the country casting his innuendoes, suggesting that we in the Democratic Party are not as devoted to the cause of freedom, implying that for some reason or other we were misled by Khrushchev and he understood him all the time? I was not the Vice President of the United States who presided over the communization of Cuba. [Applause.]"", 'Franklin Roosevelt, traveling 20 years ago, said, ""Every place I went in Latin America they cheered \'Long live democracy.\'"" I suppose Mr. Nixon read that just before his trip. I would have thought when the first rock hit him that he would have begun to wonder what had happened. [Applause.]', 'He talked movingly today, this morning and this afternoon and every day about the cheers the Polish people gave him. What has this administration ever done for the Polish people? What has this administration done in building the strength and prestige of the United States? He talks about not losing a single inch of free territory. Cuba? Now Laos. Possibly Guinea. Ghana voting with the Communists, possibly later in the year another country, Communist influence growing, the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil travels not to Washington to get our blessing, but to Havana to see Castro. Does anyone think that Mr. Nixon was right when 5 years ago our experienced Vice President pointed his finger at some unknown face and said, ""Communism is on the decline in Latin America""? I don\'t believe that that is the experience that the American people are going to want for 4 more years.', 'I knew a banker once who served 30 years as president of a bank. He had more experience until his bank went broke than any other banker in Massachusetts. But if I ever go in the banking business, I do not plan to hire him, and he knows the operation from top to bottom. [Laughter.]', 'I want to make it clear that this is an important election, and I believe the alternatives are very clear to the people of this country. It is between a candidate who when hazard and danger and opportunity and challenge are facing us as the defenders of freedom around the world, campaigns on the slogan, ""We\'ve never had it so good."" I don\'t run on that slogan. I run on the slogan ""We must do better."" [Applause.]', ""This isn't the end of the struggle. We have not finished with Mr. Castro. This is a struggle for freedom in Latin America that will go on for the next 10 years. It is a struggle that will go on for the next decade in Africa. It is a struggle that is now going on tonight and will go on for the next decade in Asia. The question you have to decide is whether this administration and Mr. Nixon demonstrated sufficient foresight, sufficient knowledge of the twisting currents that surround us, that ebb and flow through every country of the world. Do you feel the balance of power of the world is shifting with us? Are you satisfied to be second in outer space? Producing in 1950 twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union and today one-half. Our economic growth is one-half or less that of the Soviet Union every year. The Soviet Union last week produced more steel than the United States, mostly because 50 percent of our steel capacity is unused."", ""Florida depends on the economy of the rest of the country. You depend on people visiting the State. You depend on business being good around the country. A rising tide lifts your boats. But this tide is not rising. Our strength is not growing and up. Our challenges are growing. This is a great country, and I have the greatest possible confidence that our generation of Americans can meet any challenge presented to us. But how can we do so when our leadership decides that rather than tell the people the truth, they will carry on this campaign of vague innuendo and suggestion, reassuring our people that everything is all right, the same thing that Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain did in the thirties to England and England's fall was all too close."", ""We don't run on that basis. But if that is what the American people want, if they want to close in and let the future pass them by, take Mr. Nixon. But if you want to move again, if you want this country to meet its responsibilities, if you have confidence that there is nothing we cannot do, once given the opportunity to do so, if you believe that people want to be free as they do, that Khrushchev and Castro and the rest of them represent a system which is as old as time, domination of one man by another, which goes against the grain of every person whether they live in the Soviet Union or whether they live in Cuba - they want to be free. They may be misled, they may be dominated by a police state, they may be scared in other countries that the tide is moving in the direction of the Communists. But ultimately they want to be free."", ""Our experience has shown it best. Hungary's experience showed it. Poland's experience showed it. East Germany showed it. Tibet has shown it. The world will show it. But people will not stay free, this country will not lead, unless we are prepared to meet our responsibilities, and on that basis I come here tonight and ask your help. [Applause.]"", 'I ask you to join us in starting again to move this country forward. In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt said, ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" Now, in 1960, an entirely new generation of Americans is about to assume the leadership of this country, and you as citizens of this city and State have to make your determination of what you want your country to be. The candidates are sharply divided. They present different views of different problems. And it is on your good judgment, your long view, your concern about your own fate, the lives of your children, the security of your country, the cause of freedom, it is on the basis of your good judgment that I rest my case. I want Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro to know that a new generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny, and men who fought for this country\'s freedom in Africa and Italy and the South Pacific are about to strike another blow for freedom in this great country of ours. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
302,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Commander McKneally, Mr. Gray, Mr. Drummey, Commander McGuiness of my own native Massachusetts, member of the executive committee, Gabriel Ottoer, fellow Legionnaires, I am proud as the nominee of my party, to come here to this convention. I have been a member of the American Legion for 15 years. [Applause.] And I have learned a good deal about the Legion, especially since 1949; about the work that this organization has done for national defense, for the youth of America, for the strengthening of our country, for its concern about those Americans who have borne the burden of battle in the defense of their country, and I am proud to be here today. [Applause.]', 'Distinguished guests, Members of Congress, the fundamental problem of our time is the critical situation which has been created by the steady erosion of American power relative to that of the Communists in recent years. That is the fundamental problem which we face as Americans in 1960.', 'We have heard many general claims and boasts, we have heard how we are first in every area of international competition. We have heard about what must be done to stand firm and to stand up to Khrushchev and all the rest. But no amount of oratory, no amount of oratory, no amount of claims, no unjustified charges, can hide the harsh facts behind the rhetoric, behind the soothing words that our prestige has never been higher and that of the Communists never lower. They cannot hide the basic facts that American strength in relation to that of the Sino-Soviet bloc relatively has been slipping, and communism has been steadily advancing until now it rests 90 miles from this city of Miami. [Applause.]', 'The implacable Communist drive for power takes many forms and works in many ways, but behind it all, behind every weapon that they have in their arsenal is one basic fact, and that is the military power of the Communist bloc, for it is here that the Communist advance and relative American decline can be most sharply seen, and it is here that the danger to our survival is the greatest.', 'The development in 1953 of a relatively small hydrogen warhead made missiles the key to future military power. The Soviet Union decided then to go all out in missile development. But here in the United States we cut back our funds for missile development and in our race for outer space. We slowed up the modernization of our conventional forces. We will not have, for example, the new rifle to replace the M-1, which was used by you in World War II and Korea, for 5 years, before there is a complete replacement. [Applause.] And still today the Soviet Union is rapidly building up a striking force that endangers our power to retaliate and our survival itself.', 'For the harsh facts of the matter are that our relative military strength has not increased as fast as the Russians in ground forces, submarines, and missiles, and our 17 ground divisions are opposed to more than 150 Soviet armored and infantry divisions.', ""Two, that our ability to meet our commitments to more than 50 countries around the globe has been critically impaired by our failure to develop a jet airlift capacity. Have you seen the pictures of the planes that flew the United Nations forces to the Congo, or to the Lebanon? How many of them were jets? And how long did they take to fly from Western Germany to the Congo and back; that we are moving into a period where the Soviet Union will be outproducing us 2 to 3 to 1, according to the administration's own testimony before the Armed Services Committee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on which I serve; that this dangerous deterioration in our military strength has been the result of our willingness to cut our budget, to bear a much lower burden which is not large enough if we are going to maintain our freedom, and words are not a substitute for strength. [Applause.]"", 'These are the facts behind our speaking louder and louder while we carry a smaller and smaller stick. But I do not ask you to take my word for it, for it is your responsibility as members of the American Legion and as citizens of the United States to make your own judgment. That record shows, after you examine it, that every objective expert, every study commission, official or unofficial, Republican or Democratic, came to the same conclusion. We have been slipping and we are moving into a period of danger. The Gaither Committee report prepared in 1957, has been best summed up as portraying this Nation and I quote, ""moving in frightening course to the status of a second-class power.""', 'The Rockefeller brothers reported in 1958, and I quote, ""The United States is rapidly losing its lead over the U.S.S.R. in the military race.""', 'Governor Rockefeller himself has said, and I quote him, ""I believe that our position is dramatically weaker than it was 15 years ago.""', 'Robert A. Lovett, lifelong Republican, former Secretary of Defense, testified before a Senate committee this year, and I quote, ""We are doing something short of our best.""', 'Robert Sprague, Republican, consultant to the National Security Council, testifying before the same committee: ""Our military program is inadequate, and its inadequacy,"" and I quote him, ""is a danger to our survival.""', 'Lt. Gen. James Gavin - these are the questions that you must decide, not only as Legionnaires, but as citizens of this country in the next few weeks. Lt. Gen. James Gavin, who jumped in Normandy, who was Director of Army Research and Development, said, and I quote him accurately: ""We are in mortal danger. The missile lag portends serious trouble.""', 'Gen. Maxwell Taylor in 1959: ""We are now threatened with a missile gap that leaves us in a position of potentially grave danger."" And the American Legion, itself, only last year, urged that our conventional forces be maintained at a higher level, and it has not been done. [Applause.]', 'Talk is cheap, words are not enough, waving our finger under Khrushchev\'s face does not increase the strength of the United States, especially when you say to him [applause] - especially when you say, as you wave your finger, ""You may be ahead of us in rockets, but we are ahead of you in color television."" I will take my television black and white. [Applause.]', 'The question is, What must we do to regain our strength? In my judgment, in January 1961, the next President of the United States, whoever he may be, should do the following things:', 'First, we must take immediate steps to protect our present nuclear striking force from surprise attack. Today, more than 90 percent of our retaliatory force is made up of aircraft and missiles which move from unprotectable bases, whose location is known to the Russians.', 'Second, we must step up crash programs on the ultimate weapon. The Polaris submarine, the Minuteman missile, which will eventually close the missile gap.', ""Third, we must modernize, and I think especially give an airlift capacity to the armed services, particularly the Army. It does not do any good to have 17 divisions stationed here if you can't move them around the world within 24 or 48 hours. I would put that near the top, to move them by jet all around the globe to increase our forces substantially. [Applause.] But I want to make it clear that this is only the background to the struggle of power. Not one Soviet soldier in the last 8 years has crossed the frontiers of the free world. Not one Soviet bomb has dropped from missiles or from airplanes. And yet the Soviet power has steadily increased. Cuba has been lost for the time being, I hope, to the Communists. Laos has begun to slip behind the Iron Curtain and may in the next 7 or 8 days. Ghana and Guinea in Africa have moved toward the Soviet bloc. A revolution in Iraq destroyed the Middle Eastern Pact. The Communists have captured control of one of the key factions in the fight for power in the Congo. And Communist influence, propaganda, and subversion, are moving in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. I believe the American Legion should consider carefully the present technique which the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists are employing in order to increase their power."", ""When President Roosevelt was President, when President Truman was President, in the early part of the 1950's, the struggle was to build sufficient military power to prevent the Soviet Union from crossing national frontiers. But now they move in and begin to capture the nationalist movement in Nigeria. They captured the movement of Lumumba in Congo. They captured the Castro movement in Cuba. They are working to capture other movements in South America. And without a soldier crossing into those countries, without a shot being fired, by the change of mind of a paratroop commander in Laos, a country which we spent more money in per capita than any other country in the world, a country where we spent $300 million, where we have been paying the army for the last 2 years, they are about to seize control of Laos, and not a Communist soldier or a Russian soldier has crossed the boundary of Laos."", ""How do we stop this kind of conquest in the sixties? This is the kind of conquest that we are going to have to face, the kind that puts heat on in the United Nations, the kind that puts the pressure on, the kind that compels the countries of Africa to vote against us on the admission of Red China, the kind of heat that causes a candidate for President of Brazil to come up and call on Castro in order to secure his support in the fight in Brazil. They work in Venezuela. They work in Mexico. Russian soldiers do not move and yet their power increases. They could, by 1970, control great sections of the earth without ever advancing their armies beyond their present frontiers. So we have to concern ourselves with building up our military power because their military power is behind their expansion, but that is not enough, if we are going to stop the Communist advance in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'Basically they believe that the United States lacks the nerve, the will, and the determination for a long, long hard fight. It is one thing to stand up to a military invasion, it is one thing to go to war and defeat the Japanese and Hitler. It is quite another thing, year after year, decade after decade, to be engaged in struggles all around the world, in countries which we did not know anything about 10 years ago, but where we and the Communists are now locked in deadly embrace.', ""If they capture more countries of Latin America, if they increase their influence in Africa, if India should begin to move in another direction, if they are successful this week, this month, or this fall, in Iran, in taking Iran away from its Western ties, they have gained a great victory, and we sit back. That is my dispute with this administration. That is the issue which this country has to face. Are we doing enough? I don't think we are. [Applause.] I want to make it very clear to Mr. Khrushchev and to anyone else who wonders, I will not cut our present commitments to the cause of freedom if I am elected President of the United States anywhere in the world - the Formosa Straits, Latin America, Africa, Asia - I support our present effort to build strength, not merely to hold the line but to expand freedom all around the globe. [Applause.]"", ""I have never believed in retreating under any kind of fire. [Applause.] And although I do not want to get into any comparison of military experience, I believe it clear that anyone who says the reverse is guilty of a malicious distortion. [Applause.] And I want Mr. Khrushchev and anyone else to understand that if the Democratic Party wins this election, he will confront in the 1960's an America which is not only militarily strong, but which is waging the offensive for freedom all over the globe. [Applause.]"", 'And I want to make it clear that if the Democratic Party is not successful in this campaign, we will continue to fight for the maintenance of freedom around the globe. [Applause.]', ""We will rebuild our diplomatic corps so we don't send ambassadors and others out because they have contributed to a campaign, who can't even speak the language, who can't even pronounce the names [applause] who can't even pronounce the names of the heads of the countries, who have never been there, who want to stay there for a year while the Communists stay there day after day, speaking the dialect, working subversion, attempting to win control of the country."", 'There are four countries in Africa which are independent which are members of the United Nations, and there is not an American diplomatic member of our Foreign Service in residence in any of the four. When Guinea became independent it took us 2 months to recognize its independence. It took us 8 months to send an ambassador ------------------------- was there the day they got independence, and Guinea now supports the Communist foreign policy.', ""We brought more students from Africa 10 years ago than we do today. From all over the world, we brought more foreign students by the U.S. Government a decade ago than we do today. We had more diplomatic personnel in Western Germany in 1957 than we did in all of Africa. We offered 300 scholarships to the Congo in June. That is more scholarships than we offered to all of Africa the year before. Do you know how many Congolese are studying here? Six. I don't think it is good enough. I don't think this is good enough. I don't think we have never been stronger. I don't think our prestige is so high that we can't do better. I don't think the Communists are about to collapse. I believe we have to build strength, we have to stand for freedom, we have to demonstrate some vigor in our foreign policy. [Applause.]"", 'Do you know how many Voice of America programs in Spanish we have had to Latin America in the last 8 years? None, except for the 3 months of the Hungarian crisis. Do we have a Voice of America program to Cuba today to tell them that Castro is lying, when he speaks about us? To tell them that we want them to be free, that we believe in the democracy, that we are telling them our story? Do you think we have a Government sponsored Voice of America program in Spanish to Cuba today? No, let us come back from the mainland of China for a minute and worry about what is happening right off the mainland of the United States. [Applause.]', 'I want to make it clear that the United States is a great revolutionary country, that believes in the most extraordinary doctrine that man has ever put forward, that the Communist system is as old as Egypt, and if we give our cause dedication and vitality and energy and foresight, if we build strength here in the United States, if we get our economy moving again, if we educate our children, if we say that being second is not good enough, that being first, if first, but first when, and first maybe is not good enough. I have the greatest possible confidence that we can meet any challenges. [Applause.]', 'Can you tell me one good reason why the United States should have been producing twice as many scientists and engineers 10 years ago as the Soviet Union and producing half as many today? Those of you who are Legionnaires, maintain your membership in the Legion because in time of war you responded to the service of our country; you will recall that in the novel ""On the Beach,"" the lone American survivors of World War III are standing on the beach in Australia, awaiting the inevitable end from a cloud of radioactivity. The senior officer in the group turns to the others and says, ""You know, I could run for President.""', ""That is not the Presidency for which I run. I don't want to be the President of a nation perishing under the mushroom cloud of a nuclear warhead, and I intend, if President, or if I continue in the Senate, to build the defenses which this country needs, and which freedom needs. [Applause.]"", 'But neither do I wish to be the President of a nation which is being driven back, which is on the defensive, because of its unwillingness to face the facts of our national existence, to tell the truth, to bear the burdens which freedom demands, a nation which may be declining in relative strength, and with the world coming to an end, as T. S. Eliot said, ""Not with a bang, but with a whimper.""', 'That isn\'t what we are going to do. I have the greatest feeling that the 1960\'s can be a bright period in our national history, but in order to determine whether we are going to pick ourselves up again, we are going to have to have leadership which is willing to tell the truth, which does not run on a program of everything is being done that must be done, but says instead what other leaders have said in other times of crisis. It is time we went to work again. It is time we started our country moving again. It is time we picked ourselves up and moved ourselves into the 1960\'s. That is the great question that we face. [Applause.] After the Spartans were wiped out at the Battle of Thermopylae fighting against the Persians, there was carved in the rock above their graves, 300 of them, ""Passerby, tell Sparta we fell faithful to her service.""', ""Now, Legionnaires, who were willing in war to follow faithful to the service of our country, I ask you in the 1960's to live and live faithfully to the service of the cause for freedom and the cause of the United States. Thank you. [Standing ovation.]""]"
303,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Smathers, Mr. Mayor, Senator Dickinson, Congressman Fascell, Red McEwen, who is going to be the next Congressman from this congressional district [applause], ladies and gentlemen, I come here all the way from Massachusetts, 1,500 miles away, and ask your support in this campaign. I come to this State of Florida, where my family have been residents for 30 years, and I can tell you that Massachusetts and Florida and the United States, I believe need a change. They need motion. They need the Democratic Party, and they need new leadership in the United States. [Applause.] Massachusetts and Florida voted Republican in 1952 and 1956, but I cannot believe in the most difficult and dangerous time, that this Republic has ever faced, that we are going to elect a President of the United States who runs on the slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good"". [Response from the audience.]', ""In electing a President of the United States, you must make, above all, your judgment of how good his judgment is. Can he predict with any degree of certainty the flow of events through the world? Can he make a judgment which involves the security of the United States, your well-being, your prosperity, your peace, your future? What is his judgment like? Mr. Nixon's judgment, I believe, is indicated by his willingness in this time of hazard to go to the American people with a campaign promise, the campaign statement, that our prestige has never been higher, that of the Communists has never been lower, that everything that must be done is being done, and just leave it to him, and we will be secure."", ""I don't hold that view at all. I believe that this is a time of danger and of opportunity. I believe the 1960's can be the best of days or the worst of days, and I believe in the final analysis that it will be secure, that it will be peaceful, that it will be strong, that the economy will go ahead only if the American people have leadership prepared to face the facts and do something about it. [Applause.]"", 'This is no old Republican and Democratic fight. It is true that there are issues which separate us, which are traditional. The Democratic Party in my opinion, and I have been there for 14 years and I have served in the Congress with Democrats and I have served with Republicans - my judgment is that on those issues with which we are familiar, issues involving small business, care for the aged, education for our children, economic growth, full employment, development of our resources, in my opinion, time after time after time the majority of the Republicans have voted no, and the majority of the Democrats have voted yes. [Applause.]', 'But I do not run on that record. I run as a candidate for the Presidency with full knowledge that unless this country is prepared to pick itself up and get itself off dead center and begin to lead, begin to set an example to the world of what a vital society freedom can be, this country is not going to survive as the strongest, freest country in the world. That is the issue - that is the issue, not any old fights which took place in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. Those fights may still go on. We might be defeated on that basis and the country survive. Older people might not be as secure, our schools might not be as good, but the real issue is your judgment as citizens, as informed citizens, capable of exercising your franchise, it is your judgment of whether this country can afford to stand still or whether we can be secure, whether living in Florida 90 miles, as Senator Smathers said, off the coast of Cuba, and close to all the world, a few minutes from all the world, whether this country can afford leadership as usual, leadership which is so misinformed about the current of history that it chooses to run on the slogan in 1960 of peace and prosperity, as if nothing was wrong, as if everything was being done; as if our society was on the move, as if we did not live face to face with risk.', ""I don't run on that basis and it is your judgment what kind of leadership you want. If you want leadership that seeks to please you, if you want leadership that will tell you that everything is all right when it is not, vote for Mr. Nixon.

In Cuba, the Communists have established a satellite. In Venezuela, angry mobs assault the Vice President of the United States. In Mexico City, rioting mobs have protested American policy and castigated America, itself. In Panama, anti-American demonstrations have imperiled the Canal. In Brazil, the newly elected President of Brazil felt it incumbent upon him to make a journey to Havana to call on Mr. Castro in order to get his benediction in that race for the Presidency of Brazil, not to Washington - not to Washington - to Havana. Every report from Latin America, every new dispatch from the south brings fresh news of unrest and tension, and we have not seen the worst of it. We have not seen the worst of it. This struggle is going to go on through all of Latin America, through all of Africa, and through all of Asia for the next decade.', ""I am confident that we can be successful. But we cannot be successful if we demonstrate the lamentable lack of concern that we have shown for the last eight years. [Applause.] With the great tide sweeping Latin America that wanted freedom, what did this administration do? In 1953, the dictator of Peru was given a medal by the United States. In 1954, the dictator of Venezuela was awarded the Legion of Merit by the American Ambassador. In 1956, the dictator of Paraguay received his medal from America. In 1955, our Secretary of the Navy compared Peron to Lincoln in Peron's favor. The results of these blunders have been disastrous."", 'The people of Latin America have not felt we are concerned about freedom. They fear we are really concerned about them only as pawns in the cold war. We are more interested, they think, in our investments in those countries than in the people. And thus when the dictatorships fell, and they are falling every day, our actions and our identification was remembered.', 'Secondly, our major failure in that area has been to assist these people in achieving any kind of economic existence. Do you know that with these people who need a better life, who need land reform, who need a new deal, that there is in every square of every city in Latin America a Franklin D. Roosevelt Park? There is no park named after Harding or Coolidge or the President or the Vice President. There is Franklin D. Roosevelt Park. [Applause.]', 'This has been the basic area of our national security since Monroe. In the last 8 years we gave 5 percent of all of our economic aid to Latin America, 95 percent to the rest of the world, and we wonder why Castro spreads the doctrine of communism and revolt throughout all of Latin America.', 'Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago and here is what he said: ""If we had produced economic progress in Cuba we might have averted the Cuban takeover."" Why didn\'t we? That is what he said a month ago; why didn\'t we in 1955 come forward with a program that would have prevented Castro from taking power?', 'When he was there in 1955, he said, and you can judge his experience, ""I am convinced that communism has passed its highwater mark in Latin America,"" at a time when the Communists were about to communize Cuba.', 'Our third failure has been our inability to establish contact with the young people of that area that will run the country. We have brought in the last 8 years less than 400 young men and women from all the countries of Latin America each year to study in our great country, to learn about freedom, to identify themselves with us. And we have suspended in the last 8 years the ""Voice of America"" program in Spanish to Latin America; the only time we ran a regular ""Voice of America"" program to Latin America was 3 months during the Hungarian crisis.', 'Can you tell me what they have been doing for the last 8 years, when in Africa and Latin America and Asia the United States has been on the decline as a powerful country? At the very time when these people stand as they now do on the edge of decision, we have been indifferent, we have been indifferent.', 'These are the problems that the United States is going to have to begin to face. We are going to have to begin to build a strong society here in the United States. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States, and because he ran an administration which was progressive, which was compassionate, which identified itself with the people of this country. If we are building a strong society here, if our economy is on the move here in the United States, if we identify ourselves with the people, if we provide a better life for all Americans, regardless of their race, regardless of their religion, the full use of their constitutional rights, if we hold out the hand of friendship to all those around the world, then once more the United States can serve as the symbol of freedom; then once more people will begin to feel that we are on the rise, that we are on the move. And I cannot believe that given a choice between two societies, a dictatorship and a vital society identified with freedom - I believe they will choose us. I believe they will say freedom, yes. [Applause.]', 'Franklin Roosevelt said 20 years ago, ""I well recall during my recent visit to the three great capitals in South America I heard one constant cry, \'Viva la Democracia\'."" Now, 20 years later, do our Presidents and Vice Presidents hear that call? Do we hear that call through Latin America and around the world? I believe that it is incumbent on the next President of the United States to, at the beginning of his term of office, indicate by action and word his belief in the solidarity of the Western hemisphere, his belief in a Western Hemisphere which is common to democracy from top to bottom, his belief that the people of this hemisphere can provide through freedom a better life, his undying hostility to the Communist system, his undying hostility to all dictatorships, his belief that the cause of freedom and the cause of people identifying themselves and developing their own resources is the great cause of the 1960\'s.', 'That is what we fight for, the most revolutionary of all doctrines, the right of people to be free. Mr. Castro is identified with a tired and aging system that ultimately will collapse. But we have to demonstrate to them that we are not a finished country, that we are not an old country, that we are not an old people, but, instead, we are a young people on the move, the youngest republic in the world in many ways.', ""Therefore, I come to Florida tonight and I come as the leader of the oldest political party in the world, the Democratic Party [applause] but I want Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro to know that after this election a new generation of Americans has assumed responsibility of leadership, men who fought in Europe and in the Pacific in order to maintain this country's freedom, and they are not going to preside over its liquidation, here, in Latin America, in Africa, Asia, or any place in the world. [Applause.]"", 'I want the people of Latin America and Africa and Asia to wake up in the morning and wonder what this country is doing, and wonder what the President of the United States is doing and saying, and not what Castro or Khrushchev is saying. [Applause.]', 'So we come here and ask your help. This decision is yours. It is not ours. All we can do is present a sober analysis of our problems and opportunities, and in this great country of ours you must make the final judgment. And I believe that in your judgment you will come to the conclusion really of what kind of a society you want, what kind of a country you want, what kind of a world you want, what kind of a system you want to prevail throughout the world. I believe that we are going to choose in the 1960\'s progress; that we are going to make the same decision in 1960 that we made in 1932. We are going to say ""Yes"" to progress. We are going to say it is time for a change. It is time to turn those out of office who look at the world around us and our own problems with a pallid, pale view of life and its possibilities. I believe the revitalization of the American system is our challenge and the great issue of the 1960 campaign, and on that basis I ask your help. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
304,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Dante Fascell, Senator Smathers, Congressman Rogers, Fred Dickinson, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming out here this morning. I think the reason that you are here is the same reason that I run for the Presidency of the United States this year in 1960, and that is because all of us are devoted to our country, wish to serve it, wish the best for it, wish it to be secure, wish it to live in peace, wish it to move forward. And that is the service which we hope to render to this country this year. [Applause.]', 'On different occasions in our history the American people have selected one party or the other, depending on their judgment of the times and on the program and viewpoint of the party and its leaders. Now let me make it very clear that Mr. Nixon and I disagree very basically on the position of the United States, on what must be done to increase our security, and what must be done to maintain the peace.', 'This is a serious dispute, which involves the lives and the fortune of everyone here. When you make your judgment on November 8 as to which candidate and which party you want to lead, you should, I think, bear the following things in mind. Mr. Nixon and I disagree on the position of the United States in the world today. He says our prestige was never higher, that we have never been stronger, that the tide in world history is moving in our direction, and that if we continue our present policies, by 1965 and 1970, the United States will be secure and the world will begin to move in the direction of freedom.', 'I could not disagree more. I could not believe that that is the world doctrine at this time. [Response from the audience; applause.] The fact of the matter is that in the last 8 years not a single Soviet soldier has crossed the frontiers of Russia or their present territory, and yet Cuba, Laos, in part Iraq, their influence in Ghana and Guinea, their influence in Latin America their influence in Africa, their influence in Asia, their influence at the United Nations, their military position, their scientific position, their production of scientists and engineers have all steadily increased in relation to ours, and the judgment that you must make as you sit here in Florida, 90 miles from Cuba, 8 minutes by jet - you have to determine whether you can support the leadership of a candidate and a party which runs on a slogan of ""We\'ve Never Had It So Good.""', ""I don't run on that slogan. [Applause.] I don't run on that slogan. I have the greatest confidence in this country. In my judgment the United States can meet any burden, can meet any challenge, can meet any responsibility, but it cannot possibly do so unless the President of the United States and the country moves to finish the unfinished business of our society, recognizes the perils that we are in, recognizes the challenges, determines that this country shall move again, determine that we shall work in the sixties, determine that we shall be in this country an inspiration to all those who wish to be free and to hold out a helping hand to all those who desire to follow our example. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. Castro in Cuba is not alone the threat. Why was the candidate for the Presidency of Brazil in the recent election - why did he feel compelled in the middle of his election to pay a journey to Havana and call on Mr. Castro? It was because he knew in his own country there was sufficient support for Castro, there was sufficient advantage in looking anti-American, that he felt compelled to gain that support. Anyone who sits in this country, who reads the newspapers, who has children, who is concerned about the future, who desires to maintain our peace, who desires to maintain our freedom, who desires to maintain our security, and can choose to stand still in 1961, I believe is wholly wrong and I disagree with it. [Applause.]', ""I come here to Florida today where my family has lived for 30 years, where they have already voted for one of the two candidates, and I feel it looks pretty good at least to get two votes in Florida [applause and laughter.] But I came here to this State which reaches like an arm toward Latin America, which is surrounded by sea, the water which laps Miami, laps Africa and Latin America and Europe. This State here is an advancing, moving and progressive State. Its brightest days are bound to come in the years of the 1960's and 1970's, and what I feel we have to do, and I say this after 14 years in the Congress, after serving in the Senate for 8 years with both of your Senators, in the House of Representatives with your Congressmen, in my judgment this great country deserves the best from all of us."", ""It is a great country, but I believe it must be greater, and it is a powerful country, but I believe it must be more powerful, and I believe that our responsibility in the 1960's is to restore to the world the image of America as a society on the move, a society whose high noon is just ahead, not a society which stands still, which begins to lose its vitality, which begins to lose its image as a moving society, a moving country."", 'So those are the basic matters which separate us, and it is to your good judgment, your sense of responsibility, your concern for your country, your identification with the cause of freedom, that we entrust this decision on November 8. I can assure you that if we are successful, we will give leadership to this country and Florida, and the United, States will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I would like to have you give a cheer for the Waltham Post of the American Legion of Massachusetts that is down at the convention and came over to play for us today.

I want to express my appreciation to all of you for coming here today. Your presence is a testimony to your belief that this is an important election, and that all of us as citizens of this country have an obligation to make a careful judgment as to who shall be the next President of the United States. [Applause.]', 'I have served in the Congress for 14 years, and I must say I have come to the conclusion, and I am sure George Smathers and Dante Fascell would agree, that however important the Senate may be, and however important the House of Representatives may be, in the final analysis our fortunes as a nation depend, particularly because of the pressure of events as well as the provisions of the Constitution, on the good judgment, the vigor, the sense of precision, the sense of foresight - the historical sense of the President of the United States.', ""This country stood still when McKinley was President and when Harding was President and when Coolidge was President, and this country moved when Woodrow Wilson was President and Franklin Roosevelt was President, and Harry Truman was President. [Applause.] And I must say that those of you who live in this State of Florida depend upon a moving and expanding country. I know something about the economy of this State. When the rest of the country catches cold, Florida gets pneumonia and Miami is very sick. [Applause and laughter.] If we should have a recession in the winter of 1961, and the Wall Street Journal already says we have a recession, what effect does that have on Miami and Miami Beach and the counties to the north? This country cannot afford in 1961, 4 more years of Republican leadership. [Applause.] I wish I could take Mr. Nixon's attention for just 5 minutes from the coast of China where there is no disagreement, where we both agree with the Eisenhower administration. I wish I could move him off the coastline of China, 2 miles away from the mainland of China, and move him about 90 miles off the coast of Florida. [Applause.] He has announced that he is going to spend the next 3 weeks talking of those two islands, about which there is no debate. Every week, once, I would like to have him tell us about Cuba. I would like to have him tell us [applause] - we don't want it often, but I would like to have him tell us what he is going to do. I would like to have him tell us how when he stands up to Khrushchev, what he is going to do about Castro. [Applause.]"", 'I would like to have him explain his statement of 1955, because foresight and good judgment are essential qualities of the next President of the United States, and in 1955 Mr. Nixon flatly said, as he says today, our prestige is at an alltime high. Just to know how good his judgment is in 1955 he said ""Communism in Latin America is on the decline."" Just like he said when he pointed his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket engines, but we are ahead of you in color television."" [Laughter and applause.]', 'I want Mr. Nixon to come home for a while. I want him to tell those steelworkers who work in steel mills which are working at 50 percent of capacity, I want him to talk to the parents of 35 percent of our brightest children who graduate from high school and never see the inside of a college, I want him to talk to the homebuilders of this country who are building 209,000 homes less than they should be to keep up with our population, in part because the interest rates now are at an alltime high. I want him to tell us about the peace which is in the world, when in the last 8 years not one Soviet soldier has crossed the frontiers of 1952, and yet now they control Cuba, they are about to control Laos, they are in a strong position in Iraq, the foreign policy of Guinea and Ghana matches theirs. There is talk this morning in the newspaper that in the next 2 months there may be a crisis in Iran. I want him to tell us again that the power and the prestige of the United States is at an alltime high.

Demosthenes, 2,000 years ago, warning the Athenians of their danger, said, ""Our peril comes from those who seek to please us, rather than to serve us."" [Applause.]', 'I regard and we regard the responsibility of our party, not to downgrade our country, but to state that this country which has unlimited capacity for action, this country must get ready for another movement forward. We cannot maintain our position, we cannot maintain our strength, we cannot serve as an inspiration to freedom around the globe, if we move at a slow pace in the sixties. This country is the only hope of freedom. If we move forward, freedom moves forward. If we stand still, we give hope and encouragement to those who wish to destroy us.', 'I sound the alarm not with the idea that this country is doomed, but with the idea that if this country moves again, nothing can stop it. And that is where we differ. [Applause.]', 'The Bible said it long ago. ""Who will prepare for the battle if the trumpet sounds an uncertain note?"" Governor Rockefeller, before he began to swim happily in Mr. Nixon\'s pool after the convention, said this country could not be led by a question mark.', 'Our position is not that of question. Our position is one of certainty, that the future can belong to freedom, that this country can be secure, that we can turn the balance of power in our direction. All of these things can be done and all these things must be done by a United States on the move again. So I come to Florida, I come to Miami, and I come and ask you citizens of this country, I ask your support in this campaign. This is not merely a contest between Republicans and Democrats. This is a contest between those who are concerned and those who are comfortable, between those who are fat and happy and those who wish to see our country succeed. [Applause.] This is a great and powerful country. We can make it greater and more powerful. We can give this country leadership. We can make America move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
306,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['Twenty years ago this month President Franklin Roosevelt in a radio broadcast to the Western Hemisphere called upon the people of Latin America to join hands with the United States in a common struggle to keep the forces of tyranny from the shores of the Americas. ""So bound together,"" he said, ""we are able to withstand any attack from the East or the West. Together we are able to ward off any infiltration of alien political and economic ideas that would destroy our freedom and our democracy.""', ""The nations of South America responded to Franklin Roosevelt's call. Foreign efforts to capture control of the governments of Latin America were halted. American independence was maintained. And the nations of the Western Hemisphere combined in a common effort which ultimately brought about the collapse of Nazi despotism throughout the world."", 'Today, once again, the independence of the Western Hemisphere is menaced from abroad. Today, once again, the combined efforts of all the American states are vital to the preservation of that independence. Today, once again, only the leadership of the United States can summon all the resources of the hemisphere to the defense of freedom. But today, unlike 1940, we have failed to exercise that leadership. Today, unlike 1940, the nations of Latin America are distrustful of our guidance, suspicious of our intentions disillusioned by our actions. And today, unlike 1940, the forces of alien tyranny have already found their way into the Western Hemisphere - to within 90 miles of your coast - to the island of Cuba.', 'And this change has come about in the past 8 years.', 'In 1953 the Republicans inherited an inter-American system in good working order. They inherited a good neighbor policy which was more than an empty slogan. They inherited a Latin America composed of nations friendly to the United States.', 'But in 8 short years that bright heritage, the heritage of 20 Democratic years, has been largely dissipated and destroyed, and much of the good will, which it took two decades to build, has been lost.', 'In Cuba the Communists have gained a satellite and established a base for the attempted infiltration and subversion of all Latin America. In Venezuela angry mobs have assaulted the Vice President of the United States. In Mexico City rioting crowds have protested American policy and castigated America itself. In Panama anti-American demonstrations have imperiled the security of the Panama Canal. In Brazil, the newly elected President felt it necessary to appeal to rising anti-American sentiment in order to win the election. And every report, every broadcast, every newspaper dispatch from the south brings fresh news of unrest, of tension, of misunderstanding.', 'Today, time is running out for the United States in Latin America. Our once good neighbors are drifting away. Vigorous and vocal groups of Communists are exploiting domestic distress and unrest, encouraging growing dislike of the United States, working to impose Communist rule. And our historic ties are straining to the breaking point under American failure to understand the rapidly changing economies of Latin America, and the rapidly changing hopes and ambitions of the people to the south.', 'These disastrous and tragic defeats have been the defeats of a Republican leadership which has lacked the imagination and compassion to understand the needs and aspirations of the people of South America, which has lacked the leadership and the vigor to act to meet those needs, and which has lacked the foresight and the vision to realize the inevitable results of its own failures.', 'It is time now to renew our understanding and begin to act. For although the cold war will not be won in Latin America it may very well be lost there.', 'Our first failure in Latin America has been the failure to identify ourselves with the rising tide of freedom.', 'Victor Hugo once wrote that ""No army can withstand the force of an idea whose time has come."" For most of Latin America the time of freedom has come. In 1954 there were 13 military strongmen in Latin America; today there are only five. And, if we live up to our responsibilities, in the coming months and years we may expect the elimination of all despotism in Latin America - until the American hemisphere is a free hemisphere - not partly free, not almost free, but completely free from Cape Horn to the Arctic Circle. But the United States, the home of freedom, has been viewed far too often not as the friend of this rising tide of freedom, but as the supporter of toppling and brutal dictatorships.', 'In 1953 the dictator of Peru was given a medal by the United States. In 1954 the dictator of Venezuela was awarded the Legion of Merit by our Ambassador.', ""In 1956 the dictator of Paraguay received his medal from America. In 1955 our Secretary of the Navy went to Argentina and made an eloquent address comparing dictator Peron to Lincoln - to Peron's advantage."", ""We have warmly embraced Trujillo, the brutal despot of the Dominican Republic, and recently one of our ambassadors was photographed embracing Trujillo's envoy as he was being thrown out of Nicaragua because the OAS had virtually outlawed his government."", 'We have dumped more than $500 million worth of arms and ammunition into Latin America over the past 8 years, much of which has been used to strengthen the hand of dictatorships. And even now, despite the hard lessons of the past, our Air Force is planning to invite the codictator of Nicaragua to Washington as a guest of honor.', 'The result of these blunders has been disaster. The people of Latin America have begun to feel that we are more interested in stable regimes than in free governments; more interested in fighting against communism than in fighting for freedom; more interested in the possible loss of our investments than in the actual loss of the lives of the thousands of young Latins who have died fighting dictators and thus when the dictatorships fell, our actions of support were remembered, and we have been distrusted because of them.', 'Our second major failure in Latin America has been our failure to help the people of Latin America to achieve their economic aspirations.', 'Latin America is the fastest growing area in the world. By the end of the century it will have 512 million people - more than twice as many as all of North America. And this enormous population explosion is taking place in countries where millions of people are already condemned to a life of poverty and hunger and disease; where the average family income is less than $300 a year; and where population growth is outdistancing economic growth, driving this meager standard of living still lower.', 'Poverty is not new to Latin America. But what is new is the determination to emerge from poverty, to wipe out hunger and want, to create a modern growing economy in a small fraction of the time it took to build modern United States or Europe.', ""The people of Latin America want better homes, better schools, and better living standards. They want land reform, and tax reform, and an end to the corruption which drains off a nation's resources. In short, they want a new deal for South America. And that is why in every Latin American capital there is a street or park named after Franklin Roosevelt - but I do not know of one that is named after Hoover or Coolidge or Harding or Richard M. Nixon."", 'The people of South America have looked to the United States - their good neighbor - the richest land on earth - for help in this great effort to develop their economy. But in the past 8 years we have sent less than 5 percent of our economic aid to all of Latin America. We refused to enter into discussions to stabilize the commodity prices on which the Latin American economy depends, prices whose rapid fluctuation has caused the loss of more foreign exchange than all that has been gained from our total foreign-aid program. We fought the establishment of an Inter-American Bank until events forced it upon us. We ignored the President of Brazil\'s imaginative proposal for a large-scale ""Operation Pan-America"" to devdop the economy of Latin America. And we had our Secretary of State leave the Inter-American Conference in 1954, after securing a resolution against Guatemala, but before the Latin American nations had been given a chance to discuss the economic problems which were the purpose of the meeting.', 'Mr. Nixon has said that if we had a program of economic development for Latin America 5 years ago, then ""we might have produced economic progress in Cuba which might have averted the Cuba takeover."" And to that I would add that such a program might also have built up our friendships and destroyed Communist influence throughout Latin America.', 'But Mr. Nixon himself was in Latin America 5 years ago. He saw no need for action then. He merely praised the ""competence and stability"" of the Batista dictatorship and said that ""I am convinced that commurnsm has passed its high water mark in Latin America."" Mr. Nixon could not have been more wrong. Batista was not stable, and communism not only had not been halted but it was just beginning to move forward to new conquests. And it was his failure, as the President\'s personal emissary, to see what must be done in Latin America that has directly contributed to the current crisis in our inter-American relations. This is more of the experience which Mr. Nixon claims as his qualification to be President.', ""Our third major failure in Latin America has been our failure to demonstrate America's continuing concern with the problems of the people to the south, to establish the contact between nations and people which was the essence of the good neighbor policy."", 'Although Latin America is desperately in need of educated and trained men to run a modern, developing economy, in the past 8 years we have brought less than 400 students a year from all of South America to study here in the United States.', 'Although misunderstanding of America has been on the increase, we suspended all regular Voice of America Spanish-language broadcasts to South America between 1953 and 1959, with the exception of the 6 months of the Hungarian crisis. And even today, we only broadcast 1 hour a day. And we have also cut the number and size of all our other information programs in Latin America. Although our relations with the restless volatile nations of Latin America require the most skilled and constant attention, our diplomatic posts there have too often been viewed merely as a reward for contributions to the Republican campaign treasury, with the result that our representatives have committed blunders which have lost us respect - they have embraced doomed dictators; and they have failed to understand the rising tide of popular discontent which the Communists have so tirelessly worked to exploit.', 'And while we have ignored the needs of Latin America, during these last 8 years of failure and defeat, the Communists have been hard at work in South America. The Soviet Union is offering programs of technical assistance, encouraging young Latins to study behind the Iron Curtain, putting more than $100 miTlion a year into the support of local Communist parties, and offering tempting trade agreements.', 'When the United States refused to give Argentina credits for petroleum development, the Russians offered $100 million worth of such credits. Brazil and the Soviet Union have signed a $208 million trade agreement, and Russia has become a major importer of Uruguayan wool. Already the Soviet Union has captured one country in Latin America and is using that country as a base from which to export propaganda and revolution throughout the continent.', 'Perhaps the best indication of what has happened to American prestige in Latin America in the past 8 years is in the contrast between the good will visits of Franklin Roosevelt and Richard Nixon.', 'In his speech of 20 years ago, President Roosevelt said:', '\n  I well recall during my recent visit to three great capital cities in South America, the vast throng which came to express by their cheers their friendship for the United States. I remember that above all the cheers I heard one constant cry again and again, above all others, ""Viva la democracia"" - long live democracy.\n', 'When Mr. Nixon went to Latin America he too had vast throngs; but they came to express hostility, not friendship; they threw stones instead of cheers; they shouted ""Down with the United States"" instead of ""Viva la democracia."" For Mr. Nixon and his party had begun to lose what Franklin Roosevelt had labored so tirelessly to win - the friendship and respect of the people of Latin America.', 'There is much to encourage hope in Latin America; the forces of liberal democracy are still strong and are working to create the framework of economic advance, the steady elimination of poverty and want, on which the preservation of freedom will ultimately depend. But our help and our understanding are needed, and needed now, for the time of decision in Latin America has come. And the survival of freedom in the Western Hemisphere will depend on the boldness of our programs in the years to come.', 'First, we need a new attitude and new approach to the nations of Latin America. Franklin Roosevelt\'s good neighbor policy was a success because it demonstrated a continuing concern with hemispheric problems. But in the past 8 years we have not demonstrated such concern. We have reacted to a crisis in Guatemala or a crisis in Panama or a crisis in Cuba, and then, when the crisis was over, we continued to ignore the long-range problems and needs which were at the root of all the trouble. The good neighbor policy is no longer enough. The good partner policy has been discredited. Our new policy can best be summed up in the Spanish words ""alianza para progreso,"" an alliance in progress - an alliance of nations with a common interest in freedom and economic advance in a great common effort to develop the resources of the entire hemisphere, strengthen the forces of democracy, and widen the vocational and educational opportunities of every person in all the Americas. This policy also means constant consultation with Latin American nations on hemispheric problems, as well as on issues of worldwide significance. And it is an alliance, not merely directed against communism, but aimed at helping our sister republics for their own sake.', 'Secondly, we must give constant and unequivocal support to democracy in Latin America. We must end our open and warm backing of dictators. Our honors must be reserved for democratic leaders, not despots. Our ambassadors must be spokesmen for democracy, not supporters of tyrants. And we must constantly press for free elections in any country where such elections are not held. We must also strongly support the Commission on Human Rights of the OAS - a commission which can serve as a forum before which the crimes and repressions of dictators like Castro and Trujillo can be brought to the attention of all the people of Latin America.', 'Third, we must help provide the funds, the long-term development loans, essential to a growing economy, an economy which can raise standards of living and keep up with the population explosion, and which will also provide an increasingly important market for American goods.', 'Until the recent authorization of $500 million for development, nearly all our economic aid had been in the form of loans to buy American exports. As a result basic ends were ignored and a crushing burden of interest payments was imposed on Latin America. For example, Latin America will pay more in interest this year to the Export-Import Bank than the entire $500 million recently authorized by the Congress.', 'Future programs must emphasize the development of the basic resources on which a modern economy depends, resources like roads and power and schools, resources which private investment cannot provide; but resources which are the fundamental precondition of rising living standards. We must plan our aid in full cooperation with the Latin American States, carefully mapping the often widely varying needs of each nation, and financing a development program both through the revenues of the affected nation as well as long-term loans from the United States.', 'In this effort we should seek the help of those of our Western allies who have historic ties with Latin America, as well as the help of the Latin American nations themselves. For there is a great deal of difference between the economic problems of Argentina, with a GNP of $500 per person, and Bolivia, with a GNP of $100 per person. And perhaps the wealthier nations of South America will be able to offer help, at least in the form of technical assistance, to the poorer countries.', 'Fourth, we must act to stabilize the prices of the principal commodity exports of Latin America. Almost every country in Latin America depends on one or two basic commodities for nearly all its exports, and basic commodities account for 90 percent of all South American exports. The prices of these commodities are subject to violent change. And a sudden fall can cause a decline in income which will sharply reduce the national income, upset the budget, and wreck the foreign exchange position. It is plain that no program of economic development can be effected unless something is done to stabilize commodity prices.', 'Despite repeated requests it was not until 1958 that the United States even agreed to sit down and talk about price stabilization. And, except for a temporary agreement on coffee, no action has emerged from the lengthy talks and studies. Yet commodity fluctuations and uncertain markets continue to undermine Latin American economies, and tempt South American nations to enter into trade agreements with the Communist bloc.', 'We must be willing to sit down with the Latin Americans and work out a program for the solution of this complex problem, a program which can rely on arrangements such as stockpiling, buffer stocks, and others. The nature of the solution depends on the commodity involved. But it is important that we make an immediate effort to find some solution.', 'At the same time we should help the countries of South America diversify their economies in order to reduce their dependence on a few basic commodities.', 'Fifth, we must encourage and aid programs of land reform. In some South American nations archaic systems of absentee ownership still keep land in the grip of a few wealthy landowners, while the mass of the people struggle for a subsistence living as tenants. This concentration of land ownership was one of the principal grievances which underlay the Cuban Revolution, and which is behind most of the revolutions in modern South America.', 'Of course, any decision to reform the system of land ownership can only be made by the country involved. But we should always stand ready to assist them in carrying out this decision by providing technical assistance and loans, as well as helping the new landowners to set up their farms on a productive basis.', 'Sixth, we must act to stimulate private investment in Latin America, through improved consular services, through the basic development programs which will provide the resources which private industry needs, and by working out international agreements designed to safeguard our investments abroad.', 'At the same time we must encourage our private business to immerse themselves in the life of the country in which they are located, through mixing capital with local capital, training local inhabitants for skilled jobs, and making maximum use of local labor. In this way our private industry will become an accepted and valued member of the community in which it is situated.', 'Seventh, we must expand our programs of technical assistance. We need to send an increased flow of engineers, technicians, factory managers, and others to train the Latin Americans in the techniques of modern industry and modern agriculture.', 'At the same time we must train more South Americans in these same skills. Perhaps we could set up a technical training center in the Panama Canal Zone, to be financed by tolls from the canal, to educate Latins in the techniques of modern technology.', 'Eighth, we must step up our own student exchange program, to provide education for future Latin leaders, perhaps establishing an inter-American university in Puerto Rico to which young men and women from all over the hemisphere could attend.', 'At the same time we must increase our sadly lagging Voice of America broadcasts both in Spanish and in Portuguese, and all our other information programs, in order to carry the message of America to the people of Latin America.', 'Ninth, we must send skilled and trained men to man our diplomatic posts in Latin America, men who will be appointed not for the size of their campaign contributions, but for their interest in and knowledge of the problems of the country in which they represent the United States.', 'Tenth, we must make every effort to bring about some type of arms control agreement in South America, an agreement which is fully compatible with the national security needs of every nation in the hemisphere. Such an agreement would end the wasteful arms race, which now absorbs 60 percent of the budget of some Latin American nations, dissipates resources which might be used for economic development, and increase tension throughout the hemisphere.', 'Eleventh, we must work constantly to strengthen the OAS and its subordinate agencies by stimulating common American action through that organization, and encouraging personnel policies which will equip it for new responsibilities.', 'Twelfth, we must reorganize our own handling of Latin American policies, making sure that all policies originate with and flow from the President and Secretary of State, and are carried out by the agencies involved. There are literally dozens of U.S. agencies which are concerned with inter-American affairs. They have been often working at cross-purposes and without effective central guidance. This guidance and direction must be provided by the Secretary of State and ultimately by the President himself.', 'With this program for Latin America I believe we can help to create a strong and growing and free hemisphere. A hemisphere where freedom can flourish, where long-enduring people hope for a better life for themselves and their children. It is a program like this which is the ultimate answer to Castro and the Communists. For if Latin America is moving forward, if it is progressing under democratic government, then eventually the people of Cuba too will demand freedom for themselves, and Communist rule in Latin America will perish where it began - in the streets of Havana.', 'I believe in a Western Hemisphere where we in the United States do not speak atronizingly of ""our backyard"" or our ""little brothers,"" and where the people of South America do not speak with hostility of the ""colossus of the north"" or shout ""Yankee go home."" I believe in a hemisphere of independent and free nations, sharing common traditions and goals, living in peace and mutual respect. In short, I believe in a Western Hemisphere where all people - the Americans of the South and the Americans of the North - the United States and the nations of Latin America - are joined together in an alliance for progress - alianza para progreso.']"
307,John F. Kennedy ,"October 18, 1960","['* * * The critical situation which has been created by the steady erosion of relative American strength and prestige in the past 8 years. We have heard many general claims and boasts; we have heard how we are first in every area of competition: we have heard how we must be firm; how we must stand up to Khrushchev; how we must be united.', 'But no amount of oratory, no extravagant claims or vociferous braggadocio, no unjustified charges, can hide the harsh fact that behind the rhetoric, behind the soothing words and the confusing figures, American strength relative to that of the Soviet Union has been slipping, and communism has been advancing steadily in every area of the world, until the Iron Curtain now rests on the island of Cuba, only 90 miles away.', 'The implacable Communist drive for world domination, which now penetrates every continent and every section of the world, takes many forms; and the battle against communism is fought on many fronts. I would like to talk for a few minutes about one of those fronts, the front of military power. For it is here that the Communist advance, and relative American decline, can be most sharply seen; and it is here that the immediate danger to our survival is the greatest.', 'Eight years ago, when the administration took office, it inherited the most powerful military force in the history of the world, an America whose military supremacy was unchallenged and seemingly unchallengeable. The previous administration had developed the first atomic and hydrogen bombs, built up the greatest atomic striking force in the world, developed, in the Navajo project, the rocket engines which are now used in the Thor ICBM and the Atlas ICBM, and so nearly completed testing for the Atlas ICBM that construction was about to begin.', 'In that year, in 1952, no one dared challenge our power, even the most rabid partisan could make no issue of our defense, and that is what we seek, an America so strong that defense is not an issue, but a matter of pride to all Americans. And that is the kind of defense we intend to have.', 'Yet within 1 year the tide had begun to turn. The development of a relatively small hydrogen warhead has made missiles the key to future military power. The Soviet Union decided to go all out in missile development. But here, in the United States, we cut back on funds for missile development. We slashed our defense budget. We slowed up the modernization of our conventional forces until, today, the Soviet Union is rapidly building up a missile striking force that endangers our power to retaliate - and thus our survival itself.', 'For the harsh facts of the matter are that:', ""\n  Our relative military strength has not increased as fast as the Russians', particularly in ground forces, submarines, and missiles - and our 17 ground divisions are opposed to more than 150 Soviet armored and infantry divisions;"", 'Our ability to meet our commitments around the globe has been critically impaired by the failure to develop an airlift capacity sufficient to move our forces to developing trouble spots;', 'We are moving into a period when the Soviet Union will be outproducing us two or three to one in the field of missiles - a period relatively vulnerable and when our retaliatory force will be in danger of destruction through a Soviet surprise attack - the period of the missile gap;', 'This dangerous deterioration in our relative military strength has been the direct result of shortsighted budgetary policies and bad judgment in Washington.', 'These are the facts behind our claims of advancing military might - the facts which lie behind our current policy which seems to be ""speak loudly while carrying a smaller and smaller stick"" - and a policy which - with your help - we will reverse.', 'But I do not ask you to take my word for this. For it is your responsibility and the responsibility of every voter to weigh the record carefully, and examine the conclusions of those who analyzed our situation impartially, far from the heat of an election campaign.', 'And that record shows that every objective expert, every study commission, official or unofficial, Republican or Democrat, came to the same conclusion: We have been slipping and we are in danger.', 'The Gaither Committee report, prepared in 1957 at the request of President Eisenhower, has been best summed up as portraying this country as a ""nation moving in frightening course to the status of a second-class power.""', 'The Rockefeller Brothers report in 1958 said: ""The United States is rapidly losing its lead over the U.S.S.R. in the military race.""', 'Mr. Rockefelkr himself has said: ""I believe that our position is dramatically weaker today than it was 15 years ago.""', 'Robert A. Lovett, a former Secretary of Defense and a lifelong Republican, testified before a Senate committee that ""We are doing something short of our best.""', 'Mr. Robert Sprague, consultant to the National Security Council and a lifelong Republican, testified before the same committee that ""Our military program was inadequate and its inadequacies were a danger to our survival.""', 'Lt. Gen. James Gavin, Chief of the Army\'s Research and Development under this administration, declared: ""We are in mortal danger; the missile lag portends trouble of a serious nature.""', 'Gen. Maxwell Taylor, Chief of Staff under this administration, said in 1959: ""* * * we are now threatened with a missile gap that leaves us in a position of potentially grave danger.""', 'And the American Legion itself only last year urged that our conventional forces be maintained at a higher level than they have now reached. But that recommendation, too, has---', 'In fact, the only reassuring statements we have are the claims of those in power who want to stay in power, the soothing sirup fed to anxious Americans to make them forget the tragic mistakes of the last 8 years: the cutbacks in our budget for research and development, the slashes in Army personnel, the impounding of funds voted by the Congress, the silencing of critics, the consistent overriding by the Budget Bureau of the requests made by our Service Chiefs for the funds they knew they needed to carry out the missions assigned to them.', 'I say that what we need are not reassurances, but strength, not words but weapons, and I intend to see that we get them.', 'For talk is cheap. Tough words are easy. Wagging one\'s finger under Mr. Khrushchev\'s nose costs the taxpayers nothing even if all you\'re saying is ""You may be ahead of us in rockets, but we are ahead of you in color television."" But words do not stop Mr. Khrushchev. Debates do not deter Mr. Khrushchev. He will be impressed and ready to talk peace only when we can show one quality above all others and superior to his: strength.', 'The question now is: What must we do to regain our strength? The decision is only partly military but until an effective and enforceable arms control agreement can be negotiated, we must build the military power necessary to keep our commitments and stop the next war before it starts. The President of the United States has a constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense and should that office be mine in January, I would call for the following changes:', 'First - We must take immediate steps to protect our present nuclear striking force from surprise attack. Today, more than 90 percent of our retaliatory capacity is made up of aircraft and missiles which have fixed unprotectable bases whose location is known to the Russians. We can only do this by providing SAC with the capability of maintaining a continuous airborne alert and by pressing projects such as the Hound Dog air-ground missile which will enable manned bombers to penetrate Soviet defenses with their weapons. We must also step up our lagging Atlas base program. For missiles without bases are worthless, adding nothing to our defense and wasting our all to limited missile capacity.', 'Second - We must step up crash programs to provide ourselves with the ultimate weapons, the Polaris submarines and Minuteman missiles, which will eventually close the missile gap by providing us with an invulnerable retaliatory force.', 'Third - We must modernize and give increased mobility to our conventional forces, our only protection against limited war. As long as we have the airlift capacity to rush only one division to a trouble spot anywhere on the globe and as long as we are still relying on the old M-1, while the Soviet is 10 years ahead in rifle development, as long as we are relying on the M-48 tank which can be outranged and outshot by the Soviet T-54, we are in trouble.', 'Fourth - We must reorganize our Defense Department - allocations, roles and missions - in accordance with the logic of modern weapons systems and technology, transforming the Joint Chiefs of Staff into a defense level staff rather than the representatives of the three services, creating an authority which will be directly responsible for stimulating scientific research and discovery and eliminating the duplication of function which has resulted from the creation of 39 separate civilian status offices in the Pentagon.', 'All this and much more must be done. But it is also clear that an increased military effort is not enough. More and better weapons are not enough. A reorganized Defense Department is not enough.', 'For the harsh fact of the matter is that in the past 8 years not a single Soviet fighting man has crossed the frontier of the free world - not a single Soviet missile has been fired at the United States - not a single Soviet bomb has dropped on our cities or the cities of our allies.', 'Yet in those same 8 years Cuba has been lost to the Communists. Laos has begun to slip behind the Iron Curtain. Ghana and Guinea have moved toward the Soviet bloc. A revolution in Iraq virtually destroyed our Middle Eastern Baghdad Pact. The Communists have captured control of one of the key factions in the fight for the Congo. And Communist influence - propaganda and subversive activities - has grown and prospered in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, and in the Middle East.', 'In short, freedom has been on the defensive all over the globe and the Communists have made enormous gains without firing a single shot. For although military power gives stability and prestige to Communist activities, although it increases their prestige and perhaps their daring, military power is not the ultimate Communist weapon in the struggle for world domination.', 'For the Communists seek to undermine freedom, to achieve the triumph of communism by exploiting chaos and discontent in every corner of the world, by taking advantage of our weak spots, our failures to build the strong and stable governments which are the only guarantee of freedom. The Communists have a strategy for world conquest and that strategy rests in the future, as it has in the past, on the use of every weapon of economic and ideological conflict to win the allegiance of the uncommitted nations of the world and increase their dependence on the support of the Soviet Union, on the use of local Communist revolutionaries to subvert and destroy free government and on their belief that the United States lacks the will and the endurance to engage in a prolonged and difficult struggle for the protection of freedom. And I believe that their great successes of the past 8 years have encouraged them in this belief.', 'I do not believe that the steady retreat of freedom in the past 8 years has stemmed from a policy of surrender. Rather it has stemmed from an inability to understand the broad challenge of Soviet communism, to understand the wide range of their economic, social, and ideological and military offensive and from an inability to meet that challenge. And in case the reckless oratory of this campaign has confused and deluded Mr. Khrushchev, I want to make one thing clear to the Kremlin:', 'I will not cut our present commitment to the cause of freedom anywhere in the world. I have never believed in retreating under fire. And althongh I do not want to enter into any comparison of military experience of personal losses in war, I believe that it is clear that anyone who accuses me of a policy of surrender is guilty of a malicious distortion.', 'And I want Mr. Khrushchev to understand another thing: If the Democratic Party wins this election he will confront in the sixties an America which is not only militarily strong but which is waging the offensive for freedom on all the many fronts of the cold war.', '\n  We will restore the vitality of the American economy, increasing our rate of economic growth and caring for the needs of our own people so that the uncommitted peoples of the world will look once again to America and not to Moscow or Peiping for guidance and leadership in their own fight for economic progress.', 'We will rebuild our diplomatic corps so that we can send skilled and compassionate men to represent us all over the world, men who know the problems and concerns of the areas in which they are stationed, who can represent the cause of freedom with credit, men who are selected for their ability and not the size of their campaign contributions.', 'We will step up our efforts to educate the future leaders of Africa and Asia and Latin America. The youth of these areas are desperately in need of the training which will enable them to man the governments and run the economies of their developing nations. If we do not give them this training they will look for it behind the Iron Curtain where their misunderstanding of America will increase under Communist indoctrination.', 'We will increase our Voice of America programs and all our other information services in order to carry the message of America to the world.', 'We will identify ourselves with the rising tide of freedom and nationalism throughout the world. The ideals of our own Revolution have become the ideals of people everywhere, and the triumph of those ideals - of national independence and an end to tyranny - is inevitable. We can no longer support the status quo or colonial rule if we are to win the friendship and trust of the emerging world.', 'We must make every effort to help build the stable and progressing economies on which freedom depends. National independence cannot exist without political independence - and want and poverty and hunger are the conditions under which communism feasts and prospers.', 'These are just some of the steps which we must take if we are to succeed in halting the steady advance of communism - an advance which is now on our very doorstep in Cuba.', 'In the novel ""On the Beach,"" the lone American survivors of world war III are standing on a beach in Australia, awaiting the inevitable end from the spreading cloud of radioactivity. The senior in the group turns to the others and says, ""You know, I could run for President.""', 'That is not the Presidency for which I run. I do not want to be the President of a nation perishing under the mushroom cloud of nuclear holocaust. And I intend to build the military defenses which will prevent such a disaster. But neither do I wish to be the President of a nation which is being driven back because of its own unwillingness to make the sacrifices and bear the burdens which the struggle for freedom demands - a nation which is perishing, in the words of T. S. Eliot, ""not with a bang but a whimper.""', 'That is the real issue of our time. And all the slanders and insults, the accusations of surrender and softness, the distortions and rhetoric, cannot obscure the hard fact of our mounting danger.', 'And my only pledge to you is this: That if I am elected I will summon all the resources of this great and strong Republic to make the coming years the years when freedom grew strong and began to move ahead.']"
308,John F. Kennedy ,"October 19, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Your Eminence Cardinal Spellman, Mr. Silver, Mr. Vice President, Governor Rockefeller, Mayor Wagner, Mrs. Warner, Members of the Senate, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, fellow voters [laughter], I am glad to be here at this notable dinner once again, and I am glad that Mr. Nixon is here, also. [Applause]. Now that Cardinal Spellman has demonstrated the proper spirit, I assume that shortly I will be invited to a Quaker dinner honoring Herbert Hoover. [Laughter.]', 'Cardinal Spellman is the only man so widely respected in American politics that he could bring together amicably, at the same banquet table, for the first time in this campaign, two political leaders who are increasingly apprehensive about the November election [laughter] who have long eyed each other suspiciously, and who have disagreed so strongly, both publicly and privately, Vice President Nixon and Governor Rockefeller [laughter].', 'Mr. Nixon, like the rest of us, has had his troubles in this campaign. At one point even the Wall Street Journal was criticizing his tactics. That is like the Observatore Romano criticizing the Pope. [Laughter.]', 'But I think the worst news for the Republicans this week was that Casey Stengel has been fired. [Laughter.] It must show that perhaps experience does not count. [Laughter and applause.]', 'On this matter of experience, I had announced earlier this year that if successful I would not consider campaign contributions as a substitute for experience in appointing ambassadors. Ever since I made that statement I have not received one single cent from my father. [Laughter and applause.]', 'One of the inspiring notes that was struck in the last debate was struck by the Vice President in his very moving warning to the children of the Nation and the candidates against the use of profanity by Presidents and ex-Presidents when they are on the stump. And I know after 14 years in the Congress with the Vice President that he was very sincere in his views about the use of profanity. But I am told that a prominent Republican said to him yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., ""Mr. President, that was a damn fine speech."" [Laughter.] And the Vice President said, ""I appreciate the compliment but not the language."" And the Republican went on, ""Yes, sir, I liked it so much that I contributed a thousand dollars to your campaign."" And Mr. Nixon replied, ""The hell you say."" [Laughter and applause.]', ""However, I would not want to give the impression that I am taking former President Truman's use of language lightly. I have sent him the following wire:"", '\n  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have noted with interest your suggestion as to where those who vote for my opponent should go. While I understand and sympathize with your deep motivation, I. think it is important that our side try to refrain from raising the religious issue.\n', '[Laughter and applause.]', 'One of the subjects that interests candidates and those who write about candidates is whether 1960 will be another 1928. I have had some interest in that question myself, and looking at the speeches of Governor Smith in the 1928 campaign, I am struck by the continuity of the themes. The 1928 and 1960 campaign, with all of the obvious differences, have much in common. In 1928, as in 1960, the Yankees won the penant, the Postmaster General was promising efficient mail delivery at last, farm purchasing power was down some 20 percent in 1928 compared to 8 years earlier, just as it is today. Three million people had left the farms in that period, just as they have in the last 8 years. The stock market was unstable and two-thirds of all corporate profits went to one-fourth of 1 percent of the corporations.', 'In September 1928, the Republican candidate for the Presidency declared:', '\n  Real wages have improved more during the past 7 1/2 years than in any similar period in the history of our country.\n', ""He spoke of the country's unparalleled progress. He stressed American comfort, hope, and confidence for the future are immeasurably higher than they were 7 1/2 years ago."", 'The Democratic candidate in 1928 questioned how stable our prosperity was. He pointed to the pockets of industries. We warned of a farm depression. He criticized administration farm vetoes. He stressed, and I quote him, ""The necessity for the restoration of cordial relations with Latin America"" and he called for more effective action against disarmament.', 'The Democratic nominee in 1928 spoke 30 years ago tonight about building a stronger America, strengthening not only our economy but our sense of moral purpose and our public duty. In all of these and other ways, 1960 and 1928 may be sisters under the skin.', 'Some say that this will also be true when the ballots are counted, that the religious convictions of the candidates will influence the outcome more than their convictions on the issues. But this is where I believe that 1928 and 1960 are very different. Regardless of the outcome, and regardless of these similarities, I do not believe the American voter in 1960 is the same as the American voter of 1928, for we live in a different world.', ""There are a billion more people crowding our globe, and every American can hear the rumbling of a distant drum. The next President will have a budget 25 times as large as that of the candidates in Al Smith's time, and he will face problems unprecedented in that time or in any time in our long history, automation and unemployment, farm surpluses and food shortages, a high cost of living in the midst of an economic slump, new nations, new leaders, the world is different across the street and on the other side of the moon. The white race is in the minority, the free-enterprise system is in the minority, and the majority are looking at us harder and longer than they ever looked before."", 'The people who live in the tenements of Africa and Asia and Latin America want to fight their way out of the slums. The lower east side of the world is looking for help, and unlike 1928 the lower east side of the world has a voice and a vote.', '""The world is large,"" John Boyle O\'Reilly wrote, ""The world is large when its weary league two loving hearts divide, but the world is small when your enemy is loose on the other side.""', ""In 1960, as never before, our enemy is loose on the other side. In 1928 the voters perhaps could be excused for not seeing the storm coming, the depression, the Japanese conquest of Manchuria, Hitler's rise, and all the rest. But in 1960, the citizens of this country face the great question of whether freedom will not only endure, but whether it will also prevail. Thus, 1960 and 1928 are very different. It will be with this view of America that we shall accept the fortunes of November 8, 1960, be they favorable or unfavorable, good or bad. The American people in 1960 see the storm coming. They see the perils ahead. 1960 is not 1928. I am confident that whatever their verdict, Republican or Democratic, myself or Mr. Nixon, that their judgment will be based not on any extraneous issue, but on the real issues of our time, on what is best for our country, on the hard facts that face us, on the convictions of the candidates and their parties, and on their ability to interpret them."", 'When this happens then the bitter memory of 1928 will begin to fade, and all that will remain will be the figure of Al Smith, large against the horizon, true, courageous, and honest, who in the words of the cardinal, served his country well, and having served his country well, nobly served his God.

That is not the way we are going to survive. That is not the way we survived in the past. It has been on our willingness to face facts, to tell the truth, to tell the truth in New York and in Arizona and in Florida and in California, to stand for the same things, and we stand for strengthening this country of ours, making it stronger here at home, building the kind of society in this country so that people around the world who wish to be free, wish to follow us, wish to identify themselves with us, wish to follow our leadership.', ""Abraham Lincoln said in the election of 1860 that this Nation cannot exist half slave and half free.

[Applause.] If we do well in New York, it will be due in good measure to the tremendous job that was done by all of you, the Democratic Party, the citizens, the liberals and others, in providing for maximum registration and therefore for maximum participation on November 8.', 'This was an outstanding piece of constructive public service, and I congratulate you for the part that you played in it. We believe in a maximum extension of the right to vote. We believe in participation. We believe that everyone should vote, and I believe that if we can get a good vote out on November 8, now that we have them registered - I cannot believe in 1960, with all of the problems that this country faces at home and abroad, that the American people are going to do anything else but say ""Yes"" to progress, that they are going to vote, I believe, the Democratic ticket. [Applause.]', 'Let me say, briefly, I believe there are two points. First, those of you who are active in labor, those of you who lead organized labor movements, are concerned about the welfare of your people and concerned about the welfare of the general public, and you know very well, perhaps better than anyone, that this country still has unfinished business, that we have to maintain full employment, that we have to advance the standards of living of our people, of better housing, of better minimum wage, of medical care for the aged.', 'Franklin Roosevelt could put forward a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935, but that does not mean the job was finished. Ninety percent of the Republicans could vote against 25 cents an hour in 1935 just as they voted against $1.25 minimium wage in 1960. The principle is the same. It is our responsibility to bring those programs, extension of the right to vote, civil rights, minimum wage, housing, education, to increase the opportunity for all Americans to share in the abundance. And I do not share the view of the Vice President that these programs are extreme; $1.25 minimum wage, not this year, not until 1962, for those people already covered, not until 1964 for the newly covered, and still that bill was voted against by 75 to 80 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans.', 'Now, I believe the issue is quite clear in this field of social legislation. On those matters of concern to the people, matters which go to the right of a person to participate as an active citizen, because he has to live, I believe we stand on the side of the future.', 'Secondly, those of you who are active in organized labor are concerned about your country. You hold no narrow view, I am confident, of your position in society. You believe the labor movement and all Americans have an obligation to participate in strengthening our country, making it work, making our system move, providing employment for our people, a better standard of living, setting an example to the world.', 'So I appreciate your support. I can asure you we are going to keep working and I hope if we are successful on November 8, that it can be the beginning of a great movement forward in this country. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
313,John F. Kennedy ,"October 20, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to present to you Judge Ughetta, who is running for the Court of Appeals in New York State. [Applause.] Your Congressman today. [Applause.]', 'My name is John Kennedy, and I come here as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States. [Applause.] I come here as the standard bearer of a party which in this century has run men like Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt, and I run in their tradition.', 'I want to make it clear that this is a contest between two candidates and two political parties who disagree on what is needed to be done to make our country strong. The Democratic Party and I believe in a minimum wage of $1.25. We believe in urban renewal and better housing. We believe in a stronger economy that provides full employment, and we believe in equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race or regardless of their religion. And I come over here to Brooklyn and ask your help. [Applause.)', 'In the first television debate with Mr. Nixon, I said in this country of ours, which prides itself on being the symbol of freedom, I saw no reason why, if a Negro baby and a white baby were born side by side, that white baby had twice as much chance of finishing high school as the Negro baby; he had three times as much chance of getting to college as the Negro baby; he had four times as much chance, the white baby did, of having a job and of being a professional man as that Negro baby, and that Negro baby was four times more likely to be unemployed in his life than that white baby.', ""I don't say that all people have equal talent, but what I do say is that everyone should have their chance to develop their talent equally, and I want to make it clear that whether I am elected President of the United States or not, whether I continue in the Senate, or whether I win the office, this country in the next 4 years is going to make progress forward in providing every American with his constitutional rights."", 'I want it said at the end of our administration, if we are successful, that every American had an equal chance, every American had a fair chance to develop his talents, and that is all we ask and that is all that any American asks. [Applause.]', ""We stand for that, win or lose, up or down, fair winds or not. We are committed to that program, not just as Democrats, but as Americans. We are a free country, and there are not many free countries, and we want everyone to be free. When an African diplomat comes here and can't find decent housing in Washington, it isn't because he is an African; it is because he is a Negro. Do you know of 200 Federal district judges, there is not one that is a Negro? Do you know how many members of our Foreign Service are Negroes, even though the majority of the world is colored? Twenty-six out of 6,000."", 'Well, we can do better and we are going to have to do better if we are going to survive. [Applause.] Africa today has one-fourth of all the votes in the General Assembly. Do you know there are four countries in Africa without a single American diplomat representing us? Do you know that we brought more students from all over the world to study here than we did 10 years ago? We offered at the time of the Congo in June 300 scholarships. Do you know that was more scholarships to Africa and the Congo than we had offered to all of Africa the year before? I believe we can do better.', ""I think it is time we stopped standing still. I think it is time we started moving ahead as Americans and as believers in freedom. I want to make it very clear that we stand on this issue. We stand for moving ahead in the 1960's. We stand for full employment, and better housing. I stand where Franklin Roosevelt stood, and I come to Brooklyn which supported him, and ask your help. [Applause.]""]"
314,John F. Kennedy ,"October 20, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I come here tonight to ask your support in this campaign. I think this campaign in its own way and considering the problems that our country faces is as important as the campaign of 1932 that elected Franklin Roosevelt President of the United States.', 'Put your thumb down regardless of what you do. We are fighting a candidate, the Republican Party, that for 20 years has opposed what the people need, minimum wage, housing, unemployment compensation. The real issue is which party and which candidate can best strengthen the United States, can best serve the public interest.', 'I run against a candidate who in 1960 says we have never had it so good. As a Democratic candidate for the Presidency, I run on a platform that this is a great country that must be greater, a powerful country that must be more powerful, and the chief responsibility of the next President of the United States is to build the strength of America, and when we build the strength of America, we build the strength of freedom. We oppose those who wish to stand as we are, and I come over here to Brooklyn, a Democratic county, and ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.]', 'This is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, and here in Brooklyn they are concerned as they are all over America. I come over here and ask your help. [Applause.]']"

Thank you very much. [Applause.]', ""I would like to have you meet - you all know former Congressman O'Toole. I served in the Congress with him 14 years ago.

[Applause.]', 'I come over here to Brooklyn in this campaign - I come over here to Brooklyn in this campaign to ask your help. This is an important campaign, because the Office of the Presidency is important, and on the good judgment, responsibility, sense of vigor, sense of progress, foresight, of the next President of the United States, hangs the lives of all of us. So I run for the Presidency after 14 years in the Congress, because I believe that it is time this country began to move forward again. [Applause.] Before I believe that in 14 years in the Congress, on every piece of legislation which benefits the people, I believe the majority of the Democrats have voted ""Yes"" and the majority of the Republicans have voted ""No.""', 'I run against Mr. Nixon [response from the audience] - I wish he were here to hear that cheer. [Laughter.] I wish he would accept the fifth debate so the people of the country could hear. [Applause.]', 'He runs on a slogan of standing up to Khrushchev, and yet he is not willing to let the American people hear him for the fifth time espouse his views of what our country must do.', 'I come over here to Brooklyn to ask your help. I run for the Presidency in the most difficult time in the life of our country, but with the greatest confidence, that if this country is given the kind of leadership which I believe it needs, if we are willing to go to work again, this country can meet any obstacle and can serve as an inspiration to freedom around the globe. So I come to Brooklyn to ask your help in this campaign, and if we are elected, we are going to go to work. [Applause.]']"

318,John F. Kennedy ,"October 20, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. My friend Bob Wagner, guest of honor Pat Clancy, Reverend Clergy, Bert Kobler, Frank O'Connor, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Bob Wagner. He and I are graduates of the Al Smith school of dinners of last night. [Laughter.] The Vice President claimed Al Smith for his work in his latter years and I claimed him for his work in the 1928 campaign. Neither one of us indicated what Al Smith would do in 1960. It is possible he would have voted Republican but I think he would have prayed Democratic this year. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""In any case, I am delighted to be here, because Pat Clancy and Bert and the members of the Queens group were generous enough to support me at the convention, and if I had not been supported by New York, I would not have been nominated. [Applause.] And if I had not been nominated, I would not have taken that fine drive with Bob Wagner yesterday, and over there with Joe Sharkey tonight. I want to tell you there are still some Democrats in Brooklyn. I don't know what the New York Daily News will report about Brooklyn but the sample we took tonight is very good."", ""I come here tonight as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party and that I do with a sense of responsibility. To lead a great party on any occasion is a burden, is an obligation, to lead a great party in an election like 1960 where I think the issues are quite sharp, where I think the matters in dispute are of great importance, where the burdens that the next President will bear are extremely heavy, where the responsibilities that the citizens of this country will meet in the coming year must make us all conscious that to be a citizen of the United States in the 1960's will be a hazardous occupation."", 'A political campaign, I think, should be more than just a contest between two men or two political parties. In a very real sense, it should be a time of decision for the Nation, and my judgment is that if we are successful, it will be because the American people have decided for their own good and because they are conscious of their responsibilities to the cause of freedom that it is time this country started to move again. That really is the issue of the 1960 campaign. It is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is not really just a contest between our two political parties. It is a contest between two views of where the United States stands in 1960, and where it must stand in the sixties if it is going to not only endure but prevail as a great, free country. That is why I think this election is important. [Applause.]', 'I want to pay tribute to the Democratic organization of Queens. This organization made it possible for Franklin Roosevelt in another time to be elected President of the United States. Earlier it made it possible for Woodrow Wilson to be elected President of the United States. By your actions up to the election time of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 this organization played a part in all the things that he did that were of service to the country.', 'In 1960, if we are successful, your commitment to the Democratic Party, your efforts in this campaign, do not stop with November 8. All that we do, all that we are able to do in meeting our responsibilities, if I am successful, as President of the United States, you will participate in. [Applause.]', 'Political action is the highest responsihility of a citizen. I hold the view that any American in these times should be willing to accept the discipline of political action. By your being willing to do it, by your making it possible for us to win this campaign, as I hope we will, you then participate not only in the struggle of election, but you participate in all that is done afterward. And it is my hope that what is done afterward will make you feel that your efforts have been worthwhile. So I come here tonight to join you in paying tribute to a citizen who has met his responsibilities as a citizen, who has shown versatility in meeting his obligation, head of the chamber of commerce, as an attorney, as a political leader. He has met his obligation to Queens, to New York and to the country. And as one who is attempting to do the same in a difficult time, I am honored to have the chance to come and pay tribute to him. I admire him. He has been a friend of mine, and as the mayor said, I feel on these occasions it is a privilege to come and join you.', 'This is an important election. Whoever wins New York will be the next President of the United States. [Applause.] And I think it is very possible that whoever carries Queens will be the next President of the United States. [Applause.]', ""Queens is going Democratic in local elections, with Jimmy Delaney and all the rest, but it goes Republican nationally. That is a terrible habit. [Laughter.] I hope you will be voting Democratic locally and nationally. Actually I have been encouraged in the developments this week, particularly with what happened to the New York Yankees. Casey Stengel's experience shows that perhaps experience does not count. I believe that we can win this election. [Applause and laughter.]"", 'So I come to you tonight. We have about 2 1/2 weeks to go but I stand on the right hand of Mr. Clancy on this occasion, whether elected to continue as a Senator in the days to come, I will also stand with him if elected President of the United States. I will consider it an honor to join you on any occasion that you pay him tribute. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
319,John F. Kennedy ,"October 21, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Wagner, Mrs. Wagner, Harry Van Arsdale, your distinguished president, Mr. Freeman, Joe Keenan, Jeremiah Sullivan, ladies and gentlemen, I was glad to accept your invitation to come here for two or three reasons. In the first place, after 14 years on the Labor Committee, I knew a good deal about the Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. I know a good deal about this union. I know a good deal about its leadership. I know what it has stood for. I know what its contribution has been. Therefore, I was delighted to accept the invitation to come here tonight and join you on this occasion. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, at the time that I was engaged in a hard fight in the West Virginia primary, when the issue was greatly in doubt, your distinguished president, Gordon Freeman, issued a statement in my behalf, one of the few people who did it, and, therefore, that gives me another reason for being here tonight. Joe Keenan, who has been your secretary, has been traveling with me as my assistant on labor matters in this campaign for many months. Harry Van Arsdale was a supporter of mine at the Democratic Convention. So I feel tonight that I am among friends. [Applause.]', ""This union has the responsibility to its members, to the community at large, and by joining together you work to protect the interest of your members, and you have and have had in your history a sense of responsibility to the public interest. I run for the office of the Presidency because I believe that only a national leadership which attempts to build our country, which attempts to build our economy, which attempts to move our country forward, to strengthen our position here at home, and abroad - that is the only kind of leadership that America needs and deserves in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", ""This issue which divides Mr. Nixon and myself, which divides the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, has divided us through many years of our history. It divided the country in l932, and the American people choose progress. It divided the country in 1912, and the American people chose the New Freedom and Woodrow Wilson. The Repubiclan Party has been the party of the status quo. It has opposed most of the pieces of progressive legislation which now are generally accepted as being useful, useful to the public interest, but which were fought tooth and nail through the 1930's and 1940's. Now we come forward with new programs and new solutions to new problems. But I do not know that this administration has given us leadership, I don't think this administration has set before the country the unfinished business of our society. The last 9 months of thisyear - do you know what the economic growth of the United States is? And that goes to the question of whether you are going to have jobs and your children have jobs. It was minus 0.3 percent. The lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years. We are going to have to do that at a time when machines are taking the place of men. One machine - coal, steel, automobiles, paper, even in your business - 1 machine can take the job of 5 or 10 men. What happens to those 5 or 10 men? Unless our economy is moving ahead, and this is the central domestic responsibility of the next administration, unless our economy is moving ahead, you are going to have a gradual slackening of people working, and instead of there being 4 million, it will be more and more."", ""I think this is not an easy problem. I don't run for the Presidency saying that these problems are easy or the solutions are readily available. But I do say we can move off dead center. I do say that we have to bring people to Washington who are concerned with the public interest, who can look forward over the horizons of experience at home and abroad and give this country leadership. And this fight is a continuing one. In 1935, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against social security. In 1937 and 1938, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against the 25-cent minimum wage. This summer, when we tried to improve the standards of social security by providing medical care for the aged tied to social security, again the great majority of the Republicans, over 90 percent, voted against medical care for the aged tied to social security. Eighty percent of the members of the House of Representatives who are Republicans voted against the $1.25 minimum wage, $50 a week for a 40-hour week for an industry, a business, that makes more than a million dollars a year. How can anybody live on it? No Member of the Congress could. I believe that we can do better."", 'I come tonight and ask your help. I don\'t say this is an easy campaign. I don\'t say the problems that the next President will face are easy. But I believe that we have a great country, and I believe it is incumbent upon us to use our human and material resources to the fullest. We are the defenders of freedom. If we fail, if we stand still, if we give the impression that our brightest days are in the past, then it affects not only us, but all those who look to us for leadership. So I come here and stand as the Democratic nominee for the Presidency. I stand where in this century stood Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon stands in this century where McKinley stood and Harding and Coolidge and Landon and Dewey. And I believe the choice is clear. I believe in 1960 the American people are going to say, ""Yes."" I believe that they are tired of standing still. I believe this country is about to begin another great movement forward, and I come here tonight and ask your help in this effort. [Applause.]', 'I want the people of the world to know, those who live in the world south of us, I want those who live behind the Iron Curtain to know, that here in this country a new and vital leadership has taken over, a society which is determined to move ahead, a society which is determined to identify itself with the aspirations of people everywhere to be free, to live in dignity, to enjoy the rights which freedom gives them.', 'I come here tonight and ask you to join us in this effort to build a stronger country. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

He has talked to everyone in the United States, and everyone in Missouri knew where he stood, what he liked, and what he didn't like. I am delighted he is here on our platform with us tonight."", 'I speak tonight in the presence of a great tradition. This auditorium was dedicated 24 years ago by a great Democratic President, Franklin D. Roosevelt [applause], and standing by him on that occasion was a young Senator from the State of Missouri, who is younger today, former Senator Harry Truman. [Applause.]', 'I must say they have made it easy to run as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency in 1960. Mr. Nixon has to talk about McKinley and Harding [laughter and applause] and Coolidge and Landon, and Dewey [response from the audience]. Sometimes I think it isn\'t fair to us. Who can I talk about? Woodrow Wilson? Franklin Roosevelt? [Applause.] Harry Truman? [Applause.] Mr. Nixon has two speeches. One is the speech that he gives in some parts of the country where he suspects some unsuspecting Democrats may be possibly passing by and turn to listen. In that speech he says, ""Party labels don\'t mean a thing. What counts is the man."" ""I am not really anything. Therefore you can elect me."" ""I am not a Republican."" [Applause and laughter.]', 'Then he gets down to Arizona in the land of Goldwater and he says ""I am a Republican from top to bottom. I endorse everybody. I believe in the principles of the Republican Party.""', 'Now, I don\'t have to do that. I can go north, south, east, and west, and say I am a Democrat. I stand in the Democratic tradition. [Applause.] And I believe party labels do mean something. Do you think the Democrats would ever have run a candidate like McKinley, who ran on the slogan ""Stand Pat""? [Response from the audience.] Do you think they ever would have ""Returned to Normalcy"" with Warren G. Harding, or ""Kept Cool With Coolidge""? [Response from the audience.]', 'We ran on slogans in our day like the New Freedom, which had its international counterpart in the 14 points. Franklin Roosevelt ran on the New Deal, which had its international counterpart in the Four Freedoms. Harry Truman ran on the Fair Deal [applause] which had its international counterpart in the Truman doctrine, the Marshal plan, NATO, Point Four. [Applause.] They didn\'t go around the world, President Truman and President Roosevelt, saying all was well. ""You never had it so good."" They took the American people into their confidence. They realized that these were challenging days for any free society, and it was incumbent upon the President, and only the President could do this, to set before the American people the unfinished agenda, the business, the things we must do if we are going to maintain our freedom and our independence. [Applause.]', 'I am here in part to repay an obligation which is more than a century old. Senator John Quincy Adams from my own State, who after being President of the United States, represented a small district in Massachusetts in the Congress of the United States for 20 years, there made his most distinguished record as a great fighter against slavery, and when he died, the man who gave the eulogy was a man from a different section, a different party, a different experience, a different State. It was the first Senator from the State of Missouri, one of the alltime greats who served this State with courage, and the Union, Senator Thomas Hart Benton. [Applause.] For 30 years Senator Benton said he had relied upon the intelligence and the fairness of the people of Missouri and they had never disappointed him. In his speech once he said, ""I despise the bubble popularity that is won without merit and lost without pride. I value solid popularity, the esteem of good men for good action."" That is what this world needs and that is what our country needs, not words and speeches given by candidates and others. What we need are good works and the esteem of good men, backed by good action. That is why the name of Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman goes ringing down the corridors, because they matched their words with action. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon in our TV debate last night said America's prestige will be just as high abroad as the spokemen for America allow it to be."", 'That is the kind of sentence we have seen a good deal of in this campaign. Then he went on to say that any of the statements which we may have made in this campaign as the representatives of the Democratic Party on space and education and economic growth, our influence in Latin America, and all the rest can only have the effect of reducing our prestige. Mr. Nixon could not be more wrong. Our prestige abroad is not what we say it is, but what it is. [Applause.] It is not the esteem of good men for good words; it is the esteem of good men for good action. [Applause.] What we are here at home speaks far louder than what we say. The kind of society that we build here, the fairness with which we treat our people, their equal opportunity for development of their talents, the kind of jobs they hold and wages they earn, the kind of houses in which they live, the kind of education which they get, the kind of security which they achieve in their older age, these are the things that build a strong and vital society.', 'The Soviets reaching the moon was not an invention of my campaign. The first vehicle of space was called Sputnik, not Vanguard. The first passengers to return safely from outer space were named Strelka and Belka, not Rover, or Fido or even Checkers. [Applause.]', 'I did not invent our overcrowded schools. I did not invent the 5 or 6 million Americans that live out their lives waiting for food packages from the Federal Government which amount to 5 cents per day per person. I did not invent the fact that our steel capacity today is moving ahead and being used only 50 percent of capacity. I did not invent the fact that there is $9 billion worth of surplus food stored away in this rich country of ours, and farm income has dropped 25 percent in the last 8 years. A farmer in Missouri said last spring, ""I am going to plant corn and I hope I break even. I need the money.""', 'They have not been breaking even. And even Mr. Nixon admitted it in the great debate he had with Mr. Krushchev, when he stuck his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face and said, ""You may be ahead of us in rockets but we are ahead of you in color television."" [Applause.]', 'These rockets impress people. How impressed have they been with our color television? Mr. George Allen, the head of the USIA, the Director of our Information Service, made the most alarming statement when he said last June that 40 years ago the Soviet Union was the most backward country in Europe, now, because they had achieved a significant breakthrough in space, many of the people of the underdeveloped world began to think that they equaled the United States in science and productivity. And a Gallup poll taken last February, in 9 out of 10 countries, showed that a majority of people thought that the Soviet Union would be the first in science in 1970, and first in military power.', 'I did not invent it, Mr. Nixon. The facts are there. It has been achieved. This image of America, during an administration which you have claimed to be a partner, and as a citizen of the United States, I believe it is time for a change. [Applause.]', 'I believe that we can get at this matter very fairly. There are now within the Department of State certain studies and certain polls which have been made of our position overseas. The State Department has been reluctant and unwilling to release them, even though they have been paid for by the taxpayers of the United States, and even though the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Fulbright, has asked that they be made public, for our information. Mr. Nixon said that he had no objection, and I will quote him: he ""would have no objection to making them public."" I challenge him to demonstrate his influence with this administration and his willingness to have the real facts known. [Applause.]', ""I challenge him to have these facts made public and then we can determine which candidate, which party, addresses itself and themselves to the great issues which face our country. [Applause.] In the coming years, we must rebuild our strength around the world. We must demonstrate that we are a strong and vital society, that we are solving our own problems, that we are identified with the fight which is going on against the poverty and disease and illiteracy and ignorance, that in this free country of ours we are our brothers' keeper, and that here in the United States we are building the kind of society which they can build in their own time with our help."", ""I think the next President of the United States should reestablish the atmosphere that existed in the 1930's of the good neighbor policy. [Applause.] We must demonstrate in Africa, by an imaginative use of technical assistance, a program initiated by President Truman on what can be done in those great countries where people live on an income of $35, $40, or $45 a year. How can we hope, where ignorance is their constant companion, where there is in the Congo less than 12 college graduates, where the standard of living is pathetically low, how can we expect them to choose freedom, how can we expect them to identify themselves with us? How can we expect to block the Communist advance when we have been wholly indifferent?"", 'I believe the responsibilities which the next President and the next administration will bear are as great as any in our history. I believe that this country can meet any of its responsibilities. I have the greatest possible confidence in it. I believe with new leadership this country can begin the great march forward in the sixties that must be taken if we are going to maintain the peace and maintain our own security [Applause.]', 'This is a great country, but this country cannot move forward unless the people of this country will make a decision for progress on November 8, the kind of decision which they made in November of 1948 and November of 1932 and November of 1912, the decision to pick themselves up and start along the road of motion, of vigor.', 'Mr. Nixon suggests that everything that could be done is being done. He says our prestige is so high he runs on a slogan ""We never had it so good."" What kind of leadership can that party and that candidate give in the changing years of the 1960\'s if he cannot read the map of the world and see our dangers and see our opportunities? [Applause.]', 'I come here to Missouri and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in building this country. I ask you to take your decision for progress on November 8 to build Missouri, to build the United States, to build the cause of freedom. Franklin Roosevelt in accepting his second presidential nomination before 100,000 people at Franklin Field, said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'I do not believe in 1961 the people of this country want a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. I think in 1960 and 1961 they are going to choose the kind of government identified with the names of Truman and Symington and Bolling and Dalton and the others. [Applause.] They are going to choose progress. [Applause.]', 'One hundred years ago in the campaign of 1860, Lincoln wrote to a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I see His hand in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later in 1960, when the issues are much the same, though the scale is larger, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice. We see the storm coming, and we know His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe we are ready. Thank you. [Applause; standing ovation.]']"
321,John F. Kennedy ,"October 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Everyone here has been spoken to by me in one speech or another during the last month at least two or three times, so I will not make one this morning. I will express my appreciation to John Dalton, who I am confident will be the Governor, Ed Long, who will be in the Senate, to Larry Carp, running for his seat in the Congress, and I am very hopeful that he will be successful in this fight, because Congress is key. In both the House and Senate I think we need all the good men we can get, so I am hopeful that this State will elect a Democratic Governor, a Democratic Senator and a Democratic Congressman.', 'I come here really in the last 2 1/2 weeks now of the campaign. I was informed ten minutes ago that we are not taking any more days off and from now on, for the next 17 days, we will be at it all the time, traveling around the United States. I think that is the way it ought to be.', 'This is a close, hard fought campaign in all of these States, including Missouri, for the Presidential race. I believe that if we can mobilize our resources, if we can stimulate sufficient interest, if we can inform the people exactly what the alternatives are, exactly what the choice is, what the record is of the candidates, what the respective record is of the parties, and what that record promises for the future, then I think we can go to November 8 with hope.', 'I want to tell you that I am grateful to all of you. Stu Symington has been the greatest possible friend he could be in the last 3 months. So I am most grateful to him as he knows. I hope we can carry Missouri. It really is key. We are trying to put together 260-odd votes which we need. In order to win the electoral vote, you have to put Missouri in the Democratic column. Therefore, this State has to be carried if we are going to be successful. So I come here today and ask you once again, if you can give us one last lift. I am sure John Dalton and Senator Long will he elected, and I hope Larry Carp is, and I think it is possible to sweep the Democratic ticket. I think it can be done. Missouri can be Democratic. You have had a great Democratic President from this State. I think the people know what the Democratic Party stands for, what it can do, what its opportunities are for the early sixties. So I come here today on one last go to see if we can move Missouri into the Democratic column. I think we have to do it if we are going to win this election. I want to express my thanks to each of you, to all of you around the room. This is the smallest breakfast meeting I have spoken to since I became a candidate, and one of the most important. I want to thank you all for coming this morning, and to tell you that I appreciate your help. I am sure we can be successful and that you know that your contributions to this campaign have been in the public interest. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
322,John F. Kennedy ,"October 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Governor, Senator Ed Long, Larry Cox, my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, Senator Stuart Symington, your county chairman, George Johnson, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I came here this morning from New York and you came here today from your homes because all of us share an interest and concern for our country and all of us want to do the best things for it. I am the standard bearer for the Democratic Party and as such I consider it our responsibility to put forward our views of what we would do if our country is going to maintain its position in the world and the people of this country will live a more prosperous life.', ""During the long history of the United States, the pendulum between the two parties, Republican and Democratic, has swung back and forth, back and forth, depending on the candidates, depending on the parties, depending on the needs of our time. I don't think there is anyone in this country, Republican or Democratic, that would deny that the Republican Party has been and is on the whole a conservative party, and that the Democratic Party is a progressive party. [Applause.] And it has depended on which party and which times, for the majority of the people, which way they wished to go. Do they wish to more or less conserve themselves, or build their strength, have they determined that now is the time to move forward again? The decision you have to make as voters on November 8 is which time is this in the life of our country? What are the problems that our country faces? Is it a time when we can stand still more? Is it a time for conserving our resources, looking at ourselves, or is it a time for moving forward again?"", ""I don't think there is any doubt. [Applause.] Personally I don't think there is any question. The people of this country elected President Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. That is 8 years. Now, in 1960, you cannot be a citizen of this country, you cannot read the papers, you cannot look at outer space, you cannot look across the street, you cannot travel Missouri, you cannot travel the United States, you cannot look at the world around us, without deciding that it is time as Americans for another great movement forward. [Applause.]"", 'We are here in this State, in the heartland of the United States, a State which has produced in the last 15 years a great President. [Applause.] About 2 weeks ago, Mr. Nixon thought that he would dismiss me by calling me, ""He is just another Truman."" I said I regarded that as a compliment because he was just another Dewey. [Applause.] And after we had exchanged those remarks, I never heard that statement from him again. [Laughter.]', 'In any case, in the most serious time in the life of our country, and this is a serious time, because in the next 10 years around the world I believe the balance of power in the world may shift in one direction or another, if the Communists should make a decisive breakthrough in India or in Africa, or we should have other Cubas in Latin America, then the balance may turn in their direction. Then they may have the resources and the manpower and the technology and the military strength, the scientific strength, the educational strength, to begin to really surround the United States, to begin to move against us in a more direct way.', 'Otherwise we will make the decisive breakthrough. Russia and China might split apart; India succeed in its planning. Africa could determine to make itself free. Cuba could change. All these things could move in one direction or another in the next 10 years.', ""I believe in these years of transition, during these year's of hazard, during these years of change, we need a new administration in Washington which can bring to Washington, to our administrative positions, to the Congress of the United States, a spirit of movement, a spirit of looking to the future, foresight, judgment, some recognition of the turbulent world in which we live, some desire to maintain our freedom in this country, to develop our resources, to have the best educational system in the world. All these things the President of the United States cannot do. This is a free society, and the kind of country we have, the kind of strength we have, depends in the final analysis upon the people themselves. But the function and responsibility of the President is to set before the American people the unfinished business, the things we must do if we are going to succeed as a nation. My argument with Mr. Nixon, and my disagreement with him in this campaign, and I believe the basic issue of the campaign is the way we look at our country and its problems. He says our prestige has never been higher; he says that of the Communists has never been lower, and he points at the world around us. He points to the world around us. I look at the world around us and at our country, and I say this is a great country but it must be greater. I say it is time we started moving again. [Applause.] So I come here today and ask your help in this campaign. This State is a key State in this campaign. Whoever carries Missouri may well carry the United States. [Applause.]"", 'You are participating in the election of a President of the United States in the most difficult time in our history and on the President, on his judgment, on his sense of conviction, on his foresight, may well hang the security of the United States and the free world.', 'With full recognition of the responsibilities of the office, after 14 years in the Congress, after really believing that the President of the United States can strike a blow for freedom, I come here to this shopping center and ask your help. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
323,John F. Kennedy ,"October 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague in the Congress, Charley Brown, your distinguished United States Senator, who has served Missouri and the United States faithfully, and who has been a constant friend of mine and colleague, Stuart Symington [applause], Ed Long, your U.S. Senator, who succeeded Tom Hennings, and who I know you will elect to the Senate in November, John Dalton, who will be the next Governor of the State of Missouri [applause] Tom Eagleton, who is the candidate of the Democratic Party and I, hope the next attorney general of the State of Missouri, ladies and gentlemen, I come here as the Democratic standard bearer and you must make your decision on November 8 about the kind of State you want and the kind of district you want and the kind of town you want and the kind of country you want and the kind of world you want. All Mr. Nixon and I can do is present our views of that country and that State and that world, and that district, and then on one day you have to decide. And I want to make it very clear what I regard the choice to be.', 'It is a choice between the comfortable and the concerned. It is a choice between those who run on the slogan ""You\'ve never had it so good"" - and I want Mr. Nixon to come here and run on that slogan - and between those who say we must do better. It is between those who believe that this country is doing everything it must do in order to maintain its independence, its security, to meet its obligations around the world, and between those who say that we are going to have to revitalize our country, to move ahead, if we are going to fulfill our obligations to ourselves and to those who wish to be free.', 'I think this is an important election, and it is upon the citizens of the United States, not upon the candidates, that the burden finally falls, upon the miners, upon the farmers, upon the small businessmen, upon the mothers who want their children to be the best educated, upon all those who look at the world around them and say in this crucial time in the life of our country, ""I choose progress.""', 'I come here and ask your support not merely as the Democratic standard bearer but as an American who believes it incumbent upon us to be part of a generation, to live at a time when motion and action are our distinguishing characteristics, and foresight and willingness to look at the truth in the face. That has been a quality of this State since it came into the Union. Its first U.S. Senator, Thomas Hart Benton, was not a popular figure. In his own words, he despised the bubble popularity. But he looked the truth in the face and so did Harry Truman and so did the men in between, and so do our present Senators, and so do you. This State says, ""Show me,\' and I think you have to be shown. You don\'t need a map. You just have to read your paper. You just have to look at Latin America and look at Joplin, look at Asia and look at your mind, look at your farms and look at the outer side of space, look at education in this country, and housing, look at the prespects for urban renewal and know that the Republican Party for 25 years has said ""No,"" ""Maybe,"" ""Perhaps,"" ""We might,"" or vetoed it.', 'I believe this is the year when the American people are going to say they are going to move forward again. [Applause.] We have now had 8 years of the Republican leadership and I believe for our own sakes and for the sake of our country, and I believe this choice does not involve merely Mr. Nixon and myself - it involves all those who share the view I do, and I am sure you do, of this country and its future, of men like Stuart Symington, men like Charley Brown, men who have served this State and country and who know the facts of life where we live.', 'You say ""Show me."" I cannot believe that any American in 1960, faced with the problems that this country faces, faced with a militant adversary around the world, faced with a deteriorating position relative to our strength, faced with an economy that is moving ahead slowly, that dropped back in the last 9 months, that sees our steel mills using only 50 percent, which affects your mines in this community, sees farm income dropping sharply, over 25 percent, in the last 8 years, sees more small business failures by three than we had 14 years ago, 13 years ago, sees us pay interest on our debt because of our fiscal policy and monetary policy that is $3 billion more just in interest on our debt than we paid 10 years ago. --sees all of that and says that is the kind of leadership we want, that we want, Mr. Nixon to lead us in the dangerous sixties. [Response from the audience.]', 'I believe we want new leadership. We want new people in Washington. We want new policies. We want to move this district forward. We want to continue the kind of leadership which Charley Brown has given this district, Truman and Roosevelt and Wilson. [Applause.] Which John Dalton can give this State and Ed Long, as Stuart Symington has given it. Mr. Nixon stands where McKinley stood and Harding and Coolidge and Dewey and Landon. Where did they get those candidates? I stand where Woodrow Wilson stood. [Applause.] They got those candidates right out of the party. That was the best they had and that is who they ran - Harrison. Some man was found in a depression in his administration eating grass on the front of the White House lawn. He said, ""Tell him to go behind. The grass is longer."" [Laughter.]', ""Harding and Coolidge and McKinley and the rest of them - Alf Landon, who ran in 1936 on a program to repeal social security. Thomas E. Dewey - I don't know what his program was. We never did find out. [Laughter.] I think the best news we have had is what happened this week to Casey Stengel. It just shows that experience is not enough. [Laughter.]"", 'I come here to Joplin, here to Missouri here in this part of the central United States. About 2 weeks ago up in Boston, my own hometown, Mr. Nixon said I was just another Truman. I said I regarded that as a compliment because he was just another Dewey. [Applause.] When I first came in here they gave me a hat one size too small, which belonged to a miner, and there were eight or nine miners up there. I spent a month in a State which has a lot of miners in it, West Virginia. My own judgment is I know no tougher occupation in the world that to be a miner, lead, zinc, coal. I am always glad to meet them because I think they live with peril. They have as tough a life as there is. Every other one whose hand you shake has a finger off, a foot crushed, the chances of in 20 years their having a bad accident are more than any of the rest of us. And yet in this community and in West Virginia and Idaho and in other sections of the United States, there has been no group that has been harder hit, no group that has been more forgotten, and yet this administration, in spite of the fact that we are talking about people who are Americans. [Applause.] This administration vetoed twice, not once but twice, the area redevelopment bill, which was to help those sections of the United States hard hit.', 'This administration distributes its surplus food to miners and their families and others like them, nearly 4 or 5 million of them, 5 cents a day per person. Five cents a day per person, $6.50 for a family of four, not in India, but in America. Well, we are going to change all that. We are going to do better. [Applause.]', ""I don't think these problems are easy. I don't say these problems are easy. They are all different. Maintaining full employment in a free private enterprise economy is difficult. Maintaining a sound agricultural policy at a time when there is a technological revolution is difficult. Maintaining our position around the world in view of the changes in the world is difficult. But I know we can do better than they are doing. I know we can do better than Mr. Nixon. [Applause.]"", 'Ladies and gentlemen, on November 8, ""Show me."" [Applause.]']"
324,John F. Kennedy ,"October 22, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. I am grateful for the introduction of my old friend and colleague, Newell George. He has served this district with vigor and he also has served it responsibly, and he speaks also for the United States. So I am hopeful that the people of this district will reelect him to the Congress of the United States to continue to represent our country in that most important body. [Applause.]', ""Members of the House of Representatives are given under the Constitution power to levy taxes, the power to appropriate money. The Senate is confined to approving treaties and appointments by the President to high administrative offices. So quite obviously, the House is the key job. Any time you don't like the way your taxes are being raised or your money is being spent, it is to the House that you write, not to the Senate. [Laughter.]"", 'But in any case, he has done a good job. He is an old friend of mine and I am hopeful that this district - and I know that in Kansas it is tough for a Democrat - I am hopeful that the people of this district will support him and send him back.', 'In addition, I hope that Kansas will elect a U.S. Senator, Frank Theis, who will speak for Kansas. [Applause.] There are 100 Members of the Senate, 65 Democrats and 35 Republicans. Even if we lost every race, if the Republicans reelected every one of their incumbents in this fight and we lost every Democrat who is up for election, mathematically the Democrats would still Control the U.S. Senate. That being true, with the problems that Kansas has, particularly in the field of agriculture, particularly in the development of your resources, all the problems which a great State in the heartland of the United States has, specially in relation to the Government, it seems to me only commonsense that at least one of the Senators should be a member of the majority party, participating in the majority decisions, speaking for Kansas and the country in the Democratic Party.', 'Kansas today has two Republicans. The Senate will be Democratic. I believe that Frank Theis can serve this State and serve the country, and I am hopeful that he will be elected to the Senate of the United States. [Applause.] I spoke this afternoon in Wichita. We left New York after Mr. Nixon and I had our strange interlude. [Laughter.] Since then, since midnight, we have been to St. Louis, Joplin, Wichita, Kansas City, now Johnson County, and we are going to Green Bay, Wis., tonight, to attempt to carry our message tomorrow to the expectant and waiting voters of Wisconsin. But I was particularly anxious to come here. Mr. Nixon submitted a list, or his intimate advisors did, to some magazine this week, which gave his sure States. He gave us Massachusetts, I think, and Rhode Island. [Laughter.] He named a good deal of the United States and among the States that he claimed was Kansas. [Response from the audience.]', 'My impression has been that this election was not until November 8 and Kansas did not make up its judgment until then. My hope is that Kansas will vote Democratic as it did in 1936. [Applause.]', ""I don't want to disappoint him, but I do think it would be good for everybody if he got some surprises. [Laughter.]"", 'I am delighted to be here with Stuart Symington. He and I had equal claims, equal lines, on the Kansas delegation at the Democratic Convention. You divided yourselves in a Solomon-like way, so we are both happy but not too happy, so I am delighted to be over here with him tonight. [Laughter.] Your distinguished Governor spoke this afternoon at Wichita. He had an old commitment to go to a dinner and asked me if I would express his regrets to all of you. He did want to be here. He has been a distinguished Governor. He is going to lead the ticket. We are all grabbing his coattails, and I am confident that Docking, George, then Kennedy, may win here in Kansas. [Applause.]', 'Let me just say one word. We have a tendency in a campaign to simplify issues and talk pretty much in - I suppose it comes down to almost slogans, and I think that that is important, because I do believe that there is a party difference and a difference in point of view of the candidates, which has been shown really not so much by their speeches, though I hope that they reveal some difference in approach and character, but also by their record in the last 14 years. But I do want to make the point that all of these old fights which the Republicans and Democrats have been engaged in, which involve so-called social legislation, those fights are going to go on in the sixties, because we have a responsibility to meet our commitments, to improve the life of every American so that they participate to some degree or other in our general prosperity in our national life. The point I want to make, however, is that most of the difficult decisions which the next President will meet will involve problems about which we have thought very little. In other words, in 1940, during the presidential campaign between Wendell Willkie and Franklin D. Roosevelt, there was no discussion of the effects of breaking of the atom, and what the effect of possessing atomic weapons would be. And yet when Albert Einstein came in 1941 with a group of other scientists, Franklin Roosevelt endorsed the idea, appropriated nearly $2 billion to the Manhattan project, and, of course, we made the significant breakthrough.', 'In 1952, during the campaign between Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower, there was no discussion, really, of outer space, and yet this administration, when a similar opportunity was granted to it to make a significant breakthrough, to recognize the implications of the opportunity in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt had recognized it in 1941, when this administration was informed of the significance of outer space, both militarily and scientifically, we did not respond. My judgment is that we did not respond there as we have not responded to our needs in Latin America, our needs in Africa, our needs in Asia, our needs in disarmament, our needs in arms, because this administration has not been able to attract people of intellectual vitality, curiosity, foresight, and vigor. [Applause.]', 'This is not a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. Outer space is one example, and our failure to be first in outer space, as said Mr. George Allen of the Information Service, cost us more heavily in prestige, and I do not define prestige as popularity. I define prestige as influence, as an ability to persuade people to accept your point of view. That probably cost us more in the fifties than any other failure or any other decision or any other action. It persuaded people who lived in the underdeveloped countries that the Soviet Union, which was once so far behind, was now the equal and the superior in some degree of the United States. That is one of the reasons why I believe they are reluctant to release these polls we read about in the Department of State, because I believe these polls show that American prestige, the regard for America as a great scientific power has declined.', 'What is true about outer space is true about Latin America. Mr. Nixon said in September that if we had thought of a program of aid for Latin America of the kind we have now put forward as a result of our difficulties with Castro in 1955, he, and I quote him accurately [laughter and applause] said we might have been able to avoid Castro.', ""Why didn't they come in 1955? It could not have been so difficult to predict that these people in Latin America are part of the revolution of rising expectations. They are not going to be satisfied to live at $75 or $100 a year all the time when they see us rich and the Communists work among them. Look at Africa. Not until 1957 was there a Bureau of African Affairs. In 1957 we had more people stationed in Western Germany than in all of Africa. We had more students coming from abroad 10 years ago under Federal sponsorship than we do today. So my feeling is that this issue is not merely the old issue of the New Deal-Fair Deal issues, but really it is a question of which administration, which point of view, which philosophy can bring to Washington men of talent and curiosity, men who have some knowledge of the world in which we live, the kind of revolutionary times, and what is required of a free society in competing with a totalitarian society."", 'My judgment is that the Republican Party as presently constituted and presently led has not demonstrated either in the past or during this campaign that they have this kind of competence. Mr. Nixon could not run on the program that he runs on if he recognized our times. He could not run on the program that our power and prestige is at its height, that of the Communists at the lowest it has been, that everything is all right and being done in its proper measure. The very fact that he chooses that as his campaign indicates that he could not suddenly reverse in 1961 and determine on action. If he really believes these things he says, in my opinion he disqualifies himself. If he does not believe them, and runs on that program, he makes the same mistake that Stanley Baldwin made in England in 1935 which almost destroyed Great Britain, by misleading the people of England in 1935. He prevented them, by not telling them the truth, he prevented them from arming at a time when it might have been possible to prevent the disaster of Munich.', 'So I believe this issue involves a good deal more than Mr. Nixon and myself. It involves our parties. It involves men like the people who are going to represent you in the Congress and in the Senate, men like Senator Symington, Dick Bolling, men like President Truman, who we were with tonight, women like Mrs. Gray and others. This is a time once again for action. This is a time when we make our choice, that it is time that this country picked itself up again and went forward.', 'We are encouraged by the fact, as Mr. Casey Stengel showed us this week, experience perhaps does not count. [Laughter.] [Standing ovation.]']"
325,John F. Kennedy ,"October 22, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor and Mrs. Docking, my old friends, Frank Theis, who is going to be the next U.S. Senator from the State of Kansas [applause], Bill Robinson, who is going to speak for this district and the country in the U.S. Congress [applause], Congressman Hargis, Congressman Newell George, Congressman Floyd Breeding, and Congressmen-to-be Davis and Gardiner, ladies and gentlemen, I saw a list of States Mr. Nixon's headquarters put out - of the States that they had sure, the States that were doubtful, and one or two States that maybe we had [laughter], and among the States that they had sure, that they did not have to worry about, was Kansas. I don't believe it. [Applause.]"", 'If you can tell me how any farmer in the State of Kansas who has complained for 8 years about Mr. Benson\'s policies can vote for a candidate who is putting forward the very same policies - can you tell me how anyone who works in the plants here in Wichita or in business across Kansas, that work at a time when we are moving ahead at the slowest rate of economic growth since the last recession of 1958, can vote for Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party I [Response from the audience.] Can you tell me how a small businessman who has three times as much chance of going bankrupt this year as he did 10 or 12 years ago, can you tell me how any citizen can vote for a political party and leadership which permits us to be second in space? [Response from the audience.] In danger of being second in missiles? [Response from the audience.] Which permits 10 years ago, when we had twice as many scientists as they do now one-half every year? And yet a candidate and a party who runs on the slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good"" [Response from the audience.] A candidate and a party who refuses to permit documents paid for by the Federal Government relating to the taxpayers, relating to our position around the world, refuse to let the people see them because of the effect it would have on this election?', 'Can you tell me that Kansas this year can support that kind of leadership? I say it cannot. [Response from the audience.]', 'Lyndon Johnson, speaking recently in this area 2 or 3 weeks ago, said the farmers of Kansas and these States should sue Mr. Benson for nonsupport and cruelty. [Laughter and applause.]', 'A Kansas farmer said last week as he was planting his wheat, ""I hope I break even this year. I need the money."" I believe we can do better than that. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon offers two proposals for the farmer of this rich State. One is we eat our way out of the surplus. Those were Mr. Benson's very words. And that is an awfully big meal stored away. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""The second is, the other proposal is that if we pay a support price of 90 percent of the market price for the last 3 years. As the market price drops year by year, so does the support price. Any farmer in the State of Kansas who will just read Mr. Nixon's program and can accept the idea that he wants an agricultural program which provides the support price shall be tied not to a parity standard but tied to the market price - I must say that I think the record is clear, the warnings are clear. In 1952, there may have been some excuse because they were promised 100 percent of parity. Mr. Nixon makes it very clear. He is promising them an agricultural program which will eat up not only the surpluses but the farmer. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'And then he goes to New Jersey. This administration is the only administration that ever sent a Secretary of Agriculture to campaign in the city for votes. Mr. Nixon went to New Jersey and said, ""our agricultural program will increase the farmers income to such an extent that food prices will go up 25 percent."" Of course, that is like so many of his other statements made up of the whole cloth. A farmer gets 2 cents on the amount of wheat that is in a loaf of bread that may sell for 25, 6, 7, or 8 cents in the eastern part of the United States. If that farmer\'s income went up 10 or 15 percent of 2 cents, it would be what, 2 1/2 cents? I think Mr. Nixon ought to get out his adding machine and count our farm program, the effect of his farm program, and count the electoral votes of Kansas and he will come to a different conclusion. [Applause.]', 'For 24 long years Kansas has been faithful to the Republican Party. Now we come and ask your support in this election, not merely for Kansas, not merely for the United States, but for all those who believe that the United States has a role to fulfill as the great defender of freedom. You cannot be a citizen of this country, you cannot read your papers, you cannot listen to the discussion of the issues on television and radio, without knowing the truth of what I say, and that is we are not doing enough. Our power and prestige is not increasing as fast as it must. We are moving into a period of danger and hazard and opportunity. And unless this country is ready to go to work and move again by 4 years or 8 years, the tide will go out further. This is the moment of decision.', ""We present our views until November 8, and then you have to decide.

Don't you agree, looking at that State, that country, and that world, that the only way that we can maintain our position is by demonstrating in this country a sense of purpose, a sense of vitality, a sense of energy, a sense of conviction? Showing the people around the world that our brightest days are still ahead, our high noon in Wichita and across the world is in the days to come?"", ""I believe the next President of the United States should set before the American people the things we must do in the next decade, if we are going to provide leadership and security for ourselves and the free world.

We are a free society. It is completely up to you. Mr. Khrushchev is able to move his country by force, by his own direction. We move in this country by your force and by your direction, and by your willingness to commit yourselves to progress in the 1960's, and that is the issue.

I see the storm coming, and His hand is in it. If He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming.

I said I regarded it as a compliment, and he was just another Dewey. [Applause.] And be has not said it since. The fact of the matter is that this shopping center is called Truman Center, but also Mr. Truman is remembered for being a fighting President, who helped defend freedom after World War II in Greece and Turkey and Western Europe, through NATO and the Marshall plan and the rest. The Truman Center and the Truman Doctrine rests thousands of miles apart, but they are an expression of America at its best. I come here tonight to this center of a great Democratic State. I come here and ask your help. I ask you to join us in building the strength of America again. [Applause.] I shook hands coming over here tonight with some farmers, and how can you tell that they are farmers. It is because their hands are twice as big. I don't know what they do with it all day but it is twice as big because they work longer and harder than anybody with the possible exception of candidates for the Presidency. [Laughter.] And they average in pay about 60 cents an hour. I believe that this administration and its policies, pursued by Mr. Benson, called by Mr. Nixon the most remarkable Secretary of Agriculture in history, has helped liquidate the American farmer, and Mr. Nixon's program will continue it."", 'How can any farmer vote Republican in 1960? [Applause.] I understand nearby there was a farmer who planted some corn. He said to his neighbor, ""I hope I break even this year. I really need the money."" We want him to do more than break even.

You know it is not true. You cannot be a citizen of this country and read the paper and listen to the radio and watch television and look at space, and look across the street and come here and know that we are doing enough.

Or perhaps he can debate Senator Javits, of New York, who said 2 days ago that anyone who said that our prestige had not dropped was silly.

[Applause.]"", 'This is an important election. It involves not a choice between two men. It involves a choice between two points of view about the United States, two points of view about what we must do, two groups of men, two parties which have strongly different histories, which have indicated by their action in the 20th century that they move in a different way to approach the problems that they face.', 'I cannot believe in the dangerous years of the 1960\'s that the American people are going to say ""No"" to progress by electing the Republican Party again. [Applause.] In 1932, the people of this country put their confidence in Franklin Roosevelt because he promised vigorous new leadership. If they had wanted to stay the way they were, sunk in the valley of despair, they would have continued Mr. Hoover. But they chose to move agam. Now, in l960, the problem is not economic depression in the United States. The problem is on a worldwide scale, but in many ways it is the same choice that was offered in 1932, between Mr. Hoover and Mr. Roosevelt. It is between those whose imagination is limited, it is between those who represent a party which is circumscribed in action by its very nature, it is between those who rely for advice for cabinet appointments, for diplomatic appointments, on those who have a narrow concept of our role in the world, a limited sense of history, a limited sense of the future, of failure to recognize that we live in the most changing and turbulent times in the history of the world. That is the reason that we have been indifferent to the problems of Latin America. That is the reason that we have shown no recognition of what is happening in Africa. That is the reason that we don\'t talk about the real problems which face Asia particularly those which face India. That is why we don\'t really decide today what our policy is going to be in outer space and on atomic testing and on defense. It is not because there are not men of good will on both sides. It isn\'t because Mr. Eisenhower and Mr. Nixon and the others are not patriotic. It is because they represent a party which in domestic policy since Theodore Roosevelt have opposed progress. [Applause.]', 'The Democratic Party is a national party. It represents all groups in our society. It represents particularly, as our inheritance from Thomas Jefferson - and Mr. Nixon keeps going down South and saying we are not the heirs of Thomas Jefferson. I agree we are not running on the same platform Thomas Jefferson ran on. It is 160 years since he ran for President. But we are his inheritors in one particular way, I hope and believe, and that is Thomas Jefferson looked to the future. The whole Louisiana Purchase, his decision to send Lewis and Clark to the Pacific - all that represented a change. He was identified with the American Revolution. He was identified with what was new and changing. He was in touch in Europe and America with all of the course of intellectual life. The same is true with Andrew Jackson who represented a new tradition.', 'Mr. Nixon keeps saying we are not part of the tradition of Jefferson, Jackson, and Woodrow Wilson. The point is the problems are entirely new. But they all had a willingness in common - to move. They were the exact opposite in their physical and intellectual qualities from McKinley, Harding, Coolidge, from Massachusetts. As a White House usher said, ""In 42 years I never saw a President who slept so much.""', ""That isn't what you need in 1960. We need a party and candidates and people, we need ambassadors and cabinet officers, we need people on every level with a sense of our times, with a sense of the future, with a sense of the difficulties of a free society competing with a Communist society. To just mouth the old slogans, to talk about the problems of China as if it were just a problem of keeping them out of the United Nations - that is easy. That doesn't solve the problem of China, which is on the march, militant, dangerous, expanding, dedicated now to war, about to have in 2 or 3 years atomic weapons - the problems are entirely new and we must think anew, and I believe we can do it."", 'I have the greatest confidence in this country.

For there remain vital issues between us, and the country is entitled to have them thoroughly aired.', 'Moreover, it is not only between us that disagreement exists. Important conflicts are cropping up in Republican ranks. If the Vice President cannot find an hour to debate me for a fifth time, then at least he might debate Mr. Lodge, so they can air their differences on the Cabinet. At least he might debate Governor Rockefeller, so they can air their differences on defense policy. At least he might debate Senator Javits, so they can air their differences on American prestige abroad. At least he might debate Secretary Herter so they can air their differences on policy in the Far East.

And they must also be brought into sharp and clear focus so that people abroad can gain added respect for America.

[Applause.] Here in Wisconsin this campaign began last winter, and I think it ought to end right here. [Applause.] Because the motto of the State of Wisconsin and the slogan of this campaign is one and the same, ""Forward,"" and that is what this country must do, that is the direction it must take, that is the direction it will take November 8, when we make an affirmative decision.

[Applause.] Can you tell me one piece of legislation of benefit to the people? Housing? Civil rights? Aid for the farmer? Aid for the retired? Rights for labor? Can you tell me one program that either Mr. Nixon or the Republicans have supported. [Response from the audience.] I said in Cleveland about 3 weeks ago that I could not think of one program, and the Cleveland paper said I had forgotten what President Taft did about child labor. All right. What have they done since then? What have they done in the last 50 years? [Response from the audience and applause.]', 'This fight is important, because unless this country is moving ahead, this country will not lead a world which is moving ahead. The same political party, the Republicans, who could vote against social security in the thirties could vote unanimously against the medical care for the aged in the sixties. The same political party that could vote against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour in 1935 could vote against $1.25 an hour in 1960, and this goes to the heart of the issue, a party which fights progress, a party which is not prepared to associate with it, a party which has stood athwart the great social, international, and national movements of this century, sponsored by Wilson and Roosevelt and Truman - how can they lead in the dangerous sixties? How can they lead and move this country forward? How can they demonstrate to a watching world that we are a strong and vital society? In outer space, in the world around us, in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in Wisconsin, we are associated with a forward motion and they have stood still, and I believe on November 8, the people of this country are going to choose to move again. [Applause.]', 'I don\'t believe that this generation of Americans wants it said about us what T. S. Eliot in his poem ""The Rock"" said: ""And the wind shall say: \'These were decent people, their only monument the asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls.\'"" I don\'t believe that is what the people want. I think they want to move forward. [Applause]', ""The great question of the 1960's is how the United States can maintain its position in the world, how we can increase our security, how we can live in peace, how we can hold out a helping hand to all those who wish to he free, and the decision which you must make as decisions of this country is which administration, which candidates, which party, are best associated with the great issues which are going to distinguish life in the sixties, particularly the fight for peace, particularly the fight against war, especially the fight for security?"", 'Mr. Nixon and I both want peace. All Americans do. We both want to put an end to the arms race, and the possibility of a nuclear holocaust, but we do disagree, and we disagree very fundamentally, on the nature and the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of peace requires.', ""A few weeks ago, Mr. Nixon set forward his program for peace. It consisted of committees set upon committees, committees which will meet with other committees stretching around the world and across this country. But I don't believe you can talk your way into peace. I don't believe you can gain peace by conferences merely. I believe that peace, like any other goal, requires action. Words alone will never impress Mr. Khrushchev. Fingers pointed at his face in kitchen debates - he has spent his life debating. He has spent his life in argument. He is concerned only with peace, he is concerned only to disarm when he is convinced that that is the best for his system and best for the world. And how can we induce that desire in him, that is the question for the next President of the United States. [Applause.]"", 'If we are to secure peace, if we are to ever hope to negotiate for an effective arms control agreement, we must act immediately, for as each year passes the control of increasingly complex, mobile and hidden modern armaments becomes more difficult and the chances for country after country to possess an atomic capacity. By 1964 or 1965, we may see a world in which 20 countries have a nuclear capacity and the ability to destroy their adversary, themselves, and perhaps the world. In short, no problem is more vital, no problem is more immediate, than the problem of effective control over arms. Yet in the past 8 years, and in my opinion this is one of the most serious indictments that can be leveled against this administration, in this vital area in the past 8 years this administration has given this problem no attention. In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 people working on the complex subject of arms control and disarmament, less than 100 people, scattered through four or five agencies of the Government. When I reminded Mr. Nixon of this in one of the debates he gave one of his usual answers. ""Well, they were of extraordinary high quality.""', 'Who were they? Can you name one of them? Who were these geniuses at work that none of us could name?', 'Less than 100 of them scattered throughout the Government, working on one of the most vital subjects before the people of the world. A recent independent survey concludes, and I quote it accurately, ""The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research effort.""', 'As a result, we have been unprepared at every disarmament conference that we have attended. At a time when our relative military strength was at its height, in the mid fifties, at a time when we had the best chance to reach an agreement on control of arms, there was not a single top person in the entire Government working on this subject. We did not come up with a single major new proposal in the field of arms control, and we cared so little about it that we regarded the entire effort as merely a part of our effort in psychological warfare.', 'At the London Conference of 1957, the first important disarmament Conference held in the fifties, and the one which came closest of any in reaching an agreement on disarmament, we sent a man who had not been active in the field, Harold Stassen, we sent him to a meeting without formulating an American position. Mr. Stassen was never able to get clear instructions at the meeting as to what our position was. We came close and in part failed because the American position was never finalized. And at the end of the Conference, when success might have been possible, Mr. Stassen was disposed and sent back to Pennsylvania. At the next important disarmament conference, the Geneva Conference of 1958, we were represented by a businessman who had been out of the Government for 5 years and returned to his duties only 5 weeks before the Conference. Almost up to the opening day of the meeting we had no research, no position, no committees working on the subject. The Conference was a failure and our chief negotiator said, and I quote him, ""I doubt that we have given up to this time the intense study to the kind of measures which will make the prevention of surprise attacks possible."" Our chief negotiator.', 'This administration is liable on the whole series of grounds, Latin America, Africa, Asia, outer space, and here in the field of disarmament, which involves the security and peace of every person in and out of the State of Wisconsin, the head of our mission should say, ""We have given it very little time and attention."" [Applause.]', 'This is the experience of which so much is heard. The last meeting, the most recent one, the 10 nation Conference at Geneva this March - in September this administration appointed a special committee headed by a lawyer from Massachusetts, Mr. Coolidge. He worked for 3 months. He prepared a report. The report was thrown aside, and this time a New York lawyer without any experience in the field of disarmament became head of our mission. We had no position and we adopted that of the British. Our negotiators had to leave Geneva during the Conference itself to come to Washington to find out what our position was, and again we failed to prepare for disarmament. Throughout the consistent history of indifference and failure the arms race has continued to mount. This is an issue which involves the lives of all of us, and I must say in this area as in so many others this Government has been under the control of those who have been uninterested, who have lacked intellectual curiosity, who have failed to realize that in these changing times we need the best talent we can get, constantly applied to all the new problems that disturb us. Disarmament is only one failure of the last 8 years. [Applause.]', 'Therefore, I suggest the following things. First, that we maintain our strength. ""We arm to parley,"" Mr. Winston Churchill said a decade ago. We cannot parley on the basis of equality with the Soviet unless we maintain a military position of equality with them, and that goes in the traditional weapons and in missiles and in outer space. One of the reasons why we have never been able to get an agreement on the disarmament of outer space is because we are second in outer space, and the Soviet Union will not give way their advantage. We arm to parley, and we must be strong if we are going to disarm and maintain our security. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, we must establish an arms control research institute, working full time under the direction of the President, and their function will be to conduct the research and make the studies on which our position will be based at future conferences which must be held in the sixties, on the important subject of disarmament and on the important subject of nuclear test control, a full time institute manned by men whose mission is peace just as we maintain the Pentagon, whose mission is war. We must also give the same attention, certainly as much, and if possible more attention, to the involved and important subject of peace. [Applause.]', ""The struggle for disarmament will not be easy, but I don't know any easy struggles in the 1960's. The struggle for freedom in Latin America, the struggle for freedom in Africa, the struggle for freedom in Asia, the maintenance of the security of Western Europe, the maintenance of our commitments to Berlin, the hope for freedom in Eastern Europe, the development of the American economy, the security for American agriculture - all these are difficult problems, but I do not take the view that they are impossible problems. [Applause.]"", 'This is not a contest merely between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is not a contest in a very real sense between our two parties alone. It is a contest between those who look to the future with concern, with hope, with anxiety, and with a desire to serve, and between those who stand still, between those who have missed opportunity after opportunity in the last 8 years to build our position around the world to demonstrate to the world that we are a vigorous, moving country, that holds out a hand of friendship to people who wish to be free. [Applause.]', ""I believe in the 1960's that this country must prepare itself for another great movement forward, that we must work to strengthen our country, not only because of our devotion to it, but also because it represents the great hope of freedom. In the next 10 years, people around the world, particularly in the globe to the south of us, will begin to make their choice between freedom, between the system that we represent, and that of the Communists. We want them to choose to associate with us. We want them to choose to follow the same road that we are following. But we can only do that if we identify ourselves with them, if we move in this country, if we follow the roads of a distinguished citizen of the Middle West, a great son of Wisconsin, speaking nearly a century ago, who said:"", '\n  Ideals are like stars. You will not succeed in touching them with your hands, but the seafaring man who follows the waters follows the stars, and if you choose them as your guides, you can reach your destiny.\n', 'Our stars and our ideal is the welfare of our country and the welfare of freedom. I ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us in serving this country, in building this country, in demonstrating what this country can be, in demonstrating what freedom can do, in showing the people who sit on the razor edge of decision that we represent the future, that the Communist system is as old as Egypt, and in our great free society there are inexhaustible veins of energy. We are the great source of the future and I believe under new leadership, the kind of leadership which this State has had in recent years, I believe this country can be given leadership, and I believe it can move again, and I ask your help. [Applause.]', 'In the American Constitutional Convention there was a painting of a sun, low on the horizon, behind the desk of General Washington, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun, and at the conclusion, Benjamin Franklin stood up. He said, ""We now know. It is a rising sun and the beginning of a great new day."" I believe in 1960, if we choose to move forward, it can be a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day. Thank you. [Applause.]', '(Excerpt from question-and-answer period:)', 'Question. I would like to ask, Senator Kennedy, what do you feel is the best way to handle Fidel Castro?', 'Senator KENNEDY. The question is what do I think is the best way to handle Mr. Castro.', 'I think the great opportunity was really denied in 1957, during the last days of the Batista administration. I was in Cuba in 1957 and the American Ambassador informed me that the American Ambassador was the second most influential man in Cuba. There is not any doubt we had great influence in Cuba, and I think it is unfortunate that we did not use that influence more vigorously to persuade Mr. Batista to hold free, open elections, so that the people of Cuba could have made the choice, rather than holding onto his power and finally driven out by Castro at the point of a gun. Mr. Castro is now a Communist. I think the struggle will be, really, to prevent the spread of Castroism throughout all of South America. Cuba really is an isolated island. The great problem that we face as citizens of this hemisphere is to prevent other countries from following that example. The President of Brazil, during the last campaign, felt that Castro was so strong in Brazil that it was necessary for him to go to Havana to call on Mr. Castro. There were riots in Mexico in support of Castro. The difficulties we have had in Panama - this administration has almost ignored Latin America, which was the basic element, support of Latin America, in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. I believe the next President should reestablish that atmosphere, and working with the other countries [applause] and work with the other countries of the Organization of American States to maintain the free spirit within Cuba, itself, and throughout Latin America.']"

They are part of the Wisconsin idea and I am proud to be here with them. [Applause.]', ""We are involved in the last 2 weeks of a hard-fought campaign. I must admit that there is some difficulty running against Mr. Nixon. I never know whether I am running against the Republican Mr. Nixon who goes to Arizona and who says that he stands as a Republican from top to bottom, or the Mr. Nixon who goes to Jacksonville, Fla., and says that party labels don't mean anything, what counts is the man, or the man who goes to New York it and strikes a blow for civil rights, or the man who goes to Virginia and informs them that he knows their problems as he went to school in the South once himself. But I know what the issue is. It is an old issue that has been fought in this country year after year, political generation after political generation, and that is between the happy and the content and the fat, and the concerned and those who look forward. I believe in 1960 the American people are going to move forward again. [Applause.]"", 'I think this is an important election. I believe that the next President of the United States and the next Congress are going to have to deal with three sets of problems, all of them different. One is the longest problem, which is most continuing, which is a problem and an opportunity which has been with us since our country was founded, and which was with us in 1960, and that is to make good on the commitments of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that they are entitled to fairness and justice and equal opportunity, and it is the responsibility of the people speaking through their National Government, speaking through their President, to accord them those rights. That is the first opportunity and the first responsibility of the President of the United States. [Applause.]', 'I said on the first debate that I was concerned as an American when two children are born in two houses next door to each other, one is white and the other is a Negro. That Negro baby has one-half, regardless of his talents, statistically has one-half as much chance of finishing high school as the white baby, one-third as much chance of finishing college, one-fourth as much chance of being a professional man or woman, four times as much chance of being out of work in his life, one-third as much chance of owning his own home, about one-fourth as much chance of putting his child through college.', 'I believe that there are, of course, people who are not equal in talent, people who are not equal in motivation. But if there are going to be inequalities, it should be on the grounds of their ability and dedication, not on the grounds of their color. That is what we wish to wipe out. [Applause.]', ""The second set of problems that the President will face are the traditional ones. They stem from the administration of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. They are the efforts which Democratic Presidents and Democratic Congresses have made to write into law a whole platform of social legislation, which permits all Americans to participate in our standard of living, minimum wage, social security, unemployment compensation, housing, aid to education, medical care for the aged, all of the great litany of pieces of social legislation for which we are distinguished which make it easy for a Democratic candidate to run for the Presidency, and which Mr. Nixon's party has opposed. It is our function, however, not to merely invoke the names of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, not to merely live off what they did, but to bring these old programs up to date. Franklin Roosevelt proposed a 25-cent minimum wage, back in the middle thirties; 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it. We proposed this summer a minimum wage of $1.25 and 90 percent of the Members of the House of Representatives voted against it. These are the traditional issues, old but still new, and I believe that the next President and the next Congress must meet their responsibilities in this field."", 'We are talking, however, about two sets of problems which are familiar, with which we dealt in the past, the solution of which is easy, to get a President and a Congress that believe in progress. But there are a third set of problems which are entirely new, and it is this third set of problems that will most disturb the sleep of the next President of the United States and the next House and the next Senate. And it is to their solution that we must begin to address ourselves in this campaign, because unless the next President of the United States is prepared for action when he gets elected, then he will lose January, February, March, April, and May of 1961, which should be his best and most vigorous months.', ""Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt made their greatest contribution to the advancement of this country in their first 2 years, and we as Democrats, those of us who are committed to progress, should now be considering the solutions of the new problems that will face the United States in the 1960's."", 'One, how is it possible for a free society, operating with a free enterprise economy - how is it possible for that free society to double its rate of economic growth? We have talked a good deal about economic growth. Mr. Nixon has dismissed it as growthmanship. But it goes to the heart and survival of our free society. We are going to have to find 25,000 jobs a week every week for the next 10 years if we are going to maintain full employment in the United States. Our average rate of economic growth in the last 8 years was about 2½ percent; that of Western Germany 5 to 6 percent, that of Italy, 4 to 4.5 percent, that of France, nearly 5 percent. In the last 8 years overall, the United States has had the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world. We have an economic growth of about one-third that of the Soviet Union, less than Japan. How is it going to be possible for this country to maintain full employment with a low rate of economic growth, especially at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men. I would consider that to be the No. 1 domestic problem which the next President of the United States will have to meet. He will have to use monetary and fiscal tools far more effectively, far more vigorously, than the present administration has been willing to do.', 'In the last 9 months of 1960, the United States had no economic growth. We lost minus 0.3. This goes to the question of whether the students at the University of Wisconsin will have jobs, whether we will be able to maintain full employment, whether we are going to drag along with 50 percent of our steel capacity unused, as we are today, with 100,000 steelworkers out of work, with our other industries beginning to go part-time because we cannot consume what we are producing.', ""This is a new problem, entirely different from the kind of problem that Franklin Roosevelt met in the 1930's. But on its solution goes the survival of our free economy and our free system. We need to use our facilities to the utmost. We need the revenues which come from full use of our economy, in order to meet our obligations at home and abroad. We need a strong economy, or gold will continue to flow out of the United States. We need a strong economy if we are going to meet our obligations to the underdeveloped world, to maintain our defenses, to meet our needs in education and health and housing. I consider this to be, tied to the problem of agriculture, which is entirely different, to be the No. 1 domestic problem. the next President will face."", 'Secondly, how is it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union and France and Britain to come to a conclusion to cease nuclear testing with some worthwhile inspection system? How is it possible for us, who initiated the first atomic advance - how is it possible for us to make a decisive breakthrough in this area? Because of experiments now going on in Western Germany, it appears likely that almost 20 countries will have an atomic capacity by 1965. China, Egypt, Cuba - all the rest of them, all possessing atomic weapons, all possessing a hydrogen capacity perhaps all possessing ballistic missiles, and the means of delivering them.', 'When we realize that war has been the constant companion of mankind through the ages, we are about to move into a period of history when any country or combination of countries can destroy themselves, their adversaries, and perhaps the human race, all in the next 10 years. And this administration has failed to recognize the decisive nature of what science is doing to our hopes for the future. This administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire national administration on the subject of disarmament. We have gone into every conference unprepared. This administration, a year ago, in order to get a position on disarmament, appointed a lawyer from my own State of Massachusetts, Mr. Coolidge, who had had no previous experience in the field. After 3 months, his report was dismissed and so was he, and a New York lawyer, after 5 weeks of preparation, was sent to head up our mission to the Disarmament Conference. One hundred people working on one of the most important, involved, specialized fields the subject of disarmament, nuclear control. I believe we can do better, and I believe we must do better. [Applause.]', 'The third new question and the last one I wish to mention goes to the problem of the globe to the south of us. Here in these countries where the average income may be $100 a year, it may be $25 a year, as it is in Libya, in these countries, with the tremendous increasing population, with inadequate resources, in many cases - can these countries make an economic breakthrough under a system of freedom? Or is it necessary for them to follow the example of the Communists, the Chinese, and the Russians? They see Russia, which 40 years ago was the most backward country in Europe, now moving steadily up on the United States. They see China. Ten years ago China and India started from the same economic base, with the same economic problems, and yet China, by methods repugnant to us has be an to move its industrial growth forward at a faster rate than that of India through freedom.', 'What role can we play? What role can Western Europe play? Does the plan that this administration puts forward really offer hope to Latin America and Africa and Asia? What decision will they make in the next 5 or 10 years as to how they shall mobilize their resources?', ""This administration has remained almost indifferent to the great challenging problem of the 1950's. Not one Spanish program to all of Latin America; the Soviet Union has 10 times the broadcasts we do to Latin America, the foreign service. We are the 14th country in radio broadcasts to Africa. Even Indonesia has more than we do. There were more students from those countries 10 years ago in the United States than there are today. Guinea asked for 500 teachers last year. We gave them one."", 'We offered 300 scholarships to the Congo last June, more than we offered to all of Africa the year before. We had more people stationed in Western Germany in 1957 than in all of Africa. Out of a foreign service of 6,000 men and women, 26 are Negroes. I think we can do better, and I believe we are going to have to do better, or otherwise the United States is going to cease to lead.', ""Mr. Nixon pointed to the United Nations as evidence of our great program. The next day the question came on the admission of Red China. How many African nations voted with us? Not one of the newly admitted nations of Africa voted with us. The only two countries in Africa to vote with us were Liberia and the Union of South Africa. I believe that this administration by its failure to recognize the great questions which disturb our life has demonstrated its unfitness to lead us in the 1960's. I believe that before you can have the answers you must have the questions, and I don't think this administration has recognized the changing and revolutionary nature of the world in which we live; its solutions have been archaic, its proposals have been outdated. It has failed to recognize the change in circumstance in Africa or Latin America or Asia. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. Nixon, speaking in September, said if we had proposed a program of economic aid to Latin America in 1955 Castro might never have happened. Why didn\'t we do so? The only statement that was made in 1955 was made by Mr. Nixon in Havana when he praised, and I quote him accurately, ""The competence and stability of the Batista dictatorship.""', ""These are the questions that you have to determine. Does this record give you confidence for the future? Are the kinds of men that have been appointed to ambassadorships, men who cannot even pronounce, not only the language, but can't even pronounce the name of the head of state, men who have been given ambassadorships as a reward for party contributions, who are sent to sensitive areas, students who have never been given a chance to study, sudden emergency programs put forward of 300 offers to the Congo? Do you know how many Congo students got to the United States? Seven. How many college graduates in the Congo? Twelve. Did we ever show any interest in their problems? Do you know the next part of Africa that will be free? The Portuguese colonies. Do you know how many students are studying in the United States from the Portuguese? None. They are going to become suddenly independent and we will offer them scholarships, as if you can turn out a man or woman as you do an automobile. It takes years. [Applause.]"", 'The spokesmen for this administration spoke for many years about how we lost China. I would like to hear them talk about how India is going to be maintained as a free society. If India should fail in the third 5-year plan, the balance of power in the world would shift against freedom. India has within its borders 35 percent of all the underdeveloped people of the world. They are a free country, with sound economic planning, a chance to succeed, and yet when has Mr. Nixon in this campaign ever talked about a program which would assist India, not only by the United States, but by others who might be interested, particularly in Western Europe, to hold out the hand at the crucial moment? What we need is not hindsight. We need foresight. [Applause.] And we need men and women who will look beyond the next crisis and make a judgment.', 'Six countries now in Africa, members of the United Nations, have not a single American diplomatic residence in any of them. It took us 8 months to recognize Guinea and send an ambassador there. The Soviet Union took 1 day. And Guinea now votes with the Soviet Union.', ""I do not suggest that any of these problems are easy. I do not suggest that we have complete answers to any of them. But what I do suggest is that at least we have some concern, some recognition, some idea of the changing nature of our times. The whole problem in Cuba is not a dialogue about Mr. Castro. The whole problem in Cuba is what is going to happen in the rest of Latin America, whose side is going to be successful in those areas, which system offers the hope to these people. Bolivia, where the average annual income is about $100 a person - are they going to be more impressed by Castro and what he says, or are they going to be impressed by us? Franklin Roosevelt impressed them not so much because he poured out American money, but because he was a moving, compassionate figure, moving his own society at home, identifying himself with people around the world who also wish to live in the sun. I believe it is our function and our opportunity and our responsibility in the 1960's to identify ourselves with the cause of freedom, not only with the cause of freedom, but with a better life for these people. [Applause.] Franklin Roosevelt put it in 1936 in accepting his second presidential nomination before 100,000 people, and in that speech he said:"", '\n  Governments can err, Presidents can make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', ""I believe that 4 years of Mr. Nixon would be a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference, and I don't think the world can afford it. [Applause.] Other men who have led that party have tried to remake it and they all failed. Theodore Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Robert LaFollette, George Norris, and even Nelson Rockefeller before he began to graze contentedly in Mr. Nixon's pasture tried to remake the Republican Party. They all failed. Mr. Nixon basks in the sun. He sends Senator Goldwater to campaign in the South in an old Confederate uniform telling them he does not mean anything he says on civil rights, while Senator Scott of Pennsylvania travels through the North and assures he is with them all the way. What kind of a party is that? What kind of leadership is that? [Applause.]"", ""The Chicago Sun-Times this morning carries an interview with Mr. Nixon's ex-adviser, Murray Chotiner, who advises Mr. Nixon to become the old Mr. Nixon, start hitting again in this campaign. What kind of a country will we have with a candidate who cannot make up his mind whether he is going to be old or new? [Applause.]"", 'I do not run as a candidate who says that party labels are unimportant. The significance of the party is its philosophy and the kind of candidates it puts up for office. I do not have to run with leap-year progressivism, which says every 4 years, ""We are for progress"" and votes against it in the Congress day in and day out. I run as a Democrat. I run as a believer in progress. [Applause.] I stand in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and in my judgment, in 1960, the people of this country are going to say ""Yes"" to the 1960\'s and they are going to start this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Theodore Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Robert LaFollette, George Norris, and even Nelson Rockefeller before he began to graze contentedly in Mr. Nixon's pasture tried to remake the Republican Party. They all failed. Mr. Nixon basks in the sun. He sends Senator Goldwater to campaign in the South in an old Confederate uniform telling them he does not mean anything he says on civil rights, while Senator Scott of Pennsylvania travels through the North and assures he is with them all the way. What kind of a party is that? What kind of leadership is that? [Applause.]"", ""The Chicago Sun-Times this morning carries an interview with Mr. Nixon's ex-adviser, Murray Chotiner, who advises Mr. Nixon to become the old Mr. Nixon, start hitting again in this campaign. What kind of a country will we have with a candidate who cannot make up his mind whether he is going to be old or new? [Applause.]"", 'I do not run as a candidate who says that party labels are unimportant. The significance of the party is its philosophy and the kind of candidates it puts up for office. I do not have to run with leap-year progressivism, which says every 4 years, ""We are for progress"" and votes against it in the Congress day in and day out. I run as a Democrat. I run as a believer in progress. [Applause.] I stand in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, and in my judgment, in 1960, the people of this country are going to say ""Yes"" to the 1960\'s and they are going to start this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
332,John F. Kennedy ,"October 23, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Attorney General Reynolds, Gov. Gaylord Nelson, Lt. Gov. Philleo Nash, your next Congressman, Milo Singler, ladies and gentlemen, I was warned to be out here in plenty of time to permit those who are going to the Green Bay Packers game to leave. I don't mind running against Mr. Nixon, but I have good enough sense not to run against the Green Bay Packers. [Applause and laughter.] I will assure you we are not going to hold you up that long."", 'I come here this morning, back to Green Bay, as the candidate for the office of the Presidency. I came here last winter as a candidate for the nomination, and the support that we received here in Wisconsin, the support we received in the 8th and 6th Congressional Districts, the support we received in an endorsement of our candidacy in this State, led directly to our nomination in July. And now I come back here on this occasion as the standard bearer for the oldest political party in history, but a political party which is young and vital and forward looking, and ask your support again. [Applause.]', 'I want to emphasize that this is not a contest merely between Mr. Nixon and myself. We run both for the Presidency, but in a very larger sense it is a contest between two parties and in a larger sense than that, it is a contest between two political philosophies, between the comfortable and the contented, and the concerned, between those who look to the future and those who stand still, between those who are willing to break new ground and those who say ""We\'ve never had it so good."" And in that contest, your distinguished Governor, is playing a part in moving Wisconsin forward. our lieutenant governor, Philleo Nash, your attorney general, and the man who I hope you will elect to be the next Congressman from this district. We have a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House. I hope we can have a Democratic President. [Applause.]', 'The basic problem which disturbs us all, not merely as Democrats or Republicans, but as citizens of the United States, is how, over a long period of time, it is possible for a free society in which we follow our own interests, in which we have freedom of choice, and a wide range of alternatives, how that free society can successfully compete with a totalitarian society. In order that we may compete, we need strong leadership at the top and in my judgment only the President of the United States can provide that leadership, and we also need a House and a Senate working with him. We have to, in our free society and in our free way, provide the vigor and the drive to not only match the Communist drive, but also outdo it. And I am confident that we can do that, but in order to do it we have to have a President of the United States and an administration and a Congress which is willing to set before the American people the unfinished business of our society.', ""My disagreement with Mr. Nixon and with the Republican Party has been throughout its history, in fact since the end of Theodore Roosevelt's administration. That party has been identified with the status quo, with a refusal to change, with a refusal to recognize that change is essential, with a refusal to recognize that our times are revolutionary and that progress should be our most important product, our most important commodity. That has been the difference between the Democratic candidates and the Republican candidates all through this century. It is the Republican Party which ran McKinley and Harding and Coolidge and Landon and Dewey. It has been the Democratic Party that ran Wilson, Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.]"", 'The Democrats have run on slogans of the New Freedom, the New Deal, the Fair Deal. It has been the Republican\'s slogans that have been ""Stand Pat with McKinley,"" ""Keep Cool with Coolidge,"" ""Return to Normalcy with Harding,"" and all the rest. And I believe that these slogans characterize a very different outlook on life, on the function of leadership and the responsibility of our National Government.', 'I want to make it clear that I come to this section of Wisconsin to ask your support in this campaign with the full realization that the responsibility and burdens of the Presidency will be greater than they have ever been in the past. The whole spread of atomic weapons, the whole subject of disarmament, the whole crisis over Berlin which will hit this country and Western Germany hard next winter and next spring, the problems in the Far East, the maintenance of freedom in Latin America and Africa and Asia, the maintenance of full employment here in this section of Wisconsin, which depends on the paper industry, the maintenance of full employment in Pennsylvania which depends on an outgoing steel industry, the maintenance of full employment in West Virginia and Kentucky, which depend on coal - all these burdens will fall upon the desk of the next President of the United States.', 'The tremendous revolution in agriculture, which has provided a great increase in the production of food and a sharp decrease in farm income - all these will come to rest upon the desk of the next President of the United States. I think in many ways his burdens will be more difficult, his responsibilities more sharp, his alternatives more immediate than any President since the time of Lincoln. But my judgment is that in this great country of ours there are no burdens and no responsibilities that cannot be met by a strong country with strong national purposes, and it is on that basis that I come here. [Applause.]', 'As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard, as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a $1 minimum wage, as long as there are older people over the age of 65 who live on an average social-security check of less than $78 a month, as long as there are people around the world who wish to be free but are not free, as long as there are people around the world who are fighting to maintain their independence, as long as there are people who look to us for leadership, I believe we can serve. I believe the Democratic Party has a responsibility.', 'I come to this community of Green Bay which in its own community life has shown vitality and drive - I come here and ask you to join me in instilling again those qualities in the United States of vigor, of motion, of leadership, of direction, of purpose. [Applause.] This campaign has about 2 weeks to go. In those 2 weeks the people of this State and you and the people of the United States have to make a final decision as to which candidate and which party you will entrust the high office of the Presidency, the Senate, the House, the Governorship. I want to make it very clear what I consider the difference to be.', 'Mr. Nixon in these dangerous and difficult times has chosen to run on platforms and slogans which emphasize our present security, which emphasize that we have never had it so good, which state that our prestige has never been higher and that of the Communist system never lower, that all things that must be done are being done in their own good time and in good measure, and what we must do is continue in the future what we have done in the past. I want to make it very dear that I could not disagree more with this approach to the great public questions, not only of surviving, enduring, and prevailing, but also which go to the life of freedom around the globe. I do not run on the slogan ""we have never had it so good."" I run on the slogan that we are going to have to do much better. [Applause.]', ""I run with the idea not of downgrading our country, because my confidence in this country is unlimited - after 14 years of serving it in the Congress and after traveling all over it in the last 2 years. My confidence in this country is unlimited. But my confidence in the Republican Party's leadership is very limited. [Applause.] I do not believe that a political party which in the last 25 years has opposed housing and, minimum wage and social security and every great domestic program which has been identified with progress in this country, which has refused to recognize our changing times around the world, which liquidated the credit which Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman built up in Latin America, which has shown itself wholly uninformed of the present revolution now taking place in Africa, which has failed to maintain our military strength, which has given almost no attention to the important subject of disarmament, having less than 100 people working on it in the entire Federal Government, which has permitted us to be second, best in outer space, which has brought less foreign students to study here today than 10 years ago, which has, in other words, presided over the United States in a changing time and refused to change - I believe on November 8 the people of this country are going to take progress for the future, are going to give the leadership of this country once more to the Democrats. [Applause.]"", 'So let me say in conclusion that I hope that Green Bay wins today, I hope we win November 8, I hope the country will win in January. I hope if we are successful that your support will permit us in this State, in the Congress, in the Nation, to give this country the kind of leadership which will make it move again. I hope that if we are unsuccessful in this campaign, that the campaign, itself, the issue of this election, we will give the next President of the United States, whoever he may be, a sense of purpose, a sense of his obligation to place before the American people our unfinished business.', 'Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that generation of Americans had a rendezvous with destiny, and so do we. In my judgment, our destiny is the maintenance of a vigorous society here which serves as an example and inspiration to people around the world who wish also to be free. That is our responsibility. It is a responsibility that I am confident that we can meet.', 'I ask you to join me in meeting it.', 'Two thousand years ago, after the Battle of Thermopylae when 300 Spartans were wiped out by all the hordes of the Persians, carved in the rock above their graves were the words ""Passerby, tell Sparta we fell faithful to her service."" Now we ask you and ask all people to live faithful to the cause of freedom, faithful to the cause of those who wish to he free. Thomas Paine said in the American Revolution ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" Now, in 1960, in this revolutionary period, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America, and I am confident we are going to meet our responsibilities. I am confident we are going to be given the opportunity to give this country leadership, and I am confident that this country is going to move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
333,John F. Kennedy ,"October 23, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Norm Clapp, Gov. Gaylord Nelson, Lt. Gov. Philleo Nash, distinguished Attorney General John Reynolds, your distinguished Senator and my friend and colleague, Bill Proxmire, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be in this district again. I can make one boast that no other presidential candidate in history can make. I have spent more time in the Third District than any candidate for the Presidency since George Washington. [Applause.] I chased Hubert Humphrey all over this district and never caught him. [Laughter.] I am also delighted to be here in Wisconsin and in this district because I am associated with the kind of Democrats who I believe mean a good deal, not only to Wisconsin, but to the United States. I refer particularly to your candidate for the Congress Norm Clapp. [Applause.] I came out here in 1958. We had a rally, I think, at this same airport. He didn't win. This time we are holding a rally in the daytime. The last time it was about midnight. We are holding a rally in the daytime because he is the kind of candidate who I believe can serve this district and serve the country. I am hopeful he will be elected to the House of Representatives and speak for the Third District and speak for the United States. I endorse him and urge his support with all my heart. He is the kind of man we need. [Applause.]"", 'I am confident that Wisconsin will elect as Governor the man who has led this State in recent years, your distinguished Governor, Gaylord Nelson, and the men who are joined together with him in his administration. We are moving in changing times, and no candidate for the Presidency or for Governor or for Congress can possibly discuss in this campaign all of the issues which will disturb our life in the coming months and the coming years. In the final analysis it depends on the good judgment, the sense of vigor the sense of responsibility, the sense of the past, the sense of the future of the candidate. And, therefore, Wisconsin has shown particular skill in recent years in selecting men who can meet the new problems of the future.', 'I recognize that the problems which will face us in 1960, and in the immediate years that follow are in many ways more difficult and more complicated than any in our history. How are we going to maintain full employment in this country? How are we going to make sure that all of the men and women who need to work can find jobs at good pay? How are we going to maintain agricultural income in this country when our productivity is increasing at 6 percent a year, and our demand at 3 percent a year? How are we going to be first in outer space and first in the minds and the hearts of people all around the globe? These are the problems that disturb us. These are the problems that go to our survival, and it is upon this generation of Americans that our survival as a country will rest, and also our survival as the great defenders of freedom all around the globe.', ""I come to this district, which is particularly dependent upon agriculture, but I recognize that this district and districts like it also affect the general economy. It is no accident that the depression of 1929 followed a consistent farm drop in income all during the 1920's, and I don't think it is any accident that we had a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, and now the beginning of what may be a recession in 1960, all tied to a sharp decrease in farm income in the last 8 years."", 'The reason is simple: It is the interdependence of the American economy. The farmers of this country are the best market for Detroit, and the automobile industry. The automobile industry is the best market for steel in Pittsburgh. And when farm income goes down, so does Detroit, and so does Pittsburgh, and so does La Crosse. Seven out of eight of the International Harvester Machines Co. plants in Illinois, right across your State border, have been shut down this fall for varying periods, throwing nearly 12,000 men out of work because farm income has dropped.', ""And what happens to the small businessmen in those communities and what happens finally to Chicago? This country of ours is tied together, it is tied together by geography, it is tied together by tradition, but it is also tied together by the dependence of each citizen one upon another, and this administration's policy which has defeated the farmer also, in my opinion, has had an effect upon the city."", ""Mr. Nixon went to New Jersey the other day and in one of those speeches for which he has become famous, he said that the proposals that I put forward for increasing farm income would increase food prices 25 percent. Then he comes out here to La Crosse and says that my farm plan would not mean a thing for the farmer. He should make up his mind. He should say the same thing in La Crosse as he does in New Jersey. [Applause.] The fact is he should say the same thing in the North that he says in the South, the same thing that he says in the East that he says in the West. The fact of the matter is that in a loaf of bread the farmer gets about 2 cents out of a 25- or 26-cent loaf of bread. It costs more to launder this shirt in a hotel than a farmer gets for the cotton in the shirt. If that farmer's income went up 10 or 15 percent, it could increase the price of that food 1 cent or a half a cent, because it goes to the percentage that the farmer gets in that loaf of bread."", ""Mr. Nixon's attempt to turn the country against the city, to send a Secretary of Agriculture to campaign in the city rather than on the farms, to continue as he has proposed to do, the very same agricultural program which has reduced farm income 25 percent, which has made the average wage for a dairy farmer in the State of Wisconsin, according to the University of Wisconsin, about 55 cents an hour, that he would propose in 1960 a continuation of the very same program, seems to me to give the farmers a very clear choice. Mr. Nixon's program has been expressed in two lines:"", 'One, we will use the surplus to use up the surplus, whatever that may mean. Mr. Benson in 1956 said those very same words. Mr. Nixon is using the exact same phrases as well as the exact same program that Mr. Benson put forward. Then he said the support price for farm income, the long-term price-support system, with levels based on an average of market prices under the immediately preceding crop year.', ""Those words were spoken first by Mr. Benson several years ago. They are an exact quote from Mr. Nixon's speech given in South Dakota in which he described his farm program, and what did they mean? They mean that the support price for farm income will be tied to 90 percent of the market price for the immediate year or the immediate 3 preceding years. Therefore, if corn was selling for $1.50 in 1952, and is now 95 cents or 90 cents, the next year the support price will be 90 percent of that 90 cents, and then if the market price the next year is 85 cents, then the support price will be 90 percent of that 85 cents. Step by step, year by year, the farmers' income will drop, because it is not tied to parity, it is not tied to the cost of the things for which he must put out, all his purchases, it is only tied to what he got in the market the preceding year."", ""The farmers of Wisconsin and Minnesota have a very clear choice. Mr. Nixon does not offer a new program. He continues the old one, and the farmers of this State and Minnesota must decide do they want that program, is that what they want, is that what we have been hearing for 8 years. We have not been. The farmers know that Mr. Benson's program has brought them close to ruin, and Mr. Nixon proposes to continue it. I must say that given this very clear choice, given the experience of the last 8 years, it seems to me that the farmers of this State and Minnesota should determine to support our efforts to raise farm income, efforts which have been identified with the names of Gaylord Nelson and Bill Proxmire in the Senate, and Hubert Humphrey in Minnesota, which I have committed myself to as a presidential candidate in the Democratic platform, in my speech in South Dakota in which we associated the support and farm income with the whole concept of parity, the kind of income which a farmer would get if he did the same amount of work, with the same managerial skill, in a related industry. I believe that these are two very clear choices, and what the farmer decides affects all of you who do not live on the farm. Every smalltown merchant in any one of the towns of this district knows that you are affected by the income of the farmers surrounding you. The State of Wisconsin rises or falls, depending on farm income, and so does Minnesota."", 'I could understand in 1952, after President Eisenhower made a speech in which he endorsed the concept of parity price at 100 percent, that the farmers of this State and Minnesota could say, ""That sounds good."" Now we have had 8 years. Now Mr. Nixon trots out the same old program. He has given it new names, Operation Consume and Operation Safeguard. But the words are the same, the melody is the same. Only the lighting and the makeup are different. [Laughter and applause.]', ""Let me just say why I believe we can do a better job. One example of this administration's failure to take action: In 1954 millions of children in Africa, Asia, and South America were suffering from a common deficiency disease called kwashiorkor, caused by a lack of protein in the diet. It stunts the victims' minds and bodies. The U.N. World Health Organization reported that fully one-half of these hospitalized children died. Yet the management and prevention of this disease were simple: A modest daily ration of nonfat dry milk. At that time the United States possessed an enormous quantity of this nonfat dry milk. The United States could have saved children's lives. It could have put this milk to work. It could have contributed a helping hand to people around the world who needed it. Do you know what we did with this milk? We negotiated to sell our entire stockpile of nonfat dry milk to animal feed manufacturers without competitive bidding at a price of 3.5 cents per pound, about one-fifth of the market price. It sold the milk for hog feed with the stipulation it could not be used for human consumption. In this fashion, it sold an unbelievable total of nearly 600 million pounds of milk, an amount nearly equal to the production of the State of Wisconsin for 1 year, and an amount sufficient to provide a glass of milk every day for a full year to 33 million children. Mr. Benson was asked why the administration had virtually given the dry milk stockpile away to the animal feed manufacturers, and why he had not used our abundance to help fight one of the greatest diseases across the world. He replied there were too many difficulties involved."", ""Now we are going to live with difficulty in the 1960's. Anyone who is a citizen of this country, who reads the paper, knows that events and history and the world and geography are changing every day. No candidate for the Presidency can map out with certainly any program and be sure that conditions will be the same 4 or 5 years from now - the truth squad may be pulling out [laughter] they can't stand it. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'All we can guarantee, all we can guarantee is that we are going to get the best people who have been associated with policies that are progressive in the past, the best talent, those with the greatest amount of intellectual curiosity, foresight, knowledge of the world, knowledge of our times, and with a sense of compassion, and we are going to put them to work, and we are going to identify this country with the great cause of freedom around the world. That is the commitment we make. Not a life of ease, not of a solution of all the problems that disturb us. Action, motion, movement, identification. And I come to this district which I know well, and ask your support in this campaign. I ask you to join us in giving Wisconsin leadership. I ask you to join us in getting America moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
334,John F. Kennedy ,"October 23, 1960","['* * * In the years preceding World War II, Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed the historic four freedoms as the goals of American policy and American society. Tonight, I want to talk to you about one of those freedoms - freedom from fear.', 'In a message to Congress on January 7, 1941, President Roosevelt translated freedom from fear to mean ""a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world."" In short, freedom from fear was freedom from war - the pursuit of that freedom was the pursuit of peace - the method of achieving that freedom was the method of disarmament.', ""Today, 20 years later, we are still far from Franklin Roosevelt's goal. War still threatens - this time with weapons of destructive power far beyond the imagination of 1941. The pursuit of peace is still the focus of our leadership, our energies, and our determination. And disarmament is still the most vital step on the road to a lasting peace."", ""The great question of the 1960's - the overriding concern of all Americans and all men - is whether, in the coming decade, the world will move toward a secure peace and the survival of mankind or whether we will move toward war and common destruction. And how the American people choose in this campaign may well determine our direction in the years to come."", 'Of course Mr. Nixon and I both want peace. We both want to put an end to the arms race and the prospects of nuclear holocaust. But we do disagree - and we disagree fundamentally - on the nature of the effort and leadership which the pursuit of peace demands.', 'A few weeks ago, Mr. Nixon put forth his program for peace. The program consisted of setting up more committees and more conferences. It depended on meetings between heads of state and discussions among our own top officials. It was based on the premise that the battle for peace was a battle of words - that we could end the threat of war by talking it away. Thus it is a program which does not grapple with the real nature of the Communist threat to peace. For peace will not come solely through the conference room and the propaganda machine.', 'Rather the road to a world at peace runs through a revitalized and growing American economy, through the arduous construction of defenses so powerful that the Communists know that peace is their only alternative, through vast research projects to solve the complex difficulties of controlling modern arms, through carefully prepared disarmament programs to be presented by skilled and experienced negotiators, and through the exercise of a firm Presidential leadership which will never allow either our own representatives or the rest of the world to wonder what our position is, to wonder indeed, if we have any position at all, or to doubt the sincerity of our desire for disarmament.', 'Words alone will never impress Mr. Khrushchev. For he can talk louder and longer than either Mr. Nixon or myself. But he is impressed by strength and by action. And he will agree to disarm only when he is convinced that armed force can never bring a Communist victory.', ""If we are to secure peace in the 1960's, if we ever hope to negotiate an effective arms control agreement, we must act immediately."", 'For as each year passes, the control of increasingly complex, mobile, and hidden modern armaments becomes more difficult. And at the same time, as we increase our stockpiles of nuclear bombs, and as we develop pushbutton weapons systems, the danger of nuclear holocaust through accident or through a mistaken belief that war will bring victory, that danger increases.', 'In short, no problem is more vital or more urgent in the struggle for peace than the problem of effective arms control. Yet, in the past 80 years, this problem has been virtually ignored; we have had no real disarmament policy. And we have completely failed to provide the effort and the leadership which the pursuit of disarmament demands.', 'In the entire U.S. Government we have had fewer than 100 men working on the complex problems of arms control. And even this handful of workers has been scattered through four or five agencies with little coordination or leadership. A recent independent survey concluded:', '\n  The only continuous features of our efforts in the disarmament field have been a lack of continuity in top personnel and a paucity of planning and research efforts.\n', 'As a result of this failure we have been steadily unprepared on disarmament. Our delegates to international conferences have been inexperienced, understaffed, and inadequately instructed. And the Soviet Union has consistently had the initiative in the eyes of the world.', 'At a time when our relative military strength was much higher than it is today, from 1953-55, there was not a single top person in the entire Government working full time on disarmament. We did not come up with a single major new proposal for arms control. And we cared so little about arms control, that we regarded the entire effort as just another branch of psychological warfare, restricting ourselves to propaganda while Soviet armed strength increased.', 'At the London Conference of 1957 - the first important disarmament meeting, we were represented by a man with absolutely no experience in arms control, Harold Stassen, and we sent him to the meeting without having formulated any American position. It was not until August 29, 1957, more than 5 months after the conference opened, that America had any position at all. And by that time our chief negotiator had been repudiated by the administration, and publicly demoted from the White House staff.', 'At the next important disarmament conference, the 1958 Geneva Conference on surprise attack, we were represented by a businessman who had been out of Government for 5 years, and who had assumed his duties only 5 weeks before the conference met. Almost up to the opening day of the meeting, we had prepared no position, conducted no special research, formulated no realistic or constructive proposals. The conference was a failure. And our chief negotiator concluded that ""I doubt that we have up to this time really given intensive study to the kind of measures which will make this (prevention of surprise attack) possible.""', 'The last important meeting was the 10-nation conference at Geneva this March. In September the administration appointed a Boston lawyer, Charles Coolidge, to prepare an American position. Mr. Coolidge had barely finished his studies when he was replaced by another man - this time a New York lawyer without any experience in disarmament. We had no position ready when the conference started. Our negotiators had to leave Geneva for Washington during the conference itself to try to find out what our policy was. Again, we had failed to prepare for disarmament. We had developed no real policy or position.', 'Throughout this consistent history of indifference and failure the deadly arms race has continued, the danger of war has mounted, and the Soviet Union has scored propaganda victory after propaganda victory; taking the initiative with its proposals, falsely posing as the friend of peace, pointing to our lack of policy and interest in an effort to picture America as a nation unwilling to reach agreement on arms control.', 'Of course, it may not be possible to reach an agreement on arms control no matter how hard we work. Perhaps the Russians will be unwilling to give up military force as a method of achieving world domination. Perhaps they will not agree to the effective system of inspection and control which is vital to agreement. Perhaps the Communist Chinese will refuse to participate in arms control negotiation, even though their ultimate participation is essential to effective disarmament. Perhaps the science of inspection will be unable to keep pace with advancing weapons technology.', 'But no matter how difficult the problems are, how discouraging the obstacles, how uncertain the prospect for agreement, we must, nevertheless, begin a determined, large-scale effort to prepare ourselves for disarmament - to formulate constructive and realistic proposals which have a chance of success. For the hopes of all mankind rest on successful disarmament. And if we let the nations of Africa and Asia and Latin America feel that the United States is the real obstacle to disarmament, that we are not sincere in our desire for peace - if we continue to let the Soviet Union seize the offensive in disarmament negotiations - then these emerging areas of the world may well turn away from America and the free world, and begin to look to the Communist bloc for leadership in the fight for peace.', 'And, of course, we must also seek disarmament because the only alternative to pursuit of an effective disarmament agreement is the pursuit of our present course - the arms race, the gap, new weapons, the development of even higher orders of mutual terror resulting in the ever higher likelihood of mutual destruction.', ""But we will not move toward disarmament and a secure peace, we will not be any closer to freedom from fear, if we simply follow Mr. Nixon's plan for meetings, more conferences, more study groups and discussions. For peace takes more than words. It takes hard work and large-scale effort. It takes men and resources and firm leadership from the top. Above all, it takes a government which is organized for the pursuit of peace, as well as the possibility of war, a government which has a program for disarmament, as well as a program for arms."", 'First, we must work to rebuild our rapidly deteriorating defenses. Winston Churchill has pointed out that ""civilization will not last, freedom will not survive, peace will not be kept, unless * * * mankind unite together to defend them and show themselves possessed of a power before which barbaric * * * forces will stand in awe.""', ""It is only when we have a military force strong enough to convince the Russians that they'll never be able to gain any advantage through military strength, only when we can approach the conference table in a position of equality, only then can we hope for fruitful negotiation. Second, we must establish an arms control research institute, under the direction of the President, to undertake, coordinate, and follow through on the research, development, and policy planning needed for a workable disarmament program. Detection and monitoring systems will require new techniques of aerial reconnaissance and radar surveillance, new uses for our communications systems, computers, and cameras, new ways to denature plutonium and inspect power reactors, and a whole host of additional research projects."", 'The arms control research institute would coordinate and direct all these research efforts, carrying them on itself or farming them out to private firms and universities. The scattered disarmament technicians, scientists, and policymakers could at last work as a unit with a central purpose and direction given by the President himself.', 'Third - we must begin, perhaps within the framework of the arms control research institute, to plan for the reconversion of our economy from war to peace. Millions of jobs and billions of dollars are tied up in our present defense effort. We must plan for the orderly reallocation of these resources to our peacetime needs.', 'I do not share the opinion of some that disarmament would bring economic disaster. I believe that America can fruitfully use all our present productive power and much more to meet our vital needs for schools and roads and power and all the rest as well as our commitments to the war against poverty and Communist subversion abroad. But we must begin to plan now if we are not to waste these resources in severe economic dislocation.', 'Fourth, while we are working to dismantle the engines of destruction we must work out methods of protecting ourselves against the growing danger of accidental war, through sure methods of informing ourselves about suspicious events or accidental firings so that neither nation can make a mistake which will trigger nuclear destruction.', 'Fifth - And most important, the fight for disarmament must command the personal attention and concern of the President of the United States. Our defense and six disarmament experts are concentrated in many important agencies of Government - in the State Department, the Defense Department, the AEC and others. Only the President can overcome the frictions and differences between those agencies; only he can weld all the parts of the Executive into a singleness of purpose in the pursuit of peace, and only the President can make the hard decisions, decisions involving peace or war, destruction or survival, which peace programs as well as war programs will surely bring.', 'The struggle for disarmament will not be an easy one. For disarmament is an ideal just as peace itself is an ideal, but it was a great son of Wisconsin, Carl Schurz, who said:', '\n  Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But, like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny.\n', 'Carl Schurz came from Wisconsin to Faneuil Hall in Boston in 1859 to make this eloquent profession of faith.', ""Today, 100 years later, I come from my native city of Boston to Wisconsin, to tell you that Carl Schurz's teachings have not been forgotten. That I know, and all Americans realize, that peace and disarmament are remote and difficult goals. But we have chosen them as ideals to guide our actions. And we will follow those ideals until America and all mankind have reached their destiny of a free people living in a world at peace.""]"
335,John F. Kennedy ,"October 23, 1960","[""* * * The farm depression, coupled with the general sag in the economy, is America's No.1 economic problem in 1960."", ""In the last 7 years, farmers' income has gone down, farm prices have gone down, the number of farms and the number of farmers have gone down, and the only thing that won't go down is the explanations of Benson and Nixon. The only thing that has gone up is the cost of what the farmer buys."", 'Behind these economic facts of life lie human tragedies, inadequate medical care and opportunities for farm people, young people leaving the farm for higher wages in the city, older men who have earned the right to semiretirement but who are forced to stay in harness - or give up their way of life altogether - because their sons are driven to the city and because they can\'t afford hired hands. The father who owns a farm and has thousands of dollars invested in farm equipment ends the year with less return than his factory-employed son ""who\'s invested in one pair of working gloves.""', 'There is no need to overstate the case. These are not the 1930\'s, when farmers in this very county were being set out on the road. But there is also no need to exaggerate because the farm problem today is bad enough. One out of eight of our population lives on farms. One out of every eight Americans is not getting a fair deal from the national economy, not getting a fair share in the good things in American life. Nor is this all. The farm problem is important not only to the farmer, it is important to the entire Nation. A farm depression, if it is neglected, can bring on a nationwide depression. It has done so before. It was a Republican President, Calvin Coolidge, who said, ""Farmers made much money. I doubt if there is anything we can do about it."" Three Republican administrations in the 1920\'s ignored a serious farm depression - and dragged the entire Nation down into the great depression of the 1930\'s.', ""For 7 years the Republican administration has allowed the farm economy to slide deeper and deeper into the pit of depression. And now its effects are being felt in our cities in steel mills, auto factories, farm equipment plants. When farmers' income is down they can't buy new equipment, and men are thrown out of work in the plants. This fall in your neighboring State of Illinois, International Harvester is shutting down seven out of its eight plants for various periods of time, throwing 12,400 men out of work. Right here in La Crosse, Allis-Chalmers employed 1,100 people in 1942 but only a little more than a third as many today, a direct reflection of the hard times on the farm. And merchants and businessmen are hurt too - factory workers who can't find jobs can't buy new clothing for their children."", ""I say it's time we stopped the downward spiral where it began - on the farm."", 'If I am elected I will give the farm problem top priority in the opening weeks of my administration. And I know I will have the help in Congress of Senator William Proxmire and Senator Hubert Humphrey and the backing here in Wisconsin and Minnesota of your great Governors, Gaylord Nelson and Orville Freeman. We have a program and we have the men to put it into action.', ""First, we will appoint a new Secretary of Agriculture, one sympathetic to the farmers' problems. There is no magic in this but it will be a long step forward. Farmers do business with the Secretary of Agriculture, and they have learned long ago that you can't do business with Benson."", 'Second, we will bring down artificially high interest rates and reestablish inexpensive farm credit.', 'Third, in consultation with farmers and farm leaders, we will devise a crop-by-crop program to give the farmer full parity of income. There is nothing mysterious about this phrase. It simply means that we will assure the farmer a fair return, a fair net income, on his labor and his capital investment. We will accomplish this through supply management, by bringing supply into line with demand. Farmers will manage their own production, will limit their own marketing through such devices as marketing quotas, marketing orders and agreements, Government purchases, crop loans, and so on - an individual farmer-managed program tailored to each individual crop.', 'With the price of milk fat today at only 80 percent of parity, the labor earnings of dairy farmers are less than the national minimum wage. Governor Nelson has taken an active role in formulating a dairy program. It is compatible with the proposals I intend to make to the Congress, and if dairy farmers look with favor on them, I am convinced that an effective, forward-looking program can be developed.', ""Fourth, we will attack agricultural surpluses not by cramming them down the farmer's own throat, as Mr. Nixon proposes, but by using them to combat hunger at home and to promote peace abroad. The Communist challenge must be met not only with military might but in the Christian spirit of feeding the hungry. To call our food stocks surplus is wicked nonsense when half the world goes to bed hungry every night and millions of Americans are on an inadequate diet."", 'The idea of using food for peace was first put forward by Senator Humphrey. Today in an election campaign Mr. Nixon says he favors it. But the Republicans in Congress have fought every concrete Democratic bill to translate those words into action, just as they fought our proposals to expand the school lunch program. And Mr. Benson has used his official powers to stop the food for peace programs.', ""It so happened that in 1954, millions of children in Africa, Asia, and South America were suffering from a common deficiency disease called kwashiorkor. Caused by lack of protein in the diet, it stunts its victims' minds and bodies. The United Nations World Health Organization reported that fully one-half of the hospitalized cases in Africa ended in death. Yet the management and prevention of this disease is simple - a modest daily ration of nonfat dried milk. At that time the United States possessed an enormous stockpile of nonfat dried milk. The United States could have saved children's lives, and won friends, throughout the world by putting its abundance to work. Instead, this administration negotiated to sell our entire stockpile of nonfat dried milk to animal feed manufacturers without competitive bidding at a price of 3 1/2 cent per pound, about one-fifth of the market price. It sold the milk for hog feed, with the stipulation it could not be used for human consumption - at a time when children were starving to death. In this fashion, it sold an unbelievable total of nearly 600 million pounds of milk, an amount almost equal to an entire year's production of the State of Wisconsin, an amount sufficient to provide a glass of milk every day for a full year to 33 million children."", ""Mr. Benson was asked why the administration has virtually given our dried milk stockpile away to the animal feed manufacturers, and why he had not used our abundance to fight hunger among the world's children. He replied there were too many difficulties involved."", 'It was at this time that Mr. Nixon said, ""I predict that the verdict of history will be that Secretary Benson has been one of the best Secretaries of Agriculture in our history.""', ""I say the verdict of history will be that Mr. Benson has been a disaster. I say an administration that chooses the easy way out, rather than face up to the difficulties of world leadership is not good enough for America in the 1960's. And I say we cannot afford Mr. Nixon's sense of history."", 'At the beginning of this election year, Mr. Nixon turned his back on the man he had called the greatest Secretary of Agriculture in history. He announced he would propose his own farm program. He dressed it up in fancy slogans - ""Operation Safeguard,"" ""Operation Consume."" But when farmers looked closely at it they saw beneath the slogans the old familiar face of Benson. The new program is nothing more than the old Benson program expanded, a program of imaginary price supports and oratory about the free market, a program that will force the farmer to eat his own surplus, which is about the same as forcing the farm equipment worker to buy a tractor to clean out the dealer\'s showroom.', 'Experts in Mr. Benson\'s own Department of Agriculture made a careful year-long study of what the farmers of America can expect from this program. They concluded that after 4 more years the Nixon-Benson program would give the farmers 70-cent corn, 85-cent wheat, 20-cent cotton, $12 hogs, $15.75 cattle, and about $2.60 for manufacturing milk, barely 5 cents a quart. And other independent studies by agricultural economists show that the Nixon-Benson program would cut farmers\' income by a full 40 percent. Mr. Nixon would revive Mr. Benson\'s 1956 ""soil bank"" on a scale that will plow under 1 out of every 3 acres of farm cropland in the United States, at a cost of $3 billion to $4 billion a year. Mr. Nixon\'s entire program will cost the American taxpayer more than Mr. Benson\'s program. And Mr. Benson spent more money in less than 8 years than the combined expenditures of every previous Secretary of Agriculture since the Department was established 98 years ago.', ""It ill becomes Mr. Nixon to charge that my farm program would raise food prices to consumers greatly. Furthermore, his charge simply is not true. There will be no significant increase next year in consumer food prices under my farm program. It will not burden the food budget of consumers. In the long run it will help keep food more abundant and more reasonable in cost to consumers. Precise cost and price figures are impossible to calculate at this time because specific crop-by-crop programs have not yet been determined - and won't be - until a sympathetic Secretary of Agriculture, consulting with farmers, works them out. And when Mr. Nixon produces statistics on food prices at this time, he is simply doing his figuring with a political pencil."", ""He is doing worse than that. It was in the suburbs of New York that he told city people that my farm program would raise food prices to consumers greatly. But out here in the Midwest he proposed a program that would cost more than Benson's program. This is an old Nixon tactic, attempting to divide and conquer, setting farmers against the city consumer, their best customer. I say this is dangerous divisive political trickery. And I say it won't work. Because the people know that if we are to lead the world in its search for peace and freedom, we need a strong America, united and working together."", ""I preach the interdependence of all Americans, farmer, merchant, factory worker. You here in La Crosse know that hard times on the farm means men out of work at Allis-Chalmers. I have seen it across the Nation. The farmer is the automaker's best customer. The automaker is the steel industry's best customer. When the farmer can't buy cars, the autoworker loses his job, and steel mills go down to 50 percent of capacity, as they are today"", 'New England fishermen have a saying, ""The rising tide lifts all the boats."" It is time to raise the American tide. This country has stood still long enough. Russia is outproducing us in steel outflying us in the conquest of space, and outmaneuvering us in feeding the world\'s hungry. I say we need a fresh start. And the place to start the chain reaction of national prosperity and national greatness is on the farm.', 'We will work, we will legislate, we will move by Executive order, we will consult the people, we will experiment, we will innovate, we will try out bold new ideas, and above all we will act - in the fighting progressive spirit of Bob LaFollette and Franklin D. Roosevelt.']"

But I do come here today as the Democratic standardbearer and come and ask your support in moving this country forward. This administration has stood still and so has Richard Nixon for 14 years that I have been in the Congress with him. On all the great issues which disturb our country, minimum wage, social security, unemployment compensation, houses, roads, schools, hospitals, our parties have divided and we have divided, and the great questions for the 1960's are how is it going to be possible to move this country forward, build its economy, provide employment for its people. And there are 4½ million of them out of work today. Our steel mills work 50 percent of capacity and the Caterpillar lays off 4,000 in the fall of 1960. [Applause.]"", 'We can do better than that.', 'The Republicans have stood still on every great issue which affects our times and affects our country. I believe as in 1932, the United States is going to decide to move into the sixties, to provide work for our people, to strengthen our country, and set an example of what freedom can do around the world. I come here today and ask your support in this campaign in building this country of ours. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
337,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Otto Kerner, your next Governor of the State of Illinois, my friend and colleague in the Senate of the United States, your distinguished Senator who speaks for Illinois and the Nation, Senator Paul Douglas, Ed Nally, who I hope will be elected the Congressman from this district, ladies and gentlemen, I have been informed that this is a strong Republican center [response from the audience], but if this is the way we turn out in these strong Republican centers, what is happening to Mr. Nixon all over the United States? [Response from the audience; applause.]', 'This is an important campaign and these are important issues which face our country, and I appreciate your coming here. Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students - I guess maybe you better get down there a little - [applause], Prince Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body of this university is here today, but I am confident I am talking to the rulers of America, in the sense that all educated men and women have the obligation to accept the discipline of self-government.', 'Mr. Nixon and I campaign for the most important office in the free world, but in my judgment this is more than a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is more than a contest between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. It is a contest between the contented and the concerned, between those who wish to stand still and those who wish to move ahead. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon runs on a slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good."" I run on the slogan we are going to have to do much better. [Applause.] A good deal of unfavorable, a good deal of comparison and most of it unfavorable, is drawn between the Lincoln-Douglas debates and Mr. Nixon\'s and my weekly brief appearances on ""What\'s Our Line"" every Friday night. [Laughter.] I am not sure, however, that we realize how different, how numerous, how sophisticated, are the problems which face us as Americans, compared to the single significant crucial problem that faced Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Douglas a century ago.', 'Now, the next President of the United States and the Senate and the House deal with monetary and fiscal problems that dwarf in significance those that they dealt with a century ago. We deal with the problem of outer space; the problem of how a free society can successfully maintain itself over a long period of time in competition with a totalitarian society which is able to mobilize all of its resources both human and material for the service of the state. I cannot possibly predict what the great issues will be, the new great issues in the next 4 or 5 years, any more than in 1940 - when Wendell Willkie and Franklin Roosevelt ran against each other - anyone could predict that in 1941 and 1942 Franklin Roosevelt would be asked by Albert Einstein and others to support a tremendous expenditure of money in order to break the atom. We cannot predict what new problems will come across our desks in the next 4 years. We could not have predicted in 1952 - when President Eisenhower and Mr. Stevenson debated - that one of the great issues would be our recognition of the significance of space. Where Franklin Roosevelt broke the atom, this administration failed to recognize the changing nature of our times and we now see the Soviet first on the moon, and what is true of outer space is true of every area of national and international government. [Applause.]', ""I will itemize that charge. One month ago Mr. Nixon said that if we had considered a program of aid to Latin America in 1955, we might not have had a Castro. And why didn't we? Why does the United States today spend one-tenth as much on information programs and radio programs to Latin America as the Soviet Union, one-tenth as much? We are the 14th country of the world in radio programs to Africa today. We brought more students from around the world 10 years ago to study here under Federal auspices than we do today. We had more students offered to the Congo in the month of June for scholarships as a result of the explosion there than we offered to all of Africa the year before. Do you know last year we had more students from Thailand studying here than from Africa, south of the desert, from all of those new countries? More students from one country in Asia than we did from all of Africa. Do you know how many students came from Africa last year, all those countries? 155. We had more people stationed in Western Germany in the Embassy in 1957 than in all of Africa. I make the point because Africa is new, revolutionary. It contains one-fourth of all the members of the General Assembly and this administration has not known that Africa has existed until the Congo blew up in our face."", 'Do you know the next countries that are going to try to be independent and will be? The Portuguese colonies. Do you know how many students are studying in the United States from the Portuguese to prepare for leadership? None. Guinea asked us for 500 teachers last year. Do you know how many teachers we sent them? One. Guinea got its independence from France 2 years ago. I took us 2 months to recognize that independence. It took us 8 months to send an Ambassador. The Ambassador from the Soviet Union arrived there the day Guinea was independent.', 'There are six countries in Africa which are members of the United Nations which do not have a single American diplomat in residence in them. We spent less than 5 percent of our development loan fund meant for underdeveloped countries last year in Africa. I could go on and itemize it and the result is that on the admission of Red China not one of the 16 new African countries voted with us. More countries in Asia voted against us than voted with us. We are second in outer space, but this administration has failed to recognize, has failed to recognize that in these changing times, with a revolution of rising expectation sweeping the globe, the United States has lost its image as a new, strong, vital, revolutionary society.', 'This administration will not release the poll which demonstrates that. What are we going to do, get them released next November or December? They show that our prestige has dropped around the world and prove that the Vice President is wrong when he says it is at an all time high. If Mr. Nixon believes that, if he believes that, he is misinformed. If he does not believe it, he should not run on it. [Applause.]', ""I run for the Presidency in the most series time in the life of our country and these issues involve the security of everybody here. In the next 10 years, this globe around us is going to move in the direction of freedom or going to move in the direction of slavery. The Communist system is militant, hopeful, confident, optimistic, and it has been able to identify itself all too successfully with the desire of these people in the underdeveloped world to live a better life. We have not done so. Cuba is only a phase of a great struggle which will take place in the next decade. We talk about Mr. Castro. The great issue is what is the rest of Latin America going to do, Mexico, Panama, Bolivia? Why should the President of Brazil in his campaign feel it necessary to make a trip not to Washington but to Havana in order to get Mr. Castro's blessing to be elected President of Brazil. Anyone who sits in this university and looks at the far reaches of the world, looks at the kind of competition which we are now undergoing, recognizes that every phase of our national and international life is being tested, our economic growth, the development of our resources, the science, the technology, and energy of our society. Ten years ago we produced twice as many scientists and engineers as the Russians, today one-half. In the last 9 months the United States had the lowest rate of economic growth almost in its history and the lowest rate of any industrialized society in the world. The question you have to decide is, Is this good enough? Has this administration demonstrated its awareness of the world around us? Has it brought men and women to Washington and sent them around the world, who recognize our changing times? Or have they sent ambassadors who could not speak the language or even pronounce the name of the head of the state to which they were accredited? [Response from the audience.]"", 'We have failed in the Department of Defense with personnel who have averaged less than 18 months in office in this most technical world. I do not think that what was good enough in the administrations of Harding and Coolidge and McKinley is good enough for today. We are being tested as we have never been tested before, and if we fail, we fail not only ourselves, but we fail the cause of freedom.', 'I come to this university, which is a center of knowledge, which is a center of truth, and you cannot possibly tell me in 1960 that the American people are going to choose to sit still and give power and responsibility to those who in the last 8 years have demonstrated an unawareness of the basic nature of our times. [Applause.]', 'The kind of society we build here, the kind of country we develop here, that is the test of our ability to lead around the world. What we are speaks far louder than what we say.', 'I come here today and ask you to join in rebuilding the strength and image of the United States as progressive society. I want the people of the world to wake up in the morning and wonder what the United States is doing, not what Mr. Khrushchev is doing. [Applause.]', 'One hundred years ago in the campaign of 1860, Lincoln wrote to a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God, and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming and His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming.

338,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","[""SENATOR KENNEDY. I want to thank Judge Kerner, who I am confident will make a distinguished Governor of the State of Illinois. [Applause.] My friend and colleague, Senator Paul Douglas, who has served Illinois and the country [applause] in war and peace, John Watson, who will he a distinguished Congressman from this congressional district and speak for it, and for the United States [applause]; our neighbor from across the river, Lieutenant Governor of Iowa and the next Governor, Nick McManus [applause]; ladies and gentlemen, we have come to Illinois, which Mr. Nixon keeps insisting he is going to carry, because we have a different view of it. [Response from the audience.] We have come to Illinois because here in the heartland of the United States this election may well be decided, and I believe Illinois and the United States are going to choose to move forward in 1960 and are going to support the Democratic Party on this great occasion. [Applause.] This is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. In a real sense, it is not merely a contest between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. It is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who say what we are now doing is good enough, and those who wish to move this country in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'I believe that here in this State of Illinois, and in the neighboring State of Iowa, all of the problems which the United States has are incarnated in this State, education, the decline in agriculture, unemployment, layoffs at farm implement machinery, civil rights, better housing, a stronger State, a growing State, a growing country, a stronger country, the cause of freedom around the world. They are all linked together. When farm implement workers in this community are laid off it is tied to a decline in agricultural income, which is tied to a decline in steel production, which is tied to a decline in national strength, which is tied to a lack of leadership in our country. [Applause.]', ""They are all tied together. There are no domestic issues and foreign issues. There are issues which are tied together, tied together to bring a stronger America, and if this country is strong then we are strong around the world. All of the speeches, all of the statements, all of the propaganda that we send around the world means nothing next to our own record. What we are speaks louder than what we say, and if we are moving here at home, if we find imaginative solutions for the problems that disturb us, if we are providing full employment for our people, if we are providing the best educational system in the world, if we are developing our natural resources, if we are holding out a hand of friendship to people who look to us for help, then we are not only secure but freedom, itself, is strong and growing. Mr. Khrushchev's power in the world rests on the economic productivity of the Communist system. The strength of freedom in the world and its vitality rests upon the economic productivity of the United States, and one of the great issues of this campaign, an issue which up to now Mr. Nixon has not discussed, is how this country is going to provide full employment for our people in the sixties, how we are going to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years; how we are going to find a rising income for our farmers; how we are going to build a stronger America. I believe the record of our party and the record of the candidates in this great question is on our side. We have committed ourselves as a political party for the last 25 years to progress. The Republican Party nor Mr. Nixon have made that their best known products. [Applause.]"", 'Now, as a voter in the United States, and your obligation comes on November 8 when you must make the decision yourselves, as to what kind of State and what kind of country you want, all of the things that we now argue about, all of the facts that the two sides bring out, I believe you, yourselves, can make the judgment upon, and it depends really on what kind of a country you want, what kind of a State you want, whether you believe that this country must pick itself up again, whether you believe that we are sliding, whether you believe we are doing enough. Your answer to that question determines which candidate and which party you will vote for.', 'Now, in making your judgment, I would listen to more than the campaign speeches of all the candidates. As Governor Smith used to say, I would look at the record. The Bible said it even more eloquently. ""By their fruits you shall know them.""', ""Mr. Nixon's record is written in 14 years in the Congress and so is mine. We have voted time and again on the great issues which now disturb us. And I believe it a matter of public importance that that record should be spread out alongside the speeches of this campaign. [Applause.]"", 'First on the question of agriculture, Mr. Nixon now puts the blame on Mr. Benson\'s lack, and I quote him, ""of ability and success."" But only a few years ago he called Mr. Benson one of the best Secretaries of Agriculture in our history. He proposes in his new farm program a substantial expansion of the conservation reserve, and yet as the Republican Senator from California, and as Vice President, he voted six times in 3 years to cut Democratic appropriations for soil conservation. He says now we should accelerate our efforts in underdeveloped nations to stimulate commercial markets for our farm people. But when in 1952 the Department of Agriculture sought funds for this very purpose, Mr. Nixon voted to cut it. By their fruits you shall know them. [Applause.]', 'Secondly is the Nixon gap. As an amateur student of American history I know very few candidates for office whose speeches and record are so far apart. [Applause.] A second important problem for the people of this country is how we can maintain the best educational system in the world. Democracy demands more of us than any other system of education, character, self-restraint, self-discipline. How are we going to get the best education in the world? One of the ways is to have the best-trained teachers. The Vice President defeated funds for higher teacher salaries only a few days after he made a speech in Chicago calling for higher teacher salaries. His campaign position on paper supports Federal grants to school districts, burdened by Federal employees or Federal installations. But as a Senator he voted to cut the heart out of the program. He calls now for matching grants to private colleges and universities so that every talented student can go to college. But when that fight was being waged a few years ago he termed such a program, an I quote him, ""undesirable."" He calls now for a program of loans and grants for college classrooms and dormitories. And we are going to have to build more dormitories and classrooms in the next 10 years in this country than we have in our history. In 10 years we are going to have to build as many classrooms and dormitories as we have built in 170 years in order to take care of the number of boys and girls who will be applying for our colleges in 1970. And yet when this very proposal to provide loans for this purpose passed the Congress, this administration vetoed the bill twice, and Mr. Nixon never said a word. [Applause.]', ""The third area of concern to us all is the Nation's health, and Mr. Nixon has an interesting experience in that regard. His new position paper calls for matching grants to expand medical schools, dental schools, and medical research facilities, and help for our medical students as well - a wonderful program. But as Republican Senator he voted against that very same program. He calls for increased appropriations for medical research, but he never lifted his finger when that program was slashed for the last 8 years. He insists now that our older citizens have medical care, but he called the bill which Senator Douglas and I fought for in the Senate in August, he called it extreme to provide medical care for the aged under social security, and it was voted against by 32 out of 33 Republicans. He now talks about improving social security coverage, but as a Congressman he voted against it every single time. [Applause.]"", 'This State of Illinois depends upon REA power and so does the United States to light our farms. Mr. Nixon now says we must produce the power we need at the lowest possible cost. But the record shows that as a Congressman and Senator, he voted four times against the appropriations for REA, four times against the TVA, and consistently against the power development and transmission lines in the Missouri Valley, the Grand Coulee, Bonneville, and the Bureau of Reclamation.', 'The housing - if there is any State in the Union that needs housing more, it is Illinois, unless it is my own State of Massachusetts. [Applause.] There are 15 million American homes, according to the last Bureau of the Census, which are substandard. Mr. Nixon has issued a paper on housing, and this, I think, is most revealing of all and one of the most endearing qualities of the Vice President. In his position paper issued in New York within the last 3 weeks, he says that the Housing Act of 1949 has worked very well, and do you know as a Congressman he voted against it? [Laughter and applause.] In that position paper he called for greater emphasis on middle-income housing and he voted against that in 1950. He calls for a greater flow of housing credit so that the American people can buy homes at low rates of interest. But he neglects to mention his vote as Vice President to increase the interest rates on the GI housing bans.', 'High interest rates never built a single home and one of the reasons why we are building 200,000 less homes each year than we should to keep up with our population increase is because of the high interest rate policy of this administration. [Applause.]', ""Seventh, and finally, is the gap between his promise and performance in the field of civil rights. We hear a good deal in the winter and the fall of 1960 about civil rights. Do you know in 1953 and 1954 the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, and do you know no civil rights bill ever came to the floor of either body? It was not until 1957 that we passed the bill on voting, and again this year. Mr. Nixon's own record - he sends Senator Goldwater to campaign in the South and says he does not mean any of the promises he makes, and sends Senator Scott of Pennsylvania, an erstwhile member of the truth squad, who flunks his test, to travel through the North and say he means it all.

It affects not only our own security - it affects the hope of freedom of all those who look to us for hope. This is an important election, involving a high office, involving the future of this great country, and I come here tonight and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us.

339,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Senator Douglas, Otto Kerner, the next Congressman from this district, Dick Estep, ladies and gentlemen, I come here this noon, to this community of Peoria, and ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.] I come here as the standard bearer for my party, as a member of a party which believes in progress, which believes it vitally important that this city and this State and this country begin again a great movement forward. If you live in Peoria or Illinois or in the United States, you know that what this administration has done, the basis upon which Mr. Nixon runs for the presidency, that we have never had it so good, is wholly wrong. This country cannot afford to stand still any more. [Applause.] I believe the choice is very clear and very sharp. The areas of disagreement between Mr. Nixon and I involve very importantly the welfare of this country. Mr. Nixon runs on the slogan, ""We\'ve never had it so good,"" and I run on the slogan that we are going to have to do better. [Applause.]', 'As citizens of this country, all we can do is try to present the issues and the different positions we take on the great matters that disturb our country. But you as citizens on November 8 must make your judgment of what you want this community to be, what you want this State to be, what you believe we must do as a Nation, what responsibilities and obligations we must meet as citizens. And I believe the choice is between those who feel that what we are now doing is good enough, who feel that there is no urgency to the great matters which face us at home and abroad, who are not concerned to be second in outer space, who are not concerned about our deteriorating position around the world, who are not concerned that we are moving into a period when we may be second best to the Soviet Union even in military power.', 'Well, I am concerned, and I believe that you are concerned, and that this country of ours, which deserves the best from us, cannot possibly in the early revolutionary years of the sixties be led by people who are indifferent to the great problems which sweep across the horizon of the United States. [Applause.]', ""I want to make it very clear that the problems which will disturb us as Americans are difficult. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years in order to maintain full employment. Our farm income in the last 8 years has dropped 25 percent. We are now using our steel mills only 50 percent of capacity. Here in this community where you rely on building, road-building material, you have laid men off. Seven out of the eight International Harvester plants in Illinois have laid men off in this month of October because the farmers' income has dropped. We are producing today half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. Our rate of economic growth is one-third theirs. We have nearly 4½ million people out of work and 3 million working part time. I don't think this is good enough."", 'We represent not only ourselves, but we represent the hope of freedom around the world, and this country, I believe, and this is the issue, has to pick itself up and start moving forward again. [Applause.] If you are satisfied with administration policy on agriculture, if you feel that employment security in this community and the country is sufficiently good, if you feel that the United States is moving ahead around the world, that our prestige has never been higher, then I would vote for Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.] But if you believe we can build a better society, that we can provide better opportunity for our people, that we can enforce constitutional rights for all Americans, regardless of their race and regardless of their religion, if we choose to build in this country the kind of society which causes people around the world to say, ""There is where I want to go,"" that is the example I want to follow - we are a revolutionary country. Mr. Khrushchev\'s system is as old as Egypt. But unfortunately, in recent years his outward thrust has had more vitality. People around the world have the image of America as a middle-aged society which has seen its brightest days. I don\'t agree with that view. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know, and I want Mr. Castro to know, and I want people around the world to know, that a new generation of Americans is going to lead this country. [Applause.]', ""The Republican Party and the Democratic Party have entirely different histories and an entirely different approach. We stand as we stood in other years, in the other great years of our history, we stand for the forward look beyond the horizons of present experience. I believe that the 1960's are going to be the most challenging in our history, but I believe they can also be our brightest days. We have been chosen by history to be the great defenders of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all around the globe. The next 10 years may well be decisive, and I don't think any American wants historians to write that these were the years when the tide began to run out for the United States. I believe Americans want to say again that we believe in this country, that our ability to meet our assignments is unlimited, that our brightest days are still ahead, and that we are going to go to work again. [Applause.]"", 'I ask your help in this campaign. I believe this choice is between those who are comfortable and those who are concerned, those who want to serve our country and those who believe that now is good enough. I hold the view, whether I am elected President of the United States or whether I continue as a Senator, I hold the view that we wish to serve our country, that it deserves the best from us, that what we are now doing is not good enough, that we need the best education, that we must be first in outer space, that we must build our economy, that we must provide employment for our people, that we must move again, and I ask you to move with us. I ask you to join Senator Douglas and Otto Kerner, and your next Congressman in strengthening this country, in restoring its vigor, in restoring its vitality, in placing before the American people the unfinished business of our society. All around the globe we hear the rumble of distant drums. I want to beat that drum here in the United States. I want us to begin to sing again that this society of ours and this economy can provide for our people and provide an example to freedom all around the globe, and on that basis and on that issue I ask your support and help in this campaign. [Applause.]', 'In 1789, in Hartford, Conn., the skies at noon turned one day from blue to gray and by midafternoon the city had darkened over so densely that in that religious age men fell on their knees and begged a final blessing before the end came. The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session, and many of the members clamored for an immediate adjournment. The speaker of the house, one Colonel Davenport, came to his feet and he silenced the din with these words:', '\n  The Day of Judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought.\n', ""I hope that all of us in a somber time in the life of our country may bring candles to help illuminate our country's way. Thank you.

340,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Governor Kerner, Senator Douglas, Ed Nielson, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, only in Rockford do we have rallies at 1 o'clock in the morning and 9 o'clock in the morning. [Applause.] This isn't the way they told me it was when I first decided to run for the Presidency. After reading about the schedules of the President, I thought we all stayed in bed until 10 or 11, and then got out and drove around. [Laughter.] We are up early and up late, and we are not going to slumber or rest until November 8, when the Democrats are given the lead. [Applause.]"", 'I am delighted to be here. This county, this community, has not always been overwhelmingly Democratic, and I believe that the reception you have given to all of us that are running this year indicates that it is time that the Vice President came back to Illinois and started to look after it, because I think Illinois will go Democratic on November 8, and so will the United States. [Applause.] And I think it would be food for the local paper to report that Rockford went Democratic. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon, as you know, ordinarily runs as a rather ambiguous figure who is not really attached to any party, because parties have no significance but the other day he went down there and Senator Goldwater got him in a room down in Arizona and said ""Dick, you are a Republican, you have got to admit it."" [Laughter.] So Nixon came out of the room rather shamefacedly and said, ""Yes, I am a Republican and I endorse every Republican candidate from top to bottom with great pride.""', 'I have been saying that, that I am a Democrat, for the past 14 years, because I believe the Democratic Party is associated with progress, because I believe the Democratic Party is associated with the public interest, and I do not need Barry Goldwater or anyone else to remind me that parties are important. [Applause.]', 'In fairness to the Vice President, I should say that he went to Jacksonville, Fla., the next day, and said party labels were not important. I should bring that out. But one of the reasons I am glad to be running this year in this State is because I run with three distinguished citizens of this State and country, Senator Douglas, with whom I have served in the U.S. Senate [applause] who speaks for the public interest. He and I have been together on the Labor Committee for a number of years. He is now the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report on which I serve. He is one of the most gifted figures in the Senate in this century, and I know that Illinois and the country will benefit by his service in the future. [Applause.] And by Otto Kerner, who runs for the Governor [applause] who has had a matchless reputation, a matchless reputation for honor and integrity and energy as a distinguished judge and will be a great Governor of the State of Illinois. And by your candidate for the Congress, Ed Nelson. [Applause.] Members of the House of Representatives have great responsibility placed upon them by the Constitution. They are the representatives of the people. Therefore, the power to tax, to appropriate money, other great powers, are vested in the Members of the House. We need the best talent we can get in the sixties on every level. [Applause.]', 'Every problem that faces us requires new solutions, because the problems are new. Lincoln and Douglas who debated in this State, really debated one great question in every debate, the question of the position of the Union, of the new States, of slavery, all tied to one great issue. We now face issues involving monetary and fiscal policy, full employment, outer space, control of arms, control of weapons, stronger defense, our influence in Latin America and Africa and Asia, new countries, new leaders, new problems, which swarm and pour across our desk and eventually rest on the desk of the next President of the United States. Harry Truman used to have a sign which said ""The Buck Stops Here,"" and in 1961 the buck will stop on the desk of the President, will involve more serious problems, involving decisions more highly sophisticated than any in the long history of the United States. How to maintain our people working, how to maintain economic growth in a free society, how to maintain agricultural income when our production increases 6 percent a year and our consumption 3 percent a year. How can we maintain the best educational system in the world, how can we be first in outer space and first across the street, how can we extend our influence of freedom to all those billions of people who live in some cases on an income of $25, $50, or $100 a year, and look at the Chinese and the Russians and look at us and wonder in the sixties which road to take?', ""All these problems are new. All of them are difficult. There is no easy answer to any easy question, but because they are difficult, we need the best talent we can get. In every branch of government we need the most vigorous, foresighted, farsighted, intellectually curious, well-informed and responsible citizens we can get to serve the great Republic in the dangerous and changing years of the 1960's, and that is what we intend to do. [Applause.] And one of the ways in which we can do it, one of the ways in which we can contribute to the maintenance of freedom around the world is to build a strong society here in the United States. We really are the best advertisement for freedom. If we are moving ahead, if our people are working, if we have a sense of national purpose, then quite obviously people around the world who attempt to decide what they want to be, and the kind of life they want to lead, they are impressed by us. The reason that Franklin Roosevelt was a figure to contend with in Latin America and Africa and Asia in the thirties was not because American policy was intimately involved in the thirties in most of those areas. It was because they realized he was attempting to move his country forward, that his country had vigor, and, therefore, it impressed those who needed those qualities in their own lives. [Applause.]"", 'I have been critical in this campaign that the United States has not carried out a more vigorous policy of information around the world. Do you know today in the changing and vital area of Africa that we are nearly 14th in radio broadcasts? That the Soviet Union broadcasts 10 times as much as we do to Latin America in Spanish? But in the final analysis, what we are here, as Emerson said more than a century ago, speaks far louder than what we say. What we are doing here, our sense of destiny and purpose, and in the final analysis the great servants of freedom, it is our obligation to build a vital society here which will spread its influence and the influence of freedom throughout the world.', 'One of the problems which we meet in building that vital society is how we care for those who have finished their work, who are retired, whose retirement is imminent, what kind of security and what kind of a life we can give them. It is on this issue that the parties have divided, and it is on this issue that Mr. Nixon and I have disagreed.', 'There is not anyone in this room, probably, who does not have some member of his family who is over the age of 65, who lives with an income which has dropped, who live out their lives wondering what the future will hold, and who represent a responsibility and an obligation to many of you. I will give you what I believe we should do, and it involves the lives of 17 million of our fellow Americans who live on an average social security check of less than $78 a month. Nearly 9 million of them live on less than $1,000 a year, and they live at a time when this income has dropped, their needs for better health have increased, they live in inadequate housing in many cases, and as the ancient Chinese used to remind us, the test of a society is how it deals with its older people. I believe we can do better. [Applause.]', 'In judging the two parties and in judging the two candidates, I think on this question we have a strong difference of opinion. When Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress passed the first social security act in the mid-thirties, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it. In August of 1960, when we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the aged tied to social security, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it.', ""Now look at the contrast between the present bill, which the administration signed, and what we proposed. Under the present bill it is going to cost, if fully used, $2 billion a year from the taxpayer, $1 billion in the States and $1 billion in the National Government. The bill was so bad that Governor Rockefeller of New York attacked it and refused to implement it. It means before anyone can get medical assistance, he must be medically indigent, which is the phrase used. In other words, if he saved up $600 or $700 or $2,000, and the husband or the wife gets a heart disease or some other disease, and it requires a medical bill of $500 or $600 to pay the doctors, before they can receive assistance under the bill, they must indicate that they are medically indigent. They must take, in effect, a pauper's oath that they have no resources and then they can get a handout to help meet their medical obligation. That is the Republican approach. [Response from the audience.]"", ""We have proposed that medical care for the aged be tied to social security [applause]; that all people who participate in social security will pay for their treatment, which will average about 3 cents a day, which will average about $10 a year during their working years, and then when they are retired, after they have contributed to that themselves, they will receive assistance in paying their bills, the doctors and the hospitalization and all the rest. The measure is balanced financially. It is actuarially sound. It is in the tradition of social security. There is no pauper's oath. There is no commitment that we are medically indigent before we receive the assistance, and it does not represent a drain on the Treasury of $2 billion, because it is paid for on the way. [Applause.]"", 'Now, which of us is financially responsive? Which of us has concern for unreasonable expenditures? Which of us wants to meet the job? Or which of us opposes action in this field as we have for 25 years. I believe Mr. Nixon has led the wrecking crew, not merely been a member of it. [Applause.]', 'In 1935 they opposed it. In 1949 Mr. Nixon, himself, and 110 other Republicans in the House of Representatives, voted to cut out benefits for those who were disabled under social security. In 1956 this Republican administration opposed lowering the retirement age for women to 62 years. In 1956, the Republican administration and 33 out of 39 Republican Senators opposed an increase in benefits to meet the cost of living. And after he became the Vice President, Mr. Nixon did not appear in the Senate to break a tie vote to increase payments to older people, to the blind and the disabled, and the measure lost. And this is a record of progress?', 'This is a candidate who is going to lead the United States ahead in the sixties? [Response from the audience.] ""We are going to study it,"" he announced in this campaign. Well, we studied his record and the Republicans\' record on this issue, and in my judgment, a sense of responsibility, a program which has been identified, as a matter of fact with the name of your Senator, Senator Douglas, throughout the period of 25 years, I believe in this area as in so many others, which affect our policy at home and abroad, this administration has stood still and so has Mr. Nixon. And in the 1960\'s, this country is going to have to move again. [Applause.]', 'All these things, in my judgment, in a great country like ours can be done, better housing for our people, care for their aged, to which they contribute - all these things can be done, a stronger income, a society that moves forward again. And I want to make it very clear that I do not run for the office saying that these problems are easy. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years, to maintain full employment in this country. [Applause.] To find a job for everyone who will want to work will require that kind of expansion, and it comes at a time when machines are taking the place of men. This county is a rich agricultural county. It relies primarily on agriculture and dairying. The dairy farmers of this country on the average, though this county does better than most, average about 60 cents an hour in their pay. Their income has steadily dropped. The reason has been, of course, that this administration has been manned by people with little imagination, with really, in my opinion, no sense of the changes emerging around us. I look at this county, I look at Illinois, I look at the United States, I look at outer space, I look at Africa, I look at Latin America, and in all of the new problems which disturbed our lives in the fifties, this administration has not responded, it has not taken the initiative.', 'There are six countries in Africa that are members of the United Nations that do not have a single American diplomat in residence in any of the six. We offered more scholarships to Thailand a year ago than to all of South Africa and tropical Africa, all these new countries that are going to hold the balance of power in the world. We failed to be first in outer space and as a result, Mr. Allen, the head of our Information Service, has said that the United States now is regarded as second in science in many of the countries of the world to the Soviet Union, because this administration regarded it as a bauble and because it was manned by Mr. Wilson, the Secretary of Defense, who said he was not interested in spending money to find out why fried potatoes turned brown.', 'The point of the matter is that these are new times, requiring new people and new solutions. And I believe that in these kinds of times, when this country must move, when it must be inspired by energy, when it must drive ahead if we are going to survive, if we are going to defend freedom - we cannot sit by and let the world move around us, we have to move with it, we have to lead it. We don\'t want to be like the leader in the French Revolution who said, ""There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them."" [Laughter.] We want to lead them ourselves. [Applause.] We want to direct them along the road to freedom, self-government, independence, their own masters, and I think that is what they want.', ""But if we give the impression that we are taking a long siesta while all around us energy bubbles, that the United States high noon was in the past, that our best days were behind us, and that we are a society reaching middle age - I don't believe it. This is a young and vital country. Its best days are ahead. And I come to this county and I come to Rockford in Illinois, and ask your support in making America move again. [Applause.]""]"
341,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","['* * * I want to talk with you this evening not about the missile gap, which represents the difference between Russian striking power and our own in the years to come - not about the economic gap, which represents the difference between our standard of living and that in the underdeveloped countries - but the ""Nixon gap,"" the difference between Mr. Nixon\'s campaign promises and his actual record.', 'The Republicans are fond of saying: ""Experience counts."" I agree with that - and I think the American people are entitled to know exactly what Mr. Nixon\'s experience is in all the areas which affect us so vitally. At a later date, I shall discuss Mr. Nixon\'s experience in foreign affairs. Today I want to discuss his experience and record on domestic issues.', ""For here the gap is especially large. Any resemblance between Mr. Nixon's promises for the future and his performance in the past is purely coincidental."", 'When Mr. Nixon talks about his experience, he mentions his trips abroad, his positions in the executive branch, and the ideas he contributed to this administration - although President Eisenhower could not think of a single one, even when given a week to do so.', 'But Mr. Nixon never mentions his votes in the House, his votes in the Senate, or his votes as vice president. He did not have many votes these last 8 years.', 'But his voting record is there, whether he mentions it or not. Perhaps he is counting on what he once cited in advising Maine Republicans - his belief that ""the public memory is short.\' Perhaps he is counting on voters not being allowed to take notes into the voting booth.', 'But the Bible tells us to judge a tree by its fruits. For ""what is past is prologue"" - and any American who is concerned about Mr. Nixon\'s attitude in the future would do well to inform himself of Mr. Nixon\'s attitude in the past.', '1. First on the list is the agricultural gap - the complete contrast between Mr. Nixon\'s promises on the farm problem today and his votes on the farm problem over the last 14 years. Today he puts the blame for the farm mess on the fact that Secretary of Agriculture Benson has lacked the necessary ""ability and success."" But only a few years ago he called Mr. Benson ""one of the best Secretaries of Agriculture in our history."" He proposes in his new farm program a ""substantial expansion"" of the conservation reserve - and yet, as a Republican Senator from California and as Vice President, he voted six times in 3 years to cut Democratic appropriations for soil conservation. He says now ""we should accelerate our efforts in underdeveloped nations"" to ""stimulate commercial markets for our farm people"" - but when in 1952 the Department of Agriculture sought funds for this very purpose, Senator Nixon voted to cut them. He now says he favors the other services provided by the Department of Agriculture - but in 1951 it was a Nixon amendment which would have eliminated the annual yearbook and other research bulletins. Mr. Nixon downgrades support for our farmers - and our farmers are not likely to support Mr. Nixon.', '2. Second is the Nixon gap on education - a gap highlighted by his vote as Vice President defeating funds for higher teachers\' salaries only a few days after he made a speech in Chicago calling for higher teachers\' salaries. His campaign position paper on education supports Federal grants to school districts burdened by Federal employees or installation - but as a Senator he voted to cut the very heart out of these funds. He calls now for matching grants to private colleges and universities, so that every talented student can go to college - but, when that fight was being waged a few years ago, he termed such a program ""undesirable."" He calls now for a program of loans and grants for college classrooms and dormitories - but he never said a word when that very bill was twice passed by the Democrats and twice vetoed by the Republicans. This Nation needs better educated citizens - but they are smart enough now not to fall for these promises again.', '3. Third is the Nixon gap in the field of health and social security. His new position paper calls for matching grants to expand medical schools, dental schools, and medical research facilities, and help for our medical students as well - but as a Republican Senator he voted against the bill which would have built these facilities by this time and relieved the doctor shortage. He calls for increased appropriations for medical research - but he never lifted a finger when the party he leads was slashing this budget during the last 8 years. He insists now that our older citizens are entitled to decent medical care - but he called the bill which Senator Douglas and I supported achieving this goal under social security, an ""extreme"" measure - because it was defeated by 32 out of 33 Senate Republicans. He now talks about improving our social security program - but as a Congressman he voted against expanded social security coverage and increased social security benefits and as Vice President he defeated a measure to pay only $5 a month more for the aged, the blind, and the disabled who must receive public assistance. I believe this country can do better by its retired citizens - and we can start in November by retiring Mr. Nixon.', '4. Fourth, the Nixon gap on REA and public power is equally striking. He says now that we must ""produce the power we need at the lowest cost"" - but the record shows that he has voted four times against adequate appropriations for REA, four times against the TVA, and consistently against power development and transmission lines in the Missouri Valley, Grand Coulee, Bonneville, and the Bureau of Reclamation. He calls for ""greater emphasis on new starts for sound multipurpose projects"" for reclamation, power, and flood control - but only last February he called the administration\'s ""no new starts"" policy ""sound."" I call it folly - and ask your help to get our resource development moving again.', '5. Fifth, the Nixon housing gap should concern everyone who lives in our cities and suburbs, everyone who wants someday to buy their own home. His new position paper on housing praises the Housing Act of 1949 - but it neglects to mention that Congressman Nixon voted against that very bill. It calls for action on middle - income housing - but it neglects to mention his vote against this in 1950. It calls for a greater flow of housing credit so more Americans can afford more home - but it neglects to mention his vote as Vice President to increase interest rates on GI housing loans. Higher interest rates never built a single house, but the new Democratic administration will.', '6. Sixth, there is a Nixon gap on matters affecting labor and employment. He told a labor convention this fall that, if he is elected, ""labor will have a friend in the White House."" But his voting record as Congressman, Senator, and Vice President has been consistently antilabor. He says he supports the minimum wage - but as a Congressman he voted to eliminate from its protection a million workers already covered: and as Vice President he opposed our efforts to expand coverage and raise the minimum to $1.25 an hour. He makes campaign promises to help our distressed areas and our unemployed workers - but as Vice President he has consistently opposed our party\'s efforts, sparked by Senator Douglas, to get such measures enacted. Our unemployed workers only wish he loved them in May as he does in November.', '7. Seventh is the gap between promise and performance in the field of civil rights. In the big Northern States, at least, Mr. Nixon makes a great show of supporting Federal action to implement the full constitutional rights of every American - but both as a Congressman and as a Senator, he voted time and time again against effective legislation for equal job opportunities. He boasts now about his experience as Chairman of the Executive Committee To Eliminate Discrimination in Government Contracts - but the facts are that in 8 years he did not invoke a single sanction to enforce the clause (in every Government contract) that prevents racial discrimination in hiring. As a result, millions of skilled and professional jobs are denied to talented Negroes. I think a nation that holds itself out as the champion of democracy has an obligation to do better by all Americans.', '8. Finally, the voters ought to be aware of the Nixon gap on the subject of inflation - for here he has had some real experience. Last year, having broken every campaign promise ever made on holding down the high cost of living, the Republicans finally decided to do something about it. They appointed another committee - a committee to study the problem. Mr. Nixon was the chairman; and he filed a report that was supposed to tell us how to stabilize prices and increase our economic growth.', 'The Washington Post called Mr. Nixon\'s report ""one of the most redundant, uninspired, and generally useless documents lately to come off the Government\'s mimeograph machines.""', 'The New York Herald Tribune, a Republican paper, said it was like something you wrote in high school.', 'The Wall Street Journal said it was fine except it had no recommendations on what it was appointed to do.', 'I do not believe that this is the kind of experience this Nation will want to reward with the White House. As Otto Kerner can tell you, no judge is impressed by the experience of a driver whose record is full of accidents.', 'I believe the American people prefer their experience under the Democratic Party. Our experience is written in the Social Security Act, the minimum wage laws, the FHA, the REA, guaranteed bank deposits, TVA and a host of other programs.', 'The Bible tells us that ""whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."" Mr. Nixon has sown the seeds of negation. Time after time, he has said ""No"" to the American people. And on November 8, the American people will say ""No"" to Mr. Nixon. The Democratic Party has sown the seeds of accomplishments and progress; and on November 8, we shall reap a great harvest of victory.']"
342,John F. Kennedy ,"October 24, 1960","[""* * * August 14, 1935, was a milestone in the American people's journey to freedom from want and fear. On that day Franklin D.

Today social security is so much a part of our lives that we take it for granted. We forget it was won only over the bitter opposition of Republican leaders.', 'Mr. Nixon recently sounded the Republican Party\'s familiar election-year promises for improvement.

What is Mr. Nixon\'s record?', 'In 1935, when Franklin Roosevelt asked for a Social Security Act, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against it.', 'In 1936, the Republican candidate for President called social security a ""cruel hoax"" and a ""fraud.""', 'For 25 years they have kept up a steady attack on social security, resisting improvements and trying to cut its benefits.', 'In 1949 Mr. Nixon and 110 other Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to cut out benefits for those who were disabled.', 'In 1956, the Republican administration opposed lowering the retirement age for women. Thirty-eight of the 44 Republicans in the Senate opposed benefits for the permanently disabled.', 'In 1958, the Republican administration and 33 of the 39 Republican Senators opposed an increase in benefits to meet the rise in the cost of living.', 'After he became Vice President Mr. Nixon did not appear in the Senate to break a tie vote on a measure to increase payments to old people, the blind, and the measure was lost.', 'Until the closing moments of Congress this year, Mr. Nixon and the Republican administration opposed any action upon health care for our elder citizens - calling for a ""study"" and a report in 1961.', 'The Republican Party has been inconsistent on many issues. But on one issue it has been wholly consistent for a quarter of a century. It has attempted to wreck social security. And it can count on Richard Nixon to lead its wrecking crew.', 'Despite 25 years of opposition, the Democratic Party built the social security system and it stands today, a Gibraltar for our older citizens, paying monthly benefits to over 10 million retired people and half a million disabled people, a million widows and 2 million widowed mothers and their children.', ""Yet, as Franklin Roosevelt said, although we have come a long way we still have far to go. And I say it's time to get moving."", 'There are 16 million Americans 65 or older - men and women who built this country - but men and women who still cannot face old age free of fear and want.', 'I am not satisfied when well over half our older citizens are so financially insecure, so burdened with illness, so poorly fed, clothed and housed, that their years have brought problems rather than privileges, sorrow instead of security, and debts instead of dignity.', 'I am not satisfied when-', '\n  Three out of five persons over 65 are trying to get by on cash incomes of less than $1,000 a year;', 'Retired couples on social security are receiving an average of $120 a month, and widows an average of $56 a month in 1960 when the cost of living is at an all-time high.', 'Eight out of 10 people over 65 suffer from some chronic disease, more than half have no private health insurance at all, and the cost of medical care has skyrocketed.', 'Thousands of our older citizens who are able and willing to work cannot find work because employers tell them that 65 is too old to work - or for that matter, in some instances, 50 or even 45.', 'Thousands of older people are in mental hospitals even though their primary need is not psychiatric treatment but because there is no other place for them.', 'Thousands more live in rundown crowded apartments in the blighted sections of our cities because they can afford nothing else.', ""I say this isn't good enough. I say we can do better."", 'I propose immediate action upon a seven-point program to help create the necessary climate for a productive and satisfying life in later years.', ""First: We must make available a medical insurance program based on the proven social security system. It must be fiscally sound and administratively simple and it must permit each individual to select his own hospital and doctor. I feel strongly that there must be no means test, no Republican pauper's oath, for medical care. Already 214 million of our older citizens are compelled to rely on public assistance for their daily needs. It would be cruel to force another 12 million to undergo a means test before they receive aid. And it is not necessary. The social security approach is proved and successful. It is consistent with honor, dignity and individual self-reliance. Our older citizens want insurance, not charity, and they will pay for it as they go. And it requires no special appropriations by the Congress and each of the 50 States every year. President Eisenhower has insisted that every new welfare proposal should include taxes to pay for it. This is the only method of meeting that test."", 'Opponents of medical care have pretended that it would lead to socialized medicine. Let me make it perfectly clear that I have always opposed socialized medicine and that what the Republicans really oppose is adequate medical care. In 1935 they pretended that social security would sovietize America. Did it?', ""Second: We must increase social security benefit payments to keep pace with the rising cost of living. In terms of today's high prices, benefits have become so meager that for many people retirement has become little more than a mirage. A lifetime of work and a lifetime of payments into an insurance fund deserve at least the basic comforts of life. Cost-of-living increases are probably more important to our older citizens than any other group, for they have no union to protect them any they are unable to raise prices like businessmen. It is time we recognized our responsibility to see that they do not suffer because of fluctuations in the economy beyond their control."", 'Third: We must improve employment opportunities for older workers and combat age discrimination in employment. We must expand our program for retraining older workers and our effort to educate employers on the value of older workers. We must end all age discrimination by U.S. Government contractors and subcontractors. We must, through our regular employment services, do more to help older people find part-time work.', 'Fourth: We must amend the Social Security Act to encourage, not penalize, those older people who are able and willing to work. We should increase the retirement benefit for each additional year of work after 65, and raise the $1,200-a-year ceiling on what a worker may earn while still drawing social security.', 'Fifth: We must expand and accelerate the program to provide low-cost housing for the aged, a Democratic program enacted by a Democratic Congress despite two administration vetoes. Direct Federal loans have provided financial incentive in this field and should be increased. We can make loans to elderly persons who wish to purchase a home; and Government assistance can be provided in the conversion of existing housing to meet the special requirements of the elderly.', 'Sixth : We must step up our program of medical research on genetics, the problems of aging in all their aspects, including mental health. And we must provide for the establishment of clinics at the community level for the early detection, and thus the prevention, of many of the diseases that afflict the aged, for early diagnosis is often the key. The Federal Government should also encourage and assist local communities to establish organized home programs, nutritional guidance, and coordinated community health services which have already helped old people greatly to achieve self-reliance and vigor.', 'Seventh: We must increase the provision for rehabilitation and training of the physically and mentally handicapped. This is not solely a problem of our older citizens, but it strikes them particularly hard. Here again, Federal-State cooperation can be extremely effective.', ""As we move forward, the Republican leaders will obstruct the way. They will say we can't afford it, I say we cannot refuse to afford it."", 'In 1900 there were only 3 million persons over 65. Today there are 16 million and by 1975 there will be an estimated 22 million. Moreover, a child born in 1900 could expect to live only to the age of 47, but today to the age of 70, an additional 23 years of life.', 'What this amounts to is that we have created a whole new generation of men and women in our society.', 'And this in turn means one of two things. Either this generation will be recognized for what it is, an invaluable storehouse of accumulated wisdom and experience, or it will be thrown on the scrapheap. As in every other area of our national life, the decision is ours to make.']"

[Applause.] She comes from Illinois. Ladies and gentlemen, I come here today as the Democratic standard bearer in a most important election. I have served in the House and the Senate for 14 years, and after all that time, without downgrading the importance of the Congress, I recognize that I run for the key office, not only in the United States, but also in the free world. On the desk of the next President of the United States in 1961 will come questions involving our defenses in the Far East, our relations with Latin America, our relations with Africa, the whole question of what NATO is going to become, what it can be, a crisis over Berlin, the position of the United States in outer space, the whole question of our economic growth - all these are questions which disturb the life not only of the President of the United States, but of all of you. I come as the Democratic standard bearer with full recognition - maybe you can just sit down. [Applause.] Let me put in not more than 4 minutes what I consider to be the basic issues which separate Mr. Nixon and myself, and the Republican Party and the Democratic Party in 1960. [Response from the audience.]"", 'First it is a question which involves the future of every citizen of the city of Aurora. This community depends upon industry. The whole question - it is hard to talk, girls, I know - I only have 3 more minutes. One of the questions which Mr. Nixon and I have been discussing in this campaign is the whole question of economic growth. That is not an argument which is of interest only to economists. It concerns the job of every man and woman here. We have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next ten years to provide full employment in the United States, 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years, and we are going to have to do that at a time when machines are taking the place of men. When a machine takes the job of 5 men or 10 men, where are those men going to get jobs. Ten out of the twelve International Harvester plants in the State of Illinois have shut down for a month or 2 months this fall in Illinois. Anyone who does not realize that this is one of the great problems which is going to face us as citizens, anyone who does not realize that today we are only using 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills, today in the last 5 or 10 years the farmers of Illinois and the farmers of the United States, their income has dropped 30 percent - this problem goes not only to the question of employment, but it goes to the question of our strength in the competition with the Soviet Union. We have increased our economic growth on the average of about 2.5 percent in the last 8 years. Western Germany has increased theirs 5 percent, the Soviet Union 7.5 to 8 percent. Unless we grow more, unless we employ fiscal and monetary policies that stimulate employment, we are going to have a recession in the winter of 1961 and it is going to be difficult to find those 25,000 new jobs a week.', 'This is only one of the issues which separate our two parties, agriculture, full employment, education, development of our resources, care for the aged, a higher minimum wage, an economy that is moving, a country that is moving, a country which stands for vitality and energy and strength. Those are the issues which separate the two parties. [Applause.]', ""I have here a clipping from this morning's paper. It represents the results of a survey which was conducted all around the world to ask the people of the world whether they thought the Soviet Union or the United States was the stronger military power. And do you know what the survey found? Do you know what the State Department found? That a majority of the people in all 10 countries thought the Soviet Union was No. 1. How do you like that as Americans, to know that the people of the world [response from the audience] which used to regard the United States as the strongest power, as the great hope for freedom, now regard the Soviet Union as No.1. That is the question which disturbs me as an American, and you have to decide as citizens of this country 2 weeks from today. You have to make your decision of what you want this country to be, what you want Illinois to be, how ready you are to move this country forward. That is the question which separates Mr. Nixon and myself. [Applause.]"", 'It is a contest between a candidate, Mr. Nixon, who argues that our prestige has never been higher, in spite of the record, who says that everything is being done in its good time, who says our influence has never been greater, and between a candidate, myself, who says that we are going to have to do much better. You have to decide which you believe, what you want. It is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who believe we can do better and those who say we have never had it so good. And all of you as citizens of this country, as defenders of freedom, 2 weeks from today must make your judgment of what you believe, what you hope for our country; your willingness to see us stand still and grow fat or your willingness to pick yourselves up and the country and move ourselves forward and reestablish our leadership. [Applause.]', 'That is the question. No one can make that judgment except you. No one can make it except you. Two weeks from today you are going to make it. One hundred years ago in the campaign of 1860, Abraham Lincoln wrote a friend - fortunately, as the Bible tells us, it rains on the just and the unjust. There are some Republicans here and it is raining on them, too. [Laughter.]', 'One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend:', '\n  I know there is a God and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming and I see His hand in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe I am ready.\n', 'Now, 100 years later, in the great times of 1960, we know there is a God, and we know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming.

He presents his views of what he thinks is best for the country, and I present my views. But I think the biggest difference, and the most significant one, and the one that you should consider most carefully is our judgment of our present position in the world, and what we must do as citizens in order to build our strength.', 'Mr. Nixon runs on a program of saying that our prestige has never been higher - do you have the paper here?', 'Mr. Nixon 2 weeks ago, and I am ready to let this campaign make a judgment on which one of us is informed - he made a statement on our debate that our prestige in the world has never been higher. You may recall that. This is the New York Times of Tuesday, October 25, 1960, the front page. Here is what it says:', '""The United States Survey Finds Others Consider the Soviet Mightiest. Summer Poll Shows Belief Is Nearly Unanimous Among the Nations Sampled. Lead Is Expected To Hold. Some Expect Gap To Widen."" Then the story starts:', '\n  An almost unanimous belief that the Soviet Union is the leading military power was disclosed in a worldwide survey conducted for the U.S. Government during the summer, reliable sources abroad report. According to these sources, the survey also disclosed unanimity among the free and uncommitted nations of the world that the Soviet Union would maintain and possibly widen its lead over the United States through the next decade. These are the major findings of a report drawn up by the Office for Research and Analysis on the basis of the results of the survey. The office is part of the U.S. Information Service.\n', 'Now, the fact of the matter is that this administration has refused to make these surveys public. I asked Mr. Nixon if he would the other night. They have refused to give these surveys to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Fulbright as late as a week ago, and the reason is that they show that this administration and Mr. Nixon have been wholly misinformed about our position in the world, and this goes to your survival. If the people of the world once get the idea that the Russians and the the Communists represent the strongest power, how many of them will stay with us? How many people in Latin America, Africa, and Asia will decide that we represent the way of the future? This is what this means. Once they come to the conclusion that the Soviet Union is a stronger society than we are, what happens to us as leaders of the free world?', 'You are citizens of this country. You have to make the judgment on what you want this country to be. Mr. Nixon has said in the last 3 weeks that our prestige is the highest it has ever been and that of the Communists the lowest. This survey shows how misinformed he is, how wide is the gap between what he believes and what the facts are.', ""Now, is there anyone here who is prepared to say after reading this on the front page of the New York Times what the opinion of us is around the world, that there isn't time for us to pick ourselves up and start moving forward again? That is the issue that you have to decide. What do you want? You live in this community. Your children go to school here. You are concerned about your survival as a free nation, and what we are now talking about is not popularity. It is the willingness of the people to follow us, to work with them, and maintain their freedom, to stay out of the Communist bloc, to stay out of Communist influence, to support us as the strongest society. That is what this all means. In the last years people around the world have come to the conclusion that we are not the strongest power. Now, on that basis, you must make your judgment on November 8. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Would you put up your hands? [Response from the audience.] Let me say that I think you ought to be commended for admitting it. Have we got any Democrats here at all? [Response from the audience.] Now, have we got any citizens who have not decided yet, who are open-minded? [Response from the audience.] Well, we will talk to you.', ""Ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief. I just come here in this community, which is mixed, Democrats Republicans and independents, because 2 weeks from today, November 8, Mr. Nixon and my work will be finished and then you have to decide, you have to make these judgments. But what is the area of difference between us? What is the issue on which you should base your decision? You should not only make a judgment of Mr. Nixon and myself. You should also make a judgment about yourselves, what you want, about what your view is of your country and your community, about what your view of the future is whether you are satisfied today or wish to do better. If you are satisfied, if you feel happy about your life, if you feel our country is meeting its responsibilities, then you belong in Mr. Nixon's camp. But if you share the view that I hold very vigorously, that this country is going to have to do better in the future, that we have responsibilities to meet not only to ourselves but to the cause of freedom, that we are anxious to make sure that in the future people decide that these days were great days in the life of our country, that we must move forward, we must stimulate our growth, we must hold out an image to the world of a vigorous, dynamic society, if we are going to continue to lead the free world - I believe that is the choice. I don't think if we continue on our present basis that we will be the leaders of the free world."", ""We have a solemn choice to make. I think this is an important election, and I think the issue is quite clear between us, not only our parties, but also on the views we have taken in this campaign. Mr. Nixon, I am sure, says what he thinks, and he has stated that he has run on a program believing our prestige is at an alltime high and that we never had it so good. I don't run on that program at all. I run on the program, as a citizen of this country who has served it for 14 years in the Congress, and who is the standard bearer of my party. I believe we are going to have to do much better. Unless there is some dissatisfaction - that is what made this country, that is what gave us the American revolution - dissatisfaction with what was then going on.

346,John F. Kennedy ,"October 25, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to have you meet my sister, Eunice, Mrs. Sargent Shriver, who lives in Illinois. [Applause.] She said she has just been introduced. Well, it is all right to meet her again. [Laughter.]', 'Here is Otto Kerner, the next Congressman from this district; my friend and colleague in the U.S. Senate, Paul Douglas. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my thanks to you for coming today. I have been campaigning in the State of Illinois which is going to be a key State in the presidential election. This State may well determine who will be the next President of the United States, and you have to determine as citizens who you want that President to be, and, more important, what are the things you believe he should stand for, what are the things that he must do, as the leader of our free country in order to maintain our strength around the world.', 'One of the subjects that is important to us all as citizens here in this community and around the country is how we are going to have an educational system second to none. Every child here in this community deserves to be well educated, because as Thomas Jefferson said, ""If you hope that people will be free and ignorant, you hope for what never was and never will be."" In order to maintain a free society, in order that we can maintain our independence in the coming year, we have to have the best educated citizens in the world. That involves a responsibility of the people in this country, it involves a responsibility of the Governor of the State, and it involves the National Government, because all must work together for this great objective. These communities, of which this is typical, have done more in the last 10 years to build schools and educate our children than ever in our history. We had just as many children in school in 1930 as 1940, just as many in 1940 as 1950, but after 1950, in the last 10 years, we increased the number of our children in schools by one third, and that has meant that every homeowner in this district, in this area bears a burden. On a $15,000 or $16,000 house in these communities of which this is typical, the property tax may be anywhere from $400 to $500. That is the most confiscatory tax of all, the property tax. Even if you are out of work, even if you had no income, just by owning a home you have to pay that, and a good deal of it goes to education. The State has responsibility, and I believe the National Government has a responsibility, and that responsibility was recognized from the beginning of our country. When the Northwest Territory was settled, of which this is a section, 1 out of every 16 acres was put aside in order to sustain education. In Lincoln\'s administration in 1862, they set up the Land Grant Act which built your university and others like it, and set aside a certain amount of national territory to sustain education.', ""Now the question is, What should we do in the sixties? What should the National Government do in cooperation with you in order to maintain a strong educational system? It can do two or three things, and I support them. First, it can provide scholarships for our brightest children. Do you know that 35 percent of our brightest children never see the inside of a college after graduating from high school? We can't waste that talent. We need all the talent we can get. So scholarships and loans for students who want to go to college but can't afford it. We need them and they have a right to have an education."", 'Secondly, we need loans from the National Government to build dormitories and classrooms for our universities; because of the number of children that you are having, we are going to have more buildings that have to be built for our colleges in the next 10 years than we built in the last 150 years. That is a tremendous number. We are going to have to double the number of children going to college in 1970 as in 1960. One of the ways by which that can be financed is by loans at low rates of interest to be repaid over a long period of time.', ""The third area where I believe the National Government can play a role is Federal aid to education in the areas for school construction and for teachers' salaries. There are many thousands of teachers who are underpaid. There are many thousands of teachers with inadequate training. I want to see the best teachers with the best training, but make sure that they are adequately compensated. Otherwise, we are not going to get the best talent and our children will suffer. Any time that a child grows up without the best education, he dooms himself to a life of economic hardship in many ways. His children's chances are not so good, and it passes on generation after generation. A good education is the most valuable resource that you can pass on to your children. And I believe it incumbent upon us in the 1960's to make sure that all of us, cooperating in our respective fields, to make sure that we do have a good educational system. [Applause.] And this is one of the areas where I believe we have disagreed with the Republican leadership and with Mr. Nixon. He cast the deciding vote, after speaking about the need 2 weeks before for well paid teachers, he cast the deciding vote in the U.S. Senate against the bill which would have provided aid for teachers' salaries."", 'These are the problems that we have to meet. We build roads, we build homes, we also need schools. I want to make it very clear that one of those areas where we are going to act, and this is only one of the areas that need action, will be in the field of education. Ten years ago the United States turned out twice as many scientists and engineers out of our schools as the Soviet Union. Today they turn out twice as many as we do. And we need a better educated citizenry than any country to maintain a free society. So I come here today to this community and ask your help in this area as in so many others, in strengthening our country, in building our country, in making it more secure, and making it an inspiration to all those who wish to be free. I ask your help in this campaign. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I campaign for the Presidency with a full recognition that that office will bear more responsibility than it has in the last 100 years since the administration of Lincoln. All of the problems which center upon the United States finally come to rest, in a free society, upon the desk of the President. He is not only the Commander in Chief, he is not only the head of his party, he is not only a legislative leader, he is not only charged with the power of appointment, he also is charged by the Constitution and by the force of events with the maintenance of our relations across the seas. We have two great problems that face the President, and because they face the President, they face all of you.', 'First, can we in this country maintain full employment, build a stronger and more vital society, that demonstrates that freedom and productivity go hand in hand together? Secondly, how can we maintain the peace and maintain our own security around the world and strengthen freedom?', 'Now, these two questions are interrelated with our productivity, our industrial strength, our sense of purpose. All these help the cause of freedom, not only within the United States but all around the world. One of the issues which divide Mr. Nixon and myself in this campaign and one of the questions which you will be called upon to render your judgment on November 8, because all Mr. Nixon and I can do is present our views of what our country requires, and then you decide on one day, is the question of whether what we are doing now is sufficient, whether our power and prestige in the world is growing in relation to that of the Communists or deteriorating. That is the question that involves us all. It involves our children, it involves the future of our country. I have made the charge in this campaign that our prestige has been declining, and our prestige is important, because it involves the question of whether other countries will follow our leadership. Will the countries of Africa and Latin America and Asia and Western Europe and Eastern Europe, will they decide that the Communist system represents the future and we represent the past?', 'Mr. Nixon and I have differed completely on this question. He says that our prestige is at an alltime high. He said it on the debate and I say it has been declining, and this is an important issue. Now, this morning the papers reveal, and I have the New York in my hand [laughter] that the Information Service of our State Department has been conducting polls throughout 10 countries of the world to try to find out their view of the United States. These polls have been confidential, but the papers evidently got hold of them.

Subheadline: ""Summer Poll Shows Belief Is Nearly Unanimous Among the Nations Sampled and the Lead Is Expected to Hold, and Some Expect the Gap to Widen.""', 'Here are the countries:', '\n  The survey was made in 9 or 10 countries, including France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Indonesia, Britain, and Pakistan.

You have to decide. Do you want to endorse the leadership of Mr. Nixon and this is the decision you must render, who now says and has said it as a basic issue of his position, that our prestige has never been higher, and that of the Communists lower or do you take the view I take, that I don't seek to please you, but we seek to serve you, and in my judgment honesty compels us to say [applause] honesty compels us to say that we are going to have to do better. That is the question. This is a great country and I have unlimited confidence in it, and I have served it for 18 years. But my judgment is, as an American, and you must render your judgment 2 weeks from today, as an American, that this country is going to have to build an image around the world of a strong and vital and progressive society and convince a watching world, as we sit on a most conspicuous stage, that we represent the way of the future. I believe we do, and want them to know it. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

Ladies and gentlemen, Judge Otto Kerner, the next Governor of the State of Illinois Paul Douglas, the present U.S. Senator and the next U.S. Senator, Hayes Beall, candidate for the Congress from this district, and my sister, Eunice, Mrs. Sargent Shriver, who lives in Illinois. [Applause.] One of my sisters is married to someone who lives in New York, one in California. We realized long ago we have to carry New York, Illinois, and California. [Laughter and applause.]', 'In any case, I appreciate your coming out here today, and I recognize that you come here today for this meeting because you share the view that this is an important election which involves the future of the United States, and also because you realize that the office of the Presidency is key. I speak in the Senate for Massachusetts. Senator Douglas for Illinois, Senator Engle for California, but only the President of the United States speaks for California and Illinois and Massachusetts, and he speaks for more than the United States. He speaks for the free world.', 'I believe there are two basic responsibilities which the next President of the United States must meet. One is our domestic strength, the maintenance of full employment, a strong and vital society, a strong educational system, the development of our resources and a moving America.', 'The second responsibility given to the President by the Constitution and by the force of events is the conduct of foreign affairs, and it is in this area that the great issues of war and peace, of strength and weakness, of ebb and flow will meet across the desk of the next President.', 'One of the issues in this area which has separated Mr. Nixon and myself, and on which you as citizens must render a judgment, is whether the strength of the United States and its image around the world has increased or decreased. Is our prestige, as Mr. Nixon says, at an all time high and that of the Communists at an all time low? [Response.]', 'This is an important question, because prestige is not popularity. Prestige is the image which you give of a vital society which persuades other people to follow our leadership. If once they begin to feel that the Communist system represents the future, and that we represent the past, then all those people in Western Europe, Latin America and Africa and Asia, who we wish to follow our example, who we wish to be free, if once they decide the future belongs to the Communists, and not to us, here in Elgin you suffer, and we suffer across the country. This has been an issue in our campaign. I have said our prestige is not at its height. Mr. Nixon on the debate said it was. The New York Times this morning reported the results of the survey conducted by our Information Services this summer around the world and what their image was of the United States. Here is the headline on these findings which have been kept secret up to today: ""United States Survey Funds Others Consider the Soviet Union the Mightiest. Summer Poll Shows Belief Is Nearly Unanimous Among the Nations Sampled. The Lead Is Expected to Hold. Some Expect the Gap to Widen.""', 'Since they have the idea that the Communists and the Russians are stronger than we are, what happens to our alliance in Western Europe, what happens to our commitment to Berlin? What happens to the nations of Africa? We saw the result of this on the vote on the admission of Red China. Of the 16 new nations admitted to the United Nations from Africa, do you know how many voted with us? None. Not one voted with us on the admission of Red China. More nations voted against us from Asia than voted with us. The reason is right here. Because we are second in space, because the Soviet Union economic growth is three times ours today, and that goes to your job in Elgin, because they are turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are, and because Khrushchev looks with confidence to the future, people begin to feel that our brightest days are in the past.', ""I don't share that view. I want Mr. Khrushchev and the world to know that a new generation of Americans is taking over, Americans who fought in Europe and in the Pacific to maintain our freedom in World War II and who are going to rebuild the image of America as a strong and vital society, and that is the issue which you have to decide. [Applause.] You have to decide, and it is your decision. All I can do as a candidate for the Presidency, all I can do as a candidate for the Presidency is to make a judgment on what this country must do, but as citizens you have to decide what you want the country to be, and you have to decide if what we are now doing is good enough, or whether once again the United States should pick itself up and start moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
350,John F. Kennedy ,"October 25, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Judge Otto Kerner, the next Governor of Illinois, Senator Paul Douglas, my colleague in the U.S. Senate and a distinguished spokesman for the United States, Hayes Beall, the next Congressman, ladies and gentlemen, we have a baby back there. I want to thank all of you who came out today. This is a strong area in the State of Illinois. It is not a county that has been known for its Democratic majorities, but I do appreciate your coming out today. I think your presence here, whether you are Republican or Democrat, whether you wish to click with Dick or whether you wish to move this country forward [applause] that is really a strong slogan, ""Click with Dick,"" whatever your feeling may be of the United States and the State of Illinois, I appreciate your coming here, and I think you come here because you recognize that this is an important election, that the office of the Presidency is key, and whoever may be the next President, whether it is Mr. Nixon or myself, will be faced with greater responsibilities and greater burdens because we all are, than we have ever been in the long history of our country. When the United States - when the President has difficulties, the United States has, and I want to make it very clear that the United States is moving into a period which will feature great opportunities for us as well as great responsibilities and great burdens.', 'Now, what is my disagreement with Mr. Nixon? What is my disagreement with the Republicans? It is a very clear one. My belief is that Mr. Nixon runs for the office of the Presidency without emphasizing in his campaign, either because he is not informed or because he does not believe that this is the most serious time in the life of this country. I do not detect any note of urgency in the speeches of the Vice President. You have to decide yourselves as citizens whether you believe that is what you want for the future of the country. Is it your judgment - I will say this, to those of you who are Republicans - is it your judgment that this country can afford to continue as it now is going? Do you really believe that the tide of history is moving in our favor? Do you really accept the word of Mr. Nixon that our prestige [response from the audience] do you really accept his judgment that our prestige has never been higher, that our influence has never been greater? Do you really believe that the balance of power in the world is shifting with us, and that historians will write 10 years from now that these were the great years of the American Republic? If you do, you should click with Dick. But if you hold the view which I hold, that this is a dangerous time, that this is a time of challenge and opportunity, that this is a time that requires the best of us, that the United States has failed to recognize in its leadership that these are changing and different times, in a in America, Africa, and Asia, in Western Europe and Eastern Europe, in outer space, in our own country - I note no sense of vitality. I do not hear the President of the United States setting before the American people our national goals.', 'I read an article in Life magazine, ""What Is Our National Purpose?"" In this challenging time when the survival of freedom is at stake, we have to wonder what our national purpose is. The President of the United States is the voice of America; he sets the national purpose and in my judgment, the issue in this campaign is between the concerned and the comfortable, those who believe what we are now doing is good enough and those who want to start out again. Here at home in the development of our economic growth, in our relations with Latin America, in our relations with Africa, in outer space, do you really believe this administration has come to grips with change? The reason we have difficulty with Mr. Castro is because we do not any longer influence the countries of Latin America to join with us in any concerted plan of action. The reason that countries of Africa no longer support the United States and look to it is because we have been indifferent to the problems of that vital continent. In 1957 we had more foreign service people stationed in West Germany than we did in all of Africa.', 'I want to make it very clear, because you must make the final judgment, I want to make it very clear that I am not a bit satisfied as a citizen of this country, with our present rate of growth, with our present image in the world, with our present sense of national purpose. I have unlimited faith in this country but I believe we have to decide, and right up there on that plaque are the words, we have to decide whether our generation of Americans is going to make a sacrifice and a service to our country that the times require, or are they going to put a plaque up here 10 years from now that this generation of Americans failed its responsibility? That is the decision you make on November 8. What kind of a country and world do you want, what you see as your responsibility as a citizen of this country. I believe that issue sharply divides Mr. Nixon and myself, and on the basis that I want this country to resume its forward march, I want us to look to the future and not the present or the past. I want you to join me in serving this country and moving this country forward. [Applause.]']"

Senator Douglas, Judge Kerner, our congressional candidates, the next Congressman Tyler Thompson - Tyler Thompson is running for Congress from this district, and I would like to introduce my sister, Eunice Shriver, who lives in Chicago, Ill., Mrs. Sargent Shriver. [Applause.] I have sisters living in all the key electoral States in preparation for this campaign.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, I want to express my appreciation to all of you for coming this morning. I believe that you come here this morning whether you are Republicans or Democrats or independents because this is an important election for a great office in a great country. I run for the office of the Presidency after 14 years in the Congress with full recognition of the responsibilities of that office. Only the President of the United States can speak for this country. Only the President of the United States can place before the American people the unfinished business of our society. And I come here this year on this campaign to ask your support in building a stronger State and building a stronger country. [Applause.]', 'I want to make it very clear, I want to make it very clear that basic issues - maybe we can put all the signs down. Can we all put the signs down and we will have a chance to see everything - even that Kennedy sign. [Laughter.]', 'If the Nixon signs would drop also, then we can get in touch with everybody. [Laughter.] Thank you.', ""Now, can anybody hear anything over this microphone? You can't hear anything? I would like to have you hear what I am going to say, so we will try to get this fixed. [Applause.]"", ""Well, here is what I want to say. It is going to be a 3-minute speech, so let us see if I can get in touch with you for 3 minutes. I think this is an important election for the Presidency because I think the Presidency is important. What are the issues that separate Mr. Nixon and myself? They are briefly this: I don't believe that the United States is meeting its responsibilities to itself and to those around the world who look to it for leadership. Now, why do I say that? I say it because I don't believe that we can possibly be satisfied as Americans with the rate of growth in our economy. We are using today only 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills. We have seen a sharp decline in agricultural income. We have not maintained a rate of increase in education necessary to provide the best educated citizens in the world. We have permitted our influence and prestige to decline in Latin America, Africa and Asia."", 'Now, what does prestige mean? Prestige means power and influence, and our ability to persuade people to follow our leadership. That is what is involved in this dispute. The question of whether America represents as strong and vigorous an image as it did years ago goes to the security of everyone who lives in Libertyville. You have to decide as Americans whether you believe what we are doing now is good enough or whether you take the view that we must do better. That is what separates Mr. Nixon and myself.', 'He campaigns on the slogan, ""We\'ve never had it so good."" He says our prestige is the highest in history. He says our strength is growing. He says that everything that must be done is being done in good measure. I want to make it very clear that I could not disagree more, and I say that not as a Democrat, but as a concerned citizen of this country. I believe if America is going to maintain its position in the world, if we are going to maintain our freedom, if we are going to maintain the peace, if we are going to prevent the balance of power in the world from shifting from us to the Communists, we are going to have to do much better, we are going to have to set before this country its unfinished business. We are going to have to go to work again. We are going to have to build in this country a strong and vital society that spreads its influence around the world. I don\'t think we have been doing it. I am not satisfied with our record, and that is the issue which you must determine. You have to decide as citizens of this community whether you are satisfied, whether you feel that the record of the last years is encouraging enough to you that you want to continue it, or whether you feel it is time to start again picking this country up and moving it forward. That is the issue that you have to decide. [Applause.]', ""This is a contest between the concerned and the comfortable, and you have to decide what you are, comfortable or concerned. Whether you look to the future or whether you wish to stand still. I want to make it very clear that the next 5 years are going to be decisive years in the life of our country. We are concerned in this community of Libertyville not only with your own life here, but with Africa, Asia, the far side of space, and the inside of men's minds. Because I know you are concerned, because I know you share the same view of a great country which must fulfill its destiny, I come to this community, the home of a distinguished American, Governor Stevenson, I come here in 1960 and ask your help in this campaign. I ask your support. I ask you to join me in setting before the American people the image of an America on the move, moving once again, fulfilling its expectations, spreading its influence, demonstrating that we represent the way of the future. On that basis, I ask your support. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
352,John F. Kennedy ,"October 25, 1960","['We live in the midst of a population explosion that is remaking the face of America. The country is filling up, recreation areas are overcrowded, our cities are jammed, our highways are clogged, and on the edges of our great cities the shopping center and ranchhouse have replaced the silo and the haystack until today more than a fourth of all Americans live in suburbs.', 'The question we have to ask ourselves is: What kind of children, what kind of future men and women, are we raising in our new American homes?', ""I think the answer will depend to a great extent on the kind of education we provide for them. And I say that today our children's schools are not good enough."", 'I am concerned, and deeply concerned, because too many children are attending double-shift schools, too many children are not given the incentive to finish high school, too many classrooms are overcrowded, too few teachers are at work in our school systems and too many teachers are underpaid.', 'Today the United States is short 132,000 classrooms, 135,000 teachers, and according to Health, Education, and Welfare Secretary Flemming these shortages directly or indirectly affect 10 million American children.', 'In 1960 we are scheduled to build 62,700 classrooms. But we need to build 64,500 classrooms just to keep pace with deteriorating classrooms and skyrocketing enrollment just to hold our own. Instead, we are falling further and further behind.', 'Some 200,000 teachers are underpaid. And some 95,000 teachers are now teaching on an emergency basis with substandard certificates.', ""It is inevitable that this all will vitally affect our children's future and our Nation's future."", 'But we have to ask ourselves the sober question: How can we pay for the schools our children need?', ""The budgets of the Nation's school districts, taken as a whole, have not been balanced since 1948. Last year they went $2½ billion deeper in debt. The property tax is already overburdened."", ""It seems perfectly clear that the State and local method of school financing is not equal to today's task."", 'It may have been - indeed, it was - in 1930 or 1940 or even 1950. But it is not today. And the reason why is also clear. It lies in the simple arithmetic of our exploding population.', 'Consider these astonishing figures:', 'In 1930, 25,678,015 children were enrolled in public schools.', 'By 1940, that number had actually declined - to 25,433,542.', 'And by 1950, the number enrolled had declined still further - to 25,111,427.', 'But look what has happened since. By 1958, the last year figures are available, the number of children enrolled in public schools has skyrocketed to 33,528,591. This is an increase of over 8 million, about a third again as many children as were in school only 8 years earlier.', 'What has happened is that the postwar baby crop has gone off to school and the schoolrooms just are not there. And this many new classrooms simply cannot be financed solely by State and local methods.', 'The property tax which supports our schools has about reached the breaking point. It has thrust an almost insupportable burden on the homeowner.', 'Right around here a man who owns a house worth between $16,000 and $20,000 is paying a property tax bill of from $400 to $500 a year.', 'Such taxes, together with the artificially high interest rate that has prohibitively raised the cost of financing a home, have actually put a penalty on home ownership and suburban living, the fastest growing way of American life.', 'Moreover, the need for more schools will continue to rise by 2 or 3 million every 2 years.', 'Their needs must be met. They can only be met with help from the Federal Government. The school crisis has gotten out of control. It is time we stopped talking about it and did something about it.', 'I favor Federal aid to education. I have spoken for it, worked for it, and most important of all I have voted for it in the U.S. Senate.', 'What about Mr. Nixon? At the well-publicized White House Conference on Education in 1955, Mr. Nixon said:', '\n  No one questions the critical need for new classroom construction * * * but an even more critical need is that of getting and keeping qualified teachers * * * the salaries paid to teachers * * * are nothing short of a national disgrace and if the situation is not corrected it could lead to a national disaster.\n', 'That is what Mr. Nixon said. But how did he vote?', ""More than 4 years later - 4 wasted years of conferences and studies and reports - Mr. Nixon had a chance to vote. On February 3, 1960, the Senate tied 44 to 44 on a measure to authorize the expenditure of $25 per school-age child for school construction and teachers' salaries. Mr. Nixon could have passed that measure by casting a vote."", 'But he did not vote. And then he made his position clear. He voted to break another tie and prevent reconsideration of the measure.', ""He said he favored raising teachers' pay. He said he favored building schools. But he voted against it."", 'His explanation was that he feared Federal control.', 'I say this is a false issue.', ""I say Mr. Nixon has deliberately raised a false issue, has created a political bogeyman to defeat Federal aid to education and mislead the people. And I'll tell you why it's a false issue."", ""The proposal to help pay teachers' salaries is nothing new. The Federal Government has been doing it for years."", 'In recent years, 3,300 local public school districts in areas affected by Federal activities around the Nation have received over $1 billion in Federal funds to help operate and maintain their schools - and no one has made a single complaint that Federal controls resulted.', 'The Land Ordinance of 1785 provided that the 16th section of each township of public lands be granted to the States for the benefit of common schools - and no one complained that Federal controls resulted.', 'The Merrill Act of 1862 gave Federal lands to the States to aid in establishing agricultural colleges, and they were established in every State - and no one complained that Federal controls resulted.', ""Moreover, today, if safeguards are needed they are easy to provide; the Congress can appropriate funds to be distributed to local school boards and used by the local boards to meet their own local needs, whether for teachers' salaries or school construction. Finally, in appropriating funds, Congress can explicitly declare that the Federal Government shall exercise no control whatsoever over textbook content, curriculum, teaching methods, the selection and tenure of teachers and administrators, and so on; it can specifically declare that authority over such matters is to remain in the hands of local boards."", 'This is a simple matter, and Mr. Nixon, with all his experience in the legislative process, knows it very well. And that is why I say he has raised an artificial, misleading false issue.', 'Last February when he cast his vote against the education bill, he vetoed $25 in school aid for every child in the Nation.', 'I predict that if he were elected President, he would veto it again.', ""And I also predict he won't get another chance."", ""We don't want our children going to school half time. We don't want our children half educated. We owe it to each individual child to give him the best education he is capable of absorbing. And we owe it to our Nation to educate our children, for the bedrock of democracy is a constantly rising level of the education of its citizens. And the cause of freedom around the world depends upon the strength of our democracy."", 'Thomas Jefferson said, ""If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.""', ""Two weeks from today you will vote. I urge you to vote for the party that is pledged to insure your children's education.""]"
353,John F. Kennedy ,"October 25, 1960","['Newspaper and network reports today, confirming the previously reported results of the latest USIA overseas survey, lead to three deeply disturbing conclusions:', '1. American prestige, essential to our influence and our security, has declined these last 8 years even more sharply than we realized.', '2. The present administration, contrary to the public interest and the request of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has withheld this report from the American people, just as it has withheld the text of the Nixon-Khrushchev talks and the Gaither report on our military decline. There are no facts here the Russians do not know - but there are facts here the American people deserve to know - and I am distressed that this administration has no confidence in the ability of the American people to face these facts frankly. Now that the press has revealed its essential contents, I again call upon the administration to make this report officially public.', '3. The Republican candidate, Mr. Nixon, has seriously misled the American people about this survey and its results in at least four important ways:', 'He asserted, when Senator Fulbright and I indicated this survey showed our prestige declining, that ""the facts simply aren\'t as stated."" It is now clear that the facts have been stated exactly as they were.', 'He asserted that ""This report was made many, many months ago, and related to the period immediately after Sputnik"" - the fall of 1957. It is now clear that the survey was made this summer, 1960, and related to the period immediately after the U-2 incident, the summit collapse, the Tokyo riots, and the height of Castro\'s anti-American frenzy.', 'He asserted that ""Communist prestige was at an all-time low and American prestige was at an all-time high."" It is now clear that our friends and neutrals alike regard Russia ahead in the race for world power today, and are even more convinced that the Communists will widen their lead over the next 10 years.', 'He asserted that ""American prestige will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."" It is now clear that our prestige is not based on what we say but what we do, relative to what our enemies do. Mr. Nixon has said many times that our confusion on U-2, the collapse of the summit, the cancellation of the President\'s trip to Tokyo, our policies on Cuba were all great American triumphs. We wish they were. But the survey unfortunately shows that, no matter how loudly or often these claims are made, our prestige was badly damaged by those events in the eyes of other governments, other peoples, and their papers.', 'In these four statements, Mr. Nixon has misstated the facts - either because he chose to misinform the public or because he was uninformed himself.', 'Possibly Mr. Nixon is so far removed from the operations of this administration that he did not know of this report. Possibly he is so uninformed on world affairs that he did not know our prestige had declined. A man who does not know what we did in Guatemala, how the gold market operates, whether our commitment extends beyond Formosa, when the U-2 flights were canceled, and why we lost half of Indochina should perhaps be excused for not knowing our prestige has declined.', 'But all he had to do was read the headlines in our own press: Anti-American riots in Japan, Panama, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela - the weakening of pro-American forces in Laos, Iraq, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia, Guinea, Ghana, and the Congo. The Associated Press this month featured an excellent survey by Relman Morin entitled ""U.S. Prestige Is Damaged in Asia"" - citing our image in that continent as that of a ""well-meaning but confused and confusing giant."" To the Asian, this report said, the administration\'s policy on Cuba ""was a clear case of American indecision, fumbling, and possible weakness."" The events of last summer, the survey reported - the U-2, summit, and Toyko chain of events - ""appear to have shown that the United States was weak, indecisive, incapable of evaluating trends, anticipating developments and formulating action to meet them.""', 'Perhaps Mr. Nixon has read these reports but considers the matter unimportant. But prestige is important. We face a dangerous and powerful enemy. We do not want to face him alone.', 'Today the Sino-Soviet bloc is surrounded largely by nations opposed to communism - and that is a major advantage for the West, militarily, politically, and in every other way. That is an advantage we want to maintain. I do not say that the balance of power is determined by a popularity contest. But I do say that our prestige affects our ability to influence these nations, to strengthen the forces of freedom within them, to convince them of which way lie peace and security.', ""It is not merely a coincidence that the Communists obtained their first foothold in Latin America, their first foothold in the Middle Fast, and their first foothold in Africa at the very same time our prestige was declining in those areas. And it is not merely a popularity contest when our prestige is no longer high enough to win a majority of U.N. members to oppose Red China's admission - when we cannot convince the OAS Conference to condemn Castro by name - and when the Baghdad Pact collapses without a single Arab state favorable to the West."", '""We intend to be on the winning side,"" a Singapore merchant told the AP survey. ""Therefore, any setbacks for American prestige naturally affect our thinking.""', 'We in the United States intend to be on the winning side also. And any setbacks in our prestige should naturally affect our thinking as well - our choice of policies - our choice of leadership. And I cannot believe the American people - once they are given the facts - will want leadership that either is misinformed on these facts or attempts to misinform the American people about them.', 'I hope that, if he has not already done so, Mr. Nixon will read the USIA report. I hope he will read these surveys of our prestige in our own press, and the reports of our prestige in the foreign press. And I hope he will see, for example, how the figure of Uncle Sam is portrayed in the cartoons of many foreign newspapers and magazines. Once he was a stern, forceful, but friendly figure. Now, in too many of these cartoons - even in friendly countries - he is pictured as fat, weary, or greedy - confused and defensive - or talking tough with little to back it up.', 'I do not say these cartoons are either fair or accurate. But they do represent the image of America to much of the world. And if we are to save the peace and rebuild our security, we must remold that symbol of Uncle Sam as the forceful spokesman of a great and generous nation.', 'We cannot do this under a leader who stuck his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face and said: ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we are ahead of you in color television.""', 'We cannot rebuild our prestige under a leader who tells us it is now at an all-time high. I think it is time to trust the American people - to face up to the facts - and to decide what we must do. I think we must move in the spirit of Patrick Henry, when he told Virginia patriots in 1775:', '\n  It is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of the siren * * * [but] for my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth - to know the worst - and then to provide for it.\n']"

[Applause.] This is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself and in a very real sense [response from the audience] - in a very real sense it is not merely a contest between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. It is a contest between all those who look to the past, between all those who wish to stand still, and those who wish to move ahead. [Applause.]"", 'Here in the State of Michigan, in this great industrial State, it is between those who are the leaders of the Republican Party who have spilled this country into three recessions in the last 8 years, who have opposed every piece of progressive legislation for the benefit of our people, for care to the aged, employment for our people, minimum wage, education for our children, better opportunity for all of our citizens, it is between that group on the one hand and those who want to pick this country up and move it forward on the other.

Are you as a citizen of this country and a citizen of Michigan pleased to know in the most dangerous time in the life of our country that we are only using 53 percent of our steel capacity?

I have made the charge in this campaign as a concerned citizen that our position in the world is not as strong as it was, that the relative balance of power in the world is not shifting in our direction and that those who once looked to us as the strongest power in the world now begin to wonder.', 'This administration has denied that charge. Mr. Nixon says our prestige is higher than it has ever been in history. [Response from the audience.] And now we find out - and now we find out that the U.S. Information Service this summer polled 10 countries around the world and asked them these questions: ""Who do you think is first today, scientifically, the United States or the Soviet Union?"" Then they asked them, ""Who do you think will be first in 1970, militarily and scientifically."" And a majority of the people, each 1 of the 10 countries, with the exception of 1, a majority thought the Soviet Union would be first. That is what this administration has done to the image of this country. [Response from the audience.]', 'Now, people who used to look to us, who used to follow our leadership, who joined with us in a battle against the Communists around the world, now begin to wonder does the future belong to them or to us. I believe it belongs to us. [Applause.] Mr. Khrushchev says with confidence that our children and grandchildren will be Communists. I think we should say with the same confidence that his children will be free. But he looks to the future he looks to 1970 and 1980 and beyond. He believes that the time is on his side, that the United States is standing still and he is moving forward. The Republican candidate tells us in 1960 that all is well, and perhaps that fulfills his obligation for this election. But I say we have an obligation to the future and we are not meeting that obligation today. [Applause.]', 'Do you know in the next 10 years, by 1970, and we should look to the future and so should the next administration, by 1970 we will have 208 million people in this country? They will be coming into the labor market looking for jobs at the rate of 3 million people a year, and they will be coming into the labor market at a time when automation takes over in every industry, when machines take the jobs of men. The next 10 years will be a decade of opportunity, but it will also be a decade of challenge, for if we are going to maintain an increase in the standard of living for our people by 1970 we are going to need a gross national product of three-fourths of a trillion dollars. We are going to have to grow at the rate of 5 percent a year to keep you working and keep your children working. And to date, in the last 8 years, we have averaged a little more than 2 percent, half of that of Western Germany. In the last 9 months we have not increased at all in our growth. We have dropped back, and that goes to your future employment in this city, in the State of Michigan and the chance for your children to work in the next 10 years. That is what economic growth is all about. [Applause.]', 'In the next 10 years in this country we are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs every week for the next 10 years to maintain full employment. To house our population we are going to have to build twice the number of homes we now build, and that is why it is tragic when this year after this administration vetoed the last two housing bills, we built 30 percent less homes than a year ago. What does that mean for the winter of 1961? When you make your judgment a week from next Tuesday, you have to make your judgment not between just two candidates, but between their concept of the future, the security that they bring to our country, their vision of a great and strong and growing country, or an administration which stands still and can run in 1960 on slogans which have no connection with reality. [Applause.]', 'We are going to have to build more schools than we have ever built before. We are going to have to build as many college dormitories and classrooms in the next 10 years to educate all your boys and girls who want to go to college and are entitled to go. We are going to have to build as many as we built in the last 200 years. [Applause.] And we are going to have to use the talent of every boy and girl. I don\'t like to read, as an American, statistics which say when a Negro baby and a white baby are born side by side that that white baby has twice the chance to finish high school as the Negro baby, three times the chance to get into college, one-fourth as much chance of being unemployed, three times as much chance to own his own house. I want to see America where there are no statistics, Negro and white, but all men, regardless. [Applause.] I want it to be clear that today we are not meeting our responsibilities to the future. Twenty percent of our industrial capacity is unused. More than 5 percent of our labor force is out of work. Here in Detroit, in Pittsburgh, Fort Worth, San Diego, and Seattle, we see the effects of this administration\'s lack of leadership. Mr. Nixon does not mention these facts. Neither does he mention the future responsibilities, for his is the party of the past, the party of memory, the party of the status quo. Applause.] Mr. Nixon represents the party of the Republicans, of McKinley and Taft and Harding and Coolidge and Landon and Dewey. [Response from the audience.] Every one of those candidates brings up an image of a man who sits still. Even the slogans they used sat still, to ""Stand pat with McKinley."" [Applause.] Do you know what a White House usher said about Calvin Coolidge? He comes from my own State. He said, ""No man in the 42 years I was at the White House ever slept so much.""', 'We are going to need a President and a party that can move. [Applause.] Look who the Democrats ran and look at their slogans: Woodrow Wilson, the new freedom; Franklin D. Roosevelt, the New Deal [applause]; Harry Truman, the Fair Deal; programs for the people. [Applause.] And today when Mr. Nixon tells us that all is well, that we never had it so good [response from the audience], he wants us to be satisfied with the record of the last 8 years. But I look not to the past, but to the future. What is going to happen in this country in the next 10 years? What must we do? What are the goals of our society? What is the unfinished business for Americans? How do we build a strong society here, maintain the peace, attract those people around the world who wish to be free? That is the responsibility and mandate of the people of this country. [Applause.]', 'Twenty years ago this city of Detroit was known as the arsenal of democracy. That name spread across the entire world. And I think the time has come again to make this city of Detroit, this State of Michigan, this United States of ours, to make it the workshop of freedom, to build the kind of strength [applause] - to build here the kind of strength, the kind of society, to demonstrate the kind of vigor which will cause people all over the world to say ""There is the road that I wish to trod. There is the society which has combined strength and freedom. There is the way of the future. There is the high noon of tomorrow.""', ""The Communist system is as old as Egypt. It is bound to corrupt and decline. But we have to do our job, and I come here to Michigan and ask your support in the election of November 8, to ask you [applause] give us in the next 10 days your voice, your hand, your heart, and let's start this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

John Swainson, Congressman Jim O'Hara, Pat McNamara, Mennen Williams, ladies and gentlemen, let me say that I am delighted to be back here in Michigan, mostly because I am running in this State with distinguished public servants, your Senator Pat McNamara, who sits next to me in the U.S. Senate and votes for Michigan and the public interest, and I know he is going to be reelected by a large majority in this State. [Applause.] By your Congressman Jim O'Hara, who has served this district and served the United States. He is the kind of young, vigorous leader that this country needs, and I am confident that this district will endorse his record, and John Swainson, who has fought for this country in war and peace, and who I am confident will be elected the Governor of Michigan. [Applause.]"", 'We are now going into the last 13 days of this important presidential campaign. Two weeks from today the people of Michigan and the people of the United States will make their judgment as to what they want their country to be. I want to make it very clear that there are sharp differences between Mr. Nixon and myself. They go to the future of this State, they go to the future of the country, they go to the future of freedom all around the world.', 'Mr. Nixon runs on a program ""We\'ve never had it so good."" He was nominated by a political party, the Republicans, who have opposed progress for the last 25 years. [Applause.] I would like to ask Mr. Nixon one single piece of new, progressive legislation, benefiting the people that the Republicans have put forward in the last 25 years. Ninety percent of the Republican Party in 1935 voted against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour, and 80 percent of them voted against $1.25 in 1960. The fact of the matter is that this State and the United States cannot sit still in the 1960\'s. You are going to have to find and we are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years in order to provide full employment, and we are going to have to do that at a time when machines are taking the place of men. Do you believe as an American citizen of this State and country that we can be led by a political party, the Republicans, who have stood still, who have opposed progress at every turn? Or don\'t you agree we have to move forward again in Michigan and across the country? [Response from the audience. Applause.]', 'One of the arguments and one of the issues which divides Mr. Nixon and myself is the question of our position in the world, which goes to the hope of peace and goes to the security of the United States. If people in Latin America and Africa and Asia and Western Europe ever come to the conclusion that the future belongs to the Communists and not to us, then our hope of leading a great world alliance begins to fade. That is why this question of American prestige is so important.', 'Mr. Nixon has stated on many occasions that he believes that our prestige is at an alltime high, and that of the Communists at an alltime low. Now, yesterday the newspapers carried the report of a survey made by the U.S. Government in 10 countries of the world, and they asked them the question, ""Do you believe the Soviet Union or the United States is first in military power and science?"" And a majority of the people in 10 countries said the Soviet Union was first.', 'Now can we possibly hope to lead a world which begins to think that we are losing our influence and our power, that begins to think the tide of history is moving in the direction of the Communists? I believe that this report should be made public. I believe that the American people in 1960 are entitled to the truth, the truth with the bark off, the facts of the matter. [Applause.]', 'The fact of the matter is that either Mr. Nixon was uninformed about the report or he has misled us, because in the last debate he said that this report dealt with a survey made in 1957 after sputnik, and now yesterday it was revealed that these reports were made this summer. They dealt with the time after the U-2 incident, and they go to the question of the future of this country as the leader of the free world. And now we learn that this administration, which has been in the leadership of this country for the last 8 years, of which Mr. Nixon has been a part, now finds itself and our country in a position in the world where people begin to wonder what the future holds for us and for them. I believe the people of this country are strong enough and tough enough and courageous enough to know the truth, and when the truth is told to us, this country is going to make up its mind as a people that it is time we start moving forward again. That is the question at issue. [Applause.]', 'You have to decide as citizens one question on November 8: Are you satisfied? Do you believe in Michigan and the country that we are moving ahead with vigor? Do you believe that the Republican Party is capable of meeting the problems which will face us in the sixties? [Response from the audience.] If you do, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] But if you agree with me that it is time that Michigan and the United States picked itself up and started looking to the future, on that basis I ask your help on November 8. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.] I come here tonight as the standardbearer for the oldest political party on earth, but I come as the standardbearer for the youngest party on earth, and that is the Democratic Party. [Applause.] And I stand here with your mayor, with my distinguished friend and colleague of 14 years in the Congress of the United States, your Congressman who speaks for this district, and who also speaks for the United States, Ted Machrowicz [applause], with Pat McNamara, who sits next to me in the U.S. Senate and speaks for Michigan and speaks for the country, and speaks for progress, and who I am confident you will reelect to the U.S. Senate on November 8. [Applause.] And with John Swainson, who carries on a great tradition of your distinguished Governor, Mennen Williams, and will lead Michigan through the 1960\'s, when progress will be needed. I come here tonight and ask your support in this campaign. You cannot be alive today, you cannot be a citizen of this State, you cannot be a citizen of the United States, without knowing that what we are now doing is not good enough. Mr. Nixon may run around the country saying ""You never had it so good"" [response from the audience], but I want him to make that speech in Michigan tomorrow. [Response from the audience.]', ""On November 15 of this year there will be more automobiles in inventory than ever before in our history. This year in September we built 29 percent less homes than last year. Can you believe that an administration which has permitted economic strength of the United States to decline, which has permitted our prestige and image around the world to begin to fade - do you think that candidate or that party which has stood still for 25 years can lead the United States in the 1960's? [Response from the audience.] I do not."", 'I stand here tonight not saying that there are new and easy solutions to the problems which disturb our tranquillity, but I can tell you that I am a member of a party which has believed in progress, and I run against a party which has opposed every single piece of progressive legislation which this country has tried to pass in the last 25 years, minimum wage, social security, housing, housing for the aged, and all the rest. The Republican Party has said no, and we have said yes, and we are going to say yes on November 8. [Applause.]', 'This is an important election because the presidency of the United States is an important office, and what is at stake is not merely the position of our own country, our own strength, our own vitality, our own energy. What is at stake is the entire cause of freedom itself. In the words of the Polish national anthem, as long as you live, as long as the United States lives, so the hope of freedom all around the globe continues to exist. When we stand still, when we begin to fade - they want you to sit down here [applause], you see, the people run this party. [Laughter.] You tell us what you want and we will do it. [Applause.]', 'Well, now, we will just finish up what I was going to say, and that is this, and we will speak to everybody around here. The function of the President of the United States, the President of the United States, is to build a strong society here, to maintain full employment, to educate our children, to provide security for our aged citizens, to provide justice for our people, to build an image of a society on the move, so that people around the world who wonder what the future holds for them, who wonder which road they should take, they decide, ""We want to go with the United States; they represent the future.""', 'As long as the United States lives, so freedom lives. As long as we build our strength, as long as we are on the move, as long as we are a progressive society, then the future belongs to us and not to Mr. Khrushchev. [Applause.]', ""My disagreement with this administration has been that they have permitted the United States to fade as an image of strength around the world. Every recent poll taken abroad shows that more and more people begin to think that the future belongs to the Communists and not to freedom. I don't. I think the future belongs to freedom I think the future belongs to those who want to be free, and that includes the great majority of the population of the world. But we have to give them leadership. We have to show that freedom can be strong. We have to show the people of Eastern Europe that the struggle is not over, that our brightest days are ahead, that we do not recognize the present situation, and that all people someday will be free. That is the basic objective of the American society. [Applause.]"", 'During the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind."" Now I think in the revolution of 1960, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. We serve not only ourselves; we serve others, those who wish to follow our example. And in order to serve them, in order to be faithful to our trust, in order to hold out the lamp of hope to all those now subjugated who hope someday to be free, we have to build a strong society here. We have to demonstrate that in any contest with the Communist system, that we are going to win. I am not satisfied as an American to be first, if, first, but, first when, first, sometimes, first perhaps. I want to see the United States first, period. And that is our objective.

It is raining on Vice President Nixon today, and we don't mind the rain. We welcome it. We are ready to go to work. [Applause.]"", 'One of the reasons why I am glad to come to Michigan is because I am running with distinguished, vigorous, progressive Democrats. [Applause.] One of the great things about being a Democrat is you don\'t have to do what Mr. Nixon does, who keeps saying that parties don\'t mean anything. He says, ""I am not really a Republican, that is, I don\'t think I am."" Until he goes down to Arizona, and Barry Goldwater takes him in the room and puts the rubber hose to him and finally he says, ""Yes, I am a Republican."" [Applause.] But I am a Democrat every day of the year, and I run as a Democrat, and I run in the succession of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon is the intellectual heir to McKinley, Dewey, Landon, Coolidge, Harding, Taft, and the rest. [Applause.] And I don\'t believe in 1960 the American people are going to turn over the destinies of this State and the destinies of the United States to a party and leader who stands still, who runs on a slogan, ""We\'ve never had it so good,"" and at a time when all over the State and all over United States, and over the world the call is for action, the call is for movement forward, the call is for progress.', ""On that basis I come here today in the rain and ask your help. [Applause.] We have many opportunities before us in the 1960's and many responsibilities. One of the things we have to do is make our children the best educated children in the world. [Applause.] Any time your child does not get a good education by good, well-paid competent teachers, he can never make it up. His chances of getting a good job are not as good as they would have been, his chance of living out his life in security is not as good as it would have been. That is why as Americans who are responsible for maintaining a free society we have to have the best educated citizens in the world. Do you know that 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college? We can't waste that talent. They might have been the best and most vigorous and intellectually advanced citizens we have, but they never get to college. Either they don't have the money or they have to go to work, or they haven't an opportunity. We want to have the kind of country where they do have the opportunity, where they do have the chance. And I believe it incumbent upon the State government, the community here, and this community has raised its property taxes again and again to maintain education, and the National Government - they all have a responsibility."", ""When the Northwest Ordinance was signed at the end of the 18th century, which involved Michigan, one out of every 16 acres was put aside for education. I believe in 1960 [laughter] - I believe - it is going to be about 30 more seconds and then I will stop. [Response from the audience.] I believe in 1960 we are going to have to provide scholarships for those young men and women, we are going to have to provide loans for them, loans for our colleges, well-paid teachers and good constructed schools. That is what we are going to do. That is only one of the responsibilities we are going to meet in the 1960's. We are going to move this country. We are going to go ahead. We are going to move Michigan. We are going to provide jobs for our people and an opportunity for all of them to participate in our lives of a prosperous and growing country."", 'So on that basis, as one who looks to the future, as one who has the greatest confidence in this country, as one who believes that we can win this election, I come and ask your help.

[Response from the audience.]', 'Housing? He put out a statement 3 weeks ago in New York praising the Housing Act of 1949. He said it seems to be working very well. He neglected to add as a Congressman he voted against it.

Michigan and the country has to move. We know it in Warren. We know it in the country. We know it around the world.

[Laughter.] The point of the matter is I want him to come tomorrow to Michigan and tell the people of Michigan what he is doing and what this administration is doing to put people to work. What plans have they had for automation? This administration has never discussed it. And yet do you know in this State and country, we are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week, every week, for the next 10 years, to get full employment, at a time when machines are taking the jobs of men.', 'Now, this community knows the problem as well as any community in the United States. In your two arsenals, you have seen employment go from 10,000 to 2,000. This area of the State depends on the Jupiter, and the Jupiter missile program may be coming to an end. We have to find jobs in Michigan and we have to find jobs in the United States, and unless we have people working we are not able to maintain our position any place around the world. [Applause.]', 'One of the programs which would help this area was a program which was eliminated in 1953, which provided that defense contracts would go to those areas if they could meet the bid where there was high unemployment. Senator Knowland led the fight against it on the floor of the Senate and it was thrown out, and I believe that defense manpower policy No.4, as it was known, should be reinvoked, so those areas of the country which have high unemployment we could use our defense contracts to put people to work as well as make weapons. [Applause.]', 'In addition, we want to pass the area redevelopment bill, to attract industry in there, to plan our defense planning on a long-range basis, so we take advantage not only of the skills of the people in the area, but we also recognize their needs. The overnight cancellation of contracts which leaves thousands of men stranded on the beach - I believe we can do better under a good administration, a new administration which is closer to the people, which the Democratic Party is.', ""So I come to Michigan. This State knows the issues of this campaign. Senior citizens, Senator McNamara is chairman of the Senate Committee on Senior Citizens. I am vice chairman. We are both aging fast. [Laughter.] But this administration, the same administration that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties, voted 95 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security. If there is anyone here who has a mother or father who is over 65, if they get sick and they are living with you, do you know before they can get medical assistance under the program signed by the President, you have to prove that they are medically indigent? They have to sign an oath, a pauper's oath, that they haven't any money, nor you, and then they can get assistance. [Response from the audience.] What did we propose. We proposed putting it under social security at a cost of 3 cents a day per person, and then when they are 65, and then when they need assistance and then when they are sick, maybe 1, through 3 or 4 months, then you get the assistance that you contributed to. Which is the best way? [Response from the audience.] The way we suggested. [Applause.]"", ""Rain or shine, good days or bad days, we are going to continue to tell the truth about Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party. [Applause.] We are going to continue to tell how they have presided over the gradual lessening of American strength and prestige around the world, and how they are obliged to hide the report from the people of what has happened to our position around the world. While Mr. Nixon campaigns on a program that our prestige has never been higher, in his own State Department there are reports which show that Mr. Nixon is either wholly misinformed or unwilling to tell the truth. Whichever it is, on November 8, we won't have to worry about it any more.

Kennedy ,"October 26, 1960","['* * * We know enough about the USIA survey of our prestige overseas to know that one of the key questions related not to how we stood in 1960 compared to the Soviets, but who would be ahead in 1970. While the decline in our prestige caused more of those interviewed to give the Soviet Union an edge in power today, they agreed with disturbing unanimity that the Soviet Union would be the most powerful nation on earth in 1970.', 'The rest of the world is thinking in terms of the future. The underdeveloped world, looking ahead to the dawning of a happier day, is thinking in terms of the future. Mr. Khrushchev, when he boasts that his grandchildren will rule our grandchildren, is thinking in terms of the future. He is prepared to sacrifice present comfort for future glory, for he knows that, if the rest of the world believes the tide is going with the Communists, if they believe that Moscow can meet their needs better than Washington, if they find that Russia is growing stronger than we are economically and militarily, then the world balance of power will shift decisively his way.', 'The question is: Is America thinking in terms of the future? Are we willing to match the Russian sacrifice of the present for the future, or must we sacrifice our future in order to enjoy the present?', 'In the last hectic weeks of the campaign, it is understandable perhaps that our attention would be centered on where we stand in 1960. The Republican candidate tells us repeatedly that in 1960 all is well, that our prestige is at an alltime high, that our prosperity is unprecedented, that we are ahead militarily, scientifically, economically, educationally. Perhaps that fulfills his obligation in this election. But I say we also have an obligation to the next generation, and we are not meeting that obligation today.', 'We cannot meet that obligation unless we think now in terms of 1970. For this will be a wholly different nation in 1970 with wholly different needs, and we must begin now to meet those needs.', 'In 1970, our population will have grown to 208 million people. The children now overcrowding our schools will be coming onto the labor market looking for jobs at the rate of 3 million a year. Automation will be a reality in almost every industry, with machines replacing men all over the country and bringing more goods to more people all over the world.', 'The next 10 years, in short, will be a decade of opportunity. But they will also be a decade of challenge and effort. For if we are to maintain an advancing standard of living for this growing population, we will have to increase our gross national product by 1970 to three-fourths of a trillion dollars, and that requires a rate of growth no less than 5 percent a year. We are not growing at that rate today.', 'If we are to secure full employment for this growing labor force, we will have to find 20,000 new jobs a week. We are not finding those jobs today.', 'To house our growing population, we will have to build double the homes we are now building. To educate a growing number of children for a growing number of professional and technical specialties, we will need to recruit more new teachers for our public schools than are presently in service, build more college classrooms and dormitories than we have built in the last 200 years, and spend nearly twice as much on education as we are spending today.', 'These are only the minimum requirements - our minimum responsibility. But it is made all the more difficult by the hard fact that, under the spell of Republican complacency, we have been failing that responsibility to the next generation for the last 8 years, and it is time we got on with the job.', 'We are not meeting that responsibility when our economy is slipping into its third recession in 6 years. We are not meeting the needs of the future when 20 percent of our industrial capacity is idle. We are not meeting them when over 5 percent of the labor force is unemployed, and when the rate is even higher in every major industrial city - here in Detroit, and in Pittsburgh, and in Fort Worth, and in San Diego, and Seattle.', 'Mr. Nixon does not mention these present facts. Neither does he mention our future responsibilities. For his is the party of the past, the party of memory, the party of the status quo. His is the party that wanted to stand pat with McKinley, return to normalcy with Harding, keep cool with Coolidge, repeal social security with Landon - and says you never had it so good with Richard M. Nixon.', 'But the Democratic Party never says: You never had it so good. Woodrow Wilson said we could do better with the New Freedom, and he looked to the future. Franklin Roosevelt said we could do better with the New Deal, and he looked to the future. Harry Truman said we could do better with the Fair Deal, and he looked to the future.', 'And today, when Mr. Nixon tells us all is well, when he tells us we never had it so good, when he wants us to be satisfied with the record of the last 8 years, you and I look to the future - we look at 1970, when the rest of the world thinks we will be far behind - and we are not satisfied.', ""I'm not satisfied to have steel less than 60 percent of capacity, and autos around 60 percent of capacity. I'm not satisfied to have half a million more people on unemployment insurance than a year ago. I'm not satisfied to see bankruptcies at the highest rate since World War II. I'm not satisfied to see freight-car loadings at a postwar low. I'm not satisfied to see housing starts down 28 percent since last year. I'm not satisfied to see the gross national product off at an annual rate of $2 billion in the last quarter."", 'For all this means we are not doing the job; we are not meeting our responsibilities to the future; we are not assuring American leadership in the decade ahead.', 'I think the time has come to start doing the job, and doing it full time. Twenty years ago this city was known as the arsenal of democracy. That name spread to the whole country. I think the time has come to make this city, and the whole country, the workshop of freedom - freedom today, freedom tomorrow, and freedom in 1970 and for all generations to come.']"
360,John F. Kennedy ,"October 26, 1960","['The present administration has consistently followed a policy of suppressing important public information. It has denied the people their right to know the truth.', 'When a congressional committee tried to find out why high bids were accepted and low bids rejected on certain Government procurement contracts, the information was refused.', 'When the Comptroller General tried to find out whether our economic and technical assistance programs were being efficiently administered in India, Laos, Pakistan, Bolivia, and other countries, the information was refused.', 'The Defense Department and its three branches, the State Department, the International Cooperation Administration, and many other executive agencies have repeatedly refused the public free access to public information.', 'Shortly after it took office, the present administration extended the authority to classify documents as secret and confidential to hundreds of agencies, including many which did not need it - the Lincoln Sesquicentennial Commission, the Outdoor Recreation Resources Commission, and the Civil War Centennial Commission. Since 1946, the executive branch of the Government has drawn a curtain of secrecy on more than a million cubic feet of documents. Indeed, in recent years the administration has classified three times as many documents as were classified in the entire previous history of American Government.', 'The chairman of a special House Subcommittee on Government Information, Congressman John Moss, warned in a report to the House: ""Security has been perverted as a tool for the manipulation of information. Nonsecurity information has been withheld solely on grounds that it could be embarrassing.""', 'And J. R. Wiggins, an ex-president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, said, ""Our secrecy has frustrated the work of our scientists, complicated the task of our Defense personnel, concealed delay and inefficiency, hidden the consequences of budgetary limitations, and prevented the healthy operation of public opinion.""', 'In America, the people, if they are armed with the truth, can be trusted to make the right decision. The administration does not trust the people. It has kept the unpleasant truth from them in order to convince them that, as Mr. Nixon says, they never had it so good.', 'The latest example is the suppression of the recent U.S. Information Agency report on our prestige abroad.', 'The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Fulbright, asked last week that this report be made public. He charged that this secret report contained a recent worldwide survey showing that American prestige abroad had declined and that the administration was suppressing it for political purposes during this campaign.', 'During our fourth television debate last Friday night, Mr. Nixon replied that, in his words, ""The facts simply are not as stated."" He said that the report in question was one made ""many, many months ago""; indeed that it related to the time 3 years ago when the Russians first launched sputnik.', ""But now we learn, not from the administration, but from vigilant newspapers and networks, that the secret report is not 3 years old but a few weeks old, and that it shows an almost unanimous opinion abroad that the Soviet Union is the world's leading military power. That is the report which was suppressed, at a time when Mr. Nixon was campaigning on the theme that our prestige has never been higher."", 'It is bad enough to suppress the truth about procurement contracts or foreign aid expenditures to conceal waste or inefficiency or worse.', 'It is far more dangerous to hide the truth about our position abroad - and to hide it for political purposes.', 'The administration is afraid to tell the people the truth about their situation.', 'I call upon Mr. Nixon to make the secret report public, and to explain to the people how in the face of its evidence he can continue to pretend that our prestige is at an alltime high; and to explain why a public report, paid for with public funds and containing information important to the public, was not made public until its concealment was exposed.', 'Perhaps this incident of political coverup will remind us that it is time to face, not hide, the facts about our situation, both at home and abroad.', ""If we are to make the sacrifices and summon the courage that are necessary to meet the challenge of the 1960's, we need to know the truth, the bad news as well as the good."", 'We must hold steadfastly to the Biblical injunction: ""Ye shall know the truth and the truth will make ye free.""']"
361,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen - let me first speak and then you - OK, OK. You and I are in agreement. We agree. We agree. We agree. Then you come next.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, my colleague, former colleague, in the Senate, Senator Lehman, my present colleague, Mayor Wagner, my distinguished friend, my present colleagues in the Congress, Mrs. Kelly, our National Committeewoman, from New York; and an old friend and colleague of mine, Congressman Anfuso; Congressman Abe Multer, with whom I served in the Congress for 14 years; of course, your own Congressman, Manny Celler, a great representative of this district; Jim Farley, the former Postmaster General; Mike Prendergast, the State chairman - we have them all here tonight - Congressman Keogh, from Brooklyn, Arthur Levitt, distinguished State officials, Congressmen and Senators, assemblymen, anyone else who wants to be introduced - hold up their hands - after November 8 - ladies and gentlemen, I will make it brief, because I know you have been standing for some time. This is an important contest for an important office. This is a great country of ours, and the President of the United States is the spokesman for our national interest and our national purpose, and after 14 years in the Congress, and after campaigning in every State in the Union, and after looking at this country, I have come to the conclusion which you have, that it is time America started moving forward again. [Applause.]', 'The basic issue which separates Mr. Nixon and myself is that in these turbulent and trying days, he has chosen to run on a domestic platform that we have never had it so good, and he runs on an international program that our prestige is the highest it has ever been in the world, in spite of the fact that his own State Department and our State Department in their surveys taken this summer, which this administration refuses to release, shows that our prestige has gone steadily down under this administration. We are going to reverse that. We are going to move the country forward. [Applause.]', 'Franklin D. Roosevelt, in accepting the second presidential nomination before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, Philadelphia, said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'Let me give you five ways that Mr. Nixon is frozen in the ice of his own indifference. No.1, we have the highest cost of living this week in the history of the United States, and in the last few months, while costs have been going up, the wage level average has been going down. Who are the people that are hit? No.1, those who are retired, those who live on an average of $72 a month under social security. When we put forward a proposal this summer to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security, we had one Republican vote in the Senate, and when the vote was announced Time magazine said Mr. Nixon turned and smiled. He will not be smiling on November 8. [Applause.]', ""Secondly, because of the high interest rates of this administration, if you buy a $10,000 home today on a 30-year mortgage, your interest rate on the loan is $3,300 more than it was 8 years ago. This administration vetoed two housing bills last year. Mr. Nixon voted against the housing bill of 1949 which is the basis of all subsequent housing bills. I don't care what pronouncement he comes out in this campaign. The Republican Party and Mr. Nixon have opposed progressive housing legislation for our people. [Applause.]"", 'Three, who is the next group hit by the high cost of living. Those are who are paid a substandard wage. In the midthirties, 90 percent of the Republican Party voted against a 25-cent minimum wage. This summer, as your Congressman can tell you, in the House of Representatives, 90 percent of the Republicans voted against a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour, $50 a week for a 40-hour week, for a business that makes more than a million dollars a year, and Mr. Nixon called it extreme. He is frozen in the ice of his own indifference if I ever saw a Republican candidate who was. [Applause.]', 'Four, if you want to send your child to college today, it costs you $1,300 more than it cost you in 1952. Last year we passed a bill in the Congress which would provide loans to colleges for building dormitories, which would be repaid at a low rate of interest, for dormitories and classrooms. The Republican Administration vetoed it. Any time this administration or any other administration stands in the way of educating our children, giving them the best education in the world they disqualify themselves, in my opinion, from leading the United States in the sixties. [Applause.]', 'Fifth, and finally, and finally the question of which candidate stands for opportunity to all Americans regardless of their race, their creed or their color. In 1953 and 1954, the Republican Party controlled the White House, the Senate and the House, a majority in all bodies. Not one civil rights bill ever saw the light of day in either the House or the Senate. In the last 4 years, we passed two bills. I believe we should do better. Congressman Celler was more responsible for those bills, probably, than any man in the Congress. They came out of his committee which he headed. He is now chairman of a committee which I set up to implement the Democratic platform. Mr. Nixon is chairman of a committee to end discrimination in Government contracts. Two suits, two suits, in all that time. He sends Barry Goldwater through the South saying, ""I don\'t mean any of this,"" and sends Senator Scott of Pennsylvania through the North saying, ""Oh, we are all for civil rights. We are for opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race, their religion, their region, their national origin. We want everyone to have a fair chance to develop his talents. In these five ways, in my opinion, Mr. Nixon and I differ. In these five ways, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party differ. And these are only symptoms, only representatives of the great differences between our parties. Everything that Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and Harry Truman tried to do, the Republican Party stood against, and in 1960, in a great time of decision, I come to Brooklyn, I come to this district, and ask your help in picking this country up and moving it forward again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
362,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. First, let me say that you are my type of Democrat. [Applause.] My friend, Bob Wagner, General Farley, Frank O'Connor, Pat Clancy - the Irish are very big out here. [Applause.] Jimmy Delaney - they really run a balanced ticket [laughter], Lester Holtzman, and Bernard Helfat, who is running for Congress, and Joe Addabbo, who is running for the Congress [applause], and our campaign manager in Queens, Any Moray [applause], assemblymen, and others who wish to run but on another occasion, ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my thanks to all of you for staying so late. We have not been playing golf. We have been campaigning. [Applause.] We have been traveling through Brooklyn, and now tonight we are here. Just so you will know if you decide to run for the Presidency, what it is like, we will go to Bethlehem, Pa., to carry the message. But you were nice to come here tonight. I appreciate your staying. I think you come here because you feel like I do, that after 24 years, it is time Queens went Democratic in a presidential election. [Applause.] We have three or four rallies going here. You are here tonight for the same reason that I am and that is that you agree and I agree that when we make a decision on November 8, we want to make the best decision possible for the United States. We want the best for our country. Anyone who votes this year I think probably more than ever before in our history will make their judgment on what they believe to be in the best interest of our country."", 'Mr. Nixon and I disagree on what is the best interest of our country, and you have to make your judgment on November 8 of what you feel, what you believe, the kind of country that you want in the future, the kind of responsibilities that you want to meet as a citizen, because he and I do disagree and these disagreements are important. Mr. Nixon has run on a slogan that we have never had it so good. It indicates his belief that we are moving in a period now, to quote him, of ""unparalleled prosperity,"" that the United States is moving in a position of strength and vitality, and that everything that must be done is being done in good measure. He looks around the world and he sees the United States with our prestige at an alltime high, and that of the Communists at an alltime low. I look at the world and I look at the United States, and I don\'t see his picture at all, and I am not, as the Democratic candidate for office, going to run for the Presidency in 1960, with any belief or any view that it is worthwhile getting elected President if we have to run on a platform which is totally unrealistic. This country is not moving ahead like it is going to have to move ahead if we are going to meet our responsibilities to ourselves, to those who come after us, to those who look to us around the world for leadership. And our position in the world is not unparalleled, our prestige has been higher. Our strength relative to that of the Communists has been greater. If Mr. Nixon hopes to be President of the United States and present the United States to the world in the same image that he now presents it in this campaign, I could not disagree with him more. I hope you share the view with me that we want the truth with the bark off. The people of the United States want to face the facts. You share the same view that I do, that this country\'s potential is unlimited. There is no responsibility, no burden, no hazard that the United States cannot meet, but it certainly cannot meet those hazards unless the leadership is prepared to tell the truth. [Applause.]', 'What possible use is it for Mr. Nixon to say in a television debate with me a week ago or 2 weeks ago that our prestige is at an all time high, when at the very time in the State Department there are polls taken in 10 countries this summer, all over the world, from England to Indonesia, which show a different result. Mr. Nixon either does not know about the polls, or he has read the polls and he cannot draw a conclusion from them, or another decision must be forthcoming.', ""The point of the matter is that this great country of ours deserves the best in leadership. It deserves, I believe, a President of the United States that will set before the American people the unfinished business of this society, a President and an administration that believes in America moving ahead in the 1960's, that believes that the best service that we can render to the cause of freedom is to build a strong and vital society here that spreads its influence around the world and demonstrates to the Communists that we represent the way of the future, that their system is doomed to die, but it will die only when we meet our responsibilities. [Applause, response from the audience, laughter from the audience.]"", 'The man in the audience said that I should tell Mr. Nixon that experience is what he will have left after this campaign is over. [Laughter and applause.]', ""I don't know why we never think of those things. [Laughter.] But, of course, Casey Stengel's experience showed that experience is not enough. [Laughter.] What we have to do, in my opinion, in 1960 is pick this country up, pick this country up, pick this free society up and move it forward, and I believe we can do it. This is a great country, but it can be greater. It is a powerful country, but it can be more powerful, and as long as we are the chief hope of freedom, as long as we represent the great resistance to the expansion of the Communist movement, I run for the Presidency wanting to see us meet our obligations, speak the facts, tell the truth, and then let the American people make their judgment. [Applause.]"", 'My judgment is that there is not an American in Queens County that is not thinking of the best interest of this country, and my judgment is on November 8 the best interests of our country are served by those of us who are willing to say let us make one more great effort on behalf of the United States, let us move forward again, let us demonstrate to a watching world that we represent the way of the future. I want people to wake up all over the world in the next years and wonder not what Mr. Khrushchev is doing or what Mr. Castro is doing. I want them to wonder what the United States is doing. [Applause.]', 'Ladies and gentlemen of Queens, we leave it to you. We put this campaign in your good hands. Let us take this country, let us take this State, let us demonstrate in the United States, to Mr. Khrushchev and everyone else that a new generation of Americans is taking over and that this country is going to move again.', 'I will close, as we leave for Bethlehem, Pa., by quoting from Mr. Robert Frost, who said, ""I will hitch my wagon to a mule, for I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep."" Thank you. [Applause.]']"
363,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","[""Yesterday I campaigned in the Midwest, where there is a real alarm over the squeeze caused by falling farm prices and the farmer's rising costs - the cost-price squeeze."", 'But tonight, I want to talk to you about another squeeze just as serious, just as wide, and just as urgent, caused by the growing squeeze gap between the cost of living and take-home pay, the gap between higher prices and the jobs and wages needed to pay those prices, not the cost-price squeeze, but the job-price squeeze.', ""For you cannot live in a decent house and feed and clothe your family if you are unemployed or forced to work part time. You cannot pay today's hospital bills, or run a home, or send your child to college unless you have a full-time job at a decent wage. You cannot maintain a decent standard of living unless your income keeps pace with rising costs."", 'And the harsh facts of the matter are that for millions of Americans, income has not kept up with rising costs and standards of living have declined.', 'This is the job-price squeeze.', 'This month the cost of living rose to the highest point in the history of this country. And this was only the latest in a series of record increases stretching over the past 8 years. Yet at the same time, average weekly earnings took another drop as they have in every month since May. Unemployment rose to 5.7 percent of the labor force, higher than it was in the recession year of 1954. The number of men and women forced to work part time steadily increased. And the number of distressed areas, areas of substantial labor surplus, was more than 130.', 'When income goes down and the cost of living goes up, who is hit the hardest?', ""1. Next to those who can't find any work at all, those on an inadequate unemployment compensation or public assistance payment, the hardest hit by the job-price squeeze are those Americans who are forced to work for substandard wages. This year the Democratic Party tried to raise the minimum wage to $1.25 an hour, to $50 for a 48-hour week. Mr. Nixon opposed this measure. He said that it was extreme. And it was extreme for Mr. Nixon. For he had previously voted to completely remove 1 million workers from the protection of the minimum wage laws and he is the candidate of a party which opposed the first 25-cent-an-hour minimum wage and which has fought against every increase since."", '2. The job-price squeeze has also frustrated the ambitions of millions of Americans to buy their own homes. The costs of home financing have soared in the past 8 years and today a $10,000, 30-year mortgage costs $3,300 more in interest charges than it did in 1952. The costs of construction have gone up, and rents have risen 20 percent.', 'Yet the Republicans have vetoed Democratic housing bills designed to eliminate slums and provide decent housing for low- and middle-income families. They have permitted a general inflation which has raised the cost of construction materials. And they have artificially forced interest rates up, increasing the cost of financing homes, stifling needed construction, and driving rents upward. And the result has been a 30-percent drop in needed housing starts.', '3. Perhaps the most destructive human consequence of the job-price squeeze has been the inability of American families to meet the medical bills of their older members. Medical costs have increased 20 percent in the past 8 years and these rising costs have had their greatest impact on the millions of Americans who are forced to get by on an average social security check of $72 a month. Americans feel obliged to help their older parents receive needed medical care but the burden of this obligation strains family incomes to the breaking point.', ""To meet this distress, the Democrats proposed that the medical expenses of retired Americans be financed through the social security system. But Mr. Nixon and the Republicans opposed medical care for the aged and they managed to defeat it in the Congress. A national magazine reported that when the Senate rollcall killing medical care for older citizens was announced, the Vice President smiled. But our older citizens who were deprived of needed medical attention did not smile and Mr. Nixon won't be smiling on November 8 when the American people reject a party which has refused decent medical attention for millions of Americans."", '4. The job-price squeeze has kept thousands of American families from realizing their dream of sending their children to college. The costs of higher education have soared upward in the past 8 years, until it now costs $1,300 more for a college education than it did in 1952 and our colleges themselves have been unable to afford the new buildings and expanded facilities essential to meet the growing demand for a college education.', 'We Democrats have tried to meet the job-price squeeze in education by providing scholarships, and aiding the construction of dormitories and classrooms. Yet Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have opposed all of these programs denying education to talented and skilled young Americans simply because they cannot afford it.', '5. Nothing has contributed more to the job-price squeeze than the denial of jobs to qualified Americans because of the color of their skin or their religious belief. In a slump, Negroes and Puerto Ricans are the first to be fired and the last to be rehired but they still have to pay the same grocery bills as everyone else.', 'But the Republican Party has done nothing to guarantee equal job opportunities for all Americans. Mr. Nixon has been chairman of the Committee on Government Contracts for 8 years - and in that entire period he did not invoke a single sanction to enforce the clause in every Government contract that forbids racial discrimination in hiring. As a result, thousands of jobs have been denied to skilled nonwhites. But this is not a surprising record for Mr. Nixon. For it was Mr. Nixon who, in the Congress, fought and voted against every Democratic effort to guarantee equal access to jobs for every American.', 'These examples of the job-price squeeze - of rising prices and inadequate incomes - are only symptoms of the deeper Republican failure to build the vital and growing economy on which American strength depends.', 'Last month our economy actually shrank - retail sales declined - industrial production dropped. We have 4 million men out of work - a steel industry which is operating at less than 60 percent of capacity - the highest rate of business failures since the great depression. In fact, almost every index of economic health showed a decline - while prices continued to rise. That is what the Republicans have done with the greatest industrial plant and most skilled labor force in human history. Never has so little been done with so much.', 'And all Mr. Nixon has to say is that ""We\'ve never had it so good."" All he has to offer is the same old Republican policies which have driven prices up and employment down - which have caused other nations to doubt the strength of the dollar - and which are rapidly leading us toward what may be our third recession in 6 years.', ""In short, Mr. Nixon offers you higher prices, smaller real incomes and an increase in the job-price squeeze. But I don't think the American people are going to accept this offer.""]"
364,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","['The basic Republican argument against oar programs always is: America cannot afford it. They say the businessman cannot afford better schools, better pay for oar teachers, better homes, better medical care for the aged.', 'The Republican Party says, in short, that we cannot afford prosperity for all Americans. I am not talking about prosperity for our largest banks, our largest defense contractors, or our largest investors who have made record profits under the high interest rate procurement and tax policies of this administration.', 'I am talking about prosperity for all the people - for the women in some of our largest stores who are being paid 65 cents an hour - for the retired cutter who cannot pay his medical bills on an average social security check of $72 a month - for the unemployed fitter who must support his family on an unemployment check averaging less than $35 a week - for the Negro accountant who has to take a job as a messenger - for the Puerto Rican lawyer who has to drive a truck - the children who have to grow up in overcrowded slums and go to overcrowded schools - they are not sharing in what Mr. Nixon calls unprecedented prosperity.', 'But to meet their needs effectively, according to Mr. Nixon, would take higher taxes or inflation. I think we can meet these needs and expand our economy so dynamically and run our Government so efficiently that we can secure these goals without either higher taxes or inflation.', ""In short, the essential difference between the Republican Party and its candidate and the Democratic Party and its candidate boils down to this: We both agree that this is the richest country on earth but they say we can't afford prosperity for all the people and I say we can't afford another recession."", 'The Wall Street Journal and most leading economists say we are already in our third recession in 6 years. They point to the decline in our gross national product, the decline in the workweek, the decline in carloadings, retail sales, and almost every other major index.', 'But a third recession would have tragic effects at home far beyond any economic indicator. It would be a tragedy for those individuals and communities who have not yet recovered from the last recession. It would be a tragedy for those who are forced out of work, for the families they cannot support, for the merchants whose bills they cannot pay. It would be a tragedy for the businessman forced into bankruptcy and it would be a tragedy for a whole Nation that can ill afford idle men and idle machines at this hour in our history.', 'Only a prosperous America can support the defense outlays we need to safeguard the West against a surprise nuclear attack. Only a prosperous America can help strengthen the economies of less stable areas of freedom around the world. Only a prosperous America, in short, can be a strong America - and we cannot afford to be anything but stronger than we are today.', ""The Republicans are right when they say we can't afford everything. We can't afford poverty. We can't afford to overcrowd millions of families in broken down, neglected, unsanitary fire traps that produce disease and crime and urban decay, and cost the American people hundreds of millions of dollars every year."", 'We cannot afford overcrowded schools, with inadequate facilities and underpaid teachers. The cost of better schools is repaid a hundred times in political, economic, scientific, and medical progress. But the cost of poor schools, the cost of children who never develop their talents, the cost of voters who are uninformed, the cost of the doctor shortage, the engineer shortage, the teacher shortage and all the rest, is a cost which can never be recovered and which we cannot afford.', ""Finally, we cannot afford waste, we cannot afford to waste people and that means we cannot afford racial and religious discrimination. Every time a member of a minority group is denied opportunity to work at the job he is capable of doing, every time he is denied an education that will develop his talents fully, every time he is condemned to live in a home that stunts the health and warps the minds of his children, we are wasting our Nation's most precious resource: people."", 'I say we can do better. I say we can afford prosperity. I say we can make the motto of the New Frontier these words of Thomas Wolf:', '\n  To every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity - to every man the right to live, to work, to be himself and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make - this, seeker, is the promise of America.\n']"

Congressman Leonard Farbstein, who is going to be the next Congressman - I would say his chances are pretty good [applause] - and Bill Van den Heuvel who represents the district over there, who I hope will be the Congressman from this congressional district, other candidates, fellow Democrats, ladies and gentlemen, I run for the office of the Presidency this year after 14 years in the Congress with the full recognition of the responsibilities of that office. The President of the United States, and only the President of the United States, speaks for this country. I speak for Massachusetts, and Senator Douglas speaks for Illinois, and Senator Engle speaks for California. And these Congressmen speak for this district and the next district. But the President of the United States speaks for these two districts and Massachusetts and Illinois and California. And I believe it vitally important that the next President of the United States understand the revolutionary times in which we live, understand that it is vitally important that this country start to move ahead again, and that the next President of the United States place before the American people the unfinished business of our society, the things that we must achieve if we are going to maintain our freedom, and if we are going to build the kind of society which will inspire people around the world. That is why I believe this is the center of action.', 'The President of the United States is the key office, and only the President of the United States can mobilize the resources of this country so that we begin to move ahead again. And I believe it is in our conception of the office, in our understanding of the times, in our opinion about the future, that Mr. Nixon and I sharply disagree. The Republicans have run on slogans of peace and prosperity. I want to make it very clear that I am not satisfied with this kind of prosperity, when we only use 50 percent of our steel capacity, when we build this month 30 percent less homes than a year ago, when the United States economic growth in the last 9 months is minus 0.3 percent. We are going to have to find in the next 10 years 25,000 jobs a week every week or he next 10 years to keep our people working. We are going to have to build at least 200,000 more homes a year to keep our people adequately housed. We are going to have to provide better schools for our children because we need the best educated children in the world. We are going to have to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security, because all the people are entitled to live out their lives in some kind of dignity, and we are going to have to provide equality of opportunity for all Americans.', ""Now, you have to decide which party and which candidate based on their history, based on their statements in this campaign, based on their look into the future, can lead this country into the dangerous years of the 1960's, which party and which candidate and which viewpoint can build in this country a strong society which will serve as an inspiration to the people around the world. I am sick as an American of reading these studies that are made abroad, which show that the image of America as a vital forceful society, as it once was under Franklin Roosevelt, has begun to fade. [Applause]. I believe it incumbent upon this generation of Americans to meet the same rendezvous with destiny of which Franklin Roosevelt spoke in 1936. This country has to do better. This country has to move again. This country has to provide full use of all of its people and all of its facilities if we are going to win out."", ""I don't run on the Presidential program of saying that if I am elected life will be easy. I think to be a citizen of the United States in the 1960's is a hazardous occupation. But it is also one that offers challenge and hope, and I believe the choice lies with you on November 8. You have to decide what you think of the present, what you think of the future, what you want this country to be, whether you are satisfied or not, and based upon your judgment of what is best for our country I am ready to submit my case. Whether I am the candidate for the Presidency, or President, or stay in the Senate, I regard our obligation not to please you but to serve you, and in my judgment, in 1960, a candidate for the Presidency should be willing to give the truth to the people and the truth is that what we are now doing is not good enough.

He can run on a program that our prestige has never been higher, that the balance of power in the world is shifting in our direction, but as for me, I believe that the United States will not meet its commitments to itself and to those who look to it unless we are prepared to face the facts of life, and, facing them, do something about them.', 'I stand in the tradition of great Democratic Presidents who in this century moved this country forward, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and we are going to do it again in 1960. [Applause.] The Republican Party has never broken through new ground, has never stood for progress, has opposed step by step every piece of progressive legislation passed for the benefit of the people in the last 25 years, housing, social security, minimum wage, unemployment compensation - all of the things which make it possible for us to build a strong and vital society. I ask you to join us in 1960. I ask your support in this election. I ask you to help us get this country moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
366,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, can you hear me? I want those Nixon sign holders to hear what I have to say. [Laughter.] This loudspeaker is in the engine. [Response from the audience.]', 'I come here as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party, and I come here as an American. I believe this race and this campaign is between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who stand still, like Mr. Nixon [applause], those who lead a political party, the Republicans, who have opposed every piece of progressive legislation for the last 25 years. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon runs on a slogan ""Experience Counts"" - just listen. You won\'t learn anything if you are talking. [Laughter.] Let us see what the experience has been which has produced in the last 8 years three recessions, which now in the United States has us using 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills. This year we are building in September 30 percent less homes than we built last year. We have 4 1/2 million people out of work and 3 million working part time. Last week the Soviet Union produced just as much steel, pretty nearly, as the United States.', ""Those are the issues in this campaign. What kind of experience is it when in a dangerous time in the life of our country the surveys taken of our position abroad show our prestige so deteriorated that the administration would not even release the survey. [Applause.] When this administration took control of the United States 8 years ago, I don't think that there was any question that our prestige, our influence. our strength were at a peak. Now, 8 years later, the survey printed in the New York Times of opinion of England and France showed only 7 percent of the people of those countries thought the United States was ahead scientifically. In an opinion taken, a survey taken of 10 countries around the world, only one country had a majority of the people thinking we would be ahead of the Soviet Union by 1960. [Response from the audience.] You cannot hear? [The Senator left his car and went to the top of a building.]"", 'As I was saying [laughter.] Let me just say that those of you who are students here have to make a decision if you are of voting age, or even if you are not, on November 8, which I think goes to the future of the United States. The issues which separate Mr. Nixon and myself are very clear and very sharp, and I believe that basically they are twofold. First, Mr. Nixon has chosen to place his campaign on the basis that ""We\'ve never had it so good,"" that everything that must be done is being done in its own good time and in our position around the world - in our position around the world he has made the statement that our prestige has never been as high. Now, I could not disagree more with both of those statements. [Applause.] The fact of the matter is that the prestige is not popularity, it is not a matter that can be lightly dismissed. We lead an alliance of the free world, and we will no longer be the leaders of the free world. We will no longer be secure unless we have confidence that we represent the way of the future, that we are constructing here in the United States the kind of society which gives them hope that they can follow our example. When we drift, when we lie at anchor, when we are uncertain, when we have long debates about what our national purpose is, then we give an image of uncertainty. Mr. Khrushchev speaks with confidence of the future. He says our children and grandchildren will be Communists. We have to demonstrate our conviction that not only will our children be free, but so will the children of men around the world. [Applause.]', ""This administration and Mr. Nixon [response from the audience] I don't think you are going to get him though. [Applause.]"", ""Let us put this administration's record to the test. These are entirely new times, and they require new solutions. The key decision which this administration had to make in the field of international policy and prestige and power and influence was their recognition of the significance of outer space. When they permitted the Soviet Union to move ahead, when we had a Secretary of Defense who said he was not interested in spending money to find why fried potatoes turned brown, the Soviet Union now is first in outer space."", ""Mr. Nixon said the other day that if we had put forward a program of aid to Latin America in 1955, that we might not have had a Castro. Well, why didn't we? Why did we wait until this summer? [Applause.] The new continent now which will bear great influence in the world is Africa. Do you know that we brought more foreign students to the United States 10 years ago than we do today? Last year Guinea asked for 500 teachers. Do you know how many we sent them? One. Do you know there are more students studying here from Thailand than from Africa south of the Sahara? Do you know that we are about 15th or 14th in the world in radio programs to Africa, that we are behind Indonesia? Do you know that we are fourth in the world behind Radio Cairo in our radio broadcasts from the United States? Do you know that the Soviet Union spends 10 times as much as we do in Spanish broadcasts to Latin America? This administration is experienced? I don't think any judge would give a man who had 40 accidents a new driver's license. [Applause.] I don't think an administration which has presided over three recessions in the last 8 years, which is now presiding over the lessening of the U.S. position around the world, which has permitted the U.S. image to fade as a vital society, our most important asset, which has in that way damaged the cause of freedom, I cannot believe that any young man or woman who looks to the future can possibly decide to sit down and sit still and look back with Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party which has always opposed progress."", 'Let me say to you young Nixonites - all eight of you [response from the audience] - let me say this: In this 20th century both of our candidates, both parties have put up various candidates, and I believe that where we stand now and where we are going in the future can best be judged by where we have been. Hear the Republican slogans, ""Stand Pat"" with McKinley, ""Return to Normalcy"" with Harding, ""Keep Cool"" with Coolidge, ""A Chicken in Every Pot"" with Herbert Hoover, ""Repeal Social Security"" with Alf Landon, and ""Had Enough"" with Thomas E. Dewey. [Applause.]', 'Who have we run in the 20th century? Woodrow Wilson and the New Freedom, Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal [applause] and Harry Truman and the Fair Deal [applause] and every one of their domestic programs had their counterpart in the international policy. The 14 points of Woodrow Wilson was the counterpart of the New Freedom. The four freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt were the international counterpart of the New Deal. Technical assistance, point 4, the Marshall plan, the Truman doctrine, were all the international counterpart of the Fair Deal. Now, in 1960, the choice lies between the candidate who in this most revolutionary time runs on the slogan ""You\'ve never had it so good,"" versus the candidate and a party that runs on the slogan of the ""New Frontiers"" of the future. [Applause.]', 'On that basis, I ask your help. [Applause.] I ask your support. This is not a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself. It is a contest between all of us who are devoted to our country, who feel that our country has a great role to fulfill as the chief defender of freedom, and it involves each one of you. How many of you in the next decade will be willing to not only serve your country in the foreign service, in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, as doctors and engineers and teachers and nurses? How may of you will be willing to pick this country up and move it forward and make it shine once again. [Applause.]', 'We now go to Brooklyn. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

In 1952, when the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act was up, the Immigration Act which permits, even though Italy and Great Britain have the same population, 47 million, permits 50,000 Englishmen to come to this country and 570 Italians, which permits 350 Portuguese to come here, permits 400 Greeks, and almost no Poles, no Lithuanians, no Roumanians, no Hungarians, no Eastern Europeans, no Southern Europeans. Ireland has a population of 2,500,000. Seven million Irish can come here and 5,700 Italians. You tell me why Mr. Nixon voted for that bill and voted to override Truman's veto, and I voted against it and voted to sustain the veto. [Applause.]"", 'Now, Mr. Nixon can have everybody who wants to keep that kind of a law on the books, and I want the people who want to set an image of America that is fair, that stands for the torch of freedom, that encourages those to unite their families.

It involves the future of this State, it involves the future of this country, it involves the future of the cause of freedom. I cannot believe in 1960, as we enter the most difficult and turbulent and revolutionary times in the history of our country that we are going to elect a candidate and a party that looks to the past. I think the American people, as in 1932, as in 1948, as in 1912, are going to say ""yes"" to the future, are going to choose to pick this country up and move it ahead, and I come here and ask your help in doing that. [Applause.]', 'I believe the issues which separate Mr. Nixon and myself are very clear, and they go to the future of every man and woman here, and they go to the future of our country. He has chosen in this difficult time to run on a slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good."" I don\'t run on that slogan. I run on the slogan ""We are going to have to do much better."" We are going to have to meet our responsibilities, not only to ourselves, but to all those who look to us with confidence and hope. As an American, not as a Democratic standard bearer, but as an American I believe that this race is between the concerned and the comfortable, between those who sit still and those who want to pick themselves up and push forward. I run against a candidate and a party which has opposed in the last 25 years every piece of progressive legislation put forward. Minimum wage - Mr. Nixon\'s Republican Party voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties, and they voted 90 percent against the $1.25 in 1960. They voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties, and they voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960. This is the party which has stood still, and I don\'t believe in 1960 any American can stand still.', 'These are difficult times and I do not run for the Presidency promising that if I am elected life will be easy. But I do say that if I am elected, the President of the United States must - as Franklin Roosevelt did - set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, full employment for our people, better housing, the use of our natural resources, a better standard of living, building a more vigorous society which can serve as an inspiration to freedom all over the globe. I believe the choice is clear, and I come to this garment district and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join in meeting our responsibilities as citizens of this great Republic, as the chief defenders of freedom, at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe.', 'I believe the choice is between those who wish to stand still and those who wish to move, between those who believe in progress and those who look to the past. I believe the choice is between our moving this country, as Franklin Roosevelt and Truman and Wilson did it, or between those who believe, with Warren G. Harding and Landon and Dewey and Coolidge and all the rest, that back in the old days were the good days. I believe that we have to do in our generation what Franklin Roosevelt did in his generation. In 1936, Franklin Roosevelt said, ""This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny."" I believe in 1960 that this generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny, to demonstrate that we can build in this country the kind of society which gives opportunity to all Americans, regardless of their race or their creed or their color, a chance to develop their talents, to educate their children, to live in security, to work, to strengthen the United States. And in so doing strengthen the cause of freedom.', 'I ask your help on that basis. I ask you to support us. I ask you to elect Congressman Bill Vanden Heuvel in this district. I ask you to choose, as Americans have chosen in other great crises in our times, between those who wish to rest on their oars and between those who wish to break through again into the area of new frontiers.

This is a powerful country, but I think it can be a more powerful country.

[Applause.]', ""The choice between Mr. Nixon and myself is a very sharp one very simple. We lead two different parties, committed to two different philosophies of government, with two different legislative histories, both from the party point of view and the individual point of view. I represent a party which in the 1930's passed the Social Security Act. Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted against the Social Security Act 90 percent. I represent a party which passed the Housing Act of 1949. Mr. Nixon represents a party that voted against it, and Mr. Nixon himself voted against it. I represent a party which tried to pass a minimum wage of $1.25 this summer. Mr. Nixon represents a party that voted 80 percent against it in the House of Representatives. I represent a party committed to equality of opportunity for all Americans regardless of their race, their religion, their color, their creed. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon represents a party which controlled the Presidency, the House, the Senate, in 1953 and 1954. Not one single piece of legislation dealing with civil rights ever saw the light of day in either the House or the Senate."", ""Mr. Nixon runs for the Presidency he runs on a program of progress. In 1952, the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act came up. The McCarran-Walter Immigration Act provided that even though the population of England and the population of Italy is the same, 60,000 English citizens can come to the United States every year, and 5,700 Italians, 350 Portuguese, 400 Greeks, few Poles, few Hungarians, a few Czechs, a few Rumanians. Mr. Nixon voted for that bill and he voted to override the President's veto. I voted against it, and I voted to sustain the President's veto. [Applause.]"", ""The fact of the matter is that Mr. Nixon may campaign and say parties don't mean anything, but I think the kind of candidates the parties put forward does mean something. I stand where Franklin Roosevelt stood and Governor Smith and Harry Truman [applause] and Woodrow Wilson. Mr. Nixon stands where Mr. Dewey stood and Mr. Landon. [Response from the audience.] The only three candidates in this century who tried to do something about the Republicans were Theodore Roosevelt, and they drove him out of the party, Wendell Willkie, they rejected him in 1944, and Nelson Rockefeller, and they moved him right out of the picture and brought in Dick Nixon. [Response from the audience.]"", 'I want someone to tell me a single piece of domestic legislation that Mr. Nixon ever proposed that stood for progress for the people, from minimum wage, social security - this summer we tried to pass a bill for medical care for the older citizens. Under the bill, which the President signed, before you or your mother and father, who may be retired, who may have a heart attack or cancer or sick for several months - before they can get any assistance under that program, they first have to sign a petition that they are medically indigent. They have to take a pauper\'s oath and then they can go down and get public assistance. Do you know what we proposed? That it be tied to social security, that everyone contribute 3 cents a day, and they be given out of a fund to which they contributed medical care when they retired. [Applause.] We proposed our bill. Forty-four Democrats voted for it in the Senate, and one Republican. Do you know what a great national magazine said when we were defeated? ""Mr. Nixon turned,"" it said, ""and smiled."" You have to decide whether that is the kind of leadership you want, a leadership frozen in the ice of its own indifference. [Response from the audience.]', 'It is no accident that while we have stood still at home, we have stood still abroad. We stood for the most abroad when we stood for the most at home. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor to Latin America because he was a good neighbor to the people of this country. Woodrow Wilson stood for the new freedom at home and he stood for freedom abroad. Unless you have a progressive, forward looking, vigorous program as a nation, your image abroad is uncertain. Why is this administration compelled to hide the surveys which show our prestige has dropped? You cannot possibly move abroad, you cannot possibly attract the image and the commitment and the imagination of people scattered around the world who want leadership, who want leadership for freedom, unless this country is moving ahead. I am not prepared as an American to see three recessions in 8 years. [Applause.]', 'You make clothes or hats, or work and manufacture.

371,John F. Kennedy ,"October 27, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Dubinsky, Alex Rose, Governor Lehman, Bill Vanden Heuvel, the next Congressman from this district, and he will make a good one, Miss Bankhead, Mayor Wagner, Miss Lee, Miss Winters, Mr. Douglas, Miss Loy, ladies and gentlemen, and all of you. I know that you have to go back to lunch. Let me say very briefly what I think the issues are in this campaign. They are generally the great domestic issue which goes to the question of the kind of society that we can build here. Can we as a free society maintain full employment for our people, educate our children, provide security for our older citizens, provide equality of opportunity for all Americans, regardless of their race, their origin, or the circumstances of their birth. Can we, in other words, build the kind of society which we promised to build in all of the great statements of our leaders, and if we can build that society, can we build it with sufficient vigor, sufficient strength, can we do it in the sixties to set an example of freedom to all those who look to us for leadership?', 'Our problem abroad is connected with our problems here at home. If we build a strong society here in the United States, if we build a society which practices what we preach, if we build a society of strength and vigor, then quite obviously it affects our relations all around the world. One of the great problems which now affects the United States, affects our security, affects our leadership, affects our chances for peace, is that the United States in recent years, rather than giving an image of strength and purpose and vitality, has given an image of reaching middle age and beginning to fade as an inspiration and hope to the people all around the globe. All of the discussion which Mr. Nixon and I have had in this campaign about our prestige in the world does not go to the question of our popularity, whether we are liked or disliked; it goes to the question of whether people in Latin America and Africa and Asia will decide to follow our example, will decide to associate with us, representing the way of the future, or, standing on the razor edge of decision, will decide to follow the example of the Communists. That is the real serious issue which I believe is incumbent in this election of 1960.', 'The New York Times this morning carried a poll taken in England and France this summer. It showed that only 7 percent of the people of England and France thought the United States was ahead of Russia in science. An earlier poll showed that a majority of the people in 10 countries believed that by 1970 the Soviet Union would be first militarily and scientifically.', 'Now, if the people of the world begin to get that idea of the relative strength of our two societies, then it goes to the question of peace, and it goes to the question of our security. How can we lead a free world if they no longer look to us as an example? How can we speak for freedom when we no longer give an image of a strong free society?', ""My chief disagreement with the Republicans and my chief disagreement with Mr. Nixon is that I don't think they have the vaguest idea of the kind of times in which we live and the kind of national effort that will be required if the United States is going to maintain its position in the sixties. To have 5 million people out of work, have nearly 3 million people working part time, to have nearly half of our steel capacity unused at a time when we are undergoing our most serious tests - what impression does that make on Mr. Khrushchev? Does he think we are a serious society when we can only use half of our society? Do you know by the 15th of November - and this goes to everyone who deals in textiles or fabrics - that we will have 1 billion dollars in inventory unsold, the highest we have ever had in the history of the United States? Do you know this year we built 30 percent less homes than we built a year ago? How can we maintain prosperity on that basis? How can we serve as an example around the world on that basis? When people around the world in Africa, Latin America, and Asia ever get the idea that we don't represent the future but another society does, hostile to us, then I would say we have lost a most important struggle. So I regard our responsibility in the coming years as twofold:"", 'First, to build strength in the United States, to maintain employment in our country, to use our resources to the fullest, to develop the kind of society which Franklin Roosevelt and Wilson and Truman in their day tried to develop, but to do it and to do it in the sixties.', 'Secondly, to speak for freedom around the world. In the vote in the United Nations on the admission of Red China there were 16 nations from Africa. Do you know how many of those voted with us? None. Do you know we had more foreign students studying here 10 years ago under the Federal Government than we do today? In June we offered 300 scholarships to the Congo in an emergency, as if you could turn out an educated man overnight. Do you know that was more scholarships than we offered to all of Africa in the year before? Do you know how many Congolese students are here? Seven. Guinea, which now votes with the Communists, asked us for 500 teachers this year. Do you know how many we sent them? One. We had more people stationed in Western Germany in 1957 than in all of Africa.', 'Does anyone wonder why in Latin America, Africa, and Asia the United States no longer serves as a symbol? Do you know the Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know Indonesia has more broadcasts to Africa than we do? Do you know Radio Cairo has more radio programs around the world than we do? And this administration and Mr. Nixon runs on that record.', 'The gap between our programs and performance has never been wider and you have to decide on November 8 the kind of country which you want to live in, the kind of society you want. Do you feel that what we are doing now is good enough? If you do, then Mr. Nixon is your man. But if you take the view that I take, that the United States cannot possibly afford at a time when we are the chief defender of freedom and when freedom is under attack all over the globe - we cannot afford to be second in education, in space, in housing, in industrial production, in the kind of society and opportunity we present. On that basis we can move the country. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.]', 'The fact is that Pennsylvania made it possible for me to be nominated, and I would like to have you finish the job. [Applause.]', 'I am also glad to be here because the publisher of the Scranton Times, Mr. Miner, has been generous enough to endorse my candidacy. [Applause.] Unlike Mr. Nixon, who has hundreds of papers supporting him, as they do all Republicans, Democratic candidates have only a few, and we really cherish them. So we want to thank him very much. [Applause.]', 'Let me say that I think this choice that lies for the voters of Pennsylvania and the Nation on November 8 is very clear. If you want to sit still in Scranton, if you want to continue the present leadership, if you want to see the United States fail to move forward throughout the world and in our own country, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.]', 'But if you believe as I believe that now in the United States that this is one of the great watersheds in history, as was 1932, when Franklin Roosevelt was chosen, and 1912, when Woodrow Wilson was chosen [applause], I believe that this is a time of decision for America - before you decide who should he the next President, who should be your Congressman, you have to decide what your view is of your country, your community, your history, your future. You have to decide whether you are comfortable and happy and fat and prosperous today or whether you agree that as a citizen of the United States, as a defender of freedom, it is our obligation to move our country forward, not to be satisfied with anything but the best. And we want the best for this country. [Applause.]', 'I am not entirely convinced that Mr. Nixon offers it. I believe Mr. Nixon offers more of the same, but less. He continues to look behind him, he continues to look in the past, he continues to make arguments which have little relevancy with the facts. He continues to be further and further removed from reality in discussing the problems of the United States and the problems we face in the world.', 'In Michigan I saw it, when he made a speech about the number of automobiles we were now producing. I would like to ask him how many of those automobiles are being sold, because by the middle of November, according to every calculation, we will build more cars in September and October than we have in years, and by the middle of November there will be more automobiles unsold than there have been in the history of the United States.', ""Now, what kind of prosperity is that when the auto industry speeds it up now and then leaves them unsold for the dealers in November? If that is the kind of prosperity we are talking about, I don't think that is the kind that Americans want. What kind of prosperity is it when we build this year 30 percent less homes than we built last year. That affects the job of everyone here, everyone who works in construction, everyone who works in home materials, everyone who works in textiles, everyone who works in any industry is affected by the rate of homebuilding and auto building in the United States. They are our two basic industries. Fifty percent of the steel capacity is being used, 30 percent less homes, nearly 4½ million people out of work, and 3 million working part time."", ""The Wall Street Journal, which should be Mr. Nixon's bible, says it is a recession. I don't know what you would call it, and I would not calculate what it is. But in any case, it is not good enough, and if Mr. Nixon is satisfied with it, that is another difference of opinion that we have. [Applause.]"", 'The fact of the matter is in this county, alone, in this area of Pennsylvania, nearly one-quarter of a million people, one out of every four, have moved to find a better chance someplace else. I want rather than young people looking for jobs elsewhere, I want the jobs to come here. [Applause.] I think Franklin Roosevelt put the choice for us just about as sharply and clearly as any American has ever put it when he came before 100,000 people in Franklin Field, Philadelphia, in 1936, to accept his second presidential nomination, and in that speech he said:', '\n  Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that Divine Justice weighs the sins of the coldblooded and the sins of the warmhearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\n', 'And in my opinion that is what our opposition is and Mr. Nixon represents as he approaches the future of this country. [Applause.]', 'Yesterday I saw he was heckled and to the hecklers he said, ""We are going to take care of you."" In my judgment, the people of the United States will make a judgment on November 8 as to which candidate, which party, which political philosophy, which future, they believe best represents the aspirations of our society. Let me make it very clear that no voter should go to the polls thinking Mr. Nixon and I stand for anywhere near the same thing in 1960. I think the choice is very clear. It is written in his record in 14 years in the Congress. It is written in the Republican record of 25 years of opposition to every piece of progressive legislation that has come before the Congress. [Applause.] The same party that opposed 25 cents for a minimum wage in the mid-thirties opposes unanimously, pretty nearly, in the House, $1.25 in 1960. The same party, the Republicans, who opposed social security in the mid-thirties, opposed medical care for the aged. The same party which in 1960 talks about education, the same candidate who talks about aid to education, cast the decisive vote against aid to teachers salaries in the U.S. Senate. The same candidate who talks about housing and about aid to our colleges was a member of the administration which vetoed two housing bills, which would have provided low-rent housing, housing for the elderly, and loans to our colleges and universities in order to build college classrooms and dormitories. Is that progress? [Response from the audience.]', ""I always enjoy listening to Mr. Nixon talk about the Republican record on area redevelopment. On the national debate he talked about what he was going to do about Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. If I had not been there, if I had not observed that, I might have been impressed. The fact of the matter is he can't possibly explain away two Republican vetoes of area redevelopment. I was the floor manager of the first bill to pass the Senate. It came out of the committee of which I was chairman. Senator Clark of this State, Congressman Flood and your own future Congressman - that is the kind of leadership which stands for this sort of legislation. [Applause.]"", ""The first bill in 1956 which I managed died in the House. The Republicans opposed it. The next bill passed the Senate and the House and was vetoed by the President. The next bill passed in the Senate and the House and was vetoed by the President. They did not even introduce the Republican bill. They didn't even testify in favor of it until after the President had vetoed the second bill."", ""I come from a State which has had a good many people unemployed. If anyone can tell me a more desperate fate for an American than wanting to work and unable to find it, having children and a family to support - and this morning I talked to three steelworkers who have been out of work since April. How do you meet the weekly budget? What do you do, go down and get surplus food, which amounts to 5 cents a day per person? What do you do about your children? What do you do about the mortgage on your house? After unemployment compensation runs out, then what do you do? You move away or you work in another State or your wife goes to work. These are the things which divide our two parties. Medical care for the aged, aid to education, unemployment compensation insured by Federal minimum standards, a minimum wage, area redevelopment, development of our natural resources. I don't believe there is any comparison in the record of our parties for 25 years, and I don't think that there is any comparison in our approach to progressive social legislation which serves the people between Mr. Nixon and myself, I am glad to say. [Applause.]"", ""So you have to decide. I believe that the 1960's can be, in Dickens' phrase, the best of years or the worst of years. We can stand still here at home, we can see our prestige and influence go down around the world, we can see Castro's influence spread in Latin America, we can see the influence of the Communists spread in Africa, we can see the hope of freedom in Asia begin to collapse. We can see Eastern Europe permanently subjugated. We can see Western Europe moving toward independent neutrality. We can see all these things. We can be second in space. We can graduate one-half as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. We can provide more slums than we now have. All these things are possible. We can also do other things. We can build this country of ours. We can provide jobs for our people. We can provide good education for our children. We can provide security under social security for our older citizens, and we can build this country so that it serves as an ornament to people all around the world who also want to be free. We can reestablish the same atmosphere which existed in the thirties when Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America, mostly because he was a good neighbor here in the United States. [Applause.]"", 'We can hold out the hand of friendship to people in Africa, newly independent, who want to stay independent; and we can demonstrate in Europe and in Eastern Europe that we stand for freedom, that we are committed to it, that we are its chief defenders, and that this strong, vital, growing country of ours represents the way of the future. Mr. Khrushchev speaks with confidence that our children will be Communists. He could not be more wrong. My judgment is that the future belongs to freedom. The whole history of the last 10 years in Eastern Europe and Africa, all over the world, demonstrates that people want to he free. Freedom will be the ultimate unless we fail, because if we fail, then freedom has no strong source of power behind it. If we move ahead, if we build a strong and vital country here, if we demonstrate what a free society can do, then freedom is strong all around the world. We or they, the Communist system or freedom - it depends on us. Mr. Khrushchev will move and the Communist system will move with all of their energy in every area, and we have to move with a vitality that comes from freedom, which will be greater. But we cannot do it if we go and accept the idea that what we are now doing is good enough, that our prestige was never higher, that our rate of growth is satisfactory, and that all is being done in good time. So you have to decide. You have to make your individual judgment a week from Tuesday what kind of a country you want, what kind of a present you judge it to be, what kind of a future you feel it can be, what obligations and responsibilities as a citizen of a great free country you are willing to meet, and then, when you make that judgment, we will know where America is going. [Applause.]', 'Let me say in conclusion that this campaign, and I hear that some of you have been here since 6 o\'clock or 7 o\'clock standing up [response from the audience] 5 o\'clock - standing up, and I have also been working today. [Applause.] But let me say I understand that the Republicans have some trouble filling their rooms even with chairs, but here they stand up. [Applause.] But you have stood long enough and I have spoken long enough today. [Response from the audience]. Let me just say that I hope you are going to elect Stanley Prokop to be the Congressman. I think he stands for progress. [Applause.] And the assemblyman and the State senator. They will give support to the things that Governor Lawrence is trying to do in the State of Pennsylvania. And I hope also you will stand with us nationally, that this county of Scranton, Lackawanna, and the rest, and the State of Pennsylvania, on the night of November 8, will vote ""Yes"" to the sixties, will vote Democratic, will vote to move this country off dead center. I ask your help in doing that. [Applause.] Give us your hand, your voice, your vote, and all of us together will move forward in the sixties. [Applause.]']"
373,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, ladies and gentlemen, I come to this district as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States in a difficult and challenging time in the life of our country. A week from Tuesday you must make your decision on which party, which candidate, which philosophy of the future, which judgment of the present, because of your own good judgment of what is best for the United States. I don't think that any American this year will vote on any other basis than what is best for our country, because this is a sober and challenging time in the life of the great Republic."", 'Now, on what basis should you make your judgment? First, I would say this: Mr. Nixon and I differ very basically on the present position of the United States in the world, on the present position of the American economy, and on what must be done to strengthen our country. He runs on a program, ""You\'ve never had it so good,"" and he runs on a program that our prestige in the world is at an all-time high. I want to make it very clear that I disagree with him on both counts. [Applause.]', 'As an American I am not satisfied to pass through in a period of 8 years a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, and now in 1960 to have only 50 percent of the steel mills of Pennsylvania and the United States operating, to have 100,000 steel workers out of work, to build 30 percent less homes this year than last year, to find that the prestige and influence of the United States, according to studies undertaken by the United States abroad, is lower than it has been in many years. I am not satisfied as an American, and I hope you are not, either. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon accuses me of downgrading America. I do not need any lesson on devotion to my country from Mr. Nixon or anyone else. [Applause.] What I do downgrade is the kind of leadership which at this difficult time speaks through the country of our great progress, of how well we are doing, we never had it so good, things are fine. There is no sense of urgency, no sense of concern. This is a race between the comfortable, the satisfied, the happy and the concerned, those that care that this country will move ahead, those that want to see us do better, those who believe that this great country must do better. On that basis I ask your support on November 8. [Applause.]', 'You cannot possibly tell me that we are going to win this competition with Mr. Khrushchev in the future when 20 or 25 percent of our capacity is unused, when 4½ million Americans are out of work, when 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls graduating from high school never see the inside of a college, and 16 million Americans live on an average social security check of less than $72 a month. And this administration says, when we try to provide aid to education, when we try to provide medical care for the aged, it is too extreme. When we try to pass $1.25 minimum wage, per hour, $50 a week [applause] $50 a week, Mr. Nixon says it is extreme.', 'Mr. Nixon represents the same party that in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security, 90 percent against the minimum wage of 25 cents an hour, and in 1960 voted 90 percent against the $1.25 minimum wage, and medical care for the aged tied to social security. [Applause.]', 'If that is the kind of leadership in these difficult days that you think is best for your country, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] But if you share my view that this country has to move forward again, that we will only be strong in Latin America, Africa, and Asia and Europe - we will only be as strong as we are here at home, our society is on the move. If we have purpose and direction and force, then what we are will speak far louder than what we say.', ""Mr. Nixon chose to devote his speech here to Cuba. If there would be one topic that I would be reluctant to discuss if I were Republican, it would be Cuba. [Applause.] But I would also like to hear him discuss not just Cuba, but also the United States, Pennsylvania, how we are going to build a strong society here in the United States. I don't worry about the cause of freedom, I don't worry about our prestige around the world, our influence around the globe, as long as we are moving here at home. But if we sit still, if we present an untrue image, if we don't look like we know where we are going, then people around the world begin to wonder whether the future is with us. That is the difference between Mr. Nixon and myself. That is why I come here today and ask your support on November 8. [Applause.]"", ""This struggle between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the leadership of the Republican Party and the leadership which we represent, is as old as this century. Mr. Nixon's party has produced in this century McKinley, Coolidge, Harding, Hoover, Landon, Dewey, and Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.] The Democratic Party produced Woodrow Wilson [applause], Franklin Roosevelt [applause], and Harry Truman [applause]."", 'Now, if you like the McKinley-Landon-Coolidge-Harding viewpoint, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] If you have the view that I have, that it is time for us to pick ourselves up and move, to set before - and this the President must do - set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, to build in this country a strong and vital example of what freedom can do, on that basis I ask your help to give us the opportunity to get America moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
374,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['The Republican candidate for President keeps telling us how well off we are under the Republicans.', 'He tells us, ""You never had it so good.""', ""But in the next breath he tells us that we can't afford to do those things in America that everybody knows we need to do."", ""He says we can't afford to do what this great country should be doing in education, in programs for the aging, in medical care, in housing, in development of our natural resources."", 'I say we can.', 'It is Mr. Nixon - not I - who is downgrading America.', 'It is Mr. Nixon - not I - who is selling America short.', ""Mr. Nixon talks of America's limitations. I speak of her boundless possibilities."", ""Mr. Nixon talks of what we can't do. I speak of what we can do. Mr. Nixon says we are doing well enough. I say we can do far, far better."", 'I agree we are well off; I agree we have the most productive economy the world has ever seen. But I assert - and here I differ from Mr. Nixon - that we can, and ought to, put our great productivity to work to meet the needs of our people, not ignore them.', ""If we are well off, as we are, then why can't we assure every American boy and girl the chance for an education up to the very limit of his abilities?"", ""Mr. Nixon says we can't afford to. I say we can."", 'The Soviet Union is putting twice as high a share of its national income into education as we are. They have been graduating twice as many scientists and engineers. As an American, it pains me to say this, but it is true - that many a bright child born in the Soviet Union has a better chance for a college education than many a bright child born in the United States, if that child happens to be born on the wrong side of the tracks.', 'In Russia, they pay their brightest young people handsome stipends to stay in school; in the United States, a third to a half of our brightest young men and women do not go to college, principally for lack of money.', 'The Republican administration has, for 8 years, opposed almost every effort of the Democratic Congress to provide assistance to our public schools and our colleges. I say we can afford to educate our sons and daughters to the limits of their abilities, and under a Democratic administration the means will be found to do it.', ""They tell us we're well off; then they tell us we can't afford to provide enough hospital beds in America to take care of the sick. Every single year the Republican administration has tried to cut back the appropriation for aid to community hospitals under the Hill-Burton Act, while communities wait in line for the help they need. I say to cut back on hospitals is downgrading America."", ""They tell us we're well off; then they tell us we can't afford to provide our older citizens with a decent program of protection against the heavy cost of medical care."", ""The Republican administration forced upon us a program which refuses medical care to any retired person or his wife, unless they sign away their home, their car, and take a pauper's oath. And somebody comes around to check to see that there's no money hidden underneath the mattress. The Republican bill is so bad that even the Republican Governor of New York has said he won't put it into effect in his State."", 'I say that we can afford to provide medical-care benefits to every retired person - and provide them as a matter of right, without the humiliation of any kind of means test, the same way that social security pensions are provided. To say that we cannot do the right thing by our older citizens is downgrading America.', ""They tell us we're well off; then they tell us we can't afford to clear our slums and make it possible for every American child to be raised in a decent home. The Republican administration has tried to gradually abandon urban renewal and to kill off low-rent housing programs, and they have let the homebuilding industry decline to where it is building fewer than two-thirds the number of new homes each year that should be built. Russian homes are not as good as ours, or as big, but the fact remains that they are building 3 million a year to our 1 million. For Mr. Nixon to say we can't afford to do more to clear our slums is downgrading America."", 'The Republicans tell us our economy was never stronger; then they tell us that a minimum wage of $1.25 an hour would break its back. Who can raise a family on $1.25 an hour, $50 a week? For Mr. Nixon to say $1.25 an hour is ""extreme,"" as he did, is underrating the great potential strength of the American economy.', ""They tell us we're well off; yet their administration proposed to abandon, entirely, the program of aid to clean up our polluted streams so that people can fish, swim, and boat along our inland waters."", ""There is this much logic in the Republican position: It is true that under their policies, where we have three recessions in just 6 years, where we have the lowest rate of economic growth of any industrial country in the world, then there are many things we can't afford."", 'But it is equally true that, if we put our economy to work - if we achieve the rate of 4- to 5-percent growth every year that is within our reach - then we will have the added resources to devote to schools and hospitals and medical care for the aged, housing, and conservation.', ""The Republican candidate proposes to continue his party's restrictive policies.

375,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Walter, who has been my friend in the House for over 14 years, representing this district with distinction, Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Mr. Rice, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, first, I want to express our appreciation to the president of this distinguished college, to the faculty and student body, for their hospitality this morning. This college stretches back through the history of the United States. Many great and distinguished American figures have come to this campus, which is dedicated to the advancement of truth. I am delighted to come here today, I am delighted to be your guest. [Applause.] I hope that what we say here will come under the general heading of the advancement of the truth, at least as we see it in 1960.', 'Prince Bismarck, Count Bismarck once said one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany. I do not know which third of the student body of this college is here today, or which third or even fifth may be supporting the Democrats in 1960, but I am confident that I am talking to the future rulers of America in the sense that all educated men and women must bear the burden of the discipline of self-government, and I am glad to talk to all of the citizens of this community.', 'This is an important election. It involves the selection of a President of the United States, the highest office in the free world, of the Senate, and of the House, and in this sober time in the life of our country, this sober time in the life of freedom around the world, it is important that we make a careful judgment of what is in the best interest of our country. There are sharp issues which separate Mr. Nixon and myself, as to how this country should move forward, what our obligations are in this country, how we can build strength that will make us secure in the world, and will advance the cause of freedom.', 'I disagree very sharply with the leadership which this administration has given, and I do not think that it is an accident that this country has moved through two recessions, 1954 and 1958, through a serious slowdown in 1960, at the very time in the world when every impartial, objective survey, whether released by the State Department or not, shows that our prestige as the leader of the free world has declined. The problem, of course, for all of us is to build the kind of society here in the United States that strengthens the cause of freedom, that strengthens our position. Emerson said a century ago that what we are speaks far louder than what we say we are. If we are moving here at home, with a sense of national purpose, if we are committed to finishing the unfinished business of our society, then in my judgment our position around the world will be advanced rather than diminished.', 'Mr. Nixon campaigns on a domestic slogan ""We\'ve never had it so good."" But I will say he did not use that slogan frequently in the State of Pennsylvania. He campaigns around the world that our prestige is at an alltime high and that of the Communists at an alltime low. Now, if he believes that, I disagree with him. If he does not believe it, and it is contradicted by the USIA surveys of opinion in 10 countries which show that a majority of people in 10 countries, stretching all the way from England to Indonesia believe, first, that the Soviet Union is now ahead of us in science - only 7 percent of the people of England and France, according to the survey published 2 days ago, taken this summer, only 7 percent believe that we are ahead of the Soviet Union. In 9 out of 10 countries, a majority of the citizens of those countries believe that by 1970 the Soviet Union will be first militarily.', 'Now, what does that signify for a citizen of this country? Our hope for freedom, our hope for peace, depends upon our leading a free world coalition, a coalition that is put together voluntarily. How long will they listen to the sound of our trumpet if they believe it blows a faltering note, if they believe that we represent the way of the past; that the Communists represent the way of the future? To lead the free world, to defend freedom, to roll back the Communist advance requires a powerful, committed, dedicated and moving America, and that is what we are going to get. [Applause.]', ""This is a great and productive country. To those of you who are committed to the Republicans or those of you who might be committed to Mr. Nixon, I would ask the following question: How, as an American concerned with the full use of our powers, can you come to any conclusion but that the domestic economy has been mishandled, when we have a recession in 1958, 1954, and now a slowdown? Do you know this year in September we built 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago? That our steel mills are working 50 percent of capacity, and that by the middle of November we will have more automobiles in inventory than we have ever had in our history. It is estimated that there will be by the middle of November, in spite of the fact that this is a changing season, nearly a million unsold cars in the United States. I don't think we can afford in a deadly competition between freedom and totalitarianism - we are strong and productive, but we cannot possibly afford to have our facilities unused. We cannot compete with Mr. Khrushchev we cannot compete with the Communist system, we cannot lead freedom if we are using our facilities part time and our people even less; 20 to 25 percent of our facilities in this country, and manpower, is unused. What does Mr. Khrushchev think when he sees that he has half of our facilities for steel and last week almost out produced us? I don't believe that that is a record on which any candidate can run with a good deal of peace of mind as well as success in November. [Applause.]"", ""The Soviet Union today is putting twice as high a percentage of its national income into education as we are. I don't say we ought to be disturbed - I don't say we ought to duplicate - but what I say is for our own sake, because freedom demands more of people than any other system, that it requires a higher development of those qualities of self-discipline and character and restraint than any other system, it seems to me we should be disturbed when 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of college."", 'Do you know in the next 10 years we are going to have to build more college buildings, more dormitories, more classrooms, than we built in the history of this country to take care of twice the number of boys and girls who will be trying to go to college in 1970? And yet a bill which this Congress passed a year ago to provide loans, repayable at a low rate of interest for college classrooms and college dormitories was vetoed by the President of the United States, and a program still has not been enacted.', ""I don't think this State, this country or this society of ours will move ahead until every child who has the talent to develop a superior intelligence, capability, or skill, is given a chance to do it, regardless of his race or his color. [Applause.] These problems are all difficult. Running and managing and developing a free society is a difficult problem. The real question for our time is: Can we make a free society develop, grow, thrive, with sufficient purpose, sufficient direction, to compete with the single-minded advance of the Communists over a long period of time? That is the problem that all of us face as Republicans and Democrats."", 'My disagreement with this administration is that it has not set our goals high enough, that it has not provided the means and the mechanism by which we can meet the problems that we face, whether it is education whether it is housing, whether it is medical care for our older citizens, whether it is employment for our people, whether it is the development of natural resources, whether it is the building of strength throughout the world. Today, Latin America, Africa, and Asia hang on the razor edge of decision to decide which road they will take. Will they decide that the only way to mobilize their resources is to follow the example of Russia and China? Or will they say, ""We want to be free, and we see what the United States has done and that is the road we want to take."" That is why I believe this is an important election, and that is why I believe this is an important time in the life of our country. By the end of the next President\'s administration, 1964, or, if he is reelected in 1968, the world will be entirely different than it is today. We have seen how in the administration of one President, President Eisenhower, nearly all of Africa has become free. There are 16 new nations admitted from Africa in the last 2 years. That is the kind of revolutionary world in which we live. And how many of those nations voted with us in the United Nations? On the question of the admission of Red China, do you know how many votes we got from those 16 nations? None. Do you know we brought more foreign students here to study 10 years ago than we do today? Do you know the Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know Indonesia has more broadcasts to Africa than we do? Do you know we are fourth in the world now in broadcast - Moscow, one, Peiping, two, Radio Cairo, three, and we are fourth. Do you know we had more people stationed in Western Germany in 1957 in our Embassy than all of Africa?', 'Last year Guinea asked us for 500 teachers, newly independent. Do you know how many we sent them? One.', 'We offered 300 scholarships to the Congo in June, which was more scholarships than we offered all of Africa the year before, as if you could turn out a college student like that. Do you know how many of those Congolese are studying here? Six.', 'If that is the kind of record you want, if that is the kind of international record you want, Mr. Nixon is your man. But if you take the view I take [applause] - if yon take the view that I take, that this is a great country but it can be greater, that what we are now doing is not good enough, that this is a powerful country but it must be more powerful, not only because of our obligations to ourselves, but to all those who look to us - I am not satisfied as an American to see the prestige of the United States decline in any degree; I am not satisfied to be second in outer space; I am not satisfied to see us doing anything but our best, and in my judgment, the last years have not been our best. [Applause.]', 'I come to you today and ask your support those of you who agree, those of you who are not comfortable, those of you who are not content. I ask the support of those who are concerned. I ask you to join us in building this country of ours, and as we sit on a most conspicuous stage, in the history of the world, to build a society which will augment freedom, which will serve as an example, which will serve as a beacon light to all those who now wish to be free. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
376,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Congressman Flood, Mr. Mayor, fellow Democrats, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for coming out here today. Your presence here indicates that you feel as I do, that this is an important election in an important time in the life of our country for a most significant and responsible job, the Presidency of the United States. You have to make your choice as citizens of our country, concerned for our country; you have to make your choice of which man, which party, which political philosophy, which view of our times, shall be elected President of the United States and lead this country in the next 4 years. [Applause.]', ""I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon and I differ. I hope that no one will go to the polls on November 8 thinking that there is no clear choice; Mr. Nixon and I differ very basically about what our country needs to do, about what our position must be in the world, and what the responsibilities are of the United States in the turbulent and changing years of the 1960's. Mr. Nixon represents his party. He looks, in my opinion, to the past and present, and we look to the future and we ask you to look to the future, too. [Applause and response from the audience.]"", 'I hope a Democrat threw that. [Laughter.] This community probably as well as any community in the United States knows what the issues are in this campaign. This community as much as any community in the United States has worked itself. It has believed it can do, and it has tried to build itself up, tried to find work for its people, bring industry in here, provide employment. But you know very well from your own experience that unless there is full employment in the United States, unless people are working all around our country, it is extremely difficult to find jobs for all the people who need them. Under this administration we are building 30 percent less homes than we built a year ago. Our steel mills work 50 percent of capacity, and that affects the job of every miner. We are going to have, by the middle of November, 1 million unsold cars, the highest inventory of unsold cars in the history of the United States.', ""Now, anyone who believes that under those conditions we should continue that kind of leadership, that supports leadership that twice, not once, but twice vetoed the area redevelopment bill, sponsored by your Congressman, Dan Flood, and your Senator, Joe Clark - anyone that believes that a minimum wage of $1.25 is extreme, Mr. Nixon is your man. But anyone who believes as I do that this country will never be strong in the world, that we will never be successful in turning Mr. Khrushchev back, we will never be successful in expanding freedom around the world unless we have in this country a strong and vital and progressive society, and that is what we are committed to, that is what we are committed to, and I believe the American people on November 8, faced with a choice of a leadership that looks to the past and the present, and recognizing that this country, the only hope of freedom that there is, we are the only sentinel at the gate, and if we don't move ahead, if we don't provide employment for our people, if we don't use our facilities to the fullest, if we don't educate our children and provide under social security medical care for our aged and jobs for those in between, then the United States, instead of being the leader of the free world, will cease to count as the only hope of freedom."", 'Mr. Khrushchev does not take a country as seriously - when he is able last week to produce almost as much steel as the United States, and he is now producing twice as many scientists and engineers. I believe that this country is a great country. I have served it for 18 years. I represent the oldest political party in the world, but I represent this year the youngest party, the party that looks to the future, that looks as Franklin Roosevelt looked to the future, and I want your help. [Applause.]', ""If you can tell me after 14 years in the Congress, if you can tell me one single piece of original progressive legislation for the benefit of the people sponsored by either Mr. Nixon or the Republican leadership - can you tell me one? Minimum wage? [Response from the audience.] Social security? [Response from the audience.] Mr. Nixon made a speech 3 weeks ago about what we need to do in housing, and he said in that speech the Housing Act of 1949 works very well, that is the basic housing act. Do you know he voted against it as a Congressman? He leads a party that voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties and votes 90 percent against $1.25 in 1960. He leads a party that voted 90 percent against social security in the midthirties and voted 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security. Under the bill signed by the President, if you are over 65, if you have parents over 65, if they get ill, do you know what they have to do to get any assistance? They have to sign an oath that they are medically indigent, a pauper's oath. Then they go down to the relief station and get public assistance. Under our bill, those who are working would pay an additional tax of 3 cents a day, which amounts to $10 a year, and when 65 you would be entitled to the benefits to which you contributed."", 'The difference between those two approaches, in my opinion, is the difference between our two parties in 1960. And I believe in 1960, and I say this not as a Democrat or a leader or standardbearer of our party but I say it as a concerned American who wishes to see our power and prestige and influence grow as the great hope of freedom, I believe that we have to move in this country. The Bible tells us, ""Who prepares to battle when the trumpet sounds an uncertain sound?"" In the last 3 years, the influence, power, and prestige of America has declined relative to that of our adversaries, I want to see it built up again. I want people all over the world to wake up in the morning and wonder not what Mr. Khrushchev is doing, not what Mr. Castro is doing, but to wonder what the Americans are doing. [Applause.] So I come to this community in the heart of Pennsylvania, the Keystone State of the United States, and I ask your support. I ask you to join me in picking this country up and moving it again. [Applause.]', 'I ask you to join me in providing our Nation with power, force, and purpose. This is a great country and it deserves the best of us all. When you decide on November 8, you look to the future. You join with us in saying that it is time America started moving again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
377,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Mayor, Governor Lawrence, Senator Murray, Congressman Flood, ladies, and gentlemen, I come here to this city as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party, and I come here and ask your support. [Applause.] On November 8, a week from next Tuesday, you as citizens of this State and country have a sober judgment to make between the two candidates and the two parties. I don\'t think that there is any American now who can go to the polls on November 8, and be in any doubt that there are sharp differences between Mr. Nixon and myself, and they go to the future of our country. Mr. Nixon has chosen in the year of 1960, in these changing, revolutionary, and turbulent years, to run on a domestic program of ""We\'ve never had it so good."" I wish he would come here and run on that program. [Applause.] And he has chosen at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe, he has chosen to run on an international program that our prestige has never been higher, that of the Communists never lower, that everything is being done that must be done, and that the tide of history is moving in our favor.', 'I want to make it very clear as an American and as the standard bearer for my party that I do not agree with him in either category. I believe this is a great country, but think it ought to be greater, and I believe it is a powerful country. [Applause.] He says we have never had it so good, and I say we have to do better. [Applause.] My basic conviction is as we look at the world struggle, at our chances for peace, at our chances for security, at our chances to roll back the Communist offensive, rests in the final analysis upon one factor, and that is the strength of the United States, the power of the United States, a United States on the march, and my chief disagreement with Mr. Nixon is that the Republican Party in the last 8 years instead of setting before the Nation its unfinished business, has permitted the United States to stand still. [Applause.]', 'Any administration that vetoes twice the Flood-Douglas-Clark bill which I managed on the floor of the Senate the first time it came up as chairman of the Labor Subcommittee, vetoed it twice, for area depressed bills here in the State, in my own State of Massachusetts - can you tell me that is a progressive administration? [Response from the audience.]', ""Any administration which twice vetoes in the last 18 months, two housing bills - do you call that a progressive administration. [Response from the audience.] One of the results of that is that we this year in September built 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago. We tried to pass in the Senate of the United States this year a bill for $1.25 minimum wage for a 40-hour week. Mr. Nixon says it is extreme. Does anyone here think $1.25 an hour is extreme? [Response from the audience.] We tried to pass a bill for medical care for the aged tied to social security. Do you know the bill that finally passed that the President signed. That provides that if you are over 65, your husband or your wife gets sick, and if you are supporting your parents and they get sick, a heart attack, or any of the others, before they can get any assistance under that bill, they must sign a petition that they are medically indigent, a pauper's oath. They have to sell their property, have to spend their money, and then they can go down and get public assistance."", 'We attempted to pass a bill which would provide that it would be under social security. Everyone on social security would pay 3 cents a day. When they are retired, they would be entitled to medical attention, care, doctors, and the rest. We got 44 Democrats and one Republican, and Time magazine reported that when the vote was announced, Mr. Nixon turned and smiled. I wonder if he is going to be smiling November 9? [Response from the audience.]', 'The fact of the matter is, as Congressman Flood knows, that the party that voted 90 percent against the $1.25 minimum wage voted 90 percent in the midthirties against 25 cents. The party that voted against medical care for the aged, 90 percent in 1960, voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties. You have to make your judgment. You have to decide yourselves. This State depends on steel and coal and industry. Our steel mills today are working 50 percent of capacity. Last week the Soviet Union almost out produced us. Do you know that by mid-November we are going to have 1 million unsold cars in the United States, the largest number of history? And you call this a forward, progressive administration that runs on peace and prosperity? [Response from the audience.]', 'Mr. Nixon announced today that if he is elected President he is going to take a trip through the satellite countries of Eastern Europe. I remember in 1952 when they were running for President that they announced they were going to liberate Eastern Europe. I think what the people of Eastern Europe need are not parades, but they need a strong America committed to freedom here and around the world. [Applause.]', 'Let me conclude by making two points: First, that our chance for peace, our chance for freedom, our chance to meet our commitments to freedom around the globe, depend on one factor, a strong, progressive, forward-looking America. If we fail, freedom fails. If we succeed, freedom succeeds.', 'Secondly, we cannot have a strong, progressive, forward-looking America unless we get new leadership, new leadership that is committed to progress, not committed to standing still and looking back. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon runs as the Republican candidate, though he rarely admits it. [Laughter.] But I would remind you - and I would remind you that I am a Democratic candidate every day and in every State of the Union. [Applause.]', 'The Republicans have run in this century, Mr. McKinley, Harding - do you know what his slogan was? ""Return to Normalcy."" ""Keep Cool with Coolidge,"" ""A Chicken in Every Pot"" with Herbert Hoover. [Laughter.] I don\'t know what Dewey\'s slogan was because we never really found out. [Laughter.] And now they run Mr. Nixon.', ""In the 20th century we ran Harry Truman, the Fair Deal, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal [applause] and Woodrow Wilson's New Freedom, and I run in 1960, suggesting that it is time America picks it up and started toward the New Frontiers of the 1960's."", 'So I stand here tonight with your Congressman, Dan Flood, who has spoken for this district and the United States, and I stand as the standard bearer of a great old party, the oldest political party on earth. But I stand here tonight as the standard bearer of the youngest party, a party committed to progress, and if you in this city and you in this State of Pennsylvania share my view that it is time America started moving again, I ask your help in this effort. Give us your hand, your voice, your support. [Applause.]', 'In the Constitutional Convention, in your suburb of Philadelphia, there was a painting of a sun behind the desk of General Washington low on the horizon, and many of the delegates wondered whether it was a rising or a setting sun. And at the conclusion Benjamin Franklin stood up. He said, ""We now know. It is a rising sun, and the beginning of a great new day.""', 'I believe in 1960 for the United States, if we choose to look forward, if we choose to measure up to our responsibilities as Americans, as the chief defenders of freedom, and as progressive, forward looking strong people, in my judgment it can be a new day and the beginning of progress for the United States. Thank you.']"
378,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Ryan Mr. Mayor, Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Congressman-to-be William Deitman, Ed Schlitzer, and Albert Nagle, ladies and gentlemen: I want to express my thanks to all of you for coming out here this morning. You come here and I come here for the same reason, and that is that all of us believe that this is an important election, which involves our country, and that we are involved in selecting the President of the United States who will speak for the United States, who will symbolize the United States, and the symbol which Mr. Nixon and I present in this election is entirely different. You have to judge, you have to decide on November 8, a week from Tuesday, which symbol, which leadership, which philosophy, which party you prefer.', 'Now let me make it very clear that the differences are sharp. I want Mr. Nixon to come here to Pottsville and campaign on his slogan, ""You\'ve never had it so good."" [Laughter and response from the audience.] My own feeling is that this country will be as strong in the world, that our chances for peace will be as well assured, the United States will speak with vigor and lead the free world only, if we have a strong and vital economy and country here in the United States. [Applause.]', 'Words are not substitutes for strength. Mr. Khrushchev has listened to words all his life. What he respects is the power of a free society, and this country is not moving ahead, it is not developing the kind of power that it must, if we are going to maintain the leadership of the free world and roll communism back around the world. [Applause.]', ""I will make it clear where the Republicans and the Democrats and Mr. Nixon and I differ. I was the floor manager and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor brought the first area redevelopment bill to the floor of the Senate. We passed that bill for depressed areas, and I represented a number of them - the city of Lawrence Mass, had 30 percent unemployment for 4 years. I brought that bill and managed it through the Senate. That bill was opposed by the Republicans. It passed the House and President Eisenhower vetoed it. We brought the bill through, the bill which Senator Clark led the fight for in the Senate, we passed it in the Senate, passed it in the House, and the President vetoed it. And I don't want Mr. Nixon or anyone else to say that that bill was not infinitely preferable to that half-baked bill which they brought forward, which would have brought little relief to Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, southern Illinois, where the unemployment rate has been in many cases over 10 percent for as long as 3 or 4 years. [Applause.]"", ""I am not interested in campaign promises. I am interested and you should be, and you are, in what is the record. No. 2, this Government of ours passes out surplus food packages to nearly a half million people in the State of Pennsylvania. Do you know what is in those packages for a family of four? Some flour, some meal, some rice, they have added lard recently. It amounts, for a family of four people, to $6.50 for a family of four, which amounts to a grand total of 5 cents per person per day, in the richest country on earth. If you feel that a minimum wage of $1.25 is extreme, if you believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security is worse than a medical aid bill which requires that an old person must take an oath that he is medically indigent, a pauper's oath, before he gets public assistance, if you feel it is proper to veto two depressed area bills, if you are pleased by the fact that we built this year in September 30 percent less homes than a year ago, and that this administration has vetoed two housing bills in the last 12 months, if you think that is good, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.]"", ""But if you share my view that this country of ours has to move ahead, we can't permit 50 percent of our steel capacity to go unused, 109,000 steelworkers out of work, others working parttime, coal miners - and I spent a month in West Virginia, which has the same problem as Pennsylvania - out of work, and this administration has been indifferent to it - the first act passed in 1953, pretty nearly, by this administration's leader in the Senate, Senator Knowland, when the Republicans controlled the Senate, was to repeal defense manpower policy No. 4. That policy provided that defense contracts would go into those areas where there was high unemployment. The fight was led by Senator Knowland, the leader of the Senate at that time."", ""I don't think that there is any person in the United States that can go to the polls on November 8 and say they stand for the same things. I disagree with Mr. Nixon across the board. My belief is that the United States has to move ahead. We cannot provide security for our people, we cannot provide employment for our people, we cannot educate our children, we cannot care for the aged, we cannot speak with strength as the leader of the free world, unless we have a strong and vital and prosperous economy here in the United States, and that is the question, and that is the issue. What is the possible use of pointing fingers at Khrushchev or making great speeches, when every poll taken in the last 12 months by the State Department around the world shows that they do not believe any longer that the United States is the strongest country in the world."", 'How can we lead an alliance? Who prepares for battle, as the Bible tells us, when the trumpet blows an uncertain sound? We are as strong abroad as we are at home. We are as strong in the fight against communism as we are in Pennsylvania. The hope for freedom in Eastern Europe rests with our strength, our determination, our unwavering determinations to carry this fight for freedom in this country and around the world until ultimately freedom prevails. And we will not do that unless this community and this State and this country are working forward, moving forward. And if you believe in a dangerous and challenging and changing time that we ought to stand still, if you look to the past instead of the future, if you believe that every thing that must be done is being done in its own good time, Mr. Nixon is your kind of candidate. [Response from the audience.]', 'But if you share my view that the United States as the leader of the free world has to lead, that the United States must move in the sixties, that this is the most dangerous and challenging and promising time in the long life of our country, in the long life of freedom - in the next 8 years this world is going to be entirely different. It will be freer or it will be more enslaved, depending upon what we do. The responsibility is ours. We are the only sentinel at the gate. If we fail, freedom fails. If we succeed, if we present an image of power, then freedom is strengthened.', 'It is on this basis that I come to this community in the heart of the United States and ask your help on November 8. [Applause.]', 'Let me conclude by just saying that 100 years ago in the campaign of 1860, that campaign was fought over the issue of whether this Nation could exist half slave and half free. Now the question, 100 years later, is whether the world will exist half slave and half free, or whether it will move in the direction of freedom or in the direction of slavery.', 'I am reminded of what Lincoln wrote to a friend in the campaign a century ago: ""I know there is a God and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and I see His hand in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later, we know there is a God and we know He hates injustice. We see the storm coming and we see His hand in it. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
379,John F. Kennedy ,"October 28, 1960","['Since this campaign began, I have spoken in areas of heavy and prolonged unemployment in at least a dozen States. And I can tell you that those of you who live in this area are not alone in having thousands of citizens who want to work, who are able to work, but who have gone for months and even years without finding work.', 'For the problem of America\'s depressed areas is not a local problem. It is a national problem, and one of great magnitude. There are now 159 areas of substantial unemployment, places officially classified as areas of ""substantial labor surplus."" America cannot afford areas of ""substantial labor surplus."" It needs full employment and full production in northeastern Pennsylvania and in every area if the entire Nation is to be prosperous.', ""A quarter of a million people, one out of every four, have already left this region to seek better opportunities. I don't think that makes sense. I don't want to see young people moving out of these valleys, families broken up, whole communities withering away."", 'It makes far better sense to move jobs into northeast Pennsylvania than to move people out to find jobs.', 'In 1956 I was the floor manager of the first area redevelopment bill ever to pass the Senate, a bill to provide long-term loans to new industry, to create new jobs for our distressed areas. It was killed by Republican opposition in the House.', 'Two years later we tried again. I joined in sponsoring a similar bill, the Flood-Douglas-Clark bill. The Democratic Congress passed it, but it was killed by a Republican veto.', 'This year we tried a third time, and again we succeeded in the Congress. But again our bill was struck down by a Republican veto.', 'The Republicans are around now claiming concern to depressed areas. But if they had only supported our bill in 1956, this city, and dozens of others, would have been receiving substantial help for the last 4 years. If they had only supported our bill in 1958, this city, and dozens of others, would have been adding new jobs and new industries for the last 2 years. And if they had only supported our bill this spring, this city, and dozens of others, would by this time find help on the way.', 'But the Republicans would not help this city in 1956 or 1958 or in the spring of 1960, and this city, in the fall of 1960, is not going to help the Republicans.', 'I assure you help will be on its way next year if you put a Democratic administration in office. There will be a new bill, and that bill will be signed.', 'The Republican candidate for President came to this very hall last month to apologize for those two Republican vetoes, and to make some new promises. I do not come to apologize; the Democratic Party comes with a record of performance. And I advise you not to trade performance for promises.', 'The Republican bills on this subject were pale shadows of the Democratic bills. They were limited in scope, they omitted essential provision - they would not have done the job.', 'When Mr. Nixon was here he claimed that the Republican bill would have brought more aid to Scranton and Wilkes-Barre than the Democratic bill.', 'But the fact is that these figures had absolutely no basis in fact. His bill did not specify any amount for any city in the United States, including Wilkes-Barre and Scranton.', 'Moreover, Mr. Nixon was talking about a Republican bill that was not even before the Congress when area redevelopment legislation was being considered. The bill he based his mythical figures on was introduced after the Democratic bill was vetoed, after the damage was done and Republican opposition had destroyed all prospect of passing any bill at all.', 'The fact is that our bill contained five times as much loan and grant money as the Republican bill. It contained provisions for vital public facilities and for aiding rural areas that their bill omitted altogether. The Republican bill did not provide the aid necessary to start sagging economies moving forward and the Republicans knew it.', 'It all boils down to this: The Democrats gave you three bills. The Republicans gave you two vetoes.', ""The Democrats gave you action. The Republicans gave you a lot of fancy arithmetic. And you can't put people to work with arithmetic. A bill along the lines of the Flood-Douglas-Clark bill, to provide investment capital for new industries and retraining for workers, is the first point in a new and sweeping attack on the problem of distressed areas."", 'Secondly, we need some mechanism - such as that provided for by legislation now before the Congress - to provide an agency to whom your industrial development corporations and lending institutions can sell the mortgages on the industrial buildings which you have rented through your own enterprise. Under this FNMA-type assistance, the money which you have raised locally and which is now tied up in these buildings could be released and invested in additional new buildings to attract new industry.', ""Third, we need to press forward vigorously with research into new uses of coal. If anthracite can be used for building highways, for example, let's develop the necessary technology and start using it."", 'Fourth, as President, I will direct all agencies of Government to give priority, in all regular programs, to the needs to depressed areas. That includes in particular the Defense Department and other procurement agencies who have ignored the waste of idle workers and idle facilities in allocating contracts. It includes the agencies concerned with transportation, with flood control, with urban renewal, with conservation. The Youth Conservation Corps, which I have supported as a means to provide employment for idle young men, can carry on conservation projects and assist in the reforestation and rehabilitation of areas disfigured by abandoned mining operations.', 'Of special importance to this area, the Federal Government should participate fully with the State of Pennsylvania in studies and action to eliminate the threat to life and property from the flooding and the subsidence of abandoned mines underneath our cities.', 'But let us be frank about this: None of these measures will do any real and lasting good for northeast Pennsylvania, unless our whole national economy is put back on the track.', 'Since 1953, our economy, which has been restrained by Republican policies, has had the lowest rate of growth of any major industrial nation in the world.', 'When the economy is not growing, few businesses are looking for new sites in which to locate plants. And when 159 areas of substantial unemployment are competing for the few new plants that are being built, no single area like Scranton can do much on its own.', 'And, what is worse, most economists now agree that another recession is underway.', 'The Vice President has denied this, of course, but the figures speak for themselves. The gross national product has fallen. Business is at a lower level than 6 months ago. Steel is at barely half capacity, homebuilding at two-thirds. Unemployment has been at recession levels for months, and the hours of work and take-home pay of factory workers has fallen.', 'I am sure that the people of Scranton and of Pennsylvania do not want to trust their economic future to a political party which now threatens its third recession in just 6 years.', 'The unconcern of the Republican candidate about all this is not surprising. Last May he said ""Unless unemployment goes over 4.5 million, it doesn\'t become a significant issue in the minds of a great many people."" In June, he said, ""I recognize that in a free economy you can\'t have full employment.""', ""Mr. Nixon says you can't have full employment. I say, we must have full employment."", 'I want an America that provides opportunity for young people to work and to work in the towns and cities where they grow up. I want an America that provides security for those who are employed.', 'The Republican Party and its candidate offer neither. The next administration is pledged to both.', 'Finally, and most important, all this relates to our position in the world, and our hopes for peace.', 'If our country is strong at home, we will be respected abroad.', 'If we solve the pressing problems of our own people, then we will be looked to for guidance by the new and emerging peoples of the world. But if we fail to solve our problems, then those nations will look for leadership to the Soviet Union and to Communist China.', 'Let us get America moving forward once again. Let us bring into our Government new vision and new vigor, to tackle and to solve the problems which our Nation faces wherever they may be - in Latin America, in Asia, in Africa, in Europe - and right here in Scranton, Pa.']"
380,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Distinguished guests, Members of the Congress, of the State senate, Governor Lawrence, ladies and gentlemen, Governor Lawrence and I have been seeing the State of Pennsylvania for the last 2 days. I was somewhat discouraged when we started out this morning in Delaware County to be informed that in 1936 Delaware County went for Alf Landon 8 to 1. So I knew we were in for one of those political days. But I must say that it was very good this morning, and in Montgomery County, and maybe we won't do so badly after all. [Applause.]"", ""This campaign is now about to move into its last week, beginning on Tuesday, and with nine more days to go, I believe the issues are clearly developed. The program proposed by the candidates have been frequently stated. I don't think there is any doubt that there are serious and significant differences between Mr. Nixon and myself, which affect our present position and affect the view of the future of our country."", 'My own judgment is, and I do not believe that I am being unfair, that his message this fall has lacked a certain urgency which I feel the events of this country and the world require. I believe they have been committed in his message more to the present than to the future, and I think as citizens of the United States we in this country have to consider not only our obligations to ourselves, but also our obligations to all those who look to us for leadership. Tonight I speak in a historic spot, a spot which is associated in the minds of all Americans with the American Revolution and our Declaration of Independence. I speak, of course, in this campaign of 1960 of a different revolution, but one which tests our stamina, our perseverance, and our determination to survive, to endure, and ultimately to prevail in the same way that it did at the beginning of this country. I had said on many occasions in this campaign that we stand on the edge of the new frontier, a frontier that will demand of all of us, wherever we may live, in the White House or individual homes, the same qualities of courage and conviction in 1960, for we are going to move, in the next decade, into the most challenging, changing, revolutionary policy, and hazardous decade in the long years of this country, and perhaps in the long history of freedom. [Applause.]', 'But these years can also be rewarding years as well. The Chinese word ""crisis"" is composed of two characters, one signifying danger and the other signifying opportunity. Men knew the meaning of danger, but they also preserved the opportunity for the future, and the new frontiers of 1960\'s will bring us both danger and opportunities. Our task is to overcome the dangers in order to see the opportunities. What are the new frontiers of the 1960\'s? We can foresee, first, changing revolution abroad, new nations, new weapons, new shifts in the balance of power new members of the nuclear club, but equally earthshaking, equally fraught with danger and opportunity are the revolutionary changes which will take place in the life of all Americans.', 'First is the new frontier of population; 1960 will conclude the largest 10-year growth in population in the history of the United States, a growth which equals the entire population of Poland or of Spain. By 1970 our population in the United States will number 208 million, and to maintain and advance living standards for that number of people will require a gross national income of three quarters of a trillion dollars. That requires a rate of growth no less than 5 percent a year, and we are not growing at that rate today. Our average for the past 8 years was 2.5 percent. Our average for the last 9 months is -0.2 percent.', 'To secure full employment for the number of men and women who will come into the labor market in the next decade will require that we secure 25,000 new jobs every week for the next 10 years. We are not finding those jobs today. To adequately house that population, we will have to build double the number of homes we are building today, and it is a somber fact that we are building 30 percent less homes today than we did a year ago. The new frontier of population holds out great promise for this country and also critical problems.', 'Second is the new frontier of longevity. About 10 percent of our year the percentage of population is over the age of 65, and every year the percentage of our population that is over 65 is increasing, and in addition the average longevity per person is increasing. What is going to happen to those people? Who is going to sustain them? Who is going to help them spend their useful lives with some degree of security, housing, food, and so forth?', 'Will these extra years that medical experience is adding to their lives be a curse or a blessing? Will they be in poverty or will they be in security? Forcing a retired worker to stop working at 65 years of age and depend on an average social security check of $72 a month does not offer that man or woman much security. I believe we can do better and I believe the way to do better is to provide medical care for the aged which is tied to social security, so that the worker himself during his fruitful years can participate in the sustaining of his security when the time has come to retire. [Applause.]', ""The third opportunity is on the new frontier of education. Pouring into our schools in the next 10 years will be 51 million children who were born in this country between 1946 and 1956, a number greater than the entire population of the United States in 1880. They have already created the most critical classroom shortage in the history of our country. In the 1960's, as the problem becomes more acute, as the group grows, they are going to be pouring into our colleges. There will be twice as many young boys and girls applying for admission in 1970 than today. We are going to have to build more college classrooms and dormitories in the next 10 years than we built in the history of our country. [Applause.]"", 'There is an old saying that the course of civilization is a race between catastrophe and education. In a democracy such as ours, we must make sure that education wins the race. [Applause.]', ""Fourth is the new frontier of suburbia, the fastest growing portion of the United States. Most suburban areas have gained more residents in the past 10 years than in the previous century. That will be increased in the sixties. Most suburban areas, as you know yourself, from your own experience, are ill prepared to sustain that growth. The property tax in most urban communities has reached the point of diminishing returns. It has reached in some communities the point of a capital levy, and we cannot expect that the property tax will furnish, in the 1960's, the same income for the sustenance of the public sector that it has sustained in the 1940's and the 1950's. I come from a city where the property tax is about $103 or $104 per thousand dollars, and the assessments reasonably high, and at that point I say it becomes confiscatory. The next administration is going to have the problem of at tempting to provide the necessary revenues to be secured for the local and State and National Governments in such a way that these communities can meet their problems."", 'Fifth are the new frontiers of science and in space. The wonders of atomic energy which lay such a curse upon mankind today can also be a blessing, for medicine, communications and power. The conversion of salt water to fresh water - all the credit that the Soviet Union gained when it launched sputnik, a credit which they still have in great quantities, according to Mr. George Allen of the USIA, that one scientific breakthrough caused a world change in the opinion of scientific advances relative to the Soviet Union and the United States. Imagine the credit that will go to the first country that is able to secure fresh water from salt water at a competitive rate, and all those deserts that border the oceans of the world can then be made to produce food. And this administration has starved that program, treated it as a step-child, even though it could mean so much to the United States. [Applause.]', ""Sixth is the problem which is undiscussed today but which may be one of the most difficult problems that the next President of the United States and the United States faces, and that, of course, is the problem of automation. I spent enough time in West Virginia, which shares a comparable problem with Pennsylvania, which is the present increase in production being far greater per man in coal. What has happened in coal will happen in other industries in the United States. We have to have 25,000 jobs per week, as I stated, but what is going to happen to the men and women that will be displaced by these machines? Unless the next administration is able to stimulate and develop an atmosphere which will develop economic growth, provide for replacement of our present machinery in such a way to stimulate the economy, by taxation, fiscal and monetary policy, then, of course, our hope to maintain full employment will remain a hope. But the problem of automation cannot be considered a local problem but a national problem in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'Seventh, and finally, is the problem of what we are all going to do with our leisure time. With the coming of automation, the expansion of the labor force, the extension of the lifelines of each individual, the speed of modern communication and transportation, all contribute to the amount of time that each American will have for himself and his family. If we continue to ignore the polluting of our streams, the littering of our national forests, we will be denying to ourselves and to our children a heritage which we were the beneficiaries of. With more and more cars on more and more highways, requiring more and more of our space, if we permit our lives individually to decline so that leisure time becomes a burden rather than an opportunity, quite obviously we have lost more than we have gained.', 'Twenty-four years ago, Franklin Roosevelt told the Nation: ""I for one do not believe that the era of the pioneer is at an end. I only believe that the area of pioneering has changed."" [Applause.] The new frontiers of which I speak call out for pioneers from every walk of life, from the White House in Washington and in the country at large. Their challenge can be concealed for a little while, but it cannot be ignored, it cannot be met by an easy complacency, a satisfaction with things as they are, a commitment of things done and not to be done, for as the Old Testament tells us, ""This challenge is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. Who shall go over the sea for us and bring it on to us that we may do it, for the world is very near onto thee in thy mind and in thy heart."" The new frontier of which I speak is very near to you and to me. It is upon us. The only question is if the United States is ready for it. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
381,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, first, for standing in the rain. I just heard that it is raining where Mr. Nixon is. [Applause.] But the Republicans are all home. We are out here in the rain, as we are in the sunshine, as we are in the daytime, as we are at night, because this is an important campaign for a great office of a great country, and I come here and ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.]', ""This is a campaign between those who want action and those who are ready to stand still, between those who look to the future and those who look to the past, between those who say that this country is going to have to move in the sixties. As long as 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls graduating from high school never get to college, as long as 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills is unused, as long as we are building this year 30 percent less homes than we did last year, as long as we are sitting still - in other words, as long as our prestige and influence and power declines in the world in relation to that of our adversary, this country cannot be satisfied. I don't think any American can accept Mr. Nixon's words that everything that needs to be done is being done in its proper time, that our prestige is the highest it has ever been, and that of the Communists the lowest. I am not satisfied as an American to be anything less than first as a country, as the defender of freedom, as an example of freedom, and you have to make up your judgment on November 8 what kind of a country you want, what kind of a citizen you are, what you look for in the future, how ready you are to bear the burdens that go with being a citizen of this country, a defender of freedom, an example of freedom."", 'The United States is going to be only as strong in the world, freedom is going to be only as strong in the world in direct ratio to how powerful we are. The thing that gives Mr. Khrushchev his power is the productive force of the Soviet Union. The thing that makes the Chinese Communists now dangerous as opposed to years ago is because they have harnessed all of the energy and the resources, human and material, for the service of the state. We believe in freedom, and we believe in the long run that our system has the most staying power and the most vitality. But our system cannot work without leadership. Unless the President of the United States looks to the future, unless he is willing to set before our country its unfinished business in the same way that Franklin Roosevelt set it before it in the thirties, and Woodrow Wilson before him, unless he is willing to move ahead this country cannot possibly meet its responsibilities to itself and to those who look to us for assistance and help.', 'We are the defenders of freedom and therefore it is incumbent upon us to build a strong and vital society, to build a society which is moving here at home, to build a society which can be an example of what free men and women can do, which permits every American, regardless of his race or his creed, to develop his talents fully, which puts people to work, which educates our children, which permits those who are retired to live in dignity. To build, in other words, the kind of society which all men over the world will want to duplicate. That is our responsibility in the sixties. And I believe to do that we have to elect men and women who are committed to progress, not those who are committed to the status quo. This is a race between the contented and the concerned, between those who are satisfied and those who wish to move ahead. I am confident that here in this Keystone State, the people of Pennsylvania are prepared for action and progress. On that basis, I ask your help. [Applause.]']"
382,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, State senator-to-be Mr. Gore, I thank him for his generous introduction, and I also want to acknowledge with pleasure the presence on this platform of the next U.S. Congressman from this district, Henry Gouley. [Applause.] Governor Lawrence, Congressman Green, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for your coming down. I think you are here for the same reason that I am here, and that is because we are engaged in the most sober function of a citizen of a free country, and that is the selection of a President of the United States. [Applause.] One of the principles which have guided Mr. Nixon or approaches which have guided Mr. Nixon in his approach to this campaign [comment from the audience]. I sympathize with that sentiment, but today [laughter] one of the matters which Mr. Nixon and I have disagreed on has been his feeling that we could separate domestic policy from international policy. He wrote a letter last May that he was a practicing conservative, but on another occasion he said he was a risktaker abroad. It does not seem to me that you can possibly separate what we do here at home from what we do abroad. In other words, if 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never finish college, or never get to college, that affects our position not only in the United States, but it affects our position around the world. If we are only using our steel capacity in the State of Pennsylvania and in the United States at 50 percent of capacity, that affects not only the unemployed steelworkers, it affects not only the small businessmen who live in the communities where steelworkers work, but it also affects our position all around the globe. If we are building 29 percent less homes this year than we built last year, if we are not practicing the principles that we preach in providing fair opportunity for all Americans, that affects us not only in this country, but it affects our position around the world. In other words, the influence, prestige, and purpose of the United States was never more strongly felt around the world than it was in the 1930's during the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] There are Roosevelt parks and squares all over Latin America. I don't really think that there are very many that are a salute to the present administration, and yet during the thirties the good neighbor policy did not really mean very much as far as real policies which benefited the people, but they were impressed by President Roosevelt and they were impressed by the United States, because they had the sense of national purpose here in this country. Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America because he was a good neighbor in the United States. [Applause.] Woodrow Wilson was able to put forward his 14 points and have them fall with great impact in Europe because he had been identified during his term of office with the New Freedom, a progressive policy here in the United States."", 'The point is that if we are meeting our responsibilities, in this country, if we are educating our children--', 'Dick? [Laughter.] The voters are down here, not up there. [Laughter.]', 'If we are educating our children by giving them the best education we can, and it is a sober fact that 10 years ago we were turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union, and now one-half as many - if we are going to educate our children, providing full use of the capacity of our plants and men and potential of our industries in the United States, providing medical care for the aged tied to social security, some kind of security to our older citizens, if we are providing opportunity for all citizens to advance their potential, then we are building a strong and vital society here at home, and then we speak with purpose around the world.', 'The strongest force of the United States throughout the world rests with a strong and growing and vital society here in the United States. In other words, you cannot separate progress here at home from progress abroad. We are as strong abroad, we counter the Communist advance as successfully as we build a vital and strong society here at home. And I do not believe, therefore, that it is possible for us to speak with power and vigor, that it is possible for us to rally the free people of the world wherever they may live unless we speak with purpose in the United States. [Applause.]', 'Our function and responsibility as the chief defenders of freedom is to build a strong and shining society here in the United States a society with purpose, a society with strength, and then hold out hope to all those hundreds of millions of people stretching around the globe who want to live their lives in freedom.', 'The most encouraging factor in the last 10 years has been one that has seen in country after country behind the Iron Curtain, in country after country in Africa, in country after country in Asia, the desire of people to be free.', 'Finally, in the final analysis, if we can maintain our strength, if we can last this long race of nerve and will, this test of our national determination, the final blow which will be struck to the Communist empire will be based on this desire of people to govern their own destiny. If there is any fact that has emerged from the stream of history, whether it is East Germany, Hungary, or Poland against the Communists? or the experience of Africa against Western colonialism, it is the desire of people to be independent. We know it from our history. Therefore, what we have to do is maintain our strength, to spread the umbrella of freedom around the globe. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ""The disease of liberty is catching"", and ultimately it will catch around the globe. What we have to make sure is that during these years, when this disease is spreading, that we maintain our strength, that we offer it shelter, that we offer it encouragement, that we move this country and in moving our country, move the globe. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
383,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, the next Congressman from this district, Warren Ballard, ladies and gentlemen, Walter Frye, who is running for the assembly in this State - and we need good assemblymen, we need good State senators, we need good Congressmen, we need good U.S. Senators, and we need a President, [Applause.] And that is why I am here today.', 'I was informed when I started out this morning that we were going to travel in Delaware County which voted 8 to 1 for Alf Landon. We are going to wipe that record out. [Applause.] No county in the United States should have that reputation. [Laughter.] * * * [Inaudible.] * * * But this is the year for Delaware, Montgomery, Massachusetts, the United States, to choose progress, to move forward, and I come here today and ask your support. [Applause.]', ""No one can say with any certainty what is ever going to happen on election day. But I want to make it very clear that when election day is finished, or, rather, when it begins, I will be satisfied and hope I will be satisfied when it is over. But in any case, I believe that the Democratic Party and this campaign is on the side of right, is on the side of the best long-range interests of our country, stands for the things I hope in 1960 which are in accordance with the best judgment that we can render on the needs of our country. I don't know of any Democratic candidates - certainly this is true of our vice-presidential candidate or myself - that have gone to the people in the election of 1960 and talked anything but the truth as we understood it, and as we saw it and what represented the needs of our country."", 'Two thousand years ago when Athens was under attack from the Macedonians, Demosthenes in a great speech said, ""Our trouble comes from those who wish to please us, rather than serve us."" I hope after this campaign is over in 1960, whether it is successful or not, though I hope it is successful, but whether it is successful or not, I hope it will be recorded that the Democratic Party and its candidates in 1960 sought to serve the people, not please them. [Applause.] And my best judgment is that those who in 1960 seek to serve the people also please them, and I think that is the mistake Mr. Nixon has made. [Applause.] To go through the United States and talk, about our unparalleled prosperity as if there are no clouds on the horizon bigger than a man\'s hand, to talk about our position in the world as higher and stronger and greater than it has ever been in the past, to sound no alarm bell in the night, to express no urgency, to fail to warn that these are dangerous and hazardous days, full of opportunity and also of trouble, in my opinion misleads rather than misinforms, and no free people can possibly maintain their freedom unless they and those who seek positions of responsibility are willing to face the facts of life, the facts with the bark off, the truth, and the truth in 1960 calls for the American people to render an accurate judgment of their position of their country, their position in history, where they have been and where they are going. We face new problems, entirely different from those that have faced the Eisenhower administration or that of Harry Truman or Franklin Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson. Those names may be invoked by both parties. But as we move across the frontier of 1960 into the sixties, the problems which our country will face of economic growth, of development of our resources, of the development of outer space, of fresh water from salt water, of food from the ocean, of new uses for old minerals, of the undeveloped world and its economic development, of the peaceful use of the atom, the control of atomic weapons, the developments in the camps of our adversaries between the Russians and the Chinese, the development of countries of Africa newly independent, but without the resources to maintain their independence in the traditional sense - all those are entirely new problems, requiring new people, new solutions, new ideas, and requiring above all a sense of dedication to the cause of freedom.', ""I do not find in the speeches of my opponent any sound of commitment to this new future, any awareness that we live in the most revolutionary of all times, that here in this old section of Pennsylvania which was the scene of a great revolutionary struggle at the beginning of our country, we move through a period far more revolutionary, far more promising, far more dangerous. So I come not merely as a contestant with Mr. Nixon for a prize. I come representing a point of view which I hope the majority of our fellow citizens share, that in the great days of the 1960's, we as Americans individually and as a country must measure up to the responsibility which has been placed upon us by our own free choice and by the pressure of history, to be the chief defenders of freedom at a time when freedom is under attack all over the globe. I am confident that this country can meet its responsibilities. I see no peril, no burden that this country cannot sail through, unless we attempt to fool ourselves that these are easy, gentle, and prosperous times, without responsibility, without burden. We face an adversary who mobilizes all of the resources of the state for the service of the state. Young men and women in Moscow are studying esoteric dialectics of Africa and India, prepared to spend their lives in those countries as servants of international communism, prepared to work for the service of the state without regard to their own free choice. Young men and women in our universities pursue their own interest, if they should study language, occasionally French, some Spanish, and once in a while Russian. How many of those young men and women will be willing to spend their lives in far off lands in the service of freedom? The 1960's will require more from each of us than we have given in the past. But as for me, I am confident that this country will meet challenges. I am confident that we will continue to be the great defender of freedom, and I am more confident than ever that freedom will prevail. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
384,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, the next Congressman, Henry Gouley, Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Congressman Green, Mr. Connor, ladies and gentlemen, it is 9 in the morning and this will be a quiet, dignified speech. [Laughter.] The interesting thing about campaigning in Pennsylvania is that we gave a speech at some banquet at 2 o'clock in the morning and now we are starting at the o'clock of 2 in the morning. But whether it is two o'clock in the morning or 9 o'clock in the morning, I believe that the morning - I believe that the message, in a real sense, is the same. That is that this election on next Tuesday, November 8, a week from Tuesday, involves the selection of a President not only in the traditional sense, but also involves the selection of a President of the United States which is the leader of the free world. Back in President Truman's library in Missouri, which I visited a month ago, he has five hats which the President of the United States wears: the legislative leader, the employment leader, the leader of the Nation, the leader of the free world, the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States."", ""After 14 years in the Congress, without any way downgrading the Congress, there isn't any doubt that the center of action in the American constitutional system is the President of the United States. The Constitution places the greatest responsibility for the conduct of our foreign affairs, particularly, upon the President, and unless the President of the United States speaks for the Nation, unless the President of the United States is able to personify the force of the Nation, then the Nation does not move ahead, does not move to accomplish its unfinished business, does not give an image of vitality and strength throughout the world."", 'One of the issues which has been discussed with the greatest frequency in this campaign, and one of the issues on which Mr. Nixon and I have differed, has been the position of the United States in the world, all summed up in the word ""prestige."" By prestige I do not mean popularity. I do not think it makes so much difference whether we are loved personally or beloved around the world. What does make a difference, however, is that the people of the world who desire to be free - Africa, Latin America, Western Europe, Asia, the Middle East - I want them to look at the United States, not only as a powerful leading nation, but also a nation which personifies the ideal of what freedom can accomplish. Prestige is important, but if these people upon whom we depend for our security, our support, and ultimately the peace, ever begin to get the idea that we are tired, uncertain, not sure where we are going, without purpose, how can we lead a free alliance? As the Bible says, Who prepares for battle when the trumpet gives an uncertain sound?', ""No matter how many speeches, Mr. Nixon may make about how high our prestige is today, the fact of the matter is that the State Department's own survey taken this summer shows such a loss in our influence throughout the world that this administration has been unwilling to release it. The New York Times carried one this morning which shows - this week, which shows that only 7 percent of the people of England and France thought we were now ahead of the Soviet Union in science, that a majority of people in all the 10 countries polled, with the exception of 1, thought that by 1970 the Soviet Union would be ahead of us, militarily and scientifically."", 'If the people of the world ever begin to get the idea that our high noon was in the past, that the balance of power and the flow of history is moving in the direction of our adversaries, we have lost then a decisive battle. We depend upon the free support of people, but they also depend upon a leadership which is certain, which has power, which has strength. What you have to decide on November 8 is, Do you believe that Mr. Nixon with the campaign that he has conducted, with the statements which he has made, which have been so far removed from reality, can move this Nation in 1961 as it must be moved if we are going to maintain our position in the free world? [Comment from the audience.]', 'I must say I feel the same as you do. I have been trying to get that opinion over.', 'I think it is important what kind of campaign a candidate runs. I spent some time in England before World War II and I recall very clearly the election of 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the danger of a rearmed Germany, Stanley Baldwin, the head of the Conservative Party of England at that time, chose to go to the people in that election telling them that all was well, that their future was peaceful, and, as a result, the British lost 2 years which could have been devoted to preparing for action. And they had a narrow escape.', ""I don't want to play with thin margins. I don't think that any candidate for the office of the Presidency in 1960 should go to the people with anything but the truth, and then the people can decide what they want. The decision you must make is, What kind of a country do you want? What kind of a position do you believe we should occupy in the world? I believe the position that we occupy in the world and our chance for peace is directly related to the kind of society that we have here in the United States. If we have a country which is on the move, if we have an educational system second to none, if we can attract people to our government, both in this country and throughout the world, who are motivated by intellectual curiosity, concern for the future, foresight, responsibility, then quite obviously the United States will begin to go forward again."", ""Do you know that 10 years ago we brought more foreign students to the United States then we do today under the governmental program? Do you know the Soviet Union broadcasts 10 times as many programs in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know we had more people stationed in West Germany in 1957 than throughout all of Africa? I don't believe that this administration has been foresighted. I don't believe that they have understood the kind of revolutionary world in which we live. If they had, we would not be second in space. We would not find ourselves today with six new countries of Africa, all members of the United Nations, that do not have a single U.S. diplomat in residence in any of the countries."", ""One of the results of this indifference to the whole change of circumstance in one continent has been on the question of the admission of Red China. Not one of the new nations voted with us. All this, our position through the world, our influence in space and on the globe, is all tied to the kind of society that we run here. Will we move forward with vigor in the United States? If we develop our economy here in the country, if we provide a strong and fruitful existence for our people here, if we, the President of the United States and the people, set before ourselves the goals which we must accomplish in the next 10 years, then I believe the United States can speak with vigor, determination, and decisiveness throughout the world. So I come here today and ask your support. This is not merely a contest between Mr. Nixon and myself, and in a very real sense it is not a contest just between the two parties. It is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, those who are satisfied with things as they are, and those on the other hand who wish to move forward. So I come here today and ask your support in this campaign, support for the candidate for the Congress in this district, but most of all our support for our country in a difficult time, one which can be, in Mr. Dickens' phrase, the worst of times or the best of times. In the final analysis it depends on us and what we want for our country. For myself, what I want is for the United States to meet its responsibilities at home and abroad and for the United States to move again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

It does not make any difference to any of us, I am sure, whether it is raining, shining, night or day, because this is an important election. [Applause. ] What you have to decide, as voters, a week from Tuesday, you have to make your decision on which candidate, which party, which political philosophy, should lead the United States in the 1960's and you have to make a judgment specially as to which candidate somebody is pouring water on us [laughter] - which candidate's judgment, foresight, viewpoint, vigor, should govern and lead this country in the 1960's."", 'I have several disagreements with Mr. Nixon that are important to you, I think, in trying to make up your minds. The other day, about 2 months ago, Mr. Nixon, in disputing my statements that I thought that we had not had sufficient progress in recent years, speaking in Portland, Oreg., said, ""If you think the United States has stood still, who built the largest shopping center in the world?""', 'Well, now, the answer to that question is that we did, but the Soviet Union built the largest dam, the largest missile, the largest army. And it was even suggested by Mr. Nixon in his famous debate with Mr. Khrushchev - and I wish he would debate me for the fifth time [applause] - but in his famous debate - I find some difficulty understanding why a candidate who is running on a program, that he can stand up and debate Mr. Khrushchev but is so unwilling to come and debate [before] the American people. [Applause.]', 'I understand that Mr. Nixon issued a statement today saying that he would debate me if I would say I was sorry that I said he would not debate me. [Laughter.] First, he wanted to discuss just Cuba, and we said, ""Well, we thought we ought to discuss some other subjects."" Then he wanted the vice presidential candidates in there, and I said that was fine. Then he wanted an hour and a half, and I said that was fine. I said I would go to any city on any date, and I said that was fine. Then he said, ""You have to say you are sorry you said I would not debate."" Mr. Nixon can debate or not debate, whatever he wants to do. I am not going to drag him up in front of the microphone. [Applause.]', 'In this famous debate with Mr. Khrushchev he put his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s nose, and said, ""You may be ahead of us in rockets, but we are ahead of you in color television."" [Laughter.] I would rather take my television black and white and have the largest rockets in the world. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon has also said that it is dangerous and naive, and all the rest of the adjectives, for us to suggest that we may not be doing as well as we should in the world. But who do you think said this in February of this year, in South Bend, Ind.? ""Glossing over weaknesses which we may have; denying that they exist, is not only naive, but it is really dangerous."" That was Mr. Nixon\'s pre-convention. And no more unwarranted attack - he has been criticizing me for downgrading the United States. I don\'t downgrade the United States. I don\'t downgrade the United States. I downgrade the Republican leaders. [Applause.] And who do you think says these words, in 1952, in October: ""This Nation has lost its military superiority, and the people of the world are 5 to 1 against us, instead of being 9 to 1 on our side, as was the case when the war ended.""', 'I never made any rash, imprudent statement like that, but Mr. Nixon made them in the campaign of 1952, running against the Democrats. [Applause.] The fact of the matter is that these are difficult, dangerous times, in which we have great opportunities and great challenges, and the only way that I know that a free society can meet its responsibilities is for those who seek to lead a free society to speak the truth. What is the possible use in taking a survey of foreign opinion, which we took this summer, and then putting it in the State Department and not letting the people - have the country see it. What contribution does that make to the Government of a free society? Mr. Nixon said, ""American prestige is at an all time high,"" 2 weeks ago. He denied there was a recent Government survey that proved the contrary. Then he said the Government survey was taken in 1957, after sputnik. Now we find out it was taken in July of this summer, and the New York Times has printed some of it in the last 2 days. And it shows that only 7 percent of the people of France and England believe the United States is now ahead of the Russians in science. It shows a majority of the people of the world believe the Soviet Union will be ahead of us militarily by 1970. We should know these things. If we seek to lead people, and they begin to feel that the balance of power is turning against us, how many supporters will we have in the world? What good is it to bury it in the State Department until after election? Let us have it now, and then the people can make up their minds. [Applause.]', 'No.3, as Mr. Nixon said we are first in space and the strongest power militarily in the world. But the fact of the matter is and then he said we put up 28 shots into the space and the Soviets have put up 8. But the question is what is the tonnage of their shots? What was the timing of their shots? The fact is in his recent position paper on space, he said, ""The space gap is not yet closed."" If Mr. Nixon and Mr. Nixon would debate, we would really have an interesting discussion. [Applause and laughter.]', 'Then, No.3, Mr. Nixon said we are enjoying unprecedented prosperity. I would like to have him make that speech in some of the places I was in yesterday, coal mine areas, factories, 50 percent of capacity in steel, even less than that in coal. But then the White House added, ""Unemployment is widely disappearing. We are nearing the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of our land."" This year we built 30 percent less homes than last year. This year we are only using 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills. I believe we will do better than that and I believe we have to do better than that if we are going to meet our responsibilities in the 1960\'s. [Applause.]', 'The whole point of this is that this is an important election. You have to make up your judgment yourselves. Nothing that I can say, nothing that Mr. Nixon can say, especially on different days - nothing that he can say or I can say in the final analysis can make you decide better than you can decide yourselves, what the position of your country, what your view is of the future.', ""Our greatness is based on the final premise that the people themselves, working among themselves, making their final decision, will make a judgment which fits the best interest of our country. If we did not accept that premise, then the whole concept upon which a democracy is based would be hollow. But we accept that premise, we believe it, that the majority of the people, electing whoever they think best to serve their country, in making that judgment you have to make your own conclusion about where your country is and what it needs. If you feel that what we are now doing is good enough, if you feel that our position in the world is sound enough, and on the rise, then Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] I have that same view. [Laughter.] If you feel that Mr. Nixon is your man [laughter] but if you have same view that I do, that this great country of ours has to do better, that we have to maintain and build and develop a strong enough society here, not only to sustain ourselves, but also to sustain all those who look to us for hope, I believe 1960 can be the worst of years or the best of years. I believe it can be the best of years. I believe that the 1960's can be recorded as years in which the great Republic moved ahead. [Applause.]"", 'Therefore, I come to this shopping center, which is not the largest in the world, but it is large enough, to ask your support. I appreciate your coming here in the rain. We are engaged in a most important function. We are engaged in our great responsibility as citizens. My responsibility as leader of the Democratic Party in this campaign into present our case. Your responsibility on November 8 is to make your own good judgment about what this country must do. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
386,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, Congressman Green, Mr. Rice, Warren Ballard, the next Congressman and one of the great Americans of the day, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate that I am understanding it. I understand that earlier today there was a meeting here of the children's party for UNICEF, which is a United Nations organization, which is committed to the ending of children's diseases around the world, and instead of having a Halloween party everyone contributed to that. May I say that I think that is in the best tradition of this country's humane and sympathetic effort. Government to government work is important, but in the final analysis we are a free society depending upon the effort that each of us makes, and, therefore, I congratulate those who were connected with this effort this afternoon. When we look at the amount of disease which afflicts children of all parts of the globe, particularly in Africa and Asia, it staggers the imagination and offers a great challenge to us. It is sometimes tragic for us to realize in thinking of the problems which face us in the 1960's, that one of the great contributions which the United States made to international understanding and good will was the sending of penicillin to cure some of the diseases which inflicted the people of north Africa. But as a result of ending those diseases, the population of those areas so increased beyond the food supply that instead of increasing the per capita standard of living, the per capita standard of living went down."", 'So it is not enough to cure disease. If a standard of living of a country depends in the past on 3, 4, or 5 million children out of 10 dying, their first year, and we are able to save all those children, then there is not enough food supply to go around.', 'The point of all this is twofold. First, that I am delighted that the effort is made to participate in a humane and useful work, and secondly, it suggests the staggering complexity of the problems that face the United States as the leader of the free world in 1960. We fight against disease, we insure longer life; we do not increase food supply, and therefore the standard of living of the people goes down. How is it possible for a country like Congo to maintain its freedom and independence when it has 12 university graduates in the whole country? How is it possible for Libya to maintain its freedom when the average income is $25 a year per person? How is it possible for India, where the average income is $65 per year per person, and nearly 50 to 60 million people are unemployed?', ""To be the leader of the free world will require the best effort of those of us in the United States. The point that I wish to make in this campaign is that we can't do our best to meet our responsibilities around the world unless we do our best here in this country, unless we are moving ahead here in the United States. As long as there are 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school and never see the inside of a college, as long as there are 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills unused, as long as we are today building 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago, as long as we are second in space, as long as we are not able to make progress to develop all of our potential and all of our resources, both human and material to serve the cause of freedom, then quite obviously we are not meeting our responsibilities and we cannot meet our responsibilities around the world. The difference of opinion between Mr. Nixon and myself in this campaign in short is this: He says that our prestige has never been higher, that of the Communists never lower; he suggests that everything that needs to be done is being done in its own good time, and he has chosen to run on a slogan of peace and prosperity."", 'My judgment is that what we are now doing is not good enough, that we need new people, new energy, new vision, new leadership. We need to attract people to our government service and the service of our country who today are in universities or, like you, are following your own interests. We need young men and women who will spend some of their years in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, in the service of freedom. We need others who will serve in governmental posts which lack glamor but which serve the cause of freedom. We have to do through freedom what the Communist system attempts to do through the power of the state. But to do that in a system of freedom where each man or woman can follow his own individual effort requires the best kind of leadership, a leadership which shares with the people the facts of our existence.', 'One of my disagreements with this administration and with Mr. Nixon has been on the argument of whether our prestige is the highest it has even been, and all of you know now that this summer the U.S. Government paid for polls taken in 10 countries, stretching all the way from England to Indonesia, to ask them what they thought of the United States, what they thought of our leadership, what they thought of our purpose, what they thought of our military power in relation to that of the Soviets, what they thought of our science in relation to that of the Soviets, and which system they thought was going to win the long struggle. These polls have never been revealed, except the newspapers did get two or three of them this week. They showed, for example, that only 7 percent of the people of England and France thought we were ahead of the Russians in science. The majority of the people in 9 of the 10 countries believe by 1970 the Soviet Union will be first scientifically and militarily.', ""Now, if they don't have confidence in us, if they don't believe that the future belongs to the free, belongs to the strong, belongs to the productive, if they believe that the Communist system is moving with more purpose and direction than we are, how can we lead to a free world coalition, which faces great difficulties anyway? I believe we can, and I believe that the truth should be told, I believe that the American people should have a clear and honest choice between two different candidates between two different philosophies of government, between two different views of our present opportunities, our present dangers, and our future, and I believe this country is great. I believe it can meet its obligations and responsibilities. But I believe it can only do it by moving ahead. I do not believe that the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon are committed to progress. [Applause.]"", 'I have yet to hear, and I have been in the Congress for 14 years, and I know all about the record then, but I have yet to hear of one single original piece of new, progressive legislation of benefit to the people, suggested and put into a fact by the Republican Party. [Applause.] Social security, unemployment compensation, housing legislation, care for the aged - all of these programs - civil rights - in 1953 and 1954 the Republican Party controlled the White House, the Senate and the House. Not one single civil rights bill saw the light of day in either body. [Applause.]', 'Social security? The Republicans voted 90 percent against social security in the mid-thirties and voted 99 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960. The Republicans voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the mid-thirties and voted 90 percent against the $1.25 minimum wage in 1960. If you think that party is committed to progress, then Mr. Nixon is your man. Response from the audience and applause.] But if you share my view, if you share my view that this country is going to have to move ahead, that progress is our most important commodity, if you share my view that it is time we picked ourselves up and moved into the sixties, I ask your support. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
387,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","['I speak tonight in a historic spot, in an area which will be forever associated with the qualities of courage and conviction. Here, on a cold and bitter frontier, men who believed that these States were and ought to be independent, dedicated their lives to the cause of freedom.', 'I have said in this campaign that we stand today on a new frontier, a frontier that will demand of us all, in each individual home as well as the White House those same qualities of courage and conviction.', ""For we are moving into the most challenging, the most dynamic, the most revolutionary period of our existence - the 1960's. The next 10 years will be years of incredible growth and change - years of unprecedented tasks for the next President of the United States."", 'But they can be rewarding years as well. In the Chinese language, the word ""crisis"" is composed of two characters, one representing danger and the other, opportunity. In that deadly winter at Valley Forge, men knew the dread meaning of danger, but they also preserved the bright hope of opportunity. And the new frontiers of the 1960\'s will present us with both dangers and opportunities. Our task is to overcome those dangers and seize those opportunities.', ""What are the new frontiers of the 1960's? We can foresee earth-shaking revolutions abroad - new nations, new weapons, new shifts in the balance of power and new members of the nuclear club. But equally earthshaking, equally fraught with both danger and opportunity, are the new frontiers we face here at home."", '(1) First is the new frontier of population. Nineteen hundred and sixty will conclude the largest 10-year growth in the history of our country, a growth which equals the entire population of Poland or Spain. By 1970, our population will have grown to 208 million people and to maintain an advancing standard of living for that many people, we will have to increase our gross national product to three-quarters of a trillion dollars. That requires a rate of growth no less than 5 percent a year, and we are not growing at that rate today. To secure full employment to that growing labor force, we will have to find 25,000 new jobs a week. We are not finding those jobs today. To adequately house that tremendous population, we will have to build double the homes we are building today. The new frontier of population holds out the promise of a greater country, greater markets, and greater prosperity but to meet those opportunities we will have to do better than we have been doing in the past 8 years.', ""(2) Second is the new frontier of longevity. Already nearly 10 percent of our population is over the age of 65. And medical research, if properly encouraged, is on the verge of new breakthroughs in learning the cause and cure of cancer, hardening of the arteries, and other diseases that take their toll in the later years of life. But will these extra years be a blessing or a curse? Will they be years of loneliness, poverty, high doctor bills, and low income? Or will they be years of dignity and security and recognition? Forcing a retired worker to get by on an average social security check of $72 a month or forcing him to take a pauper's oath before he can receive assistance on his medical bills is not the way to meet this challenge. I think we can do better."", ""(3) Third is the new frontier of education. Pouring into our schools in the next 10 years will be the nearly 51 million children who were born in this country between 1946 and 1958 - a number greater than our entire population in 1880. They are already creating the most critical classroom shortage in the history of our public schools. In the 1960's, as that problem grows even more acute, and as this wave grows older, it will spread into our colleges and universities as well. We will need, in this period immediately ahead, to recruit more new teachers for our public schools than all those presently in service combined. We will need to build more college classrooms and dormitories than we have built in the last 200 years. We will need to spend, as a nation, nearly twice as much on education as we are spending today. There is hardly a family in America that does not look forward to a son or daughter in college. But already our colleges are being overcrowded, their costs are rising, and some 50 percent of our top students do not receive a higher education. There is an old saying that civilization is a constant race between education and catastrophe. In a democracy such as ours, in an age such as this, we must make sure that education wins that race."", '(4) Fourth is the new frontier of suburbia, the fastest growing sector of the American population. Most suburban areas have gained more residents in the last 10 years than in the previous century, and that growth will be increased in the sixties. But they are not prepared. Their property tax can ill afford more schools and community facilities. Their transportation network into the city is overloaded already. Their patchwork growth cuts across the jurisdiction and ability of outmoded local governmental units to meet these problems. But as this urban sprawl continues to consume surrounding lands at a voracious rate, our older cities are already witnessing a tragic phenomenon: suburban slums. The next administration must meet these problems head on.', '(5) Fifth are the new frontiers in science and space. We are already racing from the jet age to the space age before meeting the safety, airport development, and other problems of the former. Space exploration that unravels the secrets of our universe, reconnaissance satellites that can replace a hundred U-2 planes watching over all the world, civilian travel in space vehicles, and the rule of law and disarmament in space itself, all these lie ahead of this generation. But we need not look only to the skies for new horizons. The wonders of atomic energy, if properly pursued, promise new miracles in medicine, refrigeration, communication, and power for our homes and factories. The conversion of salt water to fresh water - a project widely neglected in recent years - could end forever the domestic squabbles between the States of this Nation and the peoples of this earth and, if we develop it first, mean more to our prestige than all the Soviet moon-rockets combined in those underdeveloped nations where great deserts border great oceans. We must find ways in the sixties of obtaining an endless supply of food and power from the ocean depths themselves and of replacing our dwindling resources of energy from the granite that lies beneath every continent. And, if we can fulfill our hopes for peace, instead of beating our swords into plowshares, and our spears into pruning hooks, we can convert our bombs into power reactors that will electrify the frontier and the jungle.', '(6) Sixth is the new frontier of automation. In every kind of endeavor, in office work as well as industry, in skilled labor as well as common tasks, machines are replacing men, and men are looking for work. And this same revolution of technology is taking place on our farms, where the smallest number of farmers on the smallest acreage in our time has produced the largest crop, and the largest surplus, in our history. Our task is to harness the wonders of automation, to make it a blessing instead of a curse, to use its abundance wisely and generously. We cannot reverse the tide of technology, but lest we become its slave, let us make certain it serves the people.', '(7) Seventh and finally is the new frontier of leisure time. The coming of automation, the expansion of the labor force, the extension of the lifeline, and the speed of modern transportation, all contribute to the amount of time available to Americans outside of work. What will we do with that time? If we continue to ignore the polluting of our streams, the littering of our national parks, and the waste of our national forests, we will be denying to ourselves and our children a part of their rightful heritage. If more and more cars on more and more superhighways, requiring more and more parking places replace parks and playgrounds and scenic routes, if we permit the great medium of television to occupy more and more of our time with poorer and poorer programs appealing to the lowest common denominator, then we will be failing the public interest on this frontier in the same way that the quality of the old frontier was hurt by those who selfishly seized public lands or razed our great forests.', 'Twenty-four years ago, Franklin Roosevelt told the Nation: ""I, for one, do not believe that the era of the pioneer is at an end; I only believe that the area for pioneering has changed."" The new frontiers of which I speak call out for pioneers from every walk of life - in the White House in Washington, but in the country at large as well. Their challenge can be concealed for a little while, but it cannot be ignored, and it cannot be met by a soft complacency, a satisfaction with things as they are, or a commitment to the past. For as the Old Testament tells us, this challenge ""is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off * * * neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldst say: \'Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us * * * that we may do it?\' (for) the word is very near unto thee - in thy mouth - and in thy heart. * * *""', 'The new frontier of which I speak is not too hard for us, neither is it far off. No one need bring it to us, it is here, both its dangers and its opportunities, and we must meet its challenges here, in our hearts.']"
388,John F. Kennedy ,"October 29, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Green, Congressman Toll, Congressman-to-be, I hope, Ballard, from the nearby district - we need another Democratic Congressman from out there; if you will, elect him - Governor Lawrence, Senator Clark, candidates for the assembly and State senate, ladies and gentlemen, I want to express our thanks for your coming here today. We are both here for the same purpose, and that is to participate in the election of a President of the United States in a time of danger, hazard, and opportunity, and I want to make it very clear, though I keep reading about all the undecided voters that there still are in the United States, I think that anyone who listens to the speeches of the two candidates, who studies the record of the two parties, who studies our position in the world and our position in this country, cannot possibly be any longer undecided. You have to decide [applause] - Mr. Nixon said - and I have given our views and they are very different. You have to decide what you yourself want. You have to decide what you want to do, what you consider the country to be, what you regard our position in the world to be. The decision is now yours, and will be on November 8, a decision which involves your own conception of your responsibilities as an American, whether you look to the future or the present, whether you are concerned or confident, whether you are satisfied or feel, as I do, that the United States is going to have to do a great deal better, and I don't believe that Mr. Nixon, based on the record that he has made in this campaign, feels a similar urgency and concern about the future, or, if he does, he has not expressed it. [Applause.]"", 'I believe the sixties will be difficult for the United States. I do not believe that there is any doubt that we can maintain our freedom, but I think it is going to be a hard, close struggle to maintain the balance of freedom in the world today. Every advantage is not on our side. We are faced by dedicated adversaries who are confident of their ultimate success, who are able to mobilize their resources in order to serve their cause, and who are now on the offensive all around the globe. Anyone who feels that under these conditions, the conditions which face the United States here and throughout the globe, that we can carry on business as usual, or that we can entrust the leadership of the free world and the United States to an administration and a leader who runs in 1960 on the platform of peace, prosperity, ""We\'ve never had it so good,"" ""Our prestige has never been higher,"" ""Look how well we have done in the United Nations,"" and other similar statements which, in my opinion, bear increasing distance from reality, it seems to me the choice is very clear, and that is whether this country will meet its responsibilities to itself and to those who look to us for leadership, or whether they will entrust the leadership of this country to the Republican Party, which has not been noted in the past for its commitment to progress, to a leader who has not been known in the past or in the present for his commitment to the future, to a party which represents a narrow segment of the political philosophy of this country, which has opposed progress in nearly every great crisis in the history of this country in this century.', 'Woodrow Wilson and his efforts to commit us to the League of Nations, Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, Harry Truman and much of his program of mutual security [applause] - the undecided voter has to make his decision not about the candidates but himself what he wants, what he believes, what he feels. There is certainly sufficient difference in this campaign, there is certainly sufficient difference in our approach to the future and in our past records and that of our parties so that no voter should be left undecided by November 8.', 'The decision involves your own conceptions. It does not need a release of documents from the U.S. State Department to tell you of our position in the world. Any American who can run for the Presidency on the statement that our position has never been more secure, that we are the strongest country economically, scientifically, educationally, and productively, without suggesting that the ratio of power is not moving in our direction but in that of our adversaries, it does not seem to me serves the entire truth. [Applause.]', 'All of us are involved heavily in this engagement together. There is no separation between the problems that the next President of the United States will face and the problems that the people will face. There are common problems. There is no such thing as the President being in trouble without the people being in trouble. There is no such thing as the President being committed to progress unless the people are committed to progress, and in my judgment, on November 8, 1960, the United States is going to commit itself to progress, is going to commit itself to responsibility, is going to commit itself to assuming the obligations which go with leading the free world, and in my judgment this is an election which represents a watershed in the history of the 20th century in the same way that 1932 did and in the same way that 1912 did.', 'I ask your support in this election. I ask your support as we face a difficult and troublesome and promising time. I ask your support in picking this State of Pennsylvania and the United States up and moving it forward. [Applause.]', 'Every problem that we now have in the world has its direct counterpart here in the United States. The economic growth of the United States and the economic growth of underdeveloped countries, the distribution of food in underdeveloped countries, the distribution of our surplus here, the education of citizens for responsibility in the underdeveloped world, the education of all young men and women of talent here in the United States, the pursuit of science and outer space, the pursuit of securing at an economical price fresh water from salt, the control of arms, the control of nuclear weapons, the strengthening of free societies, welding them together into a great common force - all of that rests with us. If the United States fails, all this fails. If the United States succeeds, all this succeeds. Has any people ever had the responsibility and the opportunity which has been placed upon us by our own free choice as well as by the exigencies of history I I welcome the chance for the United States to be the great defender of freedom at a time when freedom is meeting its most serious test. [Applause.]', 'I come here, to this shopping center, which is a symbol of our material progress, and ask you to join in committing the United States to the defense of freedom all over the globe. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
389,John F. Kennedy ,"October 30, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, Mayor Dilworth, Senator Clark, Congressman Green - can anybody hear this? [Response from the audience.] Ladies and gentleman, can you hear that? Fellow Democrats ladies and gentlemen, I come here today to this community in the State of Pennsylvania to ask your support in this election, to ask you to join us in moving this country forward. [Applause.] You have to decide on next November 8, a week from Tuesday, not merely your choice between the two candidates, but also your judgment of what kind of leadership this country needs, what its position is in the world, and what we must do to make ourselves secure and provide peace for our people.', 'In my judgment there is a very clear choice offered by Mr. Nixon and myself, by the Republican and the Democratic Parties. If you hold the view that everything that needs to be clone is being done, in its own good measure, that our security has never been higher in the world, that our prestige is steadily increasing, that here in the United States we have full prosperity, that you are satisfied with an agricultural program that stores $9 billion worth of food to rot, if you are satisfied with all these things, then Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] But if you take the same view of the future that I do, that this great country of ours has to move ahead in the sixties, that we face great responsibilities, both in our own country and around the world, that the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon have not shown in the past, nor do they now show in the present, any conception of the needs of our free society - here in this State of Pennsylvania, which has 50 percent of its steel capacity unused, here in this State of Pennsylvania, where we built 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago, here in this State of Pennsylvania where there are coal miners and steelworkers and those who depend upon them, out of work, I cannot believe that you are going to select the Republican Party again. [Applause.]', ""Can you tell me what, in the last 25 years, what program the Republican leadership ever suggested that served the people? [Response from the audience.] Housing legislation and social security? Minimum wage? All of the programs that serve our people, that advance our country, that provide this country with vigor and vitality, education, security for our aged citizens under medical care under social security, all these programs have been initiated by the party which we lead in this campaign. And as you look at the sixties and recognize the need for new resolutions to new problems, I can't believe that this country will entrust the leadership to a candidate and a party that have opposed progress in the last 25 years. [Applause.] I don't make any pretense that the future is easy for this country. By the end of the next President's term of office, by 1968, by the end of his second term if he is reelected, there are going to be 82 million men and women eligible for jobs in this country. To find work for them we are going to have to have 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 8 years. Do you believe that this administration, which has moved us into a recession in 1954, and a recession in 1958, and a partial recession in 1960 can find 25,000 new jobs a week for the next 8 years? [Response from the audience.] And this is all going to come at a time when automation and machinery is taking the place of men and women. I believe that we have to educate our children, that we have to provide jobs for those who want to work, that we have to provide security for those who have retired, particularly for medical care, that we must build in this country a strong and vital society which serves as an inspiration and an example to all those who look to us with confidence and hope. I come to this community in the closing days of a long campaign. I come here after traveling in every State in the Union. I am more convinced than I ever was, and I have served this country for 18 years, I am more convinced than I ever was that this country can meet all of its responsibilities, all of its challenges, if only it will be governed by a concept of progress and energy and drive and efficiency, qualities for which the Republican Party has not been noted in the past. [Applause.]"", 'So I come here today, on a cold and windy Sunday, and ask your help in this campaign. I ask you to join us, to give us your hand, your voice, your support, join us in moving our country forward, join us in trying to do for this country what needs to be done if it is going to maintain its position in the world, if it is going to move ahead. Join us in moving America again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
390,John F. Kennedy ,"October 30, 1960","[""Mr. Nixon's campaign on domestic issues has three basic themes - themes as familiar and as old as the Republican Party itself:"", 'The first is the assertion that ""You\'ve never had it so good."" From ""stand pat"" with McKinley, to ""prosperity is just around the corner"" with Herbert Hoover, the Republicans have always told the American people that things have never been better, that we are approaching the limit of our capacity for growth and prosperity. But today, as in 1900 and in 1932, the Democrats believe that America can do better - that 4 million men out of work, a declining rate of economic growth, and constantly rising prices are not the greatest possible achievements of our economy, and today, as in the past, the Democrats have positive programs to combat economic distress, while the Republicans only offer reassurances that there is no distress. Mr. Nixon\'s second theme is a plea that you forget party labels. And I don\'t blame Mr. Nixon for trying to forget the record of a party which has opposed virtually every single Democratic measure designed to improve human welfare in this century, a party which has not initiated a single piece of forward looking social legislation since the time of William Howard Taft. Mr. Nixon did not ignore party affiliations between elections, when he led the Republican opposition to increased minimum wages, medical care for the aged, aid to education, help for distressed areas, and all the rest and the American people are not going to ignore Mr. Nixon\'s party affiliation next week.', 'The third Nixon theme is an attack on the policies of the Democratic Party. He says that our programs are ""extreme."" He implies that they are ""socialistic"" and will involve unhealthy increases in the ""power of the Federal Government"" and ""wild, irresponsible spending.""', 'The voice is the voice of Richard Nixon, but the words are the words of every Republican candidate since William McKinley. They are the same old slogans, catchwords, and scare phrases which have been the standard Republican response to almost every progressive measure in this century and the standard Republican argument against every Democratic effort to improve the welfare of the American people.', 'Today the Interstate Commerce Commission is accepted as an essential protection to consumers and industry alike. But when it was proposed in 1887 the Republicans predicted that ""if this bill shall become a law its consequences will be most disastrous * * * to the business interests of the country.""', 'Today the pure food and drug laws are universally acclaimed as a vital safeguard to our people\'s health. But when it was before the Congress in 1904, a Republican Senator proclaimed that in terms of ""paternalism and socialism, I do not think I ever heard a proposition inside the walls of this Capitol that was to my mind as monstrous as this.""', 'Today the Federal Reserve System is used by both parties as the most important instrument of combating inflation and depression. But in 1933, Republican leaders attacked it as ""revolutionary, socialistic, and dangerous.""', 'Today prohibitions on child labor are accepted as a vital protection for our youth. But when these laws were first proposed Republican leaders attacked them as ""socialistic in origin, philosophy, and associations.""', 'Today the Fair Labor Standards Act, with its guarantee of a decent minimum wage, has become an established feature of the American economic System but in 1937 a leading Republican Congressman warned that ""if you pass this bill * * * gone with the wind is our democratic system of government and all the institutions we hold dear."" Other Republicans attacked minimum wage as ""communism"" and the ""road to economic hell"" - 93 percent of the Republicans in Congress voted to kill the bill calling for a 25-cent minimum wage and the Republicans have opposed every increase in the minimum wage ever since.', 'Today the Social Security Act is regarded as the most important and beneficial single piece of social legislation in American history. But in 1935 a Republican congressional leader warned that ""this bill * * * threatens the integrity of our institutions and to pull the pillars of the temple down upon the heads of our descendants."" Other Republicans called it a ""cruel hoax"" that would enslave American workers - 99 percent of Senate Republicans voted to kill social security in 1935, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936 called for its repeal, and the Republicans have opposed every increase in benefits ever since.', 'There are a host of examples. When they were first proposed the Republicans said that the Federal protection of securities would ""Russianize everything,"" that the Federal Farm Loan Act was ""socialistic,"" that the U.S. Housing Act ""will eventually create communism and chaos,"" that TVA was patterned closely after one of the Soviet dreams and would * * * leave a tremendous debt for the taxpayer to pay,"" and that the Housing Act of 1949, now praised by Mr. Nixon, was ""socialistic"" and ""would break the back of our economy.""', 'This is the political history of a party which lacks faith in the capacity and strength of America, a party which is more concerned with conserving old gains than meeting future needs, with defining limitations rather than setting goals for the future.', ""The Democratic Party is proud of its past contributions, but it is also concerned with the future, with working to meet problems of the challenging decade ahead, with creating new abundance rather than rationing scarcity, with setting goals for the future which today's Republicans will attack as they always have, but which tomorrow's Republicans will praise, and ultimately incorporate into their party platform. For Republican platforms are not prophecies - they are histories - and in them the scholar can find an accurate account of the Democratic goals of the preceding generation."", 'The Democratic Party today has set forth many goals for the future of America - programs for progress in almost every area of our national life.', 'I want to discuss one of these goals in more detail with you today, a goal whose attainment is basic to all our other programs, and to all our hopes for increased prosperity in the future, the goal of full employment, specifically the goal of 82 million jobs by the end of 1968.', 'Today there are 73 million workers in our labor force. By 1968 - the end of two Presidential terms - there will be approximately 84 million men and women eligible for employment - or more workers than the total population of our country 60 years ago. In a full employment economy all but 2 or 3 percent of our work forces will be employed. Thus we will need 82 million jobs.', 'If you entrust the leadership of this country to the Democratic Party for the next 8 years, then, as the presidential candidate, I pledge myself and my party to seeking 82 million jobs by 1968.', 'What will 82 million jobs mean to America?', 'It means full employment - that almost every man and woman who wants to work will be able to find work. It means, if we fully develop the potential of our manpower and technology in the next decade, a 50-percent increase in the production of goods and services, it means the gross national product will increase from $500 billion to $750 billion each year. And it means that we can provide our expanding population with a 25-percent rise in the standard of living by 1968.', 'This is our promise to America - our vision of the America to be. I have no doubt that the men of little faith who lead the Republican Party will criticize this goal as utopian and unrealistic. Such criticism comes easily to a party whose candidate has said that ""unemployment is inevitable"" - a party which has allowed the unemployment rate to soar to 5.7 percent - a party which has presided over a continual decline in our rate of economic growth.', ""But such criticism will not halt our efforts. For Republicans have always derided Democratic goals - while Democrats have been busy accomplishing those goals. When Franklin Roosevelt, 1 month after Pearl Harbor, called for the production of 40,000 planes and 6 million tons of shipping - Republicans said it couldn't be done. But by the end of that year we had 48,000 planes and 8 million tons of shipping."", 'When, in 1945, the Democrats called for a gross national product of $200 billion by 1948, the Republicans said such a figure was impossible. But by 1948 our GNP was actually $259 billion.', 'When the Democrats, in 1945, called for 60 million jobs by 1950, Republican Leader Taft said, ""How can we say there will be 60 million jobs when perhaps 50 million workers can do all the work of the Nation?"" But today we have 64 million jobs.', 'In short the history of our two political parties in this century has been the history of a Democratic party wishing to move ahead, working to increase the welfare of our people, willing to set goals for the future because it believed we had the strength to meet those goals - and the history of a Republican Party deriding our goals, prophesying disaster, fighting against progress - a party at war with the future and reluctantly accepting the past.', ""In that history can be found the background to next week's decision: whether the American people will choose the easy but dangerous philosophy which is willing to stand still - to accept what we have rather than work toward something better. Or whether they will choose the arduous and strenuous task which we offer - the tasks which will require effort and will - but the tasks which promise to lead to the vision of America which Thomas Wolfe saw when he wrote--"", '\n  to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining golden opportunity, to every man the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make - this, seeker, is the promise of America.\n']"
391,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. My friend and colleague in the Congress, Mrs. Granahan, who speaks for this district in the Congress, and also speaks for the United States - I am sure she is going to be reelected by an overwhelming margin; Congressman Green, Mayor Dilworth, committeemen, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming today. We begin today the last week of this campaign, which will come to a conclusion on Monday night, 7 days from now. In the next 7 days, I will travel in 17 states to carry this message, and the message simply is this: This is a choice for the United States not merely between two men, Mr. Nixon and myself, but I think it is a choice really not just between two parties, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. It is a choice between two different conceptions of the United States, its past history, its need for action, its position in the world, and I take the view that the 1960's can be the best years of the United States or we can continue to slide and drift."", 'I come here to Philadelphia and to Pennsylvania and ask your help in this campaign. I believe that the United States [applause] - I believe that the United States cannot possibly afford 4 years of Republican leadership under Mr. Nixon [Applause.] On all the great issues of the last 25 years, the issues of progress, of mutual security, of national preparedness, of national strength, the development of our resources, the education of our children, jobs for men and women of working age, security for our older citizens, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have differed, and we have come down on side of progress. The Republican Party has opposed every action, and Mr. Nixon has associated himself with that opposition to every action for the benefit of our people. [Applause.]', ""I don't think the United States can be secure in the world, I don't think the United States can lead a great free world alliance, unless it is leading its own people. The people of the world are not so much interested in being allies of the United States as they are in joining a great effort to maintain their freedom, to defeat ignorance, disease, and those enemies of the human race which make life so difficult for people around the globe. That is the great struggle in the sixties. Unless we are prepared to associate with them in their efforts to provide a better life for their own people, they will not associate with us in the defense of freedom, and we cannot hold out a helping hand, we cannot identify ourselves with them, in Latin America, in Africa or Asia, unless we are moving here at home, unless we have an administration and a President and a Congress which identifies itself with our own people, with their needs. I have traveled in the last 3 days in Pennsylvania through some of the most hard-hit areas of the United States, where men have been out of work not for just 2 months, but 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and a year. I spoke to three unemployed fellow workers who have been out of work since last April."", ""Mr. Nixon may go through the country saying this is the greatest prosperity we have ever had, but I don't think it is good enough. Mr. Nixon may be satisfied when we build 30 percent less homes this year than last year, Mr. Nixon and the Republicans may be satisfied to defeat medical care for our older citizens, to prevent and fail to support better education for our children, to make it possible for every bright boy and girl to see the inside of a college and develop his talents. [Applause.]"", ""The point of the matter is that the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon in his 14 years of association with it have not stood for progress, have not stood for breaking new ground, have not stood for breaking new frontiers, and I believe in the 1960's if the United States is going to fulfill its potential, if we are going to fulfill the destiny which is in store for us in the sixties, if we are going to be the leader of freedom, we are going to have to move here at home. [Applause.]"", 'I come to Philadelphia and ask your help in this campaign. This election is the means to an end, and the end is a great, stronger, and growing America. I come here to Philadelphia and ask your help. I can assure you that if we are successful that this State and country will move again. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
392,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Congressmen, Mr. Mayor, I come here today as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States to ask your support on Tuesday, November 8.', ""On Tuesday, November 8, a week from tomorrow, you have to make your judgment as to which candidate, which party, which political philosophy you support. Do you see these houses? They are built partly by the public housing program of the Government. Do you know what the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon have done? They voted against it every single year. [Applause.] You don't have to look around you, you don't have to look very far to see the differences between the candidates. In 1949, and most of these housing projects were initiated in the Housing Act of 1949, Mr. Nixon voted against the Housing Act of 1949, and so did most of the Republicans. Public housing has been a Democratic program. Every year your Congressman and those of us in the Senate have tried to increase the program, and every year the Republicans have voted against it."", 'No. 2, we talk about civil rights. In 1953 and 1954 the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House. There was no civil rights bill that ever saw the light of day in either the House or the Senate, and why not? Because the Republican Party was not for it, and neither was Mr. Nixon. [Applause.]', 'In the late forties, Mr. Nixon and I were both members of the Labor Committee. There were seven votes on FEPC, fair employment. Mr. Nixon voted against it, every single time, and I voted for it. Minimum wage - I see some signs waved around by great supportcrs of Mr. Nixon. I want to ask them three questions. They talk about prosperity:', 'No.1, Mr. Nixon says $1.25 a hour minimum wage is extreme. Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against it. The average wage for laundrywomen in five large cities of this country, and most of them are Negroes, is 65 cents an hour for a 48-hour week. Mr. Nixon says $1.25 an hour is extreme, and they wave a sign about prosperity. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, we have fought for medical care for the aged tied to social security. Mr. Nixon says it is extreme. Mr. Nixon leads the same party that voted 90 percent against the social security in the midthirties and vote 90 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960. Anybody who wants that kind of progress, anybody who wants that kind of prosperity, anybody who wants a pafty that is against housing, minimum wage, social security, equal opportunity, civil rights [response from the audience].', 'And with Martin Luther King in jail Mr. Nixon\'s headquarters issued a statement ""No comment."" If that is what you want, you can have him. But I think you will agree with me that it is time that America moved forward. [Applause.] Thank you.']"
393,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce to you first the mayor of Philadelphia, Mayor Dilworth, who is traveling with us [applause], and Congressman Green of Philadelphia, Congressman Burns of Philadelphia, and our driver, Jack Kelly of the United States. [Applause.] Bismarck once said that one-third of the students of German universities broke down from overwork, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany.', ""I do not know which third of the student body of Temple is here today, but I am confident I am talking to the future rulers of America in the sense that all educated men and women must bear the discipline of self-government. I come here today to Temple University to ask your support in this campaign. I cannot believe that any educated man or woman that seeks the truth can possibly accept the campaign which Mr. Nixon is now running on. [Applause.] First that domestically he is running on the program that we have never enjoyed such unequaled prosperity at a time when we run through a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, and we are sliding into a slow period now which is going to give us 30 percent less homes in the last month, than we had a year ago and more unsold cars in 3 weeks than we have ever had in our history. I don't want that kind of prosperity, and this country can't possibly afford it. We are now, instead of growing - the last 9 months we had no economic growth - we had minus 0.3 percent - and when you realize that this country is competing not only to provide a better life for its people, but we are also competing in order to demonstrate to the world that freedom and growth and strength and productivity go hand in hand. I am not satisfied as an American to drift and to have the Republicans continue to let us drift in the next 4 years. [Applause.]"", 'Secondly, Mr. Nixon campaigns on a program that our prestige has never been higher. He is either misinformed, uninformed, or misleads, and I have to leave you to judge which it is, when his own information service in the State Department - will you get this out of my throat? Thank you. [Laughter.] When his own information service in the State Department has polls taken in 10 countries from India to Indonesia, which show, for example, if Mr. Nixon would read them, that only 7 percent of the people of England and France now believe that we are ahead of the Soviet Union in science. A majority of the people in every one of those countries now believe that by 1970 the Soviet Union will be ahead of us in military power, science, and economic growth. How long can we lead the free world if they are convinced that the balance of power is shifting against us? This is a hard struggle. It is a close struggle. Anyone who studies the competitive histories of Germany and England in the thirties knows the advantages in a close competition which a totalitarian power has, and they certainly have an advantage if those that seek to hold responsible positions will not tell the truth. [Applause.]', ""This election will be decided in a week, and then this country has to move on. Mr. Nixon and I will finish our tasks on November 8. Then you have to decide. You have to make your own judgment, what kind of a country you think we have, what we must do in the sixties, what responsibilities we must meet, what our position should be in Latin America and Africa and Asia. What you have to decide is, Do you think that the Republican Party and those that they summon to positions of leadership led by Mr. Nixon can lead us in the 1960's? If you are satisfied, he is your man. [Response from the audience.]"", ""I am going to make an offer to Mr. Nixon. I have been trying to get him to debate me for 2 weeks. He has given me every reason and finally his last excuse was that I should apologize for saying that he was unwilling to debate. [Response from the audience.] I may find now the reason why. I read in today's paper that Mr. Nixon is unwilling to take a ride through the city of New York to meet the voters. But he is going to take President Eisenhower with him. I now offer him to let President Eisenhower come with him on the fifth debate. Then we can see. [Response from the audience and applause.] What Mr. Nixon does not understand is that President Eisenhower was running only in 1952 and 1956. President Eisenhower is not a candidate. Mr. Nixon is. Mr. Nixon and I are going to face the voters alone next November 8, no matter what the President of the United States may choose to do this week in New York or any place else. It is Nixon versus Kennedy the Republicans versus the Democrats, and I look to the future with some degree of hope. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
394,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Dilworth, Congressman Green, ladies and gentlemen, I come here to the center of Philadelphia in the last period of this long campaign. I believe that in the last 2 months the issues of this campaign, the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself, the differences between our two parties, the differences between our political philosophies, the differences between what we see in our country and what we see in its future, have been well established, and those differences are twofold.', 'First, Mr. Nixon believes that the present rate of economic growth and development in this country is highly satisfactory. I do not. I think we have to do better. [Applause.]', ""I am not satisfied at all to see the economic growth of the United States in the last 9 months go down. I am not satisfied at all to have Western Germany growing twice the rate we are. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years, and I don't think the Republicans can do it. [Applause.]"", ""The second basic dispute between Mr. Nixon and myself is in our position around the world. He states that our prestige has never been higher, in spite of the fact that in our own State Department there are surveys taken abroad, this summer, which show a sharp decline in the image of the United States as a strong, powerful, decisive country. If we are going to lead the free world, if we are going to meet our obligations to freedom, if we are going to keep Latin America and Africa and Asia free, if we are going to keep Western Europe associated with us, we have to have a strong, vital, growing country that speaks with power and force. And I don't think Mr. Nixon nor the Republican Party can provide that leadership. [Applause.]"", 'Now, you have to decide on November 8; a week from Tuesday, the responsibility of Mr. Nixon and myself to present our views of our society, and what we should do is over. You have to decide what your view is of the United States, what your view is of the world around us, what you think ought to be done - whether you are satisfied. In my judgment, this is a race between the comfortable, the contented, and those who are concerned and wish to move forward. If you are happy now in what we are now doing in the United States and in the world around us, if you are satisfied, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] But if you share my view that it is time the United States started moving again, then I ask your help. [Applause.] Thank you.']"
395,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Madam Chairwoman, Mrs. Harman, Mayor Dilworth, Congressman Green, distinguished guests, Mrs. Meir, ladies and gentlemen - ladies, rather. [Laughter.] I want to say it is a pleasure to come to this luncheon. As a bondholder in Israel myself, I think that you serve the United States, and the cause of freedom generally around the world in your efforts here today. One of the great sources of strength of the United States has been that the people who came to this country to establish their homes all came seeking freedom and opportunity, but they have always felt as a country, as a national policy, we have always been concerned with the spreading of freedom around the world. We have benefited from these ties which have been maintained with other countries. The great fight for Irish freedom was maintained in many years, during years of difficulty, by Irish men and women who had come to this country seeking freedom. The great fight for Polish freedom is maintained even today, as it has been in the past, by Polish men and women, who are strong Americans, devoted to this country, who also wish freedom for their own country of origin, for their families' origin, and who believe with Thomas Jefferson that the disease of liberty is catching, and it is our function to help spread it. So your work on behalf of Israel serves the United States. It serves Israel; it serves the cause of freedom."", 'There is no area of the world that is older than the Middle East. It is more significant, is is more ravaged by time, but which presents greater opportunities and greater hazards. One of the most inspiring examples, of course, of the devotion of people to their independence has been the whole story of the birth of Israel and the maintenance of its freedom, in spite of being surrounded by those who have not, unfortunately, always wished it well. I hope in the coming years, regardless of who may be the President of the United States, and regardless of which party may be in control of the national administration, that we will continue our national policy, which has been supported by bipartisan efforts on both sides, of extending the hand of friendship to all those nations, independent, who desire to be free, who desire to associate with us in a great international effort to extend freedom to all people.', 'Israel has devoted itself to that effort. It is small, living in a hard land, living in a land which is tied to them by time and history and religion, they have built a strong and dynamic country, which now is helping countries of Africa and the Middle East and Asia demonstrate what a new people can do. I hope that the United States will hold out the hand of friendship to Israel. I hope that we will make it clear that we stand by our commitments and by our friends and by the United Nations, that we will defend those who wish to be free and independent; that we will work for peace; that we will use our influence through the United Nations, through the World Bank, through our own effort, to provide for the spreading of peace in the Middle East. The Bible says, ""Blessed are the peacemakers."" We shall pursue peace, and that shall be our objective, here in the United States, in the Middle East, in the relationship which Israel has with the surrounding countries. Justice and peace is our objective, and those who share those objectives in their domestic and foreign policy shall find friendship here in the United States. [Applause.]', 'I believe that we have some special obligations through the United Nations. The victory of 1956 was relinquished by the Israel after the Sinai campaign, with the understanding that the United Nations instructions and resolutions would be carried out, particularly those providing for free transit of the canal. Israel met the United Nations request and retreated to its own borders and surrendered its success. It has a fair right to expect that those members of the United Nations who insisted that they should do so should also be just as insistent, just as vigorous, just as firm in requiring that all other nations meet the commitments of the United Nations. [Applause.] You have been generous to provide shelter to a candidate of one of our two parties. [Laughter.] But it is as a member of my party, a source of satisfaction to me that those who, in other years, have led this party, as I now try to do in the 1960 campaign, have all been identified with the same cause with which you are identified; Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. I stand where they stood in other years. I emphasize that the policy of the United States in this area, I hope, is not a party matter, but is a national matter, and regardless of the outcome of the election, I hope that the next administration is committed to the security of small nations, to the best of the world, to the development of freedom around the globe. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
396,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Dilworth, Senator Clark, Congressman Green, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Tonight, 7 days from now, this campaign will be all over, and the American people will then make their judgment the next day, Tuesday, November 8. On Tuesday, November 8, you will be making your judgment, and I hope when you make your judgment you will bear the following facts in mind:', ""First, 1960 and the 1960's are going to be among the most difficult and hazardous years in our long history. We are engaged in a most difficult enterprise, that will require the best effort not only of the next President of the United States, but also every man and woman who considers himself a responsible citizen of our country. And what is that effort? That effort is to build a society here which demonstrates such vitality and strength and energy and purpose, that serves not only as an example of what freedom can do, but also serves as the maintenance and the bulwark of freedom, not only here in the United States but all around the globe."", 'The question you have to decide is this: Do you believe that Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party can provide the kind of leadership which this country needs? [Response from the audience.] I must say, after campaigning for the last 2 months, I have come to the same conclusion. [Applause.]', 'I believe that Mr. Nixon, after the Republican Convention, had two alternatives: One, he could run on the facts, on a realization that this was a difficult and dangerous and promising time, that unless the United States was prepared to make a major effort both at home and abroad we could not hope to maintain our position as the leader of the free world; we could not hope to make the balance of power to shift in the direction of freedom. That is the campaign Mr. Nixon could have made. In my judgment, it is the campaign that Governor Rockefeller would have made, and it would have been in accordance with the highest traditions of public service in this country. Instead, Mr. Nixon has chosen to go to the people in these days, saying that our prestige has never been higher, saying that we enjoy unparalleled prosperity here at home - facts which, of course, cannot be proved, which are in complete disagreement with every standard in every record in every survey, and which I believe can mean that the United States under his leadership, if he is successful, would not move with the kind of vigor which will be required.', ""I saw another election just like this one, in 1935, when Stanley Baldwin of England, when England was engaged in a deadly competition with Germany, chose to tell the people that everything was being done in good time, and that England's security was assured. Mr. Baldwin won that election and the British almost lost World War II."", ""Now, I don't know whether we are going to win this election or not. That judgment is yours. [Applause.] I don't know whether we are going to win the election or not, that is your judgment, and the judgment of the people of America. But I want to make it clear that they choose between two very different views of our country, what needs to be done, what must be done. As a citizen who is concerned about our country, I cannot possibly accept the conclusion which Mr. Nixon has come to. If he believes those conclusions, he is either misinformed or misleads the public. [Applause.] These are not the best of times. This is the best of countries but these are not the best of times. This is a great country, but I downgrade the leadership which Mr. Nixon now offers the American people. He knows, himself, that our influence and prestige is not as high as it once was. He knows that the first passengers to outer space were named Belka and some other Russian dog. They were not named Checkers or Rover. [Laughter.] As long as 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls graduating from high school never get to college, as long as only the children of wealthy or reasonably wealthy parents can hope to get through medical school, as long as we are producing far less doctors for our population than we were before, as long as we are not developing our resources, rebuilding our cities, moving our economy ahead, as long as we are not giving the same effort to disarmament and nuclear controls that we are to arms and war, as long as science and technology and space and the earth are not being used to make men's lives more secure, in my judgment we are not meeting our full potential, our full capacity."", 'I come to this ancient city here in Philadelphia. Many years ago an English journalist wrote, ""Come weal or come woe, this city\'s status is quo."" That is no longer true. I don\'t believe that the status quo is good enough for the United States. I don\'t believe in 1960, any more than in 1932, the people of this country are going to sit still, are going to look to the past, are going to turn the leadership of this country over to Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party that he represents, that he leads, when we need action and progress and to move forward. [Applause.]', ""This election may well be decided in Pennsylvania, and the election in Pennsylvania may well be decided in the city of Philadelphia. This is a judgment which you make, which affects this country's security, its future, your own vision of a shining America which meets its opportunities and its responsibilities, which stands once again as the unchallenged leader of freedom, a country and a leadership which identifies itself in this country with the needs of people and identifies itself around the world with the needs of the people; that does not regard Africa or Latin America or Asia as pawns in the cold war, but as people who want to be free. And we will associate with them not merely in the struggle against communism, but in the struggle against the disease and ignorance and illiteracy and lack of hope. I believe the 1960's can be, as Charles Dickens said, the best of years or the worst of years. I believe it is going to be the best of years. I believe on November 8 the United States is going to choose progress and this country is going to move again. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

And we speak to all the world - to freedom fighters in a Polish attic; to Africans building a jungle school; to Latin Americans fearing the advent of other Fidel Castros; to Japanese mothers, still binding up the wounds of Hiroshima; to students in Bombay; to editors in Beirut; to all who wonder which way lies the future - with freedom or with slavery.', 'America will speak to all of them on November 8 - and to Mr. Khrushchev, too.', 'And our message on November 8 is going to be that this country is going to start moving again.', 'For unless we are moving here at home we cannot move the cause of freedom around the world. If we lack first-rate growing economy, we cannot sustain a first-rate defense. If we lack compassion for those who are sick and poor or aged here at home, we cannot convincingly show such compassion abroad. We cannot identify ourselves with the hundreds of millions of people to the south of us who fight not only communism but also misery, ignorance, starvation, disease.', 'If human rights and human dignity are not shared by every American, regardless of his race or his color, then those in other lands of other creeds and other colors, and they are in the majority, will treat our claims of a great democracy with suspicion and indifference.', 'If we demonstrate no vitality here in the United States, no leadership in our own country, no imagination in meeting our problems here at home, if great quantities of our food, for example, rot while the world goes hungry, if our people are complacent and self-satisfied, content with things as they are and unconcerned with things as they soon will be, then our prestige and our influence and our contribution to the cause of freedom will surely continue to decline.', ""There are those who say that this kind of talk downgrades America. I do not downgrade America, but I do downgrade the kind of leadership America's been getting."", 'Mr. Nixon says that this talk is irresponsible. But I do not need Mr. Nixon to tell me of my responsibilities to my country. I have served this country in Congress for 14 years, and 4 years before that in the service. And I run for the Presidency not to downgrade America, but to achieve the kind of America for which every American family fought and in which every American family believes.', 'I do not want it said - I do not want it said of our generation of Americans what T. S. Eliot said in his poem, ""The Rock,"" of another group of people: ""And the wind shall say these were a decent people, their only monument the asphalt road and a thousand lost golf balls"". We can do better than that.', 'Tonight I want to tell you the kind of America that I believe in, not as a Democrat, not as a presidential candidate, but as a concerned citizen. I want to look beyond the name calling, the charges, the shooting stars and meteors of this campaign to the fixed stars that lie above, the basic principles by which we shall set our course, the kind of America that I want for my children and for yours.', ""I believe in an America where every man, or woman, who wants to work can find work - a full week's work for a full week's pay; where every man or woman of talent can use those talents; where the waste of idle men and idle machines, of steel mills half shut down, and coal mines boarded up, of chronic recessions and slumps, can be limited; where a growing economy provides new jobs and new markets for a growing nation, without inflating the consumer's prices beyond the reach of their budgets and their families."", 'I believe in an America where every child is educated not according to his means or his race, but according to his capacity; where there are no longer literacy tests for voting, because there are no illiterates; where children go to school for a full school day in a well-lit, well-heated, well-equipped classroom, paid- taught by well-trained, well-paid teachers; where there are enough colleges and classrooms and dormitories to make it possible for every young man and woman of talent to go to college - instead of, as today, nearly 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. What a waste of a great national resource that is.', ""Mr. Nixon would like us to forget his tie-breaking vote against aid for teachers' salaries, and for other educational assistance. But I think - I think, in this case, experience does count."", ""I believe in an America where one's latest years are the good years - years of security and dignity; where medical care for the aged is provided out of social security - a contribution of less than 3 cents a day during their working years; where older people can find decent housing, suitable to their needs; and where doors are not automatically shut in their face by any employer, including the Federal Government, for in those crucial years we need their wisdom and their counsel."", 'I talked recently to a grandmother in Dayton, Ohio, who could not bear to ask her children, with whom she was then living, for the $13 a week she needed for medicine, because they were giving so much up to sustain her at that time.', 'We provide, under the program that we are offering and have worked for in the Congress, medical care for the aged tied to social security.

That doesn't represent meeting the needs of the people. That doesn't represent building a strong and vital country."", 'I believe in an America of fair prices for the farmer, and fair profits for the businessmen, and fair wages for the worker; where those who are out of work or handicapped or disabled can receive a helping hand; where there are no longer chronic depressed areas; and no hungry children - like those I saw in West Virginia, where children take home part of their school lunch to feed one of their parents, who live on a surplus food package from our Federal Government which amounts to 5 cents a day per person - and nearly 5 million Americans live that way.', ""And yet this administration has twice vetoed bills, that this Congress has passed, to provide aid for distressed areas so that they can work for their people. Twice.

Where farm abundance, stemming from a revolution in farm technology, brings more food to the world, not more hardship for our farmers.', ""I spent most of this winter in Wisconsin. The average wage for a dairy farmer in Wisconsin is about 52 cents an hour for a very, very, very long day. And what is true of Wisconsin is true of Minnesota. That is hard work - 52 cents an hour - well below the minimum wage of $1 an hour that's provided, which in itself is inadequate; where our great natural resources in our rivers and under our ground are fully used to benefit the Nation. But this means a change away from the Republican Party which even in this area pioneered by Theodore Roosevelt, by [Gifford] Pinchot, by Franklin Roosevelt - the development of our natural resources has been blocked by a policy of no new starts which will be a memorial to the last 8 years in the Western United States, which is our great natural resources belonging to all the people.

399,John F. Kennedy ,"October 31, 1960","['As this campaign enters its final week, the Republicans are stepping up their efforts to convince the voters to forget party labels, party records, and party differences. The American voter, however, will have no trouble in making a clear choice if he keeps in mind at least six basic areas of disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself:', '(1) Medical care for the aged: The Republican plan permits only a handfuT of retired workers to receive public assistance for medical care if they are willing to surrender their dignity by taking a ""pauper\'s oath."" The Democratic plan would permit this cost to be covered under our social security system, so that all workers may set aside a few cents every day during their working years to help pay their medical bills when their earning power is gone.', ""(2) Teachers' salaries: Mr. Nixon's tie-breaking vote defeated the amendment which by this time would have provided our public school teachers with higher salaries - and I voted for that amendment. Mr. Nixon cites the threat of Federal controls which the history of all Federal aid to education in this country since the Northwest Ordinance proves to be an empty threat invoked by every opponent of better schools. I am much more concerned about the dangers of a second-rate school system, which fails to attract and keep its best teachers, and which cannot find enough qualified teachers to meet the demand of the next 10 years - when we will need more new teachers than all those presently in service combined."", '(3) Agriculture: Mr. Nixon favors a continuation of Bensonism under a new name, permitting the support price to steadily drop as a means of ""getting rid of the farmer."" I favor a farmer-controlled [program] adjusting supply to demand at a level permitting full parity of income to every farmer. Mr. Nixon has fancy new labels for the old Benson product, and he talks of jail sentences and runaway inflation if my program is adopted - but the American farmer, who remembers that food prices were actually lower in 1952 when his income was much higher, agrees that it is time the laws of supply and demand were put to work for him instead of always operating against him.', '(4) Unemployment: Mr. Nixon, who thinks several million unemployed is inevitable and nothing to worry about, is satisfied today with what he calls our ""unprecedented prosperity"" - but I think we can do better in putting our unemployed back to work, using our idle capacity in steel, coal and other industries, and finding jobs for the thousands of young men and women who are pouring into our labor market every week of the year.', '(5) Trusting the voters: Mr. Nixon and the Republicans are unwilling to reveal to the American people reports containing the facts about our prestige, the truth about the Nixon-Khrushchev talks, the basis of the present missile gap as contained in the Gaither report, and the facts about whether we are heading for a third recession prepared by the Department of Commerce. I do not see how this vital information can be withheld from those who must make an informed judgment on November 8. I have the utmost confidence in the American people to face all the facts, however harsh, and to provide for them.', ""(6) A strategy for peace: Mr. Nixon's grand strategy is to create a series of committees, conferences, councils and goodwill tours. But I am convinced that peace can be obtained only through a stronger America - an America in which a strong economy, supporting a strong defensive posture, is manned by a citizenry strong in their sense of purpose, their sense of justice, and their dedication to the truth. The next war may be started and won by merely pushing a button - but there is no pushbutton magic for winning the peace.""]"

[Applause.]', 'Whoever wins, the task will not be easy - I am just trying to keep it open, you know what is going to happen [laughter and applause]. The next President\'s desk will not be clear, waiting for new problems and responsibilities. It will be piled high with old problems, inherited, chronic problems, old bills demanding payment, ambassadors demanding new instructions, legislation previously submitted needing to be redrafted. But as the new President turns to meet these old problems, new pressures will rush upon him, new crises from every section of the world, new decisions on weapons, on strategy, on economic policy, and a thousand other items. There on that one desk, on the shoulders of the next President of the United States, will converge all the hopes and fears of every American and, indeed, all the hopes and fears of every person in the world who believes in peace and freedom. Whatever the issue, however critical the problem, the President will sit alone. He will have his advisers, his Cabinet, the sources of information and ideas, the final decision is the President\'s alone. Harry Truman used to have on his desk the sign ""The buck stops here.""', 'For 4 years, the reins of this Nation will be in his hands and he will speak for America. For 4 years, no other decision that you make will be half so important, no other act in your daily life will entrust so much of your future to one man, one party, in his judgment and his foresight. Fully aware of this grave and somber and sober responsibility, I am asking the people of California and the Nation to place their trust and confidence in me. [Applause.]', 'I do not ask you to choose merely between two men. I ask you to choose the kind of State of California you want, the kind of United States of America you want. What kind of an effort you will make to sustain the cause of freedom all around the globe.', 'Mr. Nixon and I represent two wholly different parties, with wholly different records of the past, and wholly different views of the future. We disagree, and our parties disagree, on where we stand today and where we will stand tomorrow. During the past 2 years, and in the 14 years that we have served in the Government, we have made known our views on these matters. Mr. Nixon and the Republicans stand for the past. We stand for the future. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon represents the Republican Party which has put up in recent years Mr. Dewey, Mr. Landon, Mr. Coolidge, Mr. Harding, Mr. Taft, Mr. McKinley. I represent the party which has run Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt [applause] and Harry Truman [applause] and Adlai Stevenson. [Applause.]', 'Some may feel that their life is wholly unaffected by this decision, that their job is secure, that their rent is paid, that their taxes are paid, and are all likely to be the same, whichever man and whichever candidate holds this high office. But I want to make it clear that every American is affected by what happens. Our prestige abroad, what other people think of us, is not of importance only to those Americans who work abroad. The sign ""Yankee go home"" does not apply only to our diplomats and our soldiers. The great struggle in the world is not one of popularity, but one of power, and our power in considerable measure depends upon our ability to influence other nations, to identify ourselves with them, upon their willingness to associate with us, upon their willingness to follow our leadership. When Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher, I say he is either misinformed or misleads. [Applause.] For our own administration, this summer, in polls taken in 10 countries of the world, has proved that the people of the world, the great majority believe that the balance of power is shifting against us, and that by 1970, in 9 out of 10 countries polled, polls which the USIA now has, in 9 out of 10 countries the majority of the people thought the Soviet Union would be stronger in 1970 than the United States. Do you know what that means: That means that people who are now undecided may not be so willing to follow our leadership in the future, may hang back, may be neutral, may be uncommitted, may vote against us in the United Nations, may stand aside as we become gradually weaker. I want the people of the world and Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has taken leadership of this country and that this free society speaks with power, force and decision. [Applause.]', 'All of these problems, all of the hopes for peace, all of our hopes for security, all hang on the question of what kind of a society we can build in the United States. If we can build a strong and productive society, if we can educate our children, make sure that all young men and women of talent go to college, if we can provide jobs for our people - and today I spoke in a defense factory that is laying off 400 men a week. What happens to those men? Where do they go? How do they pay their bills? How do they pay their rent? How do they meet their obligations? This administration has sat by while here in California, in Los Angeles, in San Diego, in Pennsylvania where I was yesterday, in Ohio, in West Virginia, and in Kentucky, nearly 4.5 million Americans are wholly out of work and 3 million others work 1, 2, or 3 days a week when they can get it. As long as this administration holds back in providing assistance to education, practical physical and monetary policies that hold back employment, hold back the distribution of defense in a stronger problem, our indifference in the problem of medical care for our older citizens - Mr. Nixon says it is too extreme. He prefers a proposal that provides that the 16 million Americans who live on an average income of $73 a month should take a pauper\'s oath rather than put it under social security where it has been for 25 years. I want to make it clear that this country has to move again, that we want to get off of dead center, that we want to build in this country the kind of society which will ornament the cause of freedom, a society which moves ahead, which no longer tarries, no longer rests, no longer sits encumbered, but instead picks itself up and starts to move ahead in the sixties. I ask your help in doing that. [Applause.] I ask you to join us. Franklin Roosevelt in 1936 said, ""Shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead? Shall we call this the promised land?"" And he answered, ""No,"" and in 1960 we answer ""No \'again. We are going to move again. We are going to demonstrate what this country can do. [Applause.] Let me just say, as I understand we are now coming to a conclusion of this half hour of television, as this is coming to the end of this campaign, I want to make it very clear that this is an important choice that you must make on next Tuesday, the choice that involves the future of our country, of your recognition of your obligation to our country, of your willingness to move this country ahead, of your willingness to bear the burdens that go with citizenship, that go with the burdens of being the chief defender of freedom at a time when freedom is in danger.', 'I have the greatest hopes for this country and the greatest confidence in it. I have traveled in every State in the Union in the last 2 years. This is a great country, but I believe it can be greater, and I believe it is a powerful country but it can be more powerful. I ask your help. [Applause.]']"
401,John F. Kennedy ,"November 01, 1960","['Mr. STEIGERWALT. As student body president of the Associated Students of Southern California, and representing students of Southern California, and representing not only my fellow students but the first Voters of this area, at this time we would like to pose several questions to you regarding the 1960 presidential campaign.', ""Our first question is: Exactly what are today's practical differences between the Republican and Democratic Parties as you see them."", 'Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think that there are several significant differences. The first is the difference which is suggested by their record of the past. The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party has opposed every single piece of new, progressive legislation of benefit to the people in the last 25 years, social security [applause] social security, housing, minimum wage [response from the audience] civil rights. In 1953 and 1954 the Republicans controlled the administration, the House and the Senate. Not one single civil rights bill saw the light of day in either the House or the Senate.', ""Second, I think what is past is prologue. I think the general direction of the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon himself, as he has said on many occasions, is to be conservative, and a conservative defends the status quo. And I don't believe in 1960 or in the 1960's that there is going to be a status quo. I believe we either drop back or we move ahead. We do not sit on dead center. Secondly, the differences were suggested earlier in my speech. Mr. Nixon and I hold a wholly different view of our position in the world, of our prestige. Prestige is not popularity. Prestige involves the willingness of other countries to follow the leadership of another country, and the polls taken by the USIA this summer which have not been released, but which several papers have printed, show, for example, that only 7 percent of the people of England and France now believe that we are ahead of the Soviet Union in science. A majority of people in the 10 countries pooled believe that the Soviet Union will be ahead of us militarily and scientifically and in economic growth by 1970. How many of those people will follow our lead, if they believe that the way to the future is our adversary and not ourselves?"", 'So first in our party differences, in our willingness to move forward, in our willingness to provide programs which will serve our people; second, in our view of the world, our prestige in the world, the judgment that we make of our prestige; third, I believe that we, the Democratic Party, are far more concerned historically and at present about the problems of the underdeveloped world which hold the key to our future, Africa, Latin America, India versus China. I do not believe that the Republican Party has shared this concern. We are, for example, the 14th country in the world today in radio broadcasts to Africa. We gave the Congo last June - we offered them more scholarships, 300, than we had offered all of Africa the year before. Do you know how many Congolese students are studying as a result of that in the United States? Six.', ""Guinea asked us for 500 teachers last year. Do you know how many we sent them? One. We gave Africa less than 5 percent of all our funds for technical assistance. I don't believe that this administration, either in nuclear testing or in the case of Africa, in the two revolutions of the fifties, has demonstrated its willingness to break new ground. In those three areas, our parties and the candidates differ. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. STEIGERWALT. Our second question: What three issues upon which you and Mr. Nixon greatly differ do you feel will be the most decisive in bringing voters into your respective camps, and in each case, why do you feel that your particular stand is better?', 'Senator KENNEDY. One is the issue we have discussed already, about our position in the world. The second is the question of economic growth which goes to the question of jobs, full employment, and our ability to meet the national budget, our defense, and all the rest. The United States over the last 8 years has had an economic growth of about 2.5 percent a year. In the last 9 months, our economic growth has dropped back, 0.3 percent. Western Germany had twice the economic growth that we did in the last 8 years. Italy had a greater economic growth and so did France. The Soviet Union was, according to Mr. Allen Dulles, nearly 2 1/2 times as much. We are going to have to find 25,000 new jobs a week every week for the next 10 years, in order to maintain full employment.', ""I believe that that can be done only by an administration which is committed to progress, which in the management of the monetary and fiscal organs of government demonstrates an awareness of change, which supports programs which emphasize education, full employment, housing and all the rest. This year, for example, we are going to build 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago. This year, by the middle of November, we will have nearly a million unsold cars, the largest by 500,000, nearly, than we have ever had in mid-November in the history of the United States. Anyone who is a student, who looks at the facts, believes that we have in Mr. Nixon's words, unexampled prosperity, maybe should stay in school one more year. [Applause.]"", 'The third point on which we differ is in the record of our party, and the promise that that record gives to the future. Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against a 25-cent minimum wage in 1935, and 90 percent of them voted against the $1.25 an hour in 1960, which Mr. Nixon considers extreme. Ninety percent of the Republicans voted against the social security in the midthirties and 95 percent in 1960 voted against the medical care for the aged tied to social security. The fact of the matter is that on these issues, medical care, social security, this administration vetoed two bills on housing, and one of them, the reason it was vetoed, was because it provided loans to colleges for dormitories. We are going to have to build more college dormitories and classrooms in the next 10 years than we have built in the last 200 years, to provide space for all the people who want to go to college by 1970.', ""Now, if you believe that a party which has opposed all of these pieces of progressive legislation in the past, legislation which we now take for granted, is equipped to lead a changing country in a changing world in 1960, then Mr. Nixon is your man. But I don't agree. [Applause.] [Response from the audience.] That was my brother. [Applause and laughter.]"", 'Mr. STEIGERWALT. Mr. Kennedy, at this time we are running out of time, and at this time may I thank you on behalf of all students, the first-time voters for this area. It has been a great pleasure having you with us. Thank you very much.']"

[Laughter.] I come here today, to the Golden State of California, and ask your Support in this campaign, in this campaign for a stronger and better State of California and for a stronger and more progressive America. I come here and ask your help. [Applause.]', 'Let me make it very clear that I stand today as the standard hearer of the Democratic Party, in direct line and succession to Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and others who believe that this country must move ahead. [Applause.]', 'You have to make your judgment about what kind of a country you want, what kind of a philosophy you want to govern your country. I want to make it very clear that the differences between Mr. Nixon and myself, the differences between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party are clear. Mr. Nixon represents a party, a philosophy which he believes in, which voted against social security and minimum wage and housing and unemployment compensation. The fact of the matter is that the Republican Party controlled the Congress and the Presidency for years and no civil rights bill ever saw the light of day. [Applause.]', 'I was in the Senate in 1953 and 1954. The Republicans controlled the Senate and the House and the Presidency, and no civil rights bill came to the floor of either the House or the Senate. I was in the House in the late forties, and I served on a committee headed by Congressman Powell of New York, a committee which was devoted to providing protection to all Americans in their employment rights. Seven times the subcommittee and the full committee and on the floor of the House that bill came to a vote. Seven times Mr. Nixon voted against it, seven times, and seven times I voted for it. [Applause.]', 'In the debate 2 or 3 weeks ago, Mr. Nixon stated that he thought $1.25 minimum wage was extreme. Do you know what the average wage for laundrywomen, and most of them are Negroes, in five large cities of the United States is? Sixty-five cents an hour for a 48-hour week. [Response from the audience.]', 'Mr. Nixon came out about 3 weeks ago for a new housing program, and in it he said the Housing Act of 1949, which provided the basis for all later housing bills, the Housing Act of 1949 has worked well. Do you know Mr. Nixon voted against the Housing Act of 1949 as a Congressman? How short does he think our memory is? [Applause.]', ""I want to make it very clear that I am not satisfied as an American to know that if a white baby and a Negro baby are born side by side, that that white baby has three times as much chance of getting to college as the Negro baby, three times as much chance of finishing high school. That Negro baby has four times as much chance statistically of being out of work in his life, that Negro baby has four times as much chance of owning his own house. And how much chance does that Negro baby have of sending his children through college? [Response from the audience.] The fact of the matter is we don't say that everybody's talent is equal, but what we say is that every body should have the same chance to develop their talent. [Applause.]"", 'Do you know the greatest minority in the world today? The greatest minority in the world today is the whites. The whole world, Africa, Asia, the Middle East - people who are colored, yellow, brown, black, they look to us, they look to the Communists, and they want to decide which road they will take. We preach the doctrine of democracy. It is the most difficult of all doctrines. But we have to live up to it. We have to practice what we preach, and that is what we are going to do. [Applause.]', 'We are going to move ahead. We are going to provide a fair chance for our people, full protection for their constitutional rights. To that we are committed, and that we are going to do, and we are going to move this country ahead. [Applause.] Do you know the most important new area of the world today is Africa? It controls one-fourth of all the votes in the General Assembly. I am chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Do you know how many Negroes we have in our State Department Foreign Service out of 6,000? Twenty-six. Do you know how many Federal judges there are, Federal district judges? Zero out of 220. We can do better. We can do better. [Applause.] So I come here today, saying that this country is faced with difficulty and hazardous days. We need all the talent we can get. What we want is a fair chance and a fair opportunity to move ahead, to strengthen our country, develop the potential of our people, and to that we are committed. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted 95 percent against tlie 25-cent minimum wage in the thirties. He represents a party which voted [response from the audience] - I am doing my best. Mr. Nixon represents a party which voted 90 percent against the $1.25 wage for those employees of a million dollar company. Which side is he on? Which side are the Republicans on, for progress or for standing still?

Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of college. I don't see any reason why four and a half million people are out of work. I don't see any reason why the prestige and influence of this country is dropping. [Inaudible.] I come here today and ask your support. [Applause.] California is key to this election. If we can carry this State, if we can carry this State we will win. [Applause.] California is a beautiful State. Mr. Nixon will enjoy it.

[Applause.] I come to this plant, in this State of California, in this country of ours, and I ask you what in the last 25 years, or in the last 8 years, the Republican Party has ever done for the working people of this country.

That is typical. These plants were built, most of them, before and during World War II. Do you know who was President? Franklin Roosevelt. Do you know where he lived. [Applause.] Do you know where Franklin Roosevelt lived? In New York. And the plants were in California. How could anyone be so stupid as to think in the most dangerous time in the life of our country somebody would run for President in order to take defense plants from one State and put them in another? That about as well describes their campaign. That is about what they are reduced to.', 'Mr. Nixon takes a ride through New York City tomorrow. He has with him Governor Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, President Eisenhower. Where is Barry Goldwater?

[Applause.] Yesterday I understand Mr. Nixon spent 2 hours and a half in the White House asking the President to go with him to Pittsburgh and Cleveland. [Laughter.] Mr. Eisenhower is not a candidate. Mr. Nixon is. And if he can't stand up to the American people, if he won't come and meet me in a fifth debate, how is he going to stand up to Mr. Khrushchev? [Applause.]"", 'The fact of the matter is that the defense industries of California have been moving out. We passed in the last session of the Congress $370 million for the B-70. The administration would not do it until 7 days before election they finally decided to support the program. That is about the responsibility of the party that we have come to know in the last 8 years. Here in this plant, and I want to make it clear, long before I came to this plant, I said that it was incumbent upon the next President of the United States to provide airlift for the conventional forces if we are going to protect our commitments around the world, and to make them jet. [Applause.] When we transported the United Nations forces to the Congo, the British flew some troops in in jets and so did the Russians. We took them in in the props. I believe that the United States is going to meet its commitments to 50 countries. The next President of the United States, whomever he may be, is going to have to recommend to the Congress sustaining and increasing the airlift, if we are going to move this force of ours around the world. [Applause.]', 'Now I come here - you are all going home and I am not going to hold you up, except I want to say three things:', ""First, I want to ask you what you know from your own experience in the last 25 years or in the last 14 years, what Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party ever suggested in the field of progressive legislation for the people of this country. Social security? They voted against it. Minimum wage? Unemployment compensation? Housing? Name it. This administration has stood still, and the result is that the image of America as a moving society throughout the world has stood still. I come here to ask your help in rebuilding that image, in rebuilding the United States as a strong and vital forward-looking society, a society on the move. The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States. [Applause.] And therefore I come here today in the last 7 days of this campaign, asking you to make your judgment as responsible citizens of this country, where we stand in the most difficult, hazardous time in the life of our country, at a time when the United States is still the only hope of freedom, and I ask you to join with me in committing this country to progress, in moving this country forward. Mr. Nixon is saying that he is a conservative. I believe in 1960 and the 1960's the United States is going to have to be progressive, we are going to have to move again, and I come here and ask your help in doing it. [Applause.] Thank you.

[Applause.] Mr. Nixon has chosen to run for the Presidency with the argument that our prestige has never been higher in the world. He argues that everything that must be done is being done; that we have never had in this State of California or in the country such prosperity. I hold a different view. I hold the view that this is a great country, but it must be greater; it is a powerful country, but it must be more powerful, and I hold the view that in the 1960's this country either moves ahead or it slips back, and if we slip back, we fail not only ourselves and those who come after us - we fail all those people stretching around the globe who desire to be free and to look to us. This is one of the most important elections in the history of our country."", 'I believe it is a choice between a candidate and a party that is willing to break new ground, that is willing to move ahead, that is willing to take this country off dead center, and between a party, the Republican Party, that looks to the past.', ""Now, as long as we in this country stand still, as long as we do not take advantage of our opportunities, we fail ourselves, and we fail those who desire to be free.

We cannot afford to have 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never get to college.

We can't afford to have 16 million Americans over the age of 65 who live on an average social security check of less than $72 a month. [Applause.]"", 'This administration argues about its progress. If you buy today a $10,000 home in this community on a 30-year mortgage as a result of the high interest rate policy of this administration, you pay $3,300 more than you would have paid 8 years ago for that house. If you build a school, you pay another percentage more than you would have paid 8 years ago. Here is this country of ours, the richest country on earth, with a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, and today in San Diego and in parts of Los Angeles nearly 7 percent of the labor force is out of work.', 'Now, I think we are going to have to do better. I think we are going to have to move ahead. I think the United States has unlimited potential, but I cannot believe in the difficult and changing times in which our country lives - I cannot believe that we will put our confidence and our hopes for the future in a party which has always stood still and with a candidate which symbolizes that party - Mr. Nixon. [Applause.]', 'Can you tell me one single program in the last 25 years, domestically or abroad, that the Republican Party has ever proposed, has ever suggested? [Response from the audience.] We are going to provide our security, and we are going to provide peace, only as long as the United States gives the image of a strong and vital society. Today in Latin America and Africa and Asia, what is the image of the United States? What vision do we give to them of their future? The Government took polls this summer which showed that our prestige has dropped, and which they will not release.

[Applause.]', ""Beginning 7 days from now, November 8, the responsibilities of Mr. Nixon and myself will have ceased, and your responsibility as voters will begin. You have to make your judgment between the two candidates, between the parties that they represent, between the two political philosophies that they symbolize, and between their two different of this country and its needs. And let me make it very clear that I think that there are very sharp differences which separate Mr. Nixon and myself. We hold entirely different views. [Applause.] We hold entirely different views of our country's position in the world, of the needs of our time, of the responsibilities of our National Government, of our responsibilities as individual citizens."", ""You have to make your judgment a week from today of what you believe, of what you see is our role in the world, whether you share Mr. Nixon's view that our prestige in the world has never been higher, and that of the Communists never lower. You have to find out whether you share his view that we have never had such great prosperity in this country, that everything that must be done is being done in its proper time, and that what we need is a continuation of the past. I want to make it clear that I wholly disagree with this view. I don't believe that everything is being done in its proper time. I do not believe that our prestige in the world is at a record high. I do not believe that we have met our responsibilities as individuals and citizens of this great country."", '1960 is the beginning of a great new revolutionary period. I cannot believe that in these changing times, these times of hazard and opportunity, that the voters of this country as citizens will choose the status quo. David Lloyd George once said a tired nation is a Tory nation, and I do not hold the view that the United States is either tired or Tory. [Applause.]', 'You have to decide as young voters, as young voters who have the longest stake in the great Republic, who are the most concerned with the search for truth, who have the least ties to the present and the most ties in the future, you have to decide which party, which candidate, most nearly approximates your judgment of our country, its needs and its future. We are going into problems which are entirely different from any that this country has ever faced. The problem of how a free society, with its freedom of choice, its breadth of opportunity, its range of alternatives - how that free society can successfully compete with a totalitarian society. We believe that our society is the best, but that does not mean that it automatically survives. The whole history of the world, from the struggle of the Athenians against the Macedonians, to the experience of the British before World War II, in their competition with the Nazis, all show that for a free society to survive, to successfully compete, the leaders have to tell the truth. They have to be informed. They have to share their information with the people. I was in England and saw what happened in 1935 when Stanley Baldwin went to the people of England and told them that everything was being done in good measure, that the prestige of the British was at its height, that their security was insured. He won that election, and the British almost lost the war. We are not going to have a repetition of that in 1960. [Applause.]', ""I don't believe our economic growth is sufficient. I don't believe that the influence of the United States in Latin America, Africa, and Asia is growing - but diminishing. I don't believe that the United States has allied itself with those people in their fight against poverty, ignorance, and disease.

407,John F. Kennedy ,"November 01, 1960","['* * * One week from tonight it will be over. The ballots will be counted. The shouting will die down. One candidate will concede, one will accept, and either Mr. Nixon or myself will turn to the task of governing the great Republic.', ""Whoever wins, that task will not be easy. The next President's desk will not be clear, waiting for new plans and problems. It will be piled high with old problems, inherited problems, chronic problems, old bills demanding payment, Ambassadors and negotiators demanding instructions, agencies disappointed by the budget demanding relief, legislation previously submitted demanding new orders. But as the new President tries to clean out this pile, new problems and new pressures will rush in upon new areas of crisis around the world - new decisions on weapons and strategy and economic policy and a thousand other items."", 'There, on that one desk, on his shoulders will converge all the hopes and fears of every American, and indeed all the hopes and fears of all who believe in peace and freedom anywhere in the world. Whatever the issue, however critical the problem may be, the President will sit alone at the apex. He will have his advisers, his Cabinet, his own sources of information and ideas. But the responsibility, the burden, the final decision must be his and his alone. As the legend on President Truman\'s desk puts it: ""The buck stops here.""', 'For 4 years, the reins of the Nation will be in his hands and the burdens of the world will be on his back. For 4 years, no other decision you make will be so fateful to your country. No other act in your daily life will entrust so much of your future to one man, his party and his honor.', 'Fully aware of this grave responsibility, I am asking the people of California, and the people of this Nation, to place their trust and confidence in me.', 'But I do not ask you to choose merely between two men. I ask you to choose what kind of State you want, what kind of Nation you want, what kind of effort you want made to sustain the cause of freedom around the world.', 'Mr. Nixon and I represent two wholly different parties with wholly different records in the past and wholly different view of the future. We disagree, and our parties disagree, on where we stand today and where we are headed tomorrow. During the past 2 months, and in the 14 years that preceded, we have made known our views on these matters. We have made speeches, we have issued statements. But only one of us, in the years to come, will make the actual decisions, and there is no one in this State or Nation whose life will not be altered by those decisions.', 'Some may feel that their life is unaffected, that their job is secure, their rent is paid, their taxes and tensions are likely to be about the same whoever is elected. The speeches all seem to be directed to one special-interest group or another, to which most Americans do not belong.', 'But nothing could be further from the truth.', '(1) Our prestige abroad, what other peoples think of us, is not of importance only to those Americans who work or travel abroad. The sign ""Yankee go home"" does not apply only to our diplomats, foreign-aid specialists, and military personnel who are stationed overseas. The great struggle in the world today is not one of popularity but one of power, and our power depends in considerable measure upon our ability to influence other nations, upon their willingness to associate themselves with our efforts, upon the strength of our stature and leadership. When Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher, when this administration refuses to disclose surveys revealing how doubtful the world is about our capacity to lead the next generation, they remind me of Stanley Baldwin in the British election of 1936 telling the voters that all was well, and the Nazi menace was no cause for alarm. Many Americans would like to shrug off these surveys and the riots in Tokyo, the mobs in Venezuela, Mr. Castro\'s frenzied attacks on our reputation as the inevitable consequence of world leadership. But this deterioration in our prestige abroad threatens our bases, our alliances, our security and the peace itself and it is time we were respected once again throughout the would as the good neighbor.', ""(2) Federal aid to education is not merely of importance to those with children in school. Mr. Nixon's tie-breaking vote defeating higher teachers' salaries was not only harmful to our teachers. We live under majority rule and if that majority is not well educated in its responsibilities, the whole Nation suffers. We live in an era of growth and change, and if our educational system is not producing enough doctors or enough engineers or enough teachers, the whole Nation suffers. And finally, we live in a world of shifting tides and opinion and if we cannot outstrip the Russians in space and science, in technicians to underdeveloped countries, in the language training of our Foreign Service officers, then our prestige suffers, our influence suffers, and the whole Nation suffers. Ten years ago our colleges were producing twice as many scientists and engineers as the Russians; now they produce twice as many as we do. It is not because our colleges are empty - they are already overcrowded. And those who are counting on sending their children to college in 1970 may find that decision was already made in 1959-60 when the Republicans blocked Federal help on scholarships, loans, classrooms, and dormitories. I say a better educated America is a stronger America."", ""(3) Full employment is not merely of importance to the working man and woman. When a layoff hits a plant in southern California, every business and professional man in town feels the effect. A worker on an unemployment check of less than $35 a week cannot buy the same goods for his family that his paycheck bought and he cannot even pay all his bills. But what should shock every citizen was the Republican decision to cut national defense and defense employment, without regard for either our national security or the needs of our workers. In order to make good on arbitrary budget promises, they cut back aircraft and missile programs essential to deter a surprise attack and then partially reinstate them when election day nears. This is false economy at its worst, but it is no more false than the detestable charge that I would shift defense jobs from this State to some other area of unemployment. What Mr. Nixon doesn't understand is that the President of the United States represents all the people in all the States. He cannot run on a platform setting one State against another. I want full employment in California and New York and across the Nation; it is Mr. Nixon who calls unemployment inevitable."", '(4) Civil rights are not merely of importance to minority groups. If the full rights of our Constitution, the full values of human dignity, are not available to every American, then they no longer have the same meaning for any American. They no longer have the same appeal to those in other lands of other races and religions, and they are a majority whose respect we seek. And they no longer guarantee us a nation that draws upon the full talents of every citizen. We do not want a Negro who could be a doctor, in a city short of doctors, working as a messenger. If Mr. Nixon and the Republicans had not consistently opposed fair employment practices, if Mr. Nixon had only done something with his Committee on Government Contracts, then there would be hundreds of thousands more Negroes in skilled, professional, and Government jobs today - there would be more than 26 Negro Foreign Service officers out of 3,632 - and there would be more than 1 Negro Federal judge in the entire 50 States. I want a Government and a Nation in which every citizen can obtain any position his qualifications deserve.', '(5) Natural resource development is not of importance merely to those in our great river valleys. Its importance is not limited to the West. If we cannot obtain enough water for our farms, our cities, and our industry - if we cannot develop enough low-cost power to meet the growing demand - if our rivers are all polluted, our forests depredated, our parks all replaced by pavement - then the whole national economy is held back, our standard of living declines, and our children are denied their rightful inheritance of America, the beautiful. Almost every great dam in this country is a monument to the resource policies of the Democratic Party. The Republicans have only one monument: three words added to our history - ""No new starts.""', '(6) Monetary and fiscal policies are not merely of importance to bankers, businessmen, and gold speculators. When tight money policies force into bankruptcy a small businessman who cannot get credit, someone else must be found to hire his employees and buy from his suppliers, and someone else must pay his taxes. When interest rates soar, the family buying a home pays out thousands more on the mortgage. The cost of a new car, a washing machine, anything bought on time goes higher and higher, and even food prices rise despite a disastrous drop in farm income. Those who are out of work, those who receive only the minimum wage of $1 an hour, obviously cannot meet the rising cost of living. But this squeeze is also felt by almost every family - the cost of new drugs, the cost of a college education, the cost of broken Republican campaign promises.', '(7) Finally, medical care for the aged is not merely of importance to those past 65. The heartless inadequacies of the Republican program, the humiliating ""pauper\'s oath"" which many retired workers simply refuse to take, should be of concern to every young family who may some day need to support an aged parent. When chronic illness strikes and stays, and drags on and on, savings are not enough, loans are not enough, the family must help. And I have seen families with comfortable incomes who found their budgets drained by their own medical bills and those of their parents. How much more responsible it would be to put aside a few cents each day under social security. Mr. Nixon, as the Republican candidate, necessarily calls this extreme - I call it extremely necessary.', ""These are critical differences between the parties, and these are critical times. I stood here in Los Angeles last July, as the sun went down on the Democratic convention, and asked your help. I ask it now. I ask it next Tuesday. Give me your help, your hand, your heart, your voice, and, with God's help, we shall build a better America.""]"
408,John F. Kennedy ,"November 01, 1960","['* * * Two days ago Mr. Nixon reversed the consistent policies of 25 years of Republican leadership and issued a position paper advocating improvements in the social security system.', '""During the past 25 years,"" Mr. Nixon said, ""we have made amazing progress in making available to our citizens a sound program of social security.""', 'We have made progress in the past 25 years - but it has not been because of Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party. For every step of that progress from the first Social Security Act to the present - every increase in benefits - every successful effort to ease the hardship of old age - has been achieved by the Democratic Party over the fierce and consistent opposition of Mr. Nixon and the Republicans.', 'Mr. Nixon has taken every program which he and his party have voted and fought against - and placed them in position papers - and adopted them for his own. His election week conversion to Democratic programs and away from his own record is the greatest escape act since Houdini.', 'But election week promises and November nostrums will not meet the urgent problems of our older citizens. They need leadership from the White House and votes in the Congress between elections - and that is just what Mr. Nixon and the Republicans have refused to give.', '(1) Mr. Nixon now says that the Federal Government should end its job discrimination against those over 65 and points out that an Executive order can do the job. But for 8 years the Republicans have failed to issue any such order, and discrimination against our older citizens has continued.', '(2) Mr. Nixon now says that ""we must increase our investment in programs for the rehabilitation of the physically and mentally handicapped.""', 'But in 1954, a Democratic bill to expand our rehabilitation program was defeated by Republican opposition. And during the past 6 years the Democrats have added three-quarters of a million dollars to the Federal-State rehabilitation program over Republican opposition.', '(3) Mr. Nixon now says that ""we must continue to improve our old-age survivors and disability programs."" He calls for increasing social security coverage, studying the adequacy of benefits, and making disability payments more easily available to those over 60.', ""But in 1948, the Republican 80th Congress overrode President Truman's veto in order to remove three quarters of a million people from the coverage of the social security."", 'In 1949 Mr. Nixon himself voted to eliminate completely all disability benefits for those under 65 - and he was joined by 79 percent of his Republican colleagues. But this Republican effort was defeated because 202 out of 203 Democrats voted against it.', 'And in 1958 Mr. Nixon himself failed to break a tie vote on a bill to increase assistance payments to the old, the retired, and the disabled and, as a results the bill was defeated.', '(4) Mr. Nixon now says that ""constructive steps should be taken to provide more of our senior citizens with housing adapted to their needs.""', 'But the direct-loan program for housing for the elderly, first proposed by the Democrats in 1958, and passed by a Democratic Congress in 1959, was opposed by the Republicans, who also opposed all authorizations for the program, and refused to request appropriations when the Democrats gave them an authorization anyway. This year the Democratic Congress appropriated $20 million for this program despite Republican opposition, but the only way to make sure that the money is used is to have a Democratic President in the White House.', '(5) Finally, and most amazing of all, Mr. Nixon now says that ""we must make it possible for our senior citizens to receive adequate medical services.""', ""But this is the same Mr. Nixon who, only last spring, led the fight to defeat Democratic efforts to pass a sound program of medical aid financed through the social security system. As a result of Mr. Nixon's effort, effective medical care for the aged was defeated because only a single Republican in the Senate defied his leadership and voted for the bill."", '""In all these ways,"" Mr. Nixon concluded, ""we can surely mount a successful attack on the problems of aging and the aged.""', 'I disagree with Mr. Nixon. For the problems of our older citizens will not be solved through position papers, through promises which the record shows are unmatched by the desire to act.', 'For only specific proposals backed by action will meet the problems, and the long history of the Democratic Party, as well as the voting records of the two presidential candidates, is a clear demonstration that only under the leadership of the Democratic Party can we hope to make a real progress in creating a better life for our older citizens.', ""I have pledged myself and my party to the immediate enactment of a program of medical care for the aged through social security - a soundly financed program without a degrading pauper's oath and with adequate benefits. And if I am elected President next Tuesday, that pledge will not be filed away with old and unmeant campaign promises; it will be at the very top of my agenda for action. For I intend to submit such a program to Congress within 30 days after I take office."", 'And after we move ahead in meeting the urgent medical needs of our older citizens, we will begin to deal with their needs for increased benefits, adequate housing, employment opportunities, and all the rest.', 'I do not have to spell out these programs in a position paper. For I have already discussed them in detail. And they are written in the record of my party - in our 25-year effort to insure dignity and a decent life to our older citizens and in the Democratic bills that were defeated, the programs that were destroyed, the promises which were frustrated by the programs that were destroyed, the promises which were frustrated by the opposition of Mr. Nixon and the Republicans and by lack of leadership from the White House.']"
409,John F. Kennedy ,"November 02, 1960","['STAFFING A FOREIGN POLICY FOR PEACE', 'One week from tonight the next President of the United States will be turning to the arduous tasks that lie ahead - selecting a Cabinet - and preparing a program for peace.', 'But whoever our next President may be - whomever he selects as his Secretary of State - their efforts for a successful foreign policy, their efforts for peace, will depend in large measure on the men and women who must carry out that policy. A program for peace can be no better than those who implement it. Our stature abroad can be no more respected or influential than those who speak for us. The policies may be decided at the top - but they are placed and executed here, and accepted or rejected abroad, at a somewhat lower level.', 'Speaking in this State last month, Mr. Nixon showed his inability to grasp this basic fact. His objective was to describe the new machinery by which he intended to ""win the struggle for peace and freedom."" But that machinery turned out to be nothing more than a series of committees, conferences, and good will tours.', 'This should not have come as a surprise. In these last 8 years, confronted with some 75 different problems requiring action, this administration has promptly responded with some 75 different committees and conferences. Mr. Nixon has announced a new committee or conference himself on the average of once a week in this campaign.', 'But to win the peace - to prevent another war - and it will not be a war of words - we need more than words, harsh or soft, more than committees, conferences, and goodwill trips. We need a stronger America - militarily, economically, scientifically, and educationally. We need a stronger free world, a stronger attack on world poverty, a stronger U.N., a stronger U.S. foreign policy - and, above all, a stronger foreign-policy staff that is dedicated to peace.', 'I recognize fully the need for judgment and foresight by the President and his top advisers. High-level committees and summit conferences can play a useful role. But the hard, tough work of laying the groundwork for peace must be done by thousands of hands. It was Clemenceau who said: ""War is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the generals."" And surely, in this nuclear age, peace is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to either generals or summit conferences.', 'We can push a button to start the next war - but there is no push-button magic to bring a just and lasting peace. To be peace loving is not enough - for the Sermon on the Mount saved its blessing for the peacemakers. The generation for which I speak has seen enough of warmongers - let our great role in history be that of peacemakers.', 'But the harsh facts of the matter are that in three vital areas we have been ill-staffed and ill-represented in the struggle for peace - in our disarmament planning, in our diplomatic and foreign service, and in our technical assistance to underdeveloped nations.', 'In all three areas, we have failed to realize that times have changed since World War II. Weapons are more complex, and, therefore, so is their control. The enemy advances now by nonmilitary methods - and military methods cannot prevent that advance.', 'Disarmament planning is one of the most glaring failures of these last 8 years. There have been a series of opportunities, conferences, and proposals by other nations including the Russians. But we have not been ready. The inspection and detection of modern weapons and their testing requires complex new techniques in dozens of specialized technologies: seismology, atmospherics, aerial reconnaissance, radar surveillance, and many others. The research problems are enormous.', 'But this administration has had fewer than 100 employees working full time in this field - less than one-fifth as many Government employees as are taking care of cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission.', 'As a result, our disarmament proposals have lacked continuity and practicality - our delegates to arms-control conferences have been ill-prepared, ill-instructed, ill-staffed, and constantly changed. We have never adopted a comprehensive and meaningful position, and we have too often resorted instead to irresponsible grandstand plays.', 'I have proposed a national peace agency, an arms control research institute, to prepare those studies necessary for a firm and precise policy, to make certain our spokesmen are better prepared and better staffed at future conferences, to enable us to seize the disarmament initiative. For I know we can do better.', 'But I want to turn now to the problems of our foreign policy staff overseas. Many Americans have marveled at the selfless example of Dr. Tom Dooley in Laos. Many have shuddered at the examples in ""The Ugly American."" Both examples may be found in great numbers in our oversea missions. But most of our personnel are somewhere in between, most could be doing a better job, and most must do a better job if we are to survive the modern techniques of conquest.', 'For on the other side of the globe, diplomats skilled in the languages and customs of the nation to whom they are accredited - teachers, doctors, technicians and experts desperately needed in a dozen fields by underdeveloped nations - are pouring forth from Moscow to advance the cause of world communism.', 'The Lenin Institute for Political Warfare exports each year hundreds of agents to disrupt free institutions in the uncommitted world. A friend of mine visiting the Soviet Union last year met a young Russian couple studying Swahili and African customs at the Moscow Institute of Languages. They were not language teachers - he was a sanitation engineer and she was a nurse. And they were being prepared to live among African nations as missionaries for communism.', 'Already Asia has more of these Soviet than American technicians - and Africa may by this time. Russian diplomats are the first to arrive, the first to offer aid, the only ones represented by key officials at diplomatic receptions. They know the country, they speak the language - and in Guinea, Ghana, Laos, and all over the globe, they are working fast and effectively. Missiles and arms cannot stop them - neither can American dollars. They can only be countered by Americans equally skilled and equally dedicated - and if I am elected, I ask you to help me find those Americans.', 'The key arm of our foreign policy is our ambassadorial and Foreign Service. In my travels to every continent, I have often been impressed with the caliber of men and women in the Foreign Service. But I have also been depressed by the grounds for selecting the non-career ambassadors who are placed in charge of these career servants. Many have been ill-chosen, ill-equipped, and ill-briefed. Campaign contributions have been regarded as a substitute for experience. Party leadership has been regarded as a substitute for training. Men who lack compassion for our own people here at home - for our poor, our oppressed, our minority groups - have been sent to oversea posts where compassion, as well as anticommunism, must be reflected in their daily words and deeds. Men who do not even know how to pronounce the name of the chief of state to whom they are accredited must match wits with Communist emissaries long trained in the ways and dialects of that nation. As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee concluded this year about our ambassadors:', '\n  There are too many nominees, career and noncareer, who are merely so-so; not had enough to reject, but not really first rate.\n', 'In 1958, it was reported that our Ambassador to Moscow was the only U.S. Ambassador to a Communist country who spoke the language of the country to which he was assigned. Only two of the nine ambassadors in Arabic-speaking countries spoke Arabic. In 8 of the 12 non-English-speaking NATO countries, our ambassadors lacked a workable knowledge of the main language spoken there. But even our Ambassador in Paris could not negotiate with General De Gaulle in French. ""A man who is ignorant of foreign languages,"" said Goethe, ""is ignorant of his own.""', 'Lower standards at the top level induce lower morale and lower standards in the ranks. It was reported this month that 70 percent of all new Foreign Service officers had no language skills at all last year. Only 3 of 44 Americans in our Embassy in Belgrade spoke Yugoslavian. In Athens only 6 of 79 Americans at the Embassy spoke modern Greek dialects fluently. In New Delhi, not a single American could speak Indian dialects fluently. But we cannot understand what is in the minds of other peoples, or help them understand ours, if we cannot understand their language.', 'And what personnel we do have, we have failed to use properly. After the key African state of Guinea achieved her independence from France, it was 9 months before we sent an ambassador. He arrived to find the Russians well entrenched. Today we still do not have a single diplomatic representative in six of the newly independent nations of Africa - nations that vote in the U.N. - nations that can affect our security. And when a mission chief is sent, the indications are that he will have no briefing papers on African customs and problems - no staff member that speaks Swahili or Urdu or other language - and no staff member who is not also a member of the white race. There are only 26 Negro Foreign Service officers - less than 1 percent - and I think we have to do better.', 'Finally, where are we going to obtain the technicians needed to work with the peoples of underdeveloped lands outside the normal diplomatic channels - and by ""technicians"" I include engineers, doctors, teachers, agricultural experts, specialists in public law, labor taxation, civil service - all the skills necessary to establish a viable economy, a stable government, and a decent standard of living?', 'A news item in this week\'s paper reported that ""a group of Russian geologists, electrical engineers, architects, and farming and fishing experts arrived in Ghana today to give technical advice."" Another item described the potentiality for Castro-type or Communist exploitation in northeast Brazil, where intolerable living standards have reduced thousands to a starvation diet, and in two villages prevented a single baby from living beyond the age of 12 months. And still another item described unrest in the Caribbean island of Haiti, where - in 1950 - 90 percent of the population has never been taught to read or write, and there is 1 doctor for every 10,000 people.', 'Think of the wonders skilled American personnel could work, building goodwill, building the peace. There is not enough money in all America to relieve the misery of the undeveloped world in a giant and endless soup kitchen. But there is enough know-how and enough knowledgeable people to help those nations help themselves.', 'I therefore propose that our inadequate efforts in this area be supplemented by a Peace Corps of talented young men willing and able to serve their country in this fashion for 3 years as an alternative to peacetime selective service - well qualified through rigorous standards; well trained in the language, skills, and customs hey will need to know; and directed and paid by the ICA point 4 agencies. We cannot discontinue training our young men as soldiers of war - but we also need them as ""ambassadors of peace.""', 'This would be a volunteer corps - and volunteers would be sought among talented young women as well - and from every race and walk of life. For this Nation is full of young people eager to serve the cause of peace in the most useful way.', 'I have met them on campaigns across the country. When I suggested at the University of Michigan, lately, that we needed young men and women willing to give up a few years to serve their country in this fashion, the students proposed a new organization to promote such an effort. Others have indicated a similar response, offering a tremendous pool of talent that could work modern miracles for peace in dozens of underdeveloped nations.', ""I am convinced that our young men and women, dedicated to freedom, are fully capable of overcoming the efforts of Mr. Khrushchev's missionaries who are dedicated to undermining that freedom."", 'These proposals offer no quick and easy solution to the problems of peace. But they are essential tools. ""Give me a fulcrum,"" Archimedes is reported to have said, ""and a place to stand and I will move the world."" The tools I have suggested can be our fulcrum - it is here we take our stand - let us move the world down the road to peace.']"

I think it is time we met our problems. [Applause.]', 'It takes more than words, hard or soft, more than tours, more than parades, more than conferences. It takes a stronger America, militarily, economically, scientifically, and educationally.

[Applause.] We can push a button to start the next war but there is no push button magic to winning a lasting and enduring peace. To be peace loving is not enough, for the Sermon on the Mount saved its blessings for the peacemakers. The generation which I speak for has seen enough of warmongers. Let our great role in history be that of peacemakers. [Applause.] But in the two areas, two areas where peace can he won in the field of disarmament and in our representations abroad this country has been ill served.', 'Disarmament planning is the most glaring omission in the field of national security and world peace of the last 8 years. [Applause.] This administration has less than 100 people working full time on the subject in the entire National Government. This is one-fifth as many Government employees as take care of the cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Commission. [Applause.] One hundred people working for peace. As a result we have gone to every conference unprepared. Our chief negotiator admitted at the 1958 conference on preventing surprise attacks that we, and I quote him, ""hadn\'t up to this time really given the intense study of the kind of measure which would make this kind of measure possible,"" had not even intense study to the very program that they were then putting forward.', 'A year ago when we went to the disarmament conference, we appointed an attorney from Massachusetts to set up an ad hoc committee. That committee met for 3 months. It was then dismissed. Four months before the conference began we drafted an attorney from New York to head our mission.', 'The result was we had no program and we accepted that of the British. How could we be so indifferent to one of our great chances for peace. We are going to have to do better. [Applause.] If we are successful on Tuesday, we are going to set up in the National Government a national peace agency, an arms research institute [applause], to prepare the studies which are necessary, to conduct the scientific research which is essential if we are going to speak with vigor and precision in this vital area of opportunity.', ""Secondly, we are going to have to be better represented. We are going to have to have the best Americans we can get to speak for our country abroad. All of us have admired what Dr. Tom Dooley has done in Laos. [Applause.] And others have been discouraged at the examples that we read of the ugly American. And I think that the United States is going to have to do much better in this area if we are going to defend freedom and peace in the 1960's. [Applause.] For the fact of the matter is that out of Moscow and Peiping and Czechoslovakia and Eastern Germany are hundreds of men and women, scientists, physicists, teachers, engineers, doctors, nurses, studying in those institutes, prepared to spend their lives abroad in the service of world communism. A friend of mine visiting the Soviet Union last summer met a young Russian couple studying Swahili and African customs at the Moscow Institute of Languages. They were not language teachers. He was a sanitation engineer and she was a nurse, and they were being prepared to live their lives in Africa as missionaries for world communism."", 'This can only be countered by skill and dedication of Americans who are willing to spend their lives serving the cause of freedom.

Too many have been chosen - too many ambassadors have been chosen who are ill equipped and ill briefed. Campaign contributions have been regarded as a substitute for experience.

They did not demonstrate compassion there. Men who do not even know how to pronounce the name of the head of the country to which they are accredited, as we saw 2 years ago in the case of our Ambassador to Ceylon, have been sent to important countries, essential countries, in the struggle between East and West. How can they compete with Communist emissaries long trained and dedicated and committed to the cause of extending communism in those countries?', 'In 1958, it was reported that our Ambassador to Moscow was the only American Ambassador who could speak the language accredited behind the Iron Curtain, only one. Only two of the nine Ambassadors to the Arabic speaking countries spoke Arabic. In 8 of the 12 non-English speaking countries of Western Europe, our Ambassadors lack a workable knowledge of the language of the country to which they were accredited.', 'Our Ambassador to Paris could not even discuss negotiations with General de Gaulle, because he lacked that skill in French.

As the cow said to the Maine farmer, ""Thank you for a warm hand on a cold morning."" [Laughter and applause.] I am delighted to be here this morning, and I appreciate all you are doing in this campaign. This is a beautiful State. I am confident that Mr. Nixon will enjoy it after the election.

[Applause.]', 'But we are going to keep at it in the next 4 or 5 days. I had to have Governor Brown ride with me down the center of Los Angeles, and Mr. Nixon requires President Eisenhower to ride down the streets of New York with him. Yesterday, I said Governor Rockefeller, Henry Cabot Lodge, Vice President Nixon, and I thought they ought to have Barry Goldwater. [Laughter.] So they can all be in the car together. [Laughter.]', ""This is an important election and really it just isn't between Mr. Nixon and myself, or really just between our two parties. I really believe Mr. Nixon, after he was nominated, could have made a judgment of the needs of our country and the needs around the world and conducted a campaign based on those needs. In my judgment, Governor Rockefeller would have conducted that kind of campaign. But Mr. Nixon chose to go in a different direction. He chose to run on a program which says that our prestige has never been higher in the world, in spite of the fact that the USIA studies, locked up in his own State Department, completely refute that position, studies which they refuse to release, and he has chosen to run at home here on our unexampled prosperity. There is no note of urgency there. There is not any doubt in my mind that the success of Woodrow Wilson the success of Franklin Roosevelt, came in the early days of their administrations. There are months of grace - Governor Brown is familiar with that - where a Governor is permitted to proceed on his program without too much difficulty. And it is true of a President. They talk of the 100 days of Franklin Roosevelt. There is not any doubt that the first 2 years of Woodrow Wilson's administration saw many of the domestic reforms which were so essential, the Federal Reserve Board and all the rest written into law. But unless the groundwork is laid during the campaign, all that valuable time is then lost. The next President of the United States takes office on January 20. He then has to go to work, his time begins to run out almost immediately. So unless he is prepared for action, then, valuable time is lost, never to be regained."", 'The point of all this is that unless you lay the groundwork in a campaign for later administrative and legislative and executive action then your chances of providing progress for our country and our people, needed actions, become lessened.', ""Mr. Nixon has not sounded any note of urgency in his campaign. He is accompanied in his travels by Cabinet members, Mr. Seaton, Mr. Schreiber, Mr. Rogers, and the others, who are familiar figures in Washington. There is no idea that a new, fresh vigor is going to take over, a sense of urgency, a sense of commitment, a sense of the feeling that in this great Republic we are going to have to move forward again. If we don't feel it now, the chances of feeling it next January or February or March in a Congress controlled by the Democrats, a President who has run for office, perhaps, and won, on a program which bears little recognition of the facts, which is my polite way of referring to Mr. Nixon and he refers to me impolitely [laughter], I think that our chances [laughter]"", '(At this point there was a microphone repair.)', ""That never happens with the Vice President. I understand that everything is in perfect order. [Laughter and applause.] It does not get the votes, but it is well organized. [Laughter.] I am now going to have to give a new speech, evidently. [Laughter.] You all know Pat Hillings, don't you ? [Laughter and applause.]"", 'One of the subjects on which we are going to have to act, and on which I am really not convinced that the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon are committed, despite the position papers, is on the subject of education. Thomas Jefferson once said, ""If you expect a nation to be ignorant and free, you expect what never was and never will be."" So from the time of the Northwest Ordinance, which was written by John Adams and Thomas Jefferson and other distinguished founders of our country, which set aside in the Northwest Territory one lot out of every township for the maintenance of education, we have recognized that education is not only a local responsibility not only a responsibility of the State, but also a responsibility of the National Government. When the Land Grant College Act was passed in the administration of Abraham Lincoln, it provided that public lands in every State would be set aside for the maintenance of State universities and State colleges. The same is true in our own day. We need the best educated citizens in the world to maintain a free society. [Applause.] The property tax in all of your communities is already heavily burdened. In many places in the United States, it is a confiscatory tax - and I don\'t want any young man or woman in the United States to be denied an education merely because we rely on one source of revenue, without using wisely the sources of revenue that are available to us. Even today, 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. In the next 10 years we are going to have to build as many college classrooms and dormitories as we have built in the last 200 years. We are going to have twice as many boys and girls applying for college in 1970 as are applying in 1960. That represents a responsibility for us all.', ""Ten years ago we were turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Russians. Today they are turning out twice as many as we are, and even more ominous, because I don't say that scientists and engineers are all that we need, but even more ominous is the fact that they are devoting a far larger percentage of their national income, their gross national product, to education, than we are. We need in a free society, where the responsibility lies with the people, with their own good judgment and sense of responsibility and restraint, we want the best educated people in the world. We are at the mercy, and the cause of freedom is at the mercy, of a majority of our citizens, and as one of those citizens who is so involved, as you all are, all of us want those citizens to be well educated. [Applause.]"", ""In 1957, a majority of the Republicans in the House killed aid to school construction. In 1958, every Republican in the key Education and Labor Committee voted against aid for school construction, and in 1960, when we tried again to provide aid for the construction of public school classrooms, 67 percent of all the Republicans in the House voted against it, and all four Republicans in the House Rules Committee joined together with two unwise Democrats - and we have some of them - all four of the Republicans joined together to kill the bill from ever getting to the floor of the House. That is the party that Mr. Nixon leads, and he is part of it. He cast the deciding vote in the Senate after making one of his moving and emotional speeches, the deciding vote - a week before about the plight of our teachers - cast the deciding vote in the Senate against aid for teachers' salaries. [Response from the audience.]"", ""We need 135,000 more teachers. There are 3 million children in the United States being taught by teachers who do not have teacher certificates. The Republican Secretary of HEW says these low salaries of teachers are the most serious weakness in our country's educational system, and I hope he tells that to the Vice President or writes it to him in Whittier. [Laughter and applause.]"", ""Here is what I think we ought to do in the next Congress. First, we ought to pass a bill which will provide assistance to the States, the States then to make the judgment of what percentage of the aid should be turned over to the teachers' salaries and school construction. In that way we can insure local control over education, local control over curriculum, and all the rest, but at the same time make sure that our schools are built and our teachers are compensated. [Applause.] Once we do that, we have a right to expect that our teachers will be well trained, will be imaginative, will be dedicated. We must search for new teaching methods. I have a professor from Harvard Law School who is working to help us in this campaign and he spends a good percentage of his time in a rather old-fashioned way correcting exams and all the rest. I believe that we can develop new techniques for treating those with the most talent, television and all the rest, to provide the widest dissemination of the best teaching skills we have in the country."", ""In addition, we have to make sure that our schools meet their responsibility, which is a responsibility of yours. In some States of the United States, and I don't know whether this is true of California, every graduate from high school, regardless of the standards of the high school, is admitted automatically to college, and then 45 to 50 percent of them flunk out after the first year. We ought to have a right to expect that every high school in the country will meet high school standards, and will make it possible for any child that graduates from that high school, who has talent, who has ability, who has motivation, who desires to go to college, will have the skills, study, and application applied to them in their earlier years so that they are able to make the grade when they enter college. [Applause.]"", 'And then fourthly, I think that what we can do is provide scholarships for not only the brightest boys and girls. There are quite a lot of scholarships but we still have to do more in that area. That is only one of the problems. There are an awful lot of boys and girls who may not be brilliant in high school but who later do very well indeed and make some of our best citizens, but who nevertheless cannot win scholarships. I think what we could do is what we have done in Massachusetts, which is to provide loans, guaranteed by the State, to any boy or girl who is able to demonstrate competence in their ability to survive the first 6 months, which would be paid back with interest after they graduated. [Applause.]', 'Professor Harris at Harvard University and other places has demonstrated the actual financial return which a college education means to any boy or girl in their livelihood, the chances of earning a much greater amount of money in their lives as a result of the college education. Therefore for those young men and women who do not have the talent for scholarships, and who do not have the resources themselves, I believe that some form of a national reinsurance of State programs, of State banking programs, which would provide these loans, at low rates of interest, for those who have desire, for those who can do the job, for those who can survive in college and contribute, I believe that that offers the best way of providing them with an education, and at the same time maintaining the fiscal responsibility of the National Government.', ""I hope the next administration will devote itself to securing this kind of a plan which we have done so well with in housing by reinsurance of mortgages. I think we can reinsure a young man's education or a young woman's education. [Applause.]"", ""And finally, in the next decade, by 1970, in order to provide all those buildings for all your sons and daughters, we are going to have to spend $6 billion more. Governor Brown deals with these statistics every day. The colleges just are not there. I am an officer of Harvard University, which is privately financed, and we just got through the largest fund-raising drive in the history of the United States, to raise $83 million to try to build the buildings we are going to need, and provide compensation for our teachers in order to maintain Harvard University's high standards."", 'The State of California has far greater problems almost than any other State because of the increase in population, and no State has met its responsibility better. I drive around the United States, and I see more mothers with young children who are going to pour into the colleges and universities in this State than in any State in the Union. We need them. This is not a waste. We need them. Therefore, we have to think of ways by which these buildings can be built and maintained and still maintain the fiscal responsibility of our State government and National Government, which is a great responsibility.', 'One of the ways by which this can be done and one of the unfortunate vetoes of the present administration was the veto of the program to provide loans to colleges at low rates of interest to build classrooms and dormitories. I believe that that kind of a program is fruitful, that it comes within the proper relationship between the National Government and the State colleges and universities. It provides them some assistance, but still maintains the burden upon them, of course. But it does at least provide a helping hand at a crucial time, and the next 10 years I think are crucial.', 'This is only one of many problems we are going to have. Our responsibility is to demonstrate that a free society, with its freedom of choice, breadth of opportunity, its reliance on a private enterprise system, that this kind of society, by ingenuity, by attracting the best people we can get, by application, by foresight and a sense of commitment, can compete with a totalitarian system. That is the most difficult of all assignments. Since the time of ancient Athens, history is replete with garrison states that have overcome free cities and free states and free countries. This is not any automatic contest in which our virtues will inevitably triumph. It will require the best we have. That is one of my basic disagreements, fundamental disagreements with Mr. Nixon and the Republicans. For him to use the arguments he is now using in this hazardous time in the life of our country seems to ignore the basic challenge that society now faces.', ""I saw enough of it in the thirties in England, of a free society competing with a totalitarian society. They have young men and women in Moscow studying esoteric doctrine and dialects of Africa and Asia. We have ambassadors who can't even speak French. They have young men and women who not only speak Arabic, but Swahili and all the others that we can't even pronounce. [Applause.]"", ""We are going to have to do much better as a nation as well as individuals. I don't believe that the Republican Party or Mr. Nixon are prepared to make that kind of commitment and I think it involves the future of us all. [Applause.]"", 'Abraham Lincoln once said, ""He has the right to criticize who has the heart to help."" We criticize, but we are going to help. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I don't see any reason why here in this rich country of ours, 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. I don't see any reason why 15 million Americans should live in substandard housing. I don't see any reason why a Negro baby and a white baby born side by side on the same day, that that white baby has three times as much chance of finishing high school, four times as much chance of finishing college, one-fourth as much chance of being out of work, four times as much chance of owning his own home.

Ladies and gentlemen, Governor Brown, Senator Engle, Senator Hugo Fisher, Walter Wencke, who I am confident will be the next Congressman from this district [applause], ladies and gentlemen, I come here to San Diego in the last 6 days of this campaign and ask your support on November 8. [Applause.] Now there may be some people who are tired of politics and tired of this campaign. But I want to make it very clear that this campaign has not been entirely wasted. I want to show you the progress we have made in the last 2 months. For example, 3 weeks ago, Mr. Nixon issued a statement calling for a housing program and saying that the Housing Act of 1949, which is the basis of all other housing acts, is working well. However, years ago as a Congressman, Mr. Nixon voted against the Housing Act of 1949. There is progress for you. [Applause.]', 'We are making a progressive out of Mr. Nixon. Two weeks ago he issued a statement for social security advancement. Do you know that Mr. Nixon leads a party which in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security and voted 98 percent this summer against the medical care for the aged tied to social security. And now he calls all of these programs as progress. We are bringing him along. [Applause.]', ""For 14 years he did not see the light. It just took 1 month of this campaign, and now he is for Federal aid to education. [Applause.] The Republicans have been in control of the administration for 8 years. Eighty percent of them voted against the Federal aid to education in 1957, 65 percent of them in 1958, and this summer, when we wanted an aid to education bill, every Republican on the Rules Committee of the House voted in the House of Representatives against it. And now Mr. Nixon is for it. You can't tell us we are wasting our time in this campaign. We are bringing him along.

They told the truth once and they don't let them travel around any more. [Laughter.] Instead, President Eisenhower is now leading the rescue squad. [Laughter.] What Mr. Nixon does not understand is the President of the United States, Mr. Eisenhower, is not the candidate. You have seen those elephants in the circus. Do you know how they travel around the circus? By grabbing the tall of the elephant in front of them. [Laughter.] That was all right in 1952 and 1956. Mr. Nixon hung on tight. But now Mr. Nixon meets the people. The choice is not President Eisenhower. The choice is whether the people of this country want the leadership of Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party who have never stood for progress. [Applause.]"", 'To show you how desperate and despicable this campaign has become, they are handing out outside defense plants a poster which says ""Jack Kennedy is after your job."" I am after Mr. Eisenhower\'s job. [Applause.]', 'These were passed around without a signature. Now they sign them John B. Starkey, whoever he is, San Diego. It says, ""Attention Defense Workers: Jack Kennedy is after your job. He urges moving defense industries back east.""', ""Now let me just say this: Only to Mr. Starkey, Mr. Nixon, and Mr. Murray Chotiner, would it occur in the last week of an important campaign, when our survival is at stake, to try to pass out literature like this, to try to tell people that I want to run for the Presidency in order to take defense contracts from one State and put them in another. If I were President of the United States, I would represent the United States. Mr. Nixon has not understood that. We represent one people. If I were elected President, I would represent California, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and not only the cause of freedom here, but the cause of freedom around the world. The point of the matter is that most of these defense plants were built here in the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Do you know where he came from? New York State. Did he put all of the defense plants in Hyde Park? [Response from the audience.] And a good many of them were built in the administration of Harry Truman. I have been in Independence, Mo., and I have not seen a defense plant in Independence, Mo. The defense plants were put out here for good reason and they are going to stay here for the same reason. It has not anything to do with whether I come from Massachusetts or California. California has seen defense plants leave, with Mr. Nixon as the Vice President of the United States. [Applause.] This year, as a result of the efforts of Senator Engle and others, the Congress of the United States appropriated $300 million for the B-70's. I endorse wholeheartedly the B-70 manned aircraft. We could not get the administration to release the funds until this week. That is progress. And why do you think they did it this week? I wonder. [Response from the audience.]"", 'I have a higher opinion of the people of this United States and their intelligence than to think they are going to buy Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party in 1960, a party which has stood for 25 years against progress. Here in this community of San Diego, with twice as much unemployment as a year ago, you are building 30 percent less homes than a year ago, you have 6,000 homes unsold. What happens to a worker who is thrown out of work? What does he do? How does he pay his bills? How does he feed his family? What are his chances? Who does he sell his house to in San Diego?', ""This administration has stood still and junk like this is not going to convince the people of San Diego that Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party care, because they don't care.

Do you call that progress? Do you stand in this country now on the verge of the great sixties, with revolution and change all around us, Castro and Khrushchev and the Chinese Communists, and Africa and Latin America, and space, and every part of the world exploding, and think that we can elect an administration and a President who wishes to sit down, who wishes our country to stand still?

I want that trumpet to blow a certain note.

In 1960, this country will be prepared to move again. California and the Nation cannot provide education for our children, jobs for our people, opportunities for our people, medical care tied to social security.

415,John F. Kennedy ,"November 02, 1960","['We live in a fast moving nation. But one thing constant from the birth of our Republic has been our faith in education and our determination to make it available to all our citizens.', 'It was Aristotle, more than 2,000 years ago, who said: ""The neglect of education ruins the constitution of the country."" And Thomas Jefferson echoed these principles when he wrote to a friend in 1786 that ""the most important bill is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness.""', 'Thus the value and importance of education was at the foundation of Western thought - and was again present at the foundation of the American Republic. And in this coming week - which the President has officially proclaimed as American Education Week - we rededicate ourselves to the principle of equal educational opportunity for all regardless of race, place of birth, or wealth. But even though our basic faith in education remains unchanged, the challenges which confront our educational system today are greater, more varied, and more significant than ever before in our history.', 'Thomas Jefferson wrote that, ""If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, it expects what never was and never will be."" And today the frontline of the battle for freedom is not in the trenches - or by the missile-launching pads - it is in our classrooms, and universities - in the jungle schools of Africa, or the remote instruction huts of north-east Brazil - it is wherever free societies are struggling to train the minds of the young.', 'Today I want to discuss education with you - the current crisis in our educational system is a crisis caused by our failure to meet our responsibilities over the past 8 years; and tell you what I think we must do in the future to build an educational system to meet our expanding needs.', 'Underlying any discussion of our educational problems are two basic principles: first, the Federal Government has responsibility to help insure a decent education to all Americans. It was John Adams who wrote that, ""The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and must be willing to bear the expense of it."" And from our earliest days we have followed this principle.', 'Even before the Constitution was adopted the Founding Fathers reserved one lot in every township in the Northwest Territory for the support of education.', 'The Morrill Act of 1865 established the land-grant colleges. The GI bill supported the education of a generation of Americans.', 'The Federal Government in recent years has passed laws granting loans to students and aiding schools in areas where Federal activity increased the burden of local school systems.', 'Today the need for talent and skill is a national need affecting the national welfare. And the harsh fact of the matter is that our States and cities cannot afford to make the needed improvements in our educational system. State and local government per capita expenditures for public schools have risen 140 percent in the past 10 years - State indebtedness has increased 500 percent - and many school districts can no longer afford to float school bond issues. In too many States, the choice is not between Federal aid and State aid - the choice is between Federal aid and inadequate schools.', 'The second basic principle is our commitment to complete local control of our school systems. Despite its many aid programs to schools and universities the Federal Government has never interfered in education and it never will. Today one-quarter of all schoolchildren attend classes taught by teachers paid in part by Federal funds - but there has been no Federal interference or control. Today 70 percent of all university research is federally financed - but there has been no Federal interference or control. And today all Democratic bills for aid to education provide that the money shall be given to the States for distribution, thus insuring there can be no Federal interference or control.', 'Where then have we failed in the past 8 years? And what must we do for the future?', 'First, we have failed to provide adequate classrooms for our expanding school population. Today we have 131,000 classrooms fewer than we need - and, at our current rate of construction shortage is actually increasing. The result is double shifts, obsolete, overcrowded, and even dangerous classrooms.', 'In one community a dog kennel was converted into a school where four classes were being held. In an adjoining town the school superintendent said, ""I only wish I had a dog kennel to use."" In another area the school board is renting 2 windowless, cinder block factories to house 883 children - while in other cities kindergarten children are being taught in firetraps.', 'Yet the Republicans have opposed virtually every Democratic effort to relieve this critical classroom shortage.', 'In 1957, a majority of the Republicans in the House killed a bill to aid school construction. In 1958, every Republican on the key House Labor and Education Committee voted against aid to school construction. And in 1960, the latest Democratic effort to help the States build needed classrooms was defeated when 67 percent of all Republicans in the House and all four Republicans on the Rules Committee blocked its passage.', 'And so one of the first items on the Democratic agenda in 1961 is the passage of an adequate bill for school construction.', 'Second, we have failed to provide enough well-trained and well-paid teachers. Today we need 135,000 more teachers. Almost 3 million schoolchildren are being taught by teachers working on substandard certificates. And as our school population expands in the next decade, 1 1/2 million more teachers - one-third of all our college graduates - will be needed to keep our educational system going. We are not attracting bright young men and women into teaching because the salaries which we pay our teachers are shamefully low.', 'The Republican Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare says ""these low salaries are the most serious weakness in our country\'s educational system."" And Mr. Nixon himself has said teachers\' salaries are a ""national disgrace."" Yet it was Mr. Nixon who cast the tie-breaking vote killing a Democratic bill giving the States money to increase teachers\' salaries.', ""In 1961, a Democratic Congress - under the leadership of a Democratic President - will enact a bill to raise teachers' salaries, a bill which can help start the flow of urgently needed new teachers toward our schools."", 'Third, we have failed to take steps to improve the quality of education. Classrooms and teachers alone will not mean a better education for all our children. We must search for new teaching methods, new classroom techniques, new ways of presenting old subjects and imaginative ways of presenting new subjects. Already significant work is going on. Advanced physics and mathematics are being taught to high-school children through revolutionary new techniques. Closed circuit television is bringing lectures, plays, and experiments into hundreds of classrooms. Efforts are being made to mobilize the resources of the community - mothers with advanced degrees, retired teachers, and other skilled people - to give individual instruction to gifted youngsters. Yet the Federal Government has virtually ignored this research - with its great promise for the future of education - and, as a result, research has often lagged or been halted altogether.', 'Therefore, I propose the establishment of an Educational Extension Service within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. This service will do for education what the Agricultural Extension Service has done for our farmers for the past 75 years. It will conduct and guide research into new teaching techniques and methods - into the problems of our school systems and programs for their solution - making the result of its work freely available to all of our 48,600 school districts.', 'Fourth, has been our failure to make a decent college education available to every young man or woman with the ability to pursue it. The dream of every American family is to send their children to college. For today a college education is the doorway to opportunity - to a good job and a good life. Yet last year more than 100,000 young men and women in the top 10 percent of their class could not go to college because they did not have the money. And as the cost of an average college education rises from $10,000 today to $15,000 in 1970, many more will be excluded. No American should be denied the right to attend college because he or she cannot afford it - and America cannot afford to waste the skills of those whom high costs are keeping from college.', 'Therefore, I propose the enactment of a Student Loan Insurance Act - modeled on the highly successful program which has been adopted by my native State of Massachusetts. Under this program the Federal Government - in return for a small premium - would guarantee student loans made by colleges and universities. Thus colleges would be able to secure funds adequate to meet the pressing financial needs of all of its students - so that no able student would have to leave school because he could not pay his expenses. Although a small special revolving fund would be required, Federal payments would be made only in the unlikely event of default. Basic responsibility for repayment would be in the hands of the student, and the loan program itself would be administered by the individual college or university. In this way we can make sure that no bright young American is denied a college education.', 'But loans and scholarships will not be effective if our colleges cannot accommodate a vastly increased flow of students in the sixties. In the next decade our college population will double. By 1970, we will need to spend more than $6 billion more than we are now spending if we are to provide facilities for 3 million more students and pay 300,000 more teachers. We must build more college buildings in the next 10 years than we have built in the past 200 years. Under Harry Truman the Democrats established a loan program for construction of college buildings. Last year only vigorous Democratic efforts saved this program from destruction by Republican opposition. In 1961, we must strengthen and expand this construction loan program - under which $1 billion have been loaned without a single default - in order to make sure that higher education will be available for all those who want and deserve it. With these programs we can reverse the failures of the past 8 years and we can begin to rebuild the strength of our educational system, preparing it for the critical years ahead.', 'I have spoken in this campaign of the new frontiers which America will cross in the sixties. In many ways education is the gateway to those new frontiers. For through the education of our young people we develop those resources of mind and spirit which America possesses in such abundance, and which alone can provide the strength, the imagination, and the creative intelligence which the troubled decade ahead will demand.', 'Abraham Lincoln once said that ""He has the right to criticize who has the heart to help."" We of the Democratic Party criticize our educational system - and the leadership which has permitted it to falter - because we have the heart to help, and, even more, the programs and the leadership which can build an educational system of which all Americans can be proud.']"

I felt it was important to find out what issues in this election are of the most significance to women. And those are the things I want to talk to Jack about. That\'s why ""Calling for Kennedy"" was organized. We got in touch with women volunteers all over the country, and they went out with these forms [she shows stack of them] and armed with pencils and paper, they rang door-bells and really searched out the problems that women are most concerned with. The forms were sent to us here in Washington.', 'FONDA. That sounds like quite a problem in logistics. How was all that organized?', 'Mrs. KENNEDY. The first thing I did was get on the telephone and talk to volunteers across the country', 'FONDA. Oh, is that when the famous phone call took place? When you talked to 11 ladies in 11 different States all at once.', 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Yes. I was at a meeting of precinct workers in northern Virginia and a telephone call was put through to start the campaign .', '(""Calling for Kennedy"" film begins)', ""Mrs. KENNEDY. Hello. Good morning, this is Jacqueline Kennedy. I'm calling you from the 10th Congressional District in Arlington, Va. Can you hear me? Well, I'll tell you.

Lawley in North Carolina. Are you there? Good morning. To Mrs. V. E. Levine in New York. Oh, good. Wonderful. To Mrs. Alfreida Arden in Indiana. Are you there? To Mrs. Kay Conant in Illinois. Good morning. To Mrs. Lloyd Ives in Michigan. Oh, thank you so much. To Mrs. Arthur Miller in Texas. Oh, you sound much closer than that. To Mrs. M. Stapleton, Jr., in Colorado. Good morning. And to Mrs. Goldie Kennedy in California. Good - Oh, it's very early there. I'm sorry. Would any of you have any questions? Or last-minute messages you'd like to give? That's great, Mrs. Winalski. She has 92 clubs all ready to start out. Oh, thank you, Vickie. That's Vickie Levine in Binghamton, N.Y., who has 75 people there and 75 more who're going to start all over again tonight. Good. I hope you all have good weather, wherever you are."", 'I want to thank you all for being there and assembling so many people to start out ""Calling for Kennedy"" week, which helps finances anew, and I know you\'ll go into the homes of all these women and find out the issues which concern them the most, which I will report to my husband.', '(Film ends)', 'FONDA. All those forms came in to you? Are they the results of the phone calls we just saw?', ""Mrs. KENNEDY. Yes; and they all tell the same story. Everywhere, peace is uppermost in women's minds. They say that if we can't keep the peace, then the other issues aren't important. Not one woman called upon, put the budget ahead of peace."", 'FONDA. Mrs. Kennedy, they tell me they have Senator Kennedy in Los Angeles now.', 'KENNEDY. Hello, Jackie. Hello, Mr. Fonda.', 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Hello, Jack. How is it in California?', ""KENNEDY. Well, we've had a very good trip out here. Going to leave again tonight. Travel to 16 States in the next 7 days, then come back to Massachusetts on Monday night. We'll meet you and Caroline on Tuesday morning, when all this long running around the country comes to an end on election day, November 8. I must say I'll be glad when it does finally come to an end; we'll be glad to see you both again."", 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Hundreds of the ""Calling for Kennedy"" forms have come in. And I know women around the country are anxious to have you know how they feel. Almost without exception, every form lists peace as the most important issue. Right here on top is a comment from Mrs. Charles Hazlett of Fairfax, Va. She says we need a foreign policy which has foresight, not crisis-to-crisis planning. What can you tell Mrs. Hazlett, Jack?', ""KENNEDY. Well, I think it is the great issue that we all face as Americans in the 1960's. How can we keep the peace, and how can we protect our security? I don't think any American wants to go through another war. And I must say that, after having been through World War II, and spending 2 mon- 2 years, it turned out in the hospital, after the war, and then, of course, losing my older brother, I don't think anyone wants to see that happen again."", ""So, if I'm elected President, we're going to work with all our energy, all of our effort, to maintain the peace. I think we're going to have to do better than we're now doing. I've been talking a good deal in this campaign about national prestige, what people think of us abroad. That isn't the question of whether we're popular or not. What it does mean is whether people will follow us, whether the free world will accept our leadership, whether they will stand with us."", 'If they ever get the idea that the ""balance of power"" is moving against us, that we\'re not a strong, and vital and progressive people, then we\'ve lost a great deal and we\'ve endangered the peace. I think we have to be strong. I think we have to build a strong and vital society here. I think we have to identify ourself with the needs of people around the world - their fight against poverty and disease and illiteracy. When we had the trouble in the Congo in June, we offered more scholarships to the Congo in 1 day than we had given to all of Africa in the year before, as if you could turn out an educated man or woman overnight. We have to have thoughtful people, working for us in our own country and around the world, representing the United States - a strong vital country which stands for freedom, which stands for peace, which stands for security, which identifies itself with people who want to be free. I believe in that way the United States can keep the peace and be secure.', 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Second in importance, judging from these, is the problems of educating our children. Mrs. William Berg of Binghamton, N.Y., says that the tax resources of the Federal Government should be made available to our educational system. A number of women also have asked for Federal aid for college scholarships. I know you have strong feelings about these issues.', ""KENNEDY. Well, I believe that education is fundamental and basic. This country - in fact, I come from a section of the United States which started the first public school. We can't maintain a free society, which depends upon the good judgment and the sense of restraint of the citizens, unless we have well-educated citizens everyplace. We want every boy and girl of talent to have a chance to develop that talent. Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls today never get to college, who graduate from high school."", ""Then, a good many who go to college aren't abe to finish because they can't keep themselves in school. We want good teachers, well paid. We want colleges and dormitories which can take the tremendous number of young men and women who are going to pour into those colleges and dormitories in the next 10 years. In the next 10 years, we're going to have twice as many boys and girls applying for college as we do today. I believe in Federal aid to education. I believe in working to provide the best educational system that we can. I believe in loans to colleges so that they can build those dormitories. And also scholarships for our brightest boys and girls and loans for the others so that they can get through school. Ten years ago, we turned out twice as many scientists and engineers as the Russians; now, they turn out twice as many as we do. And I know boys and girls of ability who finish high school, even if they get a scholarship, because they have to work to keep their family going, they never get through school. I want everyone who has talent and ability and wants to learn to have that chance. I want the United States to have the best educated citizens in the world. That's the way we maintain democracy; that's the way we keep our freedom; that's the way we meet our responsibilities - schools, colleges, well-trained teachers who are decently paid. And I think, on this issue, the Republicans and Mr. Nixon and I differ. We support action, and I think we need action in the 1960's in this field as well as in others."", ""Mrs. KENNEDY. Another issue which affects almost every family is medical care for the aged. Many of these comments reveal that mothers of families are torn between the financial demands of educating their children and meeting the medical bills of their aging parents. There is also the question of parents who are unable to rely on any support from their children. Mrs. Marie Love of Oceanside, Calif., is 65 years old. She's concerned about her husband's illness; in fact, the medicine alone costs $30 a month. One of the reasons Mrs. Love is supporting you, Jack, is because she feels your approach to medical aid would help them. How do you feel about this issue?"", 'KENNEDY. Well, the problem that Mrs. Love faces is shared by a great many millions of Americans. The average social security check for 16 million Americans over the age of 65 is about $72 a month. And there are others - they include millions who don\'t have any - even social security. Now, if they get sick, if the husband gets sick or the wife gets sick, maybe sick for 3 or 4 months, they run up doctors\' bills and medical bills in the hundreds of dollars, they have to rely on their savings or they have to rely on their children, and sometimes their children are already hard pressed to maintain their own families. What we suggest is that medical care for the aged be tied to social security, every working American contribute, and it\'s little less than 3 cents a day during their working years. Then when they\'re retired, they can draw on this fund and they can sustain themselves and meet their responsibilities. Unfortunately, the bill which was passed and signed by the President provides that, before any older person can get any medical care, they have to exhaust their savings; they have to sign a petition that they\'re medically indigent, a ""pauper\'s oath,"" and their children would have to do it, too; exhaust their savings, which might represent all they had, before they could go down and get public assistance. I think our way is much better. It\'s in accordance with the social security system, which has worked for 25 years. It\'s more responsible, gives older people a chance to meet their own obligations and look to the future with security. Those citizens who are not on social security - their problems can be met in this area, too. I believe that the next Congress and the next President have to work for this program. I think it\'s important. I think these Americans are entitled to live out their life in dignity. Mrs. Love has talked about one of the most important problems now facing us.', ""Mrs. KENNEDY. Many of the women called on spoke of the high cost of living, mounting grocery bills, and the cost of children's clothing. The bare essentials seem to cost more and more all the time. Here I have one from Mrs. Harold Kautner of Chicago who thinks it's most important that the economy be stimulated. She wants to know how you are going to go about it."", ""KENNEDY. Well, the steady increase in the cost of living, which, over the last 8 years, has amounted to about 22 percent, really makes it very hard for housewives today to balance their budget. Rents have gone up in some places more than that. Medical care, nearly 35 percent. So there has been a steady increase in the cost of living for every American. Education costs more than it cost 8 years ago. The property tax on many homes costs more. If you buy a $10,000 home with a 30-year mortgage, you pay about $3,000 more than you did 8 years ago, just because interest rates are higher. I don't believe that this country can continue to maintain its position unless we have a progressive and forward-looking economy, an economy that permits people to earn enough to sustain themselves. Some of these increases are not due to any unfairness. The farmer, for example, really isn't getting very much out of that loaf of bread that you might pay 25 or 26 cents for. He gets about 2 cents. The shirt which I have on probably costs almost as much to launder as it does - the farmer gets in the way of cotton. But, across the board, there has been a steady increase in the cost of living, and it's been partly due to this administration's policy which has provided high interest rates in a very inflexible economy. I believe the next administration and the next President must stimulate our economic growth, provide employment for our people, provide this country's facilities be in full use. Today, we are using only 50 percent of our steel capacity - a hundred thousand steelworkers out of work. That keeps costs high. Competitive economy, going full blast, our people working - that's the way to keep the cost of living in balance with wages. That's the way to move this country ahead. That's the way to protect the interests of our people, and that's the program we're committed to."", 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Before we finish, Jack, I still want to speak about peace again and how important it is to the women of this country. Mrs. Irene Covall of Dallas, Tex., says that we must have peace at all costs, except, of course, at the cost of freedom. I agree, and I also feel very strongly that we must set a good example of democracy at home if we are to be the leaders of the free world and enjoy the friendship and respect of the people. Many women are concerned with the failure of disarmament negotiations. Mrs. Angela Bambacci of Baltimore, Md., asks: ""Can\'t we accomplish something concrete about disarmament?""', ""KENNEDY. Well, it is, Jackie, of course, the great problem. And I really don't think that we've made enough progress, for example, in the area of disarmament in the last years. We've only had about 100 people working in the entire Federal Government on the subject of disarmament, the subject of nuclear testing. That's a terribly important subject. It involves the lives and security of us all. I believe that we should set up an arms research institute - a peace institute - in the National Government, which will work as hard on the subject of disarmament, work as hard on the subject of peace, as our Defense Establishment does to protect us. We need to be strong, but we also need to be working toward peace. Secondly, we ought to try to recognize that these are very changing times in the world. Eight years ago there was no outer space, and now the Soviets have beaten us to outer space. We're going to have to do better there. Eight years ago Africa was completely controlled by colonial powers. Now, one-quarter of all the independent nations of the world will be African, and yet we've almost ignored that place. In 1957, for example, we had more people in our embassies in Western Germany - one country - than we had in all of Africa. We had more students coming from abroad to study in the United States 10 years ago than we do today. The Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do."", 'We have no program, for example, to Cuba in radio or TV to tell the people of Cuba that we still are their friends, that we want them to be free. These are the things that we have to do to try to build a strong country here, to try to build a progressive and forward-looking country that\'s meeting its problems, to try to find some way to distribute our food. Here we have $9 billion worth of food stored away - some of it rotting - and the world is hungry. This is a great asset to us. The Lord\'s been good to the United States, and we should find some way to provide food for all the children that are hungry. In 1954 a good many children in central Africa had a bad disease from which about half of them died. They could have been saved by one glass of milk a day. We had a lot of milk stored away and you know we let it be fed to hogs; none of that went to Africa. We can\'t afford those mistakes in the future. We have to be compassionate, identify ourselves with those people, move ahead here at home, show them what we can do, stand for peace, be firm, be decisive, but always indicate that our desire is to hold out a helping hand around the world, that we\'re going to stand firm in the future, that we stand for peace. I think that we can do it and I think we must do it. I\'ve seen enough of war and so has America, to know that peace is our objective. The Bible said: ""Blessed are the peacemakers,"" and that\'s what we must be in the 1960\'s.', 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Thank you, Jack. Other questions came in for you, but these seemed to be the vital ones. When will we see you again?', ""KENNEDY; Well, in 1 week. Tuesday morning in Boston, then we'll vote, and then we'll go home and wait to see what happens. I'll look forward, after having been on the - traveling around the country into nearly every part of the United States, in the last 3 months since August, I'll look forward to being home. So I will see you on Tuesday. In the meanwhile, as I said, I'll be going into 17 States, so we'll be working all the time. But we'll see you both Tuesday, November 8, which is election day, and which is for me, the end of the trail. It may be the beginning, but we'll have to wait and see."", 'Mrs. KENNEDY. Goodby, Jack. Before saying goodby to all of you today, I want to thank the many thousands of women volunteers who have helped in the campaign. I hope you will be able to keep up your good work until the last voter gets to the polls next Tuesday. Goodby, Mr. Fonda, and thank you for taking the time to visit with us today.', ""FONDA. Goodby, Senator. Goodby, Mrs. Kennedy. I hope you enjoyed being with the Kennedys as much as I did - Caroline's kittens and all the rest of it. I think they're a fine family, but I'm pretty partial. Good afternoon."", 'ANNOUNCER (minimum 10-second disclaimer). This broadcast has been prerecorded and edited and has been presented in the interest of John F. Kennedy for President.

417,John F. Kennedy ,"November 03, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Congressman Jarman, Governor Edmondson, distinguished guests, ladies, and gentlemen, I don't believe all those stories that Oklahoma is going Republican. I think Oklahoma is going Democratic on Tuesday. [Applause.] I am proud of the generous introduction, of the kind tribute, which has been paid to me by the senior Senator of the State of Oklahoma, Senator Kerr. [Applause.] He and I have equal devotion to the Constitution of the United States. I have served this country for 18 years, 4 years in the service and 14 years in the Congress. And whether I am elected President of the United States or continue in the Senate, I shall join him in defending the Constitution and all of its provisions. [Applause.]"", 'The issue for the people of Oklahoma and Arkansas and Texas is not where I go to church. The issue is: Do you want a Republican to lead this country for 4 more years? [Response from the audience.] Now he has run on a program that he can stand up to Mr. Khrushchev, and yet this week, in the last days of this vital campaign, what does he do to go through New York? He gets Nelson and Cabot and calls on the President, and they all drive up Broadway together. [Laughter and applause.] The rescue squad is in full operation. They are taking him around the country, the four of them, and I understand Alf Landon is joining them this week, and Dewey. [Response from the audience.] They passed under a theater on Broadway which said ""The King and I."" Mr. Nixon is running for the Presidency, not the team, not the rescue squad, but Mr. Nixon. And I don\'t believe the American people are going to select him to lead them in the next 4 years. [Applause.]', 'I keep seeing these studies that he puts out, these surveys which say, ""We are sure to win Oklahoma."" What has Nixon ever done for Oklahoma or what have the Republicans ever done? [Applause.] He is the one that is running. We have all seen these elephants, with long memory, no vision, their heads full of ivory, thick skins, and you know how they move around a circus ring. They grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. [Laughter and applause.] Mr. Nixon grabbed those coattails in 1952 and in 1956, but there are not any this year. He is running. He is running. And I can predict to you that the United States and Oklahoma is going Democratic on next Tuesday. [Applause.]', ""The fact of the matter is that the State of Oklahoma has put its confidence in the past in the Democratic Party. You have two Democratic Senators, a Democratic Governor, five Democratic Congressmen, men of influence in the House and Senate. Who is going to speak for Oklahoma? They are, and we are, Lyndon Johnson and myself are going to speak for Oklahoma and the Nation. [Applause.] I ask you, what in the last 25 years have the Republicans ever done for Arkansas or Oklahoma or Texas or Louisiana? [Response from the audience.] I have flown up the Arkansas River to see what Senator Kerr and John McClellan and the rest have done to dredge those rivers, to put in dams and all the rest. Do you know what this administration's program is? No new starts. No new starts for Oklahoma or Arkansas or the Nation. No effort made to develop the resources of this country. I want them to tell a small farmer in Oklahoma who raises livestock or wheat what the Benson program has done for him in the last 8 years. [Response from the audience.] And Mr. Nixon's program may have new lighting and new makeup, but it is the same old Benson program that he is going to put forward in the next 4 years, and I don't think the farmers of this State can stand it. [Applause.]"", ""I have served in the Congress for 14 years. I served the same amount of time as Mr. Nixon, and I cannot recall, and I have tried and tried and tried, and I cannot recall a single piece of progressive legislation of benefit to the people of this country, that he has sponsored, fought for, stood for, identified himself with, whether it is social security, whether it is aid to the farmers, whether it is dredging our rivers, whether it is providing a better life for our people. Their monument is high interest rates. Their monument is all the things that might have been done that were not done. Their monument is a declining United States in the eyes of the world. We stand for progress and I cannot believe, in this vital State of Oklahoma, that any citizen of this State, looking at Oklahoma and the Nation, can come to any other conclusion but this country and this State must move forward in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", ""This contest is between the comfortable and the concerned, those who want the best for their country, those who recognize that there is no prosperity for Oklahoma, no matter where a man or woman may work. This State cannot move forward unless the United States is moving forward, this State depending on no matter where you go - to a small businessman, a dirt farmer, a man who may work in the oil and gas industry which in 1952 had a 75-barrel minimum and today has 15, or in Texas which had 20 days of drilling and now has 8, or a farmer who has seen 4 million farmers move off the land in the last 8 years, who has seen the income of farmers drop nearly 30 percent, who have seen the highest interest rates in the country since the 1920's. Frank Church said Rip Van Winkle could go to sleep and wake up and find out whether the Republicans or Democrats were in control by asking how high the interest rates were. [Applause.]"", 'If you buy, in the United States today, an Oklahoma citizen, or one of Arkansas, or the other States, a $10,000 home on a 30-year mortgage, do you know, as a result of the interest rate increase of this administration, that you pay $3,500 more for that house than you would have 8 years ago? Do you know you paid $3 billion more in taxes every year just to maintain the debt than you did a decade ago? This is the kind of administration we want? [Response from the audience.] Let me make it clear, the people of Oklahoma are Democrats. You have to decide yourself what you want this State and country to do. You are going to send Bob Kerr back to the Senate, you are going to send these Congressmen back to the House. [Applause.] Now will you tell me why you say to them, why you say, ""We want Bob Kerr and Mike Monroney in the Senate, and we want Bob Carlisle and Congressman Jarman in the House, and the others, and then we are going to put in a Republican as President and undo it all."" [Response from the audience.]', 'The Soviet Union is working night and day. They are bent on our destruction. Can we possibly afford to divide our influence, our responsibility? [Response from the audience.] Do you think the Democratic Party which will control the House and Senate is going to be able to work with a President who goes around the country today saying, ""All is well, we have never had such great prosperity""? [Response from the audience.] I believe the United States is going to have to move in the 1960\'s, and I believe a responsible, forward-looking President and Vice President, working with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, can move this country forward, can provide prosperity for our people, education for our children, security for our older citizens, a better deal for our farmers, the development of our natural resources. These are the issues of this campaign. These are the only issues. [Applause.]', 'Oklahoma prospers or Oklahoma goes down depending upon what the United States does. And is there any citizen of this State who feels so secure in his job, in his future, in his employment, in the prospects for his children, in his security for his older age, in his position in the world, in the chances for peace, that he can possibly say: ""We want to sit still; we don\'t want to move, we don\'t want to act""? [Response from the audience.]', 'Eight years, I think is enough. [Applause.] I stand in direct succession. I stand as the Democratic standard bearer in direct succession to Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon, the Republican leader, stands in direct succession to McKinley, to Coolidge, to Harding, to Hoover, to Landon, to Dewey. [Response from the audience.] Where did they get those candidates? And now they have Richard Nixon in 1960. [Response from the audience.]', ""This decision is yours. By Tuesday night this campaign will be over. The candidates have made their arguments and the differences between us are very clear. They affect our view of our country, and they affect our view of the world. Mr. Nixon says our prestige has never been higher, and he points to our prosperity here at home. He says all is well, and I say we are going to have to do better, and that is the difference between us. [Applause.] And you must decide yourselves what you think, what your judgment is. Is it your judgment that all is well in the great Republic? Is it your judgment looking at the world around us, that the balance of power is moving in our direction? [Response from the audience.] That our security is greater than it was? It is your judgment. You know, no matter what they may put out, that the problems that face our country are as hazardous and as great as they have ever been in the past, and that the best we can do will be none too good. We need the best. We need action and motion and progress in this country. [Applause.] And we need security in the world, and we need peace in the world, and we have security in the world and peace if the United States is strong, vital, and purposeful, not reckless but careful, strong, meeting our commitments, keeping our word, keeping the peace, and you have to decide whether the experience of Mr. Nixon is the kind of experience which you want to endorse in this hazardous time in the life of our country [response from the audience] a candidate who, in 1952, endorsed the concept of liberation for Eastern Europe, dropping of air-drops and all the rest, which led in part to the Hungarian revolution and all the rest, which still knows the people's disappointment; a candidate which in 1954 recommended putting American troops in Indochina in a hopeless colonial war. In 1958, his good will trip to Latin America required the Marines to be alerted to extract him from that hitherto friendly continent. [Response from the audience.]"", 'Does Mr. Nixon\'s experience give you a feeling of confidence as he makes his judgment? [Response from the audience.] On the basis of his visit with Khrushchev, he predicted that the U-2 incident would not break up the summit. In 1955, on the basis of his visit to Cuba, he predicted and praised the stability and competence of the Batista regime, shortly before it fell. On the basis of his trip to Russia he predicted that the exchange of visits with Mr. Khrushchev and the President would bring, and I quote him, ""deeper respect between our countries."" It did not do so. He tells us now that he is the man to stand up to Khrushchev, even though I can\'t persuade him to come into a studio and engage in a fifth debate and stand up to the American people. [Applause.] But the best he could do in that debate was put his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face and say, and I quote him accurately, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust, but we are ahead of you in color television."" [Laughter.]', ""I will take my television black and white. I want to be ahead of them in rocket thrust. [Applause.] He says that aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro. But he was there 5 years ago. Why didn't they recommend a program then which might have preserved the peace in Latin America? He tells us that his trips all around the world were great embassies of good will - Ghana, Laos, Cuba, the Panama Canal. Where is he going next? [Laughter and response from the audience.] He is going back to Whittier, Calif. [Applause.]"", 'Third, has Mr. Nixon been sufficiently well informed or kept the American people accurately informed about the state of American foreign policy and the state of the world? Here are the facts:', ""He asserted in our fourth debate that official surveys of our falling prestige which the State Department has not yet released related to the 1957 postsputnik era, and we have now seen in the papers this week that they relate to 1960. He asserted that the Communist oriented regime of Guatemala was expelled by our quarantine, even though every diplomat and every newspaperman knows that is not what happened. He asserted that the administration had never attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to move his troops from Quemoy and Matsu, and nevertheless, as Senator Fulbright, the chairman of our Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said last week, testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proved Mr. Nixon wholly uninformed. A man who indicated on May 15 that the U-2 flights would continue even though they had been canceled by the President on May 12. [Laughter.] A man who did not know the difference between the detection and arrest of Communist spies between Springfield, Mass., and Springfield, Ill., is hardly a man to lead the United States in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'I want the people of Oklahoma and Arkansas and Texas and Louisiana to make their own judgment tonight and Tuesday. I want them to choose, not the Republicans, who have opposed everything significant for those States for 25 years. I want them to choose and put their confidence in the only national party that there is, the oldest party, a party with which those States have been identified for a hundred years. I want them to say again, ""We are going forward with the Democrats. We are going to move our States. We are going to move our country."" [Applause.]', 'I come here tonight as the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, with Lyndon Johnson as the candidate for Vice President, of Texas, speaking for the Nation, I come here to Oklahoma and ask your help on Tuesday.

Mr. Chairman, Governor Burroughs, Senator Chavez, Senator Anderson, Congressman Montoya, Congressman Morris, Lieutenant Governor, national committeewoman, fellow Democrats, our friends from the Navajo Indian Tribe, Pueblo Indian Tribe, ladies and gentlemen, I come here to New Mexico in the closing days of this campaign to ask your support in returning this country to progress and the Democratic Party. [Applause.] And I am proud to be on this platform with distinguished Democrats from this State who speak for New Mexico and speak for the United States; your distinguished Governor, who I am confident will be reelected [applause]; your two distinguished Congressmen, who will continue to speak for this State in the house of Representatives and the United States [applause]; my running mate in this State, a distinguished spokesman for the United States, the chairman of the Committee on Atomic Energy, a leading member of the Senate, Senator Anderson, who is going to be elected by an overwhelming majority next Tuesday [applause] and who deserves to be, and who deserves to be; Senator Chavez of the State of New Mexico, who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations, which handles appropriations for $40 billion. New Mexico is well represented in the House, the Senate, and in the State. [Applause.]', 'Massachusetts Senators are well down the list, but here in a State which is not the largest in the Union, Members of the House and the Senate from this State hold some of the most responsible jobs in the Congress. The security of the United States in defense, in the development of atomic energy, in the development of its peaceful uses, hangs to a great extent on the good judgment of the two Senators from New Mexico.', ""This is a large country. We are bound together, and it is a source of satisfaction to me that I can come all the way from Massachusetts and come to New Mexico and be among friends and colleagues who speak the same language that I do. [Applause.] Those of us who are Democrats are bound together by the oldest of ties. I carry the standard for the Democratic Party, which is the oldest political party in the United States, which is our only national party. Massachusetts, New Mexico, the State of Washington, the State of Texas - I run with Lyndon Johnson from the State of Texas, and we are going to win on Tuesday. [Applause.] And I have become more and more convinced, after running in this campaign, after observing Mr. Nixon and the programs that he puts forward, I think we ought to win, I think we must win, I think it is in the national interest that we do win. [Applause.] I don't care how large the rescue squad gets in New York, in Pittsburgh, or Cleveland. [Laughter and applause.] I don't care if it includes not only the President, Mr. Lodge, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Goldwater, Thruston Morton, Herbert Hoover - they can throw them all in the car. [Applause.]"", 'Mr. Nixon does not understand they are not choosing a committee: they are choosing a President. [Applause.] But we know all about elephants with their heads full of ivory, with their long memories and no vision, with their thick skins, and when they move around the center of the circus ring, they grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. [Applause.] Well, that tail is not that long in 1960.', 'Mr. Nixon is on his own, and I believe in 1960, on November 8, the people of the United States are going to return this country to a progressive administration. [Applause.]', ""Two days ago the Republican candidate, Mr. Nixon, quoted me as having said that the Republicans had always opposed social security, and in that wonderful choice of words which distinguishes him as a great national leader, he asserted that this was a barefaced lie. Having seen him four times close up in this campaign and made up [laughter], I would not accuse Mr. Nixon of being barefaced [laughter and applause], but I think the American people next Tuesday can determine who is telling the truth. Mr. Nixon may tell us to forget the Republican Party, he may tell us that he speaks for all the people, but I don't think the people of this State of New Mexico and the people of the United States are going to forget the record of the Republican Party which he so well represents. [Applause.] And I now repeat, I now repeat, that that record is one of consistent opposition to social security. In 1935 when Franklin Roosevelt first asked the Congress to pass a social security bill, the Republicans voted 90 percent against the heart of it. In 1936, the Republican candidate for the Presidency, Mr. Alf Landon, a distinguished predecessor who should be added to the rescue squad [laughter] - he ran on a program of repealing social security as a cruel hoax."", 'I want to give Mr. Nixon the whole record before we are finished today. In 1949, 79 percent of the House Republicans voted against any inclusion of disability benefits under social security, and Richard Milhous Nixon was among them. [Applause.]', 'In 1954, the Republican 83d Congress defeated a Democratic bill to expand our programs for rehabilitating the physically handicapped, a program Mr. Nixon now says he is for. We have converted him. We have brought him along. He favors programs he always opposed. This is progress. [Applause.]', ""In 1956, a Democratic Congress succeeded in lowering the retirement age for women from 65 to 62, and including disability benefits. Do you know what the opposition was in the Senate of the Republicans? Thirty-eight out of forty-four voted against it. I would not have thought Mr. Nixon would have brought this matter up. He should have discussed something else. Why he would ever discuss social security and try to defend his party's record on this matter - I don't understand it. [Laughter.]"", 'In 1958, the Republican administration and 33 out of 39 Senate Republicans voted against an increase in social security to meet the needs in the cost of living, and in 1958 a Democratic bill sponsored by Senator Long, of Louisiana, which would have added $5 to the payments for those aged and disabled and blind, was divided evenly in the Senate. Mr. Nixon could have passed the bill. He chose not to vote, and the benefit did not become law. And finally, in 1959, we passed a bill to provide housing for the elderly, and the administration vetoed it.', 'Lastly, in 1960, and this is the end of a sad, sad story, when Senator Anderson and I introduced an amendment to provide medical care for the aged tied to social security, do you know how many Republican votes we got? One; 44 Democrats and 1 Republican. And do you know when the vote was announced, a great national magazine said, ""Mr. Nixon smiled.""', 'He is not going to smile on November 9. [Applause.]', 'Now, all this is not what Mr. Nixon calls a vicious rumor. It is not even a rumor. This is the record. He is stuck with it. This is the party that chose him, like they chose Dewey and Landon and Hoover and Harding and Coolidge and Taft and McKinley. [Applause.] And no amount of personal abuse or makeup can cover the record of this party. [Laughter.] The fact of the matter is that in every field of needed legislation which serves our people in the last 25 years, I cannot recall a single occasion in which a majority of the Republicans were committed to progress, whether it is minimum wage, whether it is social security, whether it is housing for the elderly, whether it is aid to education - all these programs upon which the basis of a society is founded, which permits all of our people to participate in the benefits of that society, the Democrats have stood for progress and the Republicans have stood for the past. I don\'t come to you saying, ""Forget what party I belong to."" I come to you saying, ""I am a Democrat and I want your support as a Democrat."" [Applause.]', 'There is no State in the Union that depends more upon wise national policy than the State of New Mexico. Your strong defense establishments in this State, the development of your natural resources, the development of peaceful use of atomic energy, the education of your people, jobs for your people, security for your aged - all these depend not just on the good judgment of your State officials, but in the final analysis it depends upon a progressive national administration. [Applause.] To get water - to get fresh water from salt - and I recall the fight on the floor of the Senate, waged by Senator Anderson, to increase the appropriation, and the Nation that is first to get fresh water from salt water at a competitive basis will gain the good will, the admiration, and the respect, not only of the people of this country, but all those hundreds of millions who live in deserts on the edge of oceans. And this administration has ignored our opportunity in outer space and ignored our opportunity here. This administration has ignored all of the thousands of young men and women of Spanish ancestry who speak the language, who could be working for freedom all over Latin America as ambassadors of peace. I hope the next administration will use them. [Applause.]', ""Do you know today the Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know Mr. Nixon said several weeks ago that if we had thought of a program of aid for Latin America in 1955, we might have prevented Castro? Well, why didn't we? Why didn't we? Will you tell me in the last 8 years, 8 years of change and revolution in Latin America Africa, Asia, outer space, here in this State, the peaceful uses of atomic energy, what new program, what recognition of the age of change in which we live has this administration shown? How have they shown foresight, wisdom, perseverance, and initiative? What kind of people have they encouraged to represent our Nation abroad, to work for it here at home? What new programs have they suggested to raise this State and country off dead center? Space? We lost the race. Peaceful uses of atomic energy? You know the story better than anyone. How we failed, year after year, to make the maximum investment in this opportunity for peace and a better life. Fresh water from salt water? Ambassadors who could speak the language, Spanish and the rest? Hold out the hand of the United States as a vital and progressive society? All the efforts that this administration may make to conceal in the State Department polls of our decline in world prestige do not fool the American people. They know what is happening in the world. They know what this country needs. You cannot be a citizen of this country, concerned about its future, and not be aware of the decline in influence and prestige of our country, aware of the fact that in 10 countries polled a majority of the people thought by 1970 the Soviet Union would be first in science and in military power. How long are we going to be secure? How long do we keep the peace if people around the globe begin to feel that the tide is moving against us? I want historians to say a decade from now, these were the great years of the great Republic, these were the years when America began to move again. These were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when a free society demonstrated its vitality, when they brought people to Washington and sent them around the world, men who were committed to progress, men who could identify themselves with the basic aspiration of people everywhere."", 'I come to New Mexico to ask your help, not merely on November 8, but to ask you to join me in the days and months afterward in moving this country forward again. [Applause.] I want to reverse a national and international policy of no new starts. I want the people of the world to wake up in the morning and not wonder what Khrushchev is doing or what Castro is doing but wonder what we are doing, we in the United States, as the leader of the free world. [Applause.]', 'This campaign has 5 more days. On Tuesday, November 8, you must decide, not merely between Mr. Nixon and myself; you must decide what you want, what your views are, what your hopes are, what you feel must be done. If you feel it is time this country started on the road forward again, on that basis I ask your support for the Democratic Party; I ask you to join us. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.]', ""In 1932 - That is Dick coming in. [Laughter.] I understand that in the next 24 hours, Mr. Nixon is going to visit Texas, and I want Texas to ask him what the Republicans or Nixon ever did for Texas.

[Applause.] I understand that the Vice President is arriving in Texas with a rescue squad - Nelson Rockefeller, the President of the United States, Henry Cabot Lodge - and now they are adding three new members to the rescue squad, who are advising him on how to win this election - Landon, Hoover, and Dewey. We can't lose. [Response.]"", ""[Aircraft noise.] They can't stop the truth, anyway. I don't care how much that engine warms up. [Laughter.]"", ""During this stop I have been trying to think what the Republicans have ever done for Texas. I have not been able to think of it. Maybe you have. All I know is that this county, this congressional district, this State of Texas, depends upon a progressive, forward-looking national administration. Whether you work in helium, whether you work in oil and gas, whether you grow livestock, whether you grow wheat or sorghum, no matter what your business is, you prosper or you decline depending upon the state of the Nation's economy. This State of Texas will move forward in the 1960's only if the United States moves forward, and I do not believe that Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party can move the United States forward in the 1960's. [Applause.]"", 'I come here to Texas, which has had the Speaker of the House, who speaks for the United States as well as Texas, Mr. Rayburn, who has had a Texan as the majority leader, Lyndon Johnson, who speaks for the United States as well as for Texas, and I ask Texas to join the Democratic majority this year on November 8. I want Texas to lead the way. [Applause.]', ""The Democratic Party is the national party. I come from Massachusetts. Lyndon Johnson comes from Texas. We are a team in this effort, and I want Massachusetts and Texas to be in the frontlines on November 8. [Applause.] I think it is far better next January when Walt Rogers speaks for this district, that he speak to a Democratic President, not to a Republican President who calls the standard bearer of the Democratic Party in this campaign a liar, who called another farmer President a traitor. I think we want someone who speaks for the United States, who raises up a banner for our people, not one that attempts to divide us in this election. [Applause.] The fact of the matter is that this country is going to have to move in the 1960's if it is going to survive, and Texas is going to have to move. This country can't stand still. It either falls behind or moves ahead. Nobody stands still in the 1960's. And whatever you may do in the district, whatever may be your occupation, whether you raise livestock, grain, oil, gas, helium, small business - no matter what you may do - you will not prosper unless the United States prospers. Those of you who are farmers have seen your income drop steadily in the last 8 years. [Response from the audience.] What do you think Mr. Nixon offers you? He can drop Mr. Benson overboard but the program continues, the melody lingers on. He promises you just what Mr. Benson gave you, a gradual decline in your income until finally you are liquidated. That is what the Republicans have offered the farmers for 30 years."", ""The oil and gas interests of this State - how many days are you working out of 30 today? I hear these speeches by Texas Republicans about after all, the Democratic Party doesn't represent Texas. Lyndon Johnson is on this ticket with me. In 1956 when I was a candidate for the Vice Presidency, I received the votes of Texas for the Vice Presidency. Texas is part of the Nation, it is part of the Democratic Party, it has been a part of the Democratic Party for 100 years. It leads in the House, it leads in the Senate, it has an interest in the party. One Congressman is a Republican. You have a Governor that is a Democrat, two Senators that are Democrats, 21 Congressmen that are Democrats, and you are going to have a Vice President of the United States that is a Democrat. [Applause.]"", 'Who speaks for Texas? Who speaks for the United States? That is the question. And I come down here to Texas and ask you to join us.

It has taken us through all parts of the United States. But it ended up right here in the State of Texas, and I think you ought to decide, those of you who are Democrats, what you want for Texas and what you want for the country, and what you think of this country, and what you think it must do. These are not easy times for Americans. Texas has always met its responsibility in time of war. Now I am asking Texas to join us in building this country in times of peace. I don't think any Texas wants the easy way in the 1960's. Every Texan is willing to face the facts of life, and you know, yourself, from your own long experience, that it is not good enough in the 1960's for a great country to sit down and look at the past. I don't care what speeches you may have heard. You know yourselves, as individuals, as citizens of this country, that this country is going to have to do better.

[Applause.] And I don't think in 1960 they are going to elect a candidate who runs on a platform of standing up to Mr. Khrushchev, who won't engage in a fifth debate, who requires a President and a Vice President to accompany him through the streets of New York. What kind of a candidate and what kind of a party is that? Is that the party and the candidate for the 1960's? [Response from the audience.] I should say not."", 'What?

[Applause.] He has been issuing lists of all the States that he has sure, and one of the ones always at the top of the list is old Arizona.

My friend and colleague in the House, whom I am confident will be the next Congressman from this district, Congressman Harless, Congressman Stewart Udall, Lee Ackerman [applause] - Lee Ackerman to be the Governor of the great State of Arizona [applause] - there is not any doubt that it is possible to assemble a group of Democrats in Arizona at any hour of the day or night. Myself and other candidates are delighted to be here at 3 o'clock in the morning or at 9 o'clock in the morning because we are here for a good cause. I understand that Senator Goldwater sent a wire to Nelson Rockefeller a few days ago saying Arizona is in the bag. Well, it seems to me it is a mighty thin bag."", ""I was not aware that there had been an election here. Votes are not going to be counted until Tuesday, November 8. Mr. Nixon has not got any votes yet, and neither do I, and I believe that in the next 4 or 5 days, if we can keep working, if we can keep emphasizing how important it is for Arizona and the country that the United States look forward and move forward in the sixties, we will just take it right out of Barry Goldwater's bag. [Applause.]"", 'In any case, we will make it easy for him to be a candidate in 1964. That is the least we can do for a favorite son. [Laughter.]', 'I am informed that time is short. Let me just say that this has been a long and somewhat arduous campaign, but as time has gone on, and I have had a chance to listen in more detail to the views expounded by Mr. Nixon as the leader of his party, as the leader of the Republican Party, I become more convinced than ever that it is important that we win this one. This is an important election. It involves the future of this country. The Presidency is a key office, holding great power and influence, given to it by the Constitution, and also given to it by the course of events. We cannot possibly afford in these difficult times, when the President of the United States must set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, we cannot possibly afford to put the chief responsibility upon those who look back. I come to Arizona, which is a State which has gained from looking ahead, which has seen its resources prosper by those willing to commit themselves to future investment, which has seen its country grow, and I come here to Arizona which has an overwhelming Democratic majority to tell you that on this occasion we led a national Democratic Party that is moving forward, that is moving across the country, and I want to see Arizona commit itself with the rest of the United States to this kind of Democratic Party. [Applause.] I think it would be wonderful for all concerned if the Arizona Republic had to print across the front of its pages Wednesday morning, November 9, ""Kennedy Carries Arizona"".']"

Congressman Udall, my friend and colleague from the House of Representatives, Congressman-to-be Dick Harless, with whom I served in the House in the end of the 1940's, and with whom I will serve again in Washington [applause]. Lee Ackerman, the next Governor of the State of Arizona [applause], my friend and valued colleague, a distinguished Senator from this State, and from the Nation, Senator Hayden, ladies and gentlemen [applause], I come here to Arizona this morning to ask your support in this campaign. [Applause.] I recognize that the struggle here is not easy. I know that Barry Goldwater sent a wire [response from the audience] - sent a wire to Nelson Rockefeller that it was in the bag in Arizona."", 'It is in the bag for Arizona like it was in the bag for the New York Yankees. [Applause.] There is no election in the United States that is in the bag 2 weeks ahead, and our experience this year in Arizona, a strong Democratic State, is going to prove that Arizona and the Nation are going Democratic in 1960. [Applause.] There is no State in the Union that depends more upon men who look to the future. I spent a year in Arizona. There is no State in the Union, I repeat, that is committed more to progress by the inevitable laws of nature. This State would not be here, there would not be a single person now living in this community, unless men who went before you looked to the future, made it possible for you to develop the land and the water. Do you believe a Republican Party committed to no new starts, committed to the present and the past - how can they build Arizona? How can they build a nation? [Response from the audience.]', 'I want to make it clear that anyone here in Arizona who is satisfied with things as they are, who looks to the world around them and sees our prestige as the highest it has ever been, if they accept that view, who believe that the balance of power in the world is shifting in our direction, who believe that we are meeting our problems here at home in full measure, that we are planning our lands and water with vigor - anyone who feels that, anyone who is that happy and contented, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] But anyone who takes the view that I take, that our prestige is not as high as it must be, that this powerful country of ours must be more powerful, that this strong country of ours must be stronger - anyone who takes the view that freedom is not secure, that this country is not secure unless we are building a strong and vital society, I want their help. I want them to come with me. [Applause.]', 'I represent the only national party in the United States, a party stretching from Arizona to Massachusetts. I run with a running mate from the State of Texas. We stand in the tradition of the oldest political party in the United States. I come to a State which has a majority of Democrats and ask you, ""What have the Republicans done for Arizona?"" [Response from the audience.] What have the Republicans ever done for the Nation compared to the progress to which we are committed, the kind of progress which Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt provided in their time which makes it possible now for Arizona to prosper? [Response from the audience and applause.]', 'Barry, this election is not in the bag in Arizona or in the Nation. Your chances in 1964 may still come because we are going to retire Mr. Nixon to the beauties of California. [Applause.]', ""If I am elected President of the United States November 8, I am committed to progress and to a stronger America, strengthening this country here at home, to providing a vital society here in the United States and a society which speaks with vigor around the world. I don't care how many polls taken of our prestige in the world, which show that it is dropping, which are hidden by the Government in the State Department, all of us citizens of this country who read the papers, we know the facts of life. We know that this country is not doing what it must do. We know that we no longer hold the position in the world as strong as we once did."", ""Yesterday the papers carried a poll which had been taken out by someone and released to the press, which showed that by 1970 a majority of people in the world thought the Soviet Union would be stronger than we were. Do you realize 30 years ago or 40 years ago the Soviet Union was the most backward country in Europe? What is happening to the United States that people around the world begin to believe that the way of the future is not freedom, is not us, but is our adversary? I don't want that. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans has taken over in the United States, a generation of Americans committed to strength and progress and vigor, one that will speak for freedom as well as for America, and I ask your help. [Applause.]"", 'You make a choice not merely between Mr. Nixon and myself, and not merely between our two parties, but you make a choice between two philosophies. One that looks to the present and the past, and wishes to return in some in some cases to that happy past, and one that believes that in the deadly days of 1960 we must look forward, as a people individually, as States, and as a nation. This State of Arizona depends upon the wise development of your natural resources, of the effective use of water. We have dams all around the United States, built as memorials to the efforts of Franklin Roosevelt and others. We have three words that are the memorials to this Republican administration: ""No new starts."" And how long will Arizona last with no new starts? [Applause.] How much water are you using than is going back into the ground? How long can Arizona live off the resources built up over hundreds of thousands of years? How long before Arizona comes face to face with the reality of the fact that we are not doing enough today? This State is going to grow and grow. The Western united States is going to have four times as many as the United States as a whole. By the year 2000, we are going to have twice as many people in this country as we do today. Where are they going to live? We will have three or four times as many in this State. And yet this administration in the critical years of the 1950\'s, carried on a policy which gutted our hopes for developing the orderly resources of the Western United States.', 'I come from Massachusetts, but it is a source of pride to me that the two Americans in this century who did more to develop the resources of the West both came from New York, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. [Applause.] And it is an interesting fact that an administration headed by two westerners, one born in Texas, the other in California, did the least. [Applause.]', 'Now, Mr. Nixon - we brought him along. He is making progress. I will agree with that. In the last month he has taken more progressive, forward-looking stands than he has taken in the last 14 years, and I am glad of that. [Laughter and applause.] But the Bible tells us, ""By their fruits you shall know them."" In 1951, Mr. Nixon himself voted to kill the Southwestern Power Administration, which supplies power for the REA co-ops. It was Mr. Nixon himself in 1951, before he saw the bright view of the frontiers of America, who voted to kill the central Arizona project. It was Nixon himself in 1952 who voted to eliminate funds for road construction to schools and reservations on the Arizona Indian reservations. This record is clear, and I don\'t think anyone in the State of Arizona can go to the polls on Tuesday, November 8, and come to any conclusion but that the differences are sharp. The Republican Party and Mr. Nixon have opposed progress for 25 years. I don\'t know of a single project in the last 25 years [passing plane]. Dick? See you later in New Mexico. [Laughter.]', ""I don't know of a single project - all the people are down here, Dick. [Laughter.] We don't want Barry to leave yet. Stay here, Barry. Fight it out. [Laughter and applause.]"", 'Let me make it clear that the kind of thing, in conclusion, that I think Arizona has to recognize is that we live in the most changing time in the life of our country. In the 1952 campaign, there was no discussion of two issues which have become important in the fifties. One was outer space, and one was the development of fresh water from salt water. This administration has failed in both of those areas, and they may well mean, these two areas, outer space, and the securing of enough water from the ocean to make our lands green, may well mean more blessings to our people than anything done in this century.', 'This is the kind of change that is coming upon us. Africa, Latin America, Asia - all are changing. The world is changing around us. n 1952, there were very few independent countries in Africa. Today, 25 percent of all the countries in the United Nations are African. There were 16 new nations admitted to the United Nations this summer. Do you know how many voted with us on the admission of Red China? Zero. Do you know the Soviet Union has 10 times as many broadcasts in Spanish to Latin America as we do? Do you know that the United States now is fourth in radio broadcasts? Russia first, Peiping second - do you know who is third? Radio Cairo. We are fourth. Do you know we brought more foreign students to the United States 10 years ago by the Government than we do today? Do you know in Western Germany in 1957 we had more people stationed in our embassies than in all of Africa? We live in a changing time. We cannot sit still. We cannot look back. We cannot just stay as we are. We have to recognize that we are face to face with a dangerous adversary that is determined to destroy us and freedom, and unless we are prepared to move, unless we are prepared to lead, unless we are prepared to build a strong and vital country here in the United States, then our hopes for freedom in our generation will begin to fade. The balance of power stands like this: If India should fall, if Africa should fall, if more Castros should develop in Latin America, what happens to the United States? What happens to Arizona? What happens to our security? That is the issue of our times. Can we demonstrate that a free society can move ahead, that it can speak with power, that it can develop its resources, that it can provide individual employment for its people, that it can educate its children, that it can provide security for its older citizens? These are the things that we must do, and I believe they can be best done by the Democratic Party. I ask your help in picking this country up. [Applause.] I ask your help in picking this country of ours up and moving it into the sixties. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

You have put your confidence in a Democratic Governor. You have put your confidence in two Democratic Senators. Can you imagine if this country elects & Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, and elects Dick Nixon a Republican President of the United States? [Response from the audience.]', 'Would Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn go over to meet with him as the leaders of the Congress and sit down with Dick Nixon, who in l952 said Acheson had graduated from the College of Cowardly Communist Containment, in 1951 called Truman a traitor, in 1960 called me a liar, in 1960 called Lyndon an ignoramus. Lyndon said he called me one. I said he called him one. He called me rash, inexperienced, reckless, and uninformed. But he called Lyndon an ignoramus. Will he sit down and work with him? [Response from the audience.] Do you think Frank Ikard is going to go over and tell him about the problems of this district? I think when the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate go over to the White House, they ought to sit down with a Democratic President. [Applause.] Why do you elect a Democratic Congressman? Why do you elect a Democratic Senator? Why do you elect a Democratic Governor? Because you believe the Democratic Party stands for something. Grover Cleveland said 60 years ago, ""What good is a politician unless he stands for something?"" What good is a party unless it stands for something? What possible use is it saying that you have confidence in your Senators, in the Speaker of the House, in your Governor, in your Congressmen, and then saying, ""You go with them there, but we want a Republican President like Dick Nixon."" [Response from the audience.]', 'If you elect Frank Ikard as your Congressman, it is because you think he can speak for this district. If the House of Representatives elects Sam Rayburn as the Speaker, they think he speaks not only for his district but the United States. Four times the Senators of the United States, Democrats, all the way from Maine to Washington, have elected Lyndon Johnson, not to just speak for Texas, but to speak for the United States. Now Lyndon Johnson and I are engaged in this effort, to move this country forward. We have the endorsement of Sam Rayburn and your Governor and your Congressmen, and I believe on November 8 we are going to have the endorsement of Texas. [Applause.]', ""I don't care how many rescue squads they send to help Dick Nixon travel round the United States. [Applause.] I don't care if Cabot Lodge and Nelson Rockefeller and Barry Goldwater all prop him up and push him forward, and I don't care if they add Dewey, Landon, and Hoover to advise him how to win. [Applause.] The point of the matter is a team does not run for the Presidency. One man runs for President, one man runs for Vice President, and the country makes its decision. The President of the United States, Mr. Eisenhower, dragged him in twice. But they are not going to drag him in a third time. [Applause.] I understand one of the high administration officials has come down to Texas and is proposing to put limitations on imports under this administration beginning January 1. What? Three weeks to go before the end of the administration? What do they think of the people of the United States? We have been trying for 2 years to get the B-70 in California, $300 million the Congress appropriated. The administration opposed it. Two days ago they decided to endorse it. They must think the memories of the people of Texas and the United States are pretty short. Here in this old community, Sam Gray, who sells shoes, in 1955 to 1960 he sold 60 pairs of oil safety shoes a month. Do you know how many he sold last month? Two. Mr. Nixon talks about unexampled prosperity. I want him to tell me how a man can work 8 days a month and have unexampled prosperity? I don't want that example, I don't want that prosperity. Eight days an oil well works in the State of Texas. Eight years ago it worked 20 days. [Applause.] Who do you think will speak well for Texas? Cabot Lodge or Lyndon Johnson? [Response from the audience.]"", ""I will speak for Massachusetts and he will speak for Texas. Cabot Lodge can't speak for Massachusetts and Texas. I come down here and ask your help. This is an important election. There is not anyone here who is not involved in it. You are citizens of this country as well as citizens of the State of Texas. You rise and fall, depending on how the United States rises and falls, and I cannot believe that a State which has been noted for its vitality, a State which has been noted for its vigor, can possibly choose to put Dick Nixon as President of the United States in these dangerous times.

We want someone who can tell the United States and set before it its unfinished business - the things we must do. Lyndon Johnson and I stand in succession [aircraft passing]. Lyndon - he is on his way to Fort Worth tonight. Dick, good luck to you.

I want him to call me on the phone and say, ""Texas is leading the Nation in the Democratic camp."" [Applause.]', 'This party of ours is the oldest political party on earth. Thomas Jefferson founded it from the State of Virginia. He went to New York on a butterfly expedition up the Hudson River. He flew down - he came down the river, met the New York organization, and founded the Democratic Party.', 'Now I come down the river, I come down to Texas, 165 years later; Lyndon Johnson and I, speaking for a united national Democratic Party, come down and ask your help in moving Texas, and the country, forward.

I want the farmers of this district [applause] I talked to a newspaperman from a county in this area. The average age of a farmer nearby is 52 - no young men. They can't make a go of it. Mr. Benson has liquidated it. Mr. Nixon promises more of Mr. Benson's program. He pats Mr. Benson and sends him around the world. But nevertheless, the melody lingers on. He promises the farmers of this State and the United States the exact same program. He says we are going to use the surplus - to use up the surplus, whatever that may mean, and that is exactly what Mr. Benson said 4 years ago. [Applause.] How many feed grain - how many ranchers will be around when they pour that surplus into the market? They will break every rancher in the State of Texas.

[Response from the audience.] I understand in the paper that Tom Dewey has offered him a job in his law office. I don't know what he is going to do. But all I know is I know what the United States is going to do, and they are going to choose to move forward. They are going to choose progress and so is Texas.

I am going to keep going from now until Tuesday night and we are going to travel in the next 4 or 5 days in 13 States, and we are going to carry the message that here in the heartland of the United States, here where the tall cotton grows, right here in the heart of Texas, Lyndon Johnson, the Democratic Party, Frank Ikard, and the people of Texas are going Democratic. Thank you. [Applause.]']"
424,John F. Kennedy ,"November 03, 1960","['* * * Most people thought it was duly a slip of the tongue when, in the first television debate, Mr. Nixon said that we should get rid of the farmer. But there is room for doubt whether it was a slip in view of his distorted charge that the Democratic farm program would raise food prices to the consumer. Not only is that charge wholly wrong but like everything else about the Republican program in agriculture, it works toward the extinction of the family farmer. For it stirs up an artificial war between farmers and consumers. And it prevents a solution of the farm problem by misrepresenting the problem completely.', 'The core of the farm problem is the steady decline in the income of efficient family farmers. During the last 8 years, under the Nixon-Benson program, farm income has dropped by $24 billion, a shrinkage of 26 percent. The farm economy is now badly depressed. It will be depressed when the next administration takes office in January.', 'The farm depression hurts every industry which sells to the farmer: steel, machinery, autos, chemicals, clothing, appliances, building materials, and so forth. The decline in farm income, in other words, is a central component of our current economic distress. It is of the first importance, for the Nation as well as the farmer, that we raise farm income immediately.', 'The Democratic farm program does just that. It offers to the farmer parity of income. It will increase farm income in the 1961-62 marketing year - and no one denies that. At the same time, by balancing supply and demand, the Democratic farm program can, I believe, reduce costs to the Treasury by about $1 billion annually.', 'With respect to wheat, for example, the Democratic program would increase the farmers income to parity income levels; surpluses would be gradually reduced; and the retirement of wheat crop acreage would protect feed producers from additional feed production.', 'The Republican farm program does nothing to raise farm income. It does nothing to achieve parity of farm income. It does nothing to raise support prices. It is a continuation of Bensonism, tricked out with two new public relations stunts.', 'One is Operation Consume, a boondoggle, plainly manufactured on Madison Avenue. The other is the massive land retirement program. Far from helping the farmer, that program would extend and continue the extinction of the family farmer set in motion 8 years ago by Ezra Taft Benson. For that Mr. Benson sired the program is abundantly clear. In describing the program this year Mr. Nixon said: ""We will use the surplus to use up the surplus."" Do you know who said that first? Ezra Taft Benson. Four years ago he said: ""We will use the surplus to use up the surplus.""', ""It is precisely because his own program does not meet the farmers' needs that Mr. Nixon has fallen back on the blackmailer's tactic of distorted threats of threats to the consumer and threats to the farmer. But the only possible consequences of such tactics is to foment bitterness and distrust between city and farm, and thus to add new burdens to the staggering load already borne by the farm community. For in effect Mr. Nixon, not satisfied with having used the full powers of the Federal Government to get rid of the farmer, is now trying to enlist all consumers in a new campaign against the farm community."", 'I am confident that the American people will block this Nixon campaign against the farmer. For there is available a solution to the farm problem, and it lies with the Democratic Party for only the Democratic Party has ever had the courage to deal with farm matters on a sensible and mature basis.']"
425,John F. Kennedy ,"November 03, 1960","[""I speak of a strong America - strong in economy and resources and the dedication of our citizens - because I am concerned about the future of our country. I am concerned about the future of freedom around the world. I am concerned about our declining prestige, our sensitive alliances, the delicate balance of power. I think you share my concern. I think you recognize the need for leadership in this period that is thoughtful but courageous, prudent but firm, well-informed but imaginative. And I think you share my concern that Mr. Nixon's record and experience in foreign affairs do not demonstrate that he possesses these qualities for the critical sixties."", 'I ask you to ask yourselves three questions about his experience:', 'First, does his record demonstrate that he is a man to whom this Nation can entrust awesome responsibilities affecting our peace, our security, our very survival? Here are the facts. Mr. Nixon in 1952 and 1956 joined in reckless political promises, never to be kept, in support of the so-called liberation policy that was going to aid revolutions behind the Iron Curtain through airdrops, coordination, and other direct assistance. In 1954 he tried to get us involved in a hopeless colonial war by recommending the dispatch of American troops to fight in Indochina. In 1958 his goodwill tour of Latin America ended by endangering the prestige of the United States - when he disregarded the advice of our diplomats and allies, and permitted his presence to provoke arguments and disorders of such violence that the Marines had to be called out to safeguard his homecoming.', ""Secondly, does Mr. Nixon's record demonstrate that he is a man whose judgment of world events and future crises is sufficiently farsighted to lead this Nation in the sixties? Here are the facts. On the basis of his visit with Khrushchev, he predicted that the U-2 incident would not affect the summit conference. He was wrong. On the basis of his visit to Cuba, he praised the competence and stability of the Batista dictatorship, and said communism could never take over in that island. He was wrong. On the basis of his trip to Russia, he predicted that the exchange of visits with Khrushchev would develop deeper respect between the two governments. He was wrong, again."", 'He tells us now that he\'s the man to debate with Khrushchev - but the best he could do in that Moscow kitchen was to wag his finger in Mr. Khrushchev\'s face and say: ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust, but we\'re ahead of you in color television."" He tells us now that economic aid to Cuba and Latin America 5 years ago would have prevented the rise of Castro - but he neglects to say that he was there 5 years ago and didn\'t do anything about it. He tells us now that his trips abroad were a valuable experience - but the facts are that every key area he has visited is less friendly to western views now than it was at the time of his visit: Ghana, Laos, Cuba, Panama, and at least 10 others.', 'The great tragedy of American foreign policy in all of these areas was our failure to recognize the situation before the crisis developed. Mr. Nixon was there - presumably he saw what was going on - presumably he made recommendations. But it is apparently an unfortunate fact that for all these years a trip by Mr. Khrushchev or Mr. Mikoyan has had a far greater effect on our foreign policy than a trip by Mr. Nixon. Mr. Nixon would like us to forget the fact that he did not foresee these crises, or recommend new policies, or secure their adoption. But the American people will not forget. For they know that experience counts.', 'Third and finally, has Mr. Nixon been willing to keep sufficiently well-informed - or keep the American people accurately informed - about the state of the world and American foreign policy? Here are the facts. He asserted in our fourth debate that official surveys of our falling prestige abroad related to the 1957 post sputnik era - and we now know that statement to be incorrect. He asserted that the Communist-oriented regime in Guatemala was replaced as the result of our quarantine - and the information available to every diplomat and reporter proves that this is incorrect. He asserted that the administration had never attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to move troops away from the offshore islands - and administration statements before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee prove this to be incorrect.', 'A man who indicated on May 15 that the U-2 flights should be continued, apparently unaware that they had been canceled on May 12 - a man who did not know the difference between the detection of Communist spies and their arrest, or whether it happened in Springfield, Mass., or Springfield, Ill. - a man who does not know to which issues in the United Nations the veto may be applied - cannot be expected, perhaps, to be informed on all these major issues. But neither can he expect the American people to elevate him to the White House on the basis of this experience.', 'I think we need leadership that is better informed - leadership that is less complacent about the future - leadership that is more sound in its judgments. And we need leadership willing to face the facts.', 'In 1939, I saw in Europe what happened to those lulled into a complacent sleep by leaders who talked of peace instead of building for it. And when France fell to the Nazis, one of its most illustrious leaders declared: ""Our spirit of enjoyment was greater than our spirit of sacrifice. We wanted to have * * * more than we wanted to give. We spared effort, and we met disaster.""', 'I run for the Presidency in 1960 in the conviction that the people of this country are willing to sacrifice - to give - to spare no effort. And it is in that conviction that I ask your help tonight.']"
426,John F. Kennedy ,"November 03, 1960","['I believe a strong America is a growing America - a nation that is developing all its resources - economic, human and natural - to the fullest extent.', 'In the past 8 years we have neglected the development of these vital resources. And nowhere has this neglect been more glaring than in the development of our abundant natural resources - the water, and power, and timber, and land - which has been the foundation of American greatness in the past, and which is the key to our future strength.', 'The development of these resources is not just a problem for the West. For the strong America which we all seek can only be built on a foundation of expanding natural wealth. It was because they were building a strong America that two easterners, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt, led the fight for the conservation and development of our natural resources. And it is because he lacks faith in a strong America that a son of the West, a son of California, Richard Nixon, has failed to support the development of our natural resources. At the end of the next 15 years there will be 230 million Americans, a vastly increased industrial and business plant. And the West will grow four times as fast as the rest of the country.', 'To meet the expanded needs of our people and our industry we will need twice as much water, 3 1/2 million more acres of productive land, three times as much power and millions more acres for wildlife and for recreation.', 'If future generations are to have the resources on which their prosperity and strength will depend this generation of Americans must immediately undertake the programs of development which alone can assure the safety of the future.', 'Yet in the past 8 years we have not only failed to provide for future needs, we have not even met our needs of today.', 'Today there are 40 million Americans on the edge of a serious water shortage - water tables are falling everywhere. In east Texas, for example, water is being pumped out of the ground 140 times faster than it is being replenished. And industrialization of the West is being held up because water supplies are not adequate.', 'Today two-thirds of our farmland is not protected by proper soil conservation and half the public rangeland faces severe erosion. As a result millions of acres are washed away by recurrent floods while other millions are burned off by recurrent droughts.', 'Today nearly every major waterway in the United States is polluted - and the Public Health Service has estimated that we need more than 12,000 waste disposal systems to protect our water and our health.', 'Today floods take a toll of about a billion dollars a year as well as an incalculable toll in human welfare.', 'No matter to which of our natural resources you look, the record is the same: Unmet needs, wasted abundance, destroyed timber or power or opportunity for recreation.', 'And these failures have been the failures of Mr. Nixon and the Republicans. It was Mr. Nixon himself who in 1951 voted to kill the Southwestern Power Administration which supplies power for your REA co-ops. But Democratic opposition preserved the Administration.', ""It was Mr. Nixon himself, who, in 1951, voted to kill the central Arizona project bill. And Republican opposition ended this project. It was Mr. Nixon himself who voted, in 1952, to eliminate funds for road construction and schools on Arizona's Indian reservations."", ""It was Mr. Nixon himself who, in the past 8 years, supported Secretary of Agriculture Benson's program which closed all regional offices of the Soil Conservation Service, liquidated all plant and tree nurseries, cut manpower, attempted to reduce conservation appropriations, and, when the Democrats appropriated more money, impounded portions of the additional funds. As a result only one-quarter of vitally needed soil conservation has been completed and at the current rate our present needs will not be met until the year 2000."", ""It was Mr. Nixon himself who backed Republican reductions in appropriations for flood control work in the 11 authorized watersheds and who supported Republican opposition to a Democratic bill for small watershed management. The bill was passed, but Republican hostility has caused more than a thousand applications for watershed planning assistance to pile up in Mr. Benson's office."", 'It was Mr. Nixon himself who supported the Republican veto of the Water Pollution Control Act which would have permitted the Federal Government to help the State build badly needed sewage treatment plants.', 'It was Mr. Nixon himself who helped to formulate the Republican policy of ""no new starts"" which brought development of our river systems to a virtual halt, and has let 90 million kilowatts of potential power and 675 million acre-feet of water go unused.', 'And it was Mr. Nixon himself who concurred in administration opposition to the building of saline water conversion demonstration plants, research to turn salt water into fresh; and to research into weather modification to use modern science to bring rain to our arid lands.', 'This is the record of Mr. Nixon and the Republicans, an unparalleled waste and neglect of our natural resources - waste and neglect which has been justified in the name of economy. Even by the narrow dollars and cents standard of the Republicans these failures have been inexcusable. Investments in forest development have always returned better than 5 percent interest, the $3 1/2 billion we have spent on reclamation has returned more than $5 billion in direct taxes from reclamation projects and the trade areas they support, the $3.8 billion we have spent on flood control projects has prevented an estimated $9 billion worth of floods, and we have paid out, and will pay out, almost twice as much in emergency funds for drought relief as it would cost to end those droughts.', 'But the failures of Mr. Nixon and the Republicans cannot be measured only in terms of dollars and cents. They have taken an immense toll in the welfare of our people, in the slowdown in our economic growth, and in the weakening of the basic foundation of American strength today and for generations to come.', 'If we are to have a strong America we must develop our great resources.', 'First, we must rebuild the historic resource programs which are the proud heritage of Teddy Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt, reversing the policy of no new starts, pressing forward with forest development, water development, power development, soil conservation and all the rest, and passing effective legislation to control the pollution of our water and our air.', 'Second, we must expand research to adapt the new tools of modern science to our resource needs, seeking new breakthroughs in converting salt water into fresh, controlling weather, using atomic energy to increase our oil and mineral resources and developing new techniques of conservation.', 'Third, we must recognize the increasing interdependence of all our resource needs by establishing, in the office of the President, a council of resource and conservation advisers to conduct a continuous appraisal of our resource needs, inventory our resource potential, and formulate a resource program to meet the needs of a growing population and an expanding economy.', ""Fourth, we must put the financing of our resource programs on a business-like basis by using accounting methods which reflect the long-term return which investment in resource projects will yield, thus showing the true value of these projects, their real cost, and the nature of our investment in America's future."", 'A Senator from South Carolina said in 1843 that ""To talk about constructing a railroad to the western shore of this continent manifests a wild spirit of adventure which I never expected to hear broached in the Senate of the United States.""', 'That Senator would have felt very much at home with the Republican Party of the past 8 years but the spirit he represents, the spirit of timidity and little faith in the future will be driven from the White House next week and a Democratic administration, imbued with the same spirit of wild adventure will embark upon the great task of building a strong America.']"
427,John F. Kennedy ,"November 04, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Mayor Daley, my distinguished colleagues in the Congress, my friend and Colleague in the U.S. Senate and the next Senator from Illinois, Senator Paul Douglas [applause], the next Governor of the State of Illinois, Otto Kerner [applause], ladies and gentlemen, I come here tonight in the closing days of this Campaign and ask your help. [Applause.]', ""In 3 days, on Tuesday, November 8, this campaign will come to an end, and then the people of the United States must make their judgment, not only between the two candidates, not only between our two parties, but also between the two philosophies of government which we represent, the two views we have of our country's future, and our message. [Applause.] I want to make very clear that contrary to what you may have come to think this week, we are not electing a committee for President of the United States. [Applause.] I have seen pictures in the paper of the rescue squad. [Response from the audience.] Nelson Rockefeller, Thomas F. Dewey [response from the audience], Cabot Lodge [response from the audience], and I understand they are adding Alf Landon to their strategy board this weekend on how to win their campaign. [Response from the audience.]"", 'I want to make it very clear that they are not all running for the Presidency. Mr. Nixon is running. He is the one the people have [response from the audience] you have to choose between Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party and Mr. Kennedy and the Democratic Party. [Applause.]', 'You have all seen elephants in the circus, and you have seen how they grab the tail of the elephant in front of them, and they pull themselves around that way. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon grabbed that tail in 1952 and 1956, but now he is running, not President Eisenhower but Mr. Nixon. [Response from the audience.]', ""I fly back to the East to finish the last 3 days of this campaign and then I await the results in Massachusetts with my wife and my daughter. [Applause.] Whatever the outcome may be, whatever the outcome may be, I shall not forget the last few months. It has taken me to every section of the United States, and I have visited the famous, ancient places of Valley Forge, Hyde Park, Warm Springs, Springfield, Ill., and the Alamo. I have seen our Nation's last frontier in Alaska and this morning I saw our Nation's first frontier in Virginia. I have seen America, and I am proud to be an American. [Applause.] There are some who say that presidential campaigns are outmoded, they last too long, they are expensive, they are too arduous, they test popularity, not principle, they require endurance, not insight. How much better it would be, they say, for the candidates to stay home, to keep quiet, depend as in the old days on party managers to circulate the party record. But I disagree. I believe the nature of the campaign tells you something about the nature of the candidate. [Applause.] I believe that the level of daily speeches of a candidate tells you something about what kind of a President he would make. [Applause.] If a candidate for the Presidency cannot stand the pressure of a campaign or of a fifth debate, he cannot withstand the pressures of the Presidency. [Applause.] If he cannot inspire confidence among the American people in the 4 months preceding election, he cannot maintain their confidence in the 4 years of office. [Applause.]"", 'In this campaign, I have tried to do the following things:', 'First, I have tried to tell the truth to the American people, whether that truth [applause] whether that truth was pleasant or not. I sought to serve the American people, not to please them. [Applause.] I did not reassure the voters that our prestige was at an all time high, because that would not have been true. And anti-American riots in Tokyo and Caracas, American defeats in the U.N. and the Organization of American States, and speeches in Panama and in Havana, made those clear long before the USIA polls were leaked to the press. [Applause.]', 'I did not tell the voters that regardless of what kind of an effort we make in the next 12 months we were bound to remain first militarily, because that would not necessarily have been true. We are now entering the age of the missile gap, when our nuclear striking power, backed up by larger, more mobile conventional forces, may no longer necessarily convince the Russians of our capacity to survive a surprise attack and also be able to strike back at their willingness to fight. Nor did I reassure the voters that we were enjoying ""unprecedented prosperity,"" because that would not have been true. [Applause.]', 'There is no point in telling the more than 5 million unemployed Americans, the 3 million Americans who work part time, the farmers with the declining income or the coal miner in southern Illinois or in Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, who has been out of work for months, that he never had it so good. [Applause.] This country will never get action unless we first face the truth. [Applause.]', ""Secondly, I have tried in this campaign to set before the American people their unfinished agenda, the task which Franklin Roosevelt could not have foreseen in the 1930's, the task which President Truman could not complete by 1953. We have, for example, a minimum wage of $1 an hour, and there are millions of Americans who do not even receive it. I believe $1.25 an hour is necessary. [Applause.]"", 'We have a social security system, but it pays the 16 million Americans who live over the age of 65, it pays them an average social security check of less than $72 a month. I believe that medical care for the aged tied to social security must be passed by the next Congress. [Applause.]', 'We have 15 million American homes in the United States that are substandardized, 5 million American homes in the cities of the United States that lack plumbing of any kind, and yet in spite of the fact that our population is steadily increasing, this year, in September, we built 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago. I believe we are going to do better. [Applause.]', 'We need legislation to help those Americans who live in those areas of chronic depression. The Congress twice under the leadership of Senator Douglas has tried to pass a bill to assist them, and twice this administration has vetoed it, and next year the President will sign it. [Applause.]', 'And then we have millions of Americans whose full and equal rights under the Constitution, regardless of their race or their creed or color has been recognized in law but unfulfilled in fact.', ""These are some of the items left over for the 1960's, and it is to this agenda that we shall devote ourselves in January of 1961. [Applause.]"", 'Thirdly, I have in this campaign not merely attempted to prolong the present but look forward to the future. If we are to educate all of our children in the next 10 years, who will be going to our schools and applying to our colleges, we will need more teachers than we now have in the service by double. [Applause.] And we want to make sure that they are well compensated and well trained. [Applause.] By 1970, there will be twice as many of your sons and daughters, twice as many, applying for admission to colleges as applied this year, and we have to make it possible for them to have the education they deserve, we are going to have to build as many college dormitories and classrooms in the next 10 years as we built in the last 200.', ""These are some of the problems that these United States of ours faces, some of the opportunities. I want to make it clear as an American that I am not satisfied to have 35 percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college because they can't afford to go. [Applause.] Ten years ago we produced twice as many scientists and engineers as the Soviet Union. Last year they produced twice as many as we, and we lost the talent of 35 percent of our boys and girls. Of all the waste of our resources, there is the greatest, and it shall not continue. [Applause.]"", 'These are new areas of concern, the spread of nuclear weapons - there is a possibility by 1962 that Communist China will have an atomic capacity. The conversion of fresh water from salt water - can you imagine what that will do for the world? The first country that is able to do that will earn far more prestige than we lost by being second in outer space.', ""The harnessing of atomic energy for peaceful use, the conquest of outer space, not merely for military advantage but for the service of all mankind - these are some of the opportunities that stretch before our country in the 1960's."", 'Fourth, I tried in this campaign to emphasize that we must face up to all of our problems and opportunities realistically. As long as we have $9 billion worth of food stored, and in some cases rotting away, while hundreds of millions of people go to bed without a decent diet around the world, we should not be satisfied. [Applause.]', 'We have to improve our distribution and through local farmer action adjust the supply and demand so that they serve the farmer instead of hurting him. The average wage for a dairy farmer, his average wage per hour in Wisconsin or Minnesota, is about 55 cents an hour. A cotton grower in South Carolina who could make a living 20 years ago now lives a thin existence off his land because the policies followed by Mr. Benson and this administration have driven his income steadily downward. [Response from the audience.] And as a result, the farm implement companies of Illinois have let off nearly 11,000 of their employees during the fall of 1960 in the State of Illinois.', ""The catastrophic arms race, more costly than all of our budget put together, more costly than all the other things which we pay for, cannot be eliminated merely by wishful thinking. But isn't it a somber fact that this administration has had less than 100 people working in the entire National Government on the subject of disarmament One-fifth as many as work for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission are working on disarmament in this administration - 100 people scattered throughout the international government. And we cannot avoid the menace of a Communist base on Cuba, only 90 miles from our shores, merely by wishing it had not happened, though I wish it had not. I wish this administration had been as alert to that as they now say they were. [Applause.]"", ""But Castro is not the only problem, and we have to make sure in the 1960's that other Castros do not arise, for poverty and despair are equal evils in Latin America. In northeast Brazil, where living standards are so miserable that in two villages this year not one baby lived beyond 1 year of age, what is the chance for freedom in that country under those conditions, if we continue to ignore our neighbors to the South? We need a program of concerted effort of attack on these problems in Latin America, or otherwise Castros are going to spring up all over South America in the next 5 years. [Applause.]"", 'We need an America that is growing. Freedom will be as secure around the world, our foreign policy will be just as vigorous as we are here in the United States. If we are not moving forward, if we are not developing our economic growth, and that is the key to the future - this year we have dropped back rather than gone ahead. That is the reason that we are using only 50 percent of the capacity of our steel mills, because we are not moving our economy forward. And all the talk, and all the speeches that may be held on fiscal responsibility, the whole point, the whole question of balancing our budget depends on our moving our economy forward. The largest unbalanced budget in the history of the United States was 2 years ago, $12 billion because of the recession of 1958. Already this administration has predicted a tax lowering of $4 billion worth of receipts, not because expenditures have gone up, but because of the slowdown in the American economy. The key to the future of the United States, the key to our foreign policy, the key to our national defense depends on our maintaining full employment in the United States, depends on our using our facilities and our manpower. Then we can meet these programs and meet our obligation and move ahead. But this administration has permitted a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, and now in 1960 we begin to slide again. [Applause.]', ""These are the issues in this campaign, a strong America, an America that is committed to peace, and I know something of war, an America that is committed to peace by firmness, by resolution, by perseverance, by holding out the hand of friendship to those who wish to be friends and maintaining our position of comity with those other countries who desire to be free, by letting young Americans serve the cause of freedom as servants of peace around the world, working for freedom as the Communists work for their system. I want to demonstrate to Mr. Khrushchev and others that a new generation of Americans has taken over this country, men who are committed to the maintenance of freedom in the 1960's. [Applause.] And with your help, we shall do it. [Applause.]"", 'I believe that as a counter to the flood of well trained and accomplished tacticians now helping nations with their problems that the Communists are sending out, I believe an American Peace Corps as a supplement to our selective service that now draws only a fraction of our young men could be trained to help these people live a life of freedom in agriculture, in handiwork, in roadbuilding, in government and other skills, young Americans who will represent the cause of freedom around the globe. [Applause.]', ""This campaign comes to an end and on Tuesday you have to make your judgment. You make your judgment not merely about the two candidates, but you must make your judgment about yourselves, what you believe, what you stand for, what you see as your obligations to this country, what you see as your responsibilities as a citizen of this country. I believe that the 1960's can be years of promise for America. I believe that this country can move ahead. I believe that we can meet the unfinished business of our society. I believe it is possible to build in this country an ornament to freedom, and I hope on November 8 that all of us working together, because that is what this country requires - all of us working together - can begin a great effort to insure the peace and insure the United States will serve as the defender of peace. [Applause.] Thank you.""]"
428,John F. Kennedy ,"November 04, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Battle, Governor Almond, Congressman Jennings, Congressman Downing, Congressman Gary, your distinguished national committeeman, Congressman Hardy, ladies and gentlemen, as the Democratic standard bearer in 1960, I come to the mother of the Democratic Party, Virginia, and ask your help. [Applause.] I am honored by the generous introduction of your distinguished former Governor, and I am proud to sit here on this platform with leaders of the Democratic Party of Virginia, Virginia which began under Thomas Jefferson the Democratic Party. I cannot believe that in 1960 Virginia would vote for a Republican of the strip of Richard Nixon. [Applause.]', 'I come here today to this State which has nourished the Democratic Party in good times and bad, which began this party, which gave it growth, which gave it intellectual conviction, and I come here to this State and ask your support in the last 4 days of this campaign. [Applause.] I believe that Virginia and the Nation join in concerning ourselves with the future of our country. I do not believe that any citizen of the State of Virginia who bears the proud title of Democrat can possibly, in 1960, determine that the destinies of this country should be placed in the hands of a candidate and in the hands of a party who have opposed progress for the last 15 years. [Applause.]', ""Mr. Nixon [aircraft noise] - goodby, Dick [laughter] - I don't care how many rescue squad operations are now being organized around the country to save Mr. Nixon. I rode through the streets of New York by myself. I did not require [applause] - I did not require Henry Cabot Lodge or Nelson Rockefeller or President Eisenhower to go by my side. [Applause.] The point of the matter is that a team is not running for the Presidency. We have one man who runs, one candidate, and the people of Virginia and the people of the United States must decide whether a candidate who runs on a platform of standing up to Khrushchev, who will not come into a studio and have a fifth debate, who needs an escort guard to take him around the State of New York, whether he can lead the American people or not. [Applause.] You have all seen these elephants at the circus, with their heads full of ivory, thick skins, long memory, no vision, and when they move around the circus ring, they grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. [Laughter.] Mr. Nixon grabbed that tail in 1952 and 1956, but he is the lead elephant now, and the people of the United States do not want a candidate who needs an escort to meet the American people in the last 5 days of the campaign. [Applause.]"", 'I come here today and ask your help. This party was begun by Thomas Jefferson. This party of the Democrats is a national party. I run as the presidential candidate, Lyndon Johnson, of Texas, as the Vice President. We stand as a united party, North, South, East, and West. The strength of the Democratic Party is the fact that it is a national party, that it speaks for all the people, that it represents all interests, and most of all represents the public interest. [Applause.]', 'I have been reading speeches by Mr. Nixon and others that if we get into office, that we are going to spend this country blind. I do not know a fiscal record which has been marked by greater imprudence than the record of this administration in fiscal matters in the last 8 years, and I am going to prove it. [Applause.]', 'Do you know in the last 3 months the United States has lost $1 billion in gold? One billion dollars in 3 months has flowed out of this country. In 1952, the U.S. gold reserves were $11 billion more than the debts that we owed to foreign debts. Today our foreign debts are $3 billion more than our gold reserve. A dangerous deterioration in our world position of $15 billion in the last 8 years.', 'In the past month our estimated tax revenues, because of a decline in our economy, have gone down from $2 to $3 billion in the last 3 or 4 months. In the last few months, our gross national product has actually declined by $3 billion. The Soviet Union is moving ahead at 7 percent a year. Our average growth in the last 8 years is 2 1/2 percent; in the last 9 months it is minus 0.3 percent. In the most difficult and dangerous time in the life of our country instead of growing, instead of providing opportunity for our people, instead of providing the sinew that makes it possible for us to defend our country, we are actually falling behind.', 'In the last few months, the cost of living has reached an alltime high. Therefore, I believe we can do much better. I believe we are going to have to do much better. I want to make it clear as the leader of the Democratic Party in this campaign, as a Member of Congress for 14 years, if I am elected President of the United States, we commit ourselves to a sound monetary and fiscal and responsible monetary policy that will move this country ahead and meet our obligations. [Applause.]', 'From fiscal 1954 to fiscal 1960, the last 6 years, we increased the national debt by $21 billion. In the last 6 years, $21 billion. We incurred budgetary deficits of more than $18 billion, and piled up the largest single peacetime deficit in 1 year in the history of the United States $12 billion. Never before in the history of the United States did any administration in peacetime have a larger deficit than this administration in 1958, 12 billion. They would have had an increase in the debt of more than $10 billion except a Democratic Congress in the last 6 years cut the budget requests of the President of the United States by $10 billion. So if we are going to talk about fiscal responsibility, if we are going to talk about meeting our obligations, if we are to talk about balanced budgets, I want to look at the record.', 'This administration in 1952 on a commitment to reduce Federal spending to $60 billion a year, it is $73 billion. It has never been close to $60 billion. They have spent 46 percent more than Harry Truman spent. They have added 106,000 new Federal employees. I think it is about time the American people knew. [Applause.]', ""I don't believe that any Democratic President or any Democratic Congress could perform the miracles of Mr. Benson. Do you know that in the last 3 years the Department of Agriculture has cost more than it cost in the 20 years of the Democratic Party? In the last 8 years they have spent more money in the Department of Agriculture than they spent in the whole history of the Department of Agriculture. That is the record that Mr. Nixon is running on. [Applause.]"", 'The interest rate policy of this administration has added $3 billion a year to the tax bill of the American people. If you buy a house today, $10,000, 30-year mortgage, you pay $3,200 more for that house on interest rates alone than you would have paid in 1952. Who are the spenders? [Applause.]', 'I was chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Governmental Reorganization which steered 30 Hoover Commission recommendations through. Mr. Hoover wrote me a letter praising us for the work we had done on Government economy. I do not intend to become President of the United States in order to liquidate the dollar. I become President of the United States because I think we can do a much better job than the Republicans can do. [Applause.] And I make the following commitments:', 'First, we Democrats do not intend to devalue the dollar from its present rate. We will defend its value and its soundness.', 'Second, we will seek a balanced budget over the years of our administration, seeking a budget surplus in good years as a brake on inflation.', 'Third, we will place less reliance on a high interest rate policy which discourages investment, which I believe is vital to our growing economy, and which has been a major contribution to two recessions, 1954 and 1958, and which has slowed down business in 1960 so that the rate of unemployment in this area of Virginia is higher than the national average.', 'And, fourth, we will begin a large-scale effort to assist those communities in the United States, communities that are represented by Pat Jennings, by the people of West Virginia, which have been hard hit, chronically [applause] which have seen men and machines go idle. Here in this rich country of ours we are producing steel at about 55 percent of capacity. We built this year 30 percent less homes than a year ago. By November, the middle of November of this year, we will have more cars unsold than we have ever had in our history. That is the record Mr. Nixon runs on. And I believe we can do much better. [Applause.]', 'I come to Virginia and ask your help. Every citizen of this State is a citizen of the world. You do not need the reassurances of any man about our position in the world. You know it well. This State would not have survived unless the citizens of this State had had foresight, and you know as Virginians and as citizens of the United States that the United States has to be stronger, we have to do better. You cannot possibly place your reliance in a candidate who has chosen in 1960 to run on a platform that we have never had it so good, that our prestige has never been higher. I ask your support, the descendants of those Americans who in other days faced the truth. [Applause.]', 'This State nourished the great Republic. Its leaders protected this country during our early years, and I do not believe the citizens of Virginia would choose in 1960 to place their confidence in a leader who is not wholly frank with them, who does not tell them the truth, the truth with the bark off. [Applause.]', 'This State and country is going to have to do better. That is the real issue of our times. If you are satisfied, if you believe that everything that needs to be done is being done, in its proper measure, if you believe that our power and prestige is increasing around the world, if you are satisfied, if you are confident, Mr. Nixon is your candidate. [Response from the audience.] But if you share my view that the Republican Party is not equipped by its very nature, by the interests it represents, to lead our country in a changing and vigorous time in the life of our country, in a world of change, in a world of revolution, in a world which sees new countries rising and old countries falling, which sees the Communists carrying on a steady offense against us - I believe that whether the struggle is in outer space or whether it is for the economic survival of this country, I believe the Democratic Party, made up of men of commitment, made up of men who look to the future - I believe you should place your confidence with the Democratic Party once again. [Applause.] And I believe the presence on this platform of Governor Battle and Governor Almond, and distinguished Members of Congress, I believe that that indicates better than anything their good judgment that Virginia should go Democratic in 1960. [Applause.]', 'Virginia was Democratic when Massachusetts was Federalist. Virginia was Democratic when Massachusetts was Whig. Virginia was Democratic when Massachusetts was Republican, and I do not want it said that Virginia was Republican when Massachusetts was Democratic. [Applause.]', '[Aircraft noise.] There are more Republicans leaving town today than ever. [Laughter.]', 'This campaign is just about over, and I am sure we are all going to be glad. It is 4 more days. The issues are joined. The differences between us are acute. The differences which separate Mr. Nixon in the past and us in the future are sharp. You can make your own judgment. You can make your own judgment about your community, your State, your country, and the world. But I come to this State with its long and ancient history, and I come here as one who knows Virginia, whose two brothers attended the University of Virginia, who feels at home in Virginia. [Applause.] Who feels at home in Virginia, who knows as a Democrat that he is among friends, and I come here and say, How could Virginia possibly put its confidence in Richard Milhous Nixon and the Republican Party in 1960? [Applause.]', 'I believe a Democratic tide is rising in the Nation. I believe the people of this country are committed to looking forward. I believe that they know in good times and bad, regardless of what may be said or read, the record of the Democratic Party is shown to you all. It is a responsible and progressive record. All those Republicans who come down here to worship at the shrine of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson and Andrew Jackson fought against them all their political lives. [Applause.] The Republican Party ruined Woodrow Wilson and his hope for the League of Nations. [Applause.] The intellectual predecessors of the Republican Party, the Whigs, censured Andrew Jackson for trying to prevent the flow of money, in this country, prevent it from being dominated by a small group in Philadelphia.', 'John Quincy Adams, who represented my State in the Senate, was expelled from the Senate by the Republicans in those days, because he supported Thomas Jefferson and the Louisiana Purchase. They come down here and say, ""We are all for Wilson, Jackson, Jefferson, and the rest. [Response from the audience.] They are even beginning to say a few kind words about Franklin Roosevelt. Harry Truman, of course - 20 years from now they might even speak a good word for him, but he won\'t about them. [Applause.]', 'This is an ancient struggle between those who look to the future, between those who share the inheritance of Jefferson, and what was it? It was a willingness to look life in the eye, to look to the future, to plan to decide what is best for our country and to move ahead, to be committed to no faction but to be committed to the truth. That is the inheritance of Thomas Jefferson. And on that inheritance I run in 1960, and ask your help. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

Mr. Mayor, Governor Di Salle, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Young, your distinguished Congressman, Lud Ashley, your congressional candidates Bill McCray, Tom Ritchey and Virgil Gates, who I am confident you are going to elect to the Congress next Tuesday [applause], Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen: I am glad to come back to Ohio for the sixth time in this campaign to ask your help on Tuesday. [Applause.] I want to express our regrets at being late. In the last 36 hours we have been all the way from California to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Virginia. We are carrying the message from one part to the United States to the other that this country is going to go Democratic. [Applause.] And I am carrying it myself. [Applause.] I do not send representatives of a rescue squad to save me in the last week of this campaign. [Applause.] The Democrats are not engaged in Operation Ruboff. They are running on their own. [Applause.] And how a candidate who is running on a program that he is the man to stand up to Khrushchev cannot possibly stand up to the people of the United States without five people bearing him up, from Nelson Rockefeller, Barry Goldwater, President Eisenhower, and Cabot Lodge.

[Applause.] Well Dick grabbed that tail in 1952 and in 1956. But now he is running. [Applause.] In the last 4 days he has called me everything from a barefaced liar to an economic ignoramus. I am calling him a worthy member of his party in 1960. [Applause.] He fits right in with Dewey, Landon, Coolidge, Harding, McKinley, and all the rest of them. [Applause.]', 'I understand he has set up a committee on last-minute strategy to win this election composed of Herbert Hoover, Alf Landon, and Thomas Dewey. I look with confidence to Tuesday. [Applause.] This is an important election. This election involves Ohio, and involves the future of this country. The decision that you have to make is which party, which candidates, which view of the present, which view of the future do you accept as a citizen of the United States.', ""You cannot be a citizen of Ohio, you cannot be a citizen of the United States, without realizing that this State and this country is going to have to do better in the 1960's. We are going to face entirely new problems which come upon us in an entirely new day. In the month of October in the State of Ohio, there were nearly as many men and women out of work as there were in October in the recession year of 1958. Mr. Nixon talks about our unexampled prosperity. I don't think it is good enough when we are using only 55 percent of our steel capacity. Mr. Nixon says we are producing more cars in the last 6 weeks than ever before in our history. How many are being sold? [Response from the audience.] We are going to have, by the middle of November, more unsold cars than we have ever had in the history of the United States. This year we are building 30 percent less homes than we did a year ago. In the last 3 months of this year, $1 billion worth of gold has flowed out of the United States. The next President of the United States is going to be faced with serious problems in the winter of 1961 right here in the United States."", 'I do not run for the Presidency under any expectation that if I am successful on Tuesday that that job will be easy. But I have the greatest confidence in this country. I have the strongest feeling of conviction that we can meet the responsibilities of our time, that we can move this country forward, and I come and ask your help on that basis. [Applause.]', ""You have to decide as citizens of this State and country which party, looking ahead over the next 10 years, can find 87 million jobs, because that is the number of people we are going to have in 10 years looking for jobs, 87 million. Do you think the Republican Party - do you think that they are concerned about the problems that are coming across the horizon? [Response from the audience.] Thirty-five percent of our brightest boys and girls who graduate from high school never see the inside of a college. We are going to have twice as many boys and girls applying for admission to college in 1970 as do today. Do you believe that the Republican Party and Mr. Nixon look to the future of these problems? [Response from the audience.] I must say, I have come to the same conclusion. [Laughter and applause.] All the problems which the next President of the United States is going to face are complicated; technical, they involve economic growth. They involve automation, they involve our position in the world, of how it is possible for countries around the world, and people, facing staggering problems of poverty and ignorance and decline, how they can maintain freedom and how we can head a world torn by conflict, in many cases by poverty, fighting against an enemy who is unrelenting in his attacks on freedom and upon the United States. The United States in the 1960's will be meeting its great time of challenge, and also its great time of opportunity. I have traveled this country from one end to the other. I have served in the Congress for 14 years, and I come to this time in this campaign not merely talking about the problems of this election, but attempting to point out that in these times of change which the 1960's are, I believe the Democratic Party is best equipped to lead our country. [Applause.] We are going to have to build a better life for our people. As long as there are 15 million American homes which are substandard, as long as there are millions of Americans who are not even paid a dollar an hour, as long as there are hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work, living on an average unemployment compensation check of $31 a week - what do they do when they go out of a job? Where do they go to work? How do they keep their families? How do they pay their rent? These are the problems that disturb America."", ""How do we maintain our position in the world? How do we provide fairness and equality of opportunity for all Americans? I think that on Tuesday my job and responsibility and that of Mr. Nixon's is over. Then you have to decide. You have to make your judgment of whether you believe that everything that must be done is being done in good time, or whether we can do better. I believe we must do better, and I ask your help in doing it. [Applause.] I ask your help in building in this country a strong and vital society, one which uses its facilities, one where men and women can find jobs when they seek them, one that moves ahead and demonstrates to the world what a free society can really do. That is our opportunity in the 1960's. That is the challenge which faces the great Republic. As this election comes to an end, we pick not merely a President, but we pick a road, we pick a position for the sixties, we make a decision, each one of us, what we want, and my judgment is that a majority of the citizens of this country on Tuesday will choose to move forward. [Applause.]"", 'I am not planning a seventh trip to Ohio in this campaign. We are coming to an end in this trip to Toledo. But this State is key. Whoever carries Ohio will carry the United States. [Applause.] Whoever secures the electoral support of you on Tuesday night, of your collective judgment, you in this State will elect the President of the United States.', 'I do not recall a decision as significant, that carries with it so many responsibilities, since 1932, I believe that the United States is at a period in its history, facing different problems, different challenges, in some ways less serious, in other ways more serious. I feel this is 1932 and 1912, and I come here as a concerned citizen of this country, and I ask you not merely for your help on Tuesday, but I ask you to join me in building this country of ours, in moving it forward, in showing what we can do. [Applause.]', 'So give us your hand, your voice, your vote, and we are going to move forward on Tuesday. [Applause.]']"
430,John F. Kennedy ,"November 04, 1960","['* * * There are some who say that presidential campaigns are an outmoded, unnecessary institution in American political life. They are too long, too expensive, too arduous, it is said. They test popularity, not principle. They require endurance, not insight. How much better it would be, they say, for the candidates to stay home, keep quiet, and depend as in the old days on party managers to circulate the platform and turn out the voters.', 'But I disagree. I believe the nature of the campaign tells you something about the nature of the candidate. I believe the level of daily campaign speeches tells you something about the level of future White House operations. If a man cannot withstand the pressure of a presidential campaign, he cannot withstand the pressures of the Presidency. If he cannot inspire confidence among the people in the 4 months preceding election, he cannot inspire their confidence in the 4 years that follow.', 'I believe in campaigns as a great education - for the voters - and for the candidates. I like to campaign, and I think all Democrats like to campaign, because we like hard work and we like people.', 'Tonight I want to talk with you about the campaign now coming to a close, about what I have tried to do, what I have tried to say. I am not referring to any grand strategy or master plan, I simply mean my efforts for 3 months to take my case to the American people in a manner worthy of your confidence and worthy of the high office I seek. I hope I have fulfilled that obligation.', 'First I have tried in this campaign to tell the truth to the American people, whether the truth was pleasant or not. I did not reassure the voters that our prestige was at an alltime high, because that would not have been true. And anti-American riots in Tokyo and Caracas, American defeats in the U.N. and OAS, and anti-American speeches in Panama and Havana should have made this clear long before the secret USIA surveys leaked out and confirmed it.', 'I did not reassure the voters that we were sure to remain first in the world militarily, because that would not have been true. We are now entering the age of the missile gap when Russian nuclear striking power, backing up a larger, more modern, and more mobile conventional force, may no longer be convinced of our capacity to survive a surprise attack and still destroy their willingness to fight. Nor did I reassure the voters that we were enjoying ""unprecedented prosperity,"" because that would not have been true.', 'There is no point in telling the rising number of unemployed, the rising number of short workweeks, the farmer with declining income or the coal miner unemployed for a year that ""you never had it so good."" We have to face the facts about where we stand - and then do something about it.', ""Secondly, I have tried in this campaign to set before the American people their unfinished agenda - the tasks which Franklin Roosevelt did not foresee in 1933 - the tasks which Harry Truman could not complete by 1953 - and the tasks on which in 8 Republican years we never even started. We have a minimum wage, but to be of any help at today's prices it must be raised to $1.25 an hour."", 'We have social security, but to meet the most basic need of older people today, it must be amended to include medical care.', 'We have urban renewal and housing measures, but to replace slums faster than they are spreading, those measures must be expanded.', 'We have unemployment insurance benefits that need higher nationwide standards, a water pollution control program that needs stepping up, dams that are planned but unbuilt. We have legislation to help our depressed areas of long-term unemployment that needs to be passed again - so it can be signed instead of vetoed. And we have millions of citizens whose full and equal rights under the Constitution regardless of race, have been recognized in law but unfulfilled in fact. These are some of the items left over for our agenda of the sixties and it is high time we get on with the job.', 'Third, I have tried in this campaign to meet the challenge of the future and not merely prolong the past. New problems require new effort. If we are to educate all our children in the coming 10 years, we will need salaries, sufficient to attract as many new teachers as all those presently in service, as well as massive school construction. If we are to send to college all who want and deserve to go, we will need far more scholarships, far more loans and the construction of more dormitories and classrooms than have been built in the last 200 years - for even today, some 35 percent of our brightest high school graduates are unable to afford the high cost of a college education.', 'There are other new areas of concern which require our attention - the spread of atomic weapons - the adverse effects of automation - the conversion of salt water to fresh - the harnessing of atomic energy - and the conquest of outer space, not for our military advantage, but for the benefit of all mankind.', ""Fourth, I have tried in this campaign to get the American people to face up to their problems realistically, without the luxury of wishful thinking. The unprecedented $9 billion of stored farm surpluses, that depress farm prices, burden Federal taxes, and antagonize a hungry world, cannot be eliminated by merely wishing. We have to improve our distribution, and then, through local farmer action, adjust supply to demand so that those laws, the laws of supply and demand, serve the farmer instead of always hurting him. I talked to a South Carolina small cotton farmer who had worked the land for 41 years but could not make it pay at today's prices while his own costs went up and up."", 'The catastrophic arms race, more costly and less constructive than the rest of the budget put together, cannot be eliminated by merely wishing. We have to research and prepare effective arms control plans under a single agency, and not leave this terribly complex matter to less than 100 people scattered throughout Washington - one-fifth as many people as work on cemeteries and memorials for the U.S. Battle Monuments Commission.', 'We cannot avoid the menace of a Communist base in Cuba, only 90 miles away from our shores merely by wishing it hadn\'t happened. For Castro is not the only problem, and if we are not careful, he may not be the only ""Castro"" in power. For poverty and despair are equal evils in Latin America - in northeast Brazil, for example, where living standards are so miserable that in two villages no babies have survived the age of 1 year. We need a program of concerted effort with other Latin American States to build freedom and isolate dictators throughout our hemisphere.', 'And we cannot avoid continued budget deficits and continued rises in the cost of living, merely by wishing - or merely by raising interest rates so high that every small businessman and home buyer in America is squeezed. We need an America that is growing - not less than the Soviet Union, as it is today - not less than other industrialized economies, as it has for 8 years - but more than any other nation on earth. For in economic strength, as in every other kind, I believe in an America that is not first sometimes, or first when, or first if - I want an America that is first, period.', 'Fifth, I have tried in this campaign to address myself to the real issues confronting America - the real issue is world freedom or world slavery. World peace or world war, stopping the Communist advance which in 8 years has penetrated deep into Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America - taking over Cuba itself - without firing a single shot or losing a single soldier.', ""That is the real issue - peace - and my greatest objective is peace because I know something of war. And that issue will not be met by more words, more committees, more good will tours, or more debates with Khrushchev or any other Soviet leader in a Moscow kitchen. For we have erred in regarding Mr. Khrushchev as the enemy. He only personifies the enemy and that enemy is the relentless, tireless Communist system now infiltrating the world's less prosperous areas."", 'For much of the bottom half of our globe is not only but uncommitted and undecided, and we need to identify ourselves with their struggle against poverty and hunger and disease.', 'To this end I have proposed a new policy for Latin America - Alianza Para Progreso - a new educational and development program for Africa - and a new joint effort by all the wealthier nations to establish funds of long-term credit for India and each of the underdeveloped regions.', 'Finally, and most recently, I have proposed, as a counter to the flood of well-trained and dedicated Communist technicians now helping these nations with their problems, an American ""peace corps,"" a supplement to our selective service that now draws only a fraction of our young men and, as General Gavin and others point out, wastes the talents of many who are taken. A peace corps of Americans trained to help these nations help themselves, to show them modern agriculture, public health, roadbuilding, government and other skills - trained in the languages and customs of these nations (which so few of our ambassadors and foreign service are today) - would be composed not only of young men who qualify to elect this alternative to the draft, but also men and women of every age - teachers and engineers forced to retire at 65, for example - who desire to devote a part of their lives not as soldiers of war but as ambassadors of peace.', ""Sixth I have tried in this campaign to demonstrate my confidence in the American people, in their ability to listen to facts, not name calling, to judge the candidates on their own views, not someone else's coat tails, to remember the records of the two parties, and not ignore party labels, to hear what is said in one section alone. It is because I have this confidence in you that I do not share my opponent's fear of the future, his fears of every new program his fears that inflation and deficits and unemployment are unavoidable, his fear that we cannot afford what we must afford, or even his fear of a fifth debate."", 'In short, I have tried in this campaign to set forth my responsibilities - and yours as well. I have tried to meet my obligations to the future - and indicate yours. For I like campaigning. But we are not engaged in a one-man campaign. I hope to be successful, but we do not live under a one-man form of government. So I ask your help. In these last remaining days, I ask your help. In the day and years ahead I shall ask your help And I shall ask God\'s help, in reminding us all, in the words of Woodrow Wilson, to ""never forget that we created this Nation, not to serve ourselves, but to serve mankind.""']"

Massachusetts and Virginia both went wrong in the last 8 years. But the people of Virginia have begun to look to the future. I believe that the past will not control the future. The future will control itself.', 'No citizen can live in this section of Virginia without realizing there is a world of danger and opportunity surrounding us.', 'You must believe that the United States must go forward.', 'You cannot possibly put your confidence in Democratic Senators and Democratic Congressmen and suddenly put in reverse and elect a Republican President.

I come back where it all began, and I ask Virginia to give me her vote.', 'We do not intend to devalue the dollar from its present rate.

432,John F. Kennedy ,"November 04, 1960","['Next Tuesday the American people will have to choose between the economic policies of the Republican and Democratic Parties, between the wasteful and shortsighted policies of the past 8 years and the Democratic pledge of a sound fiscal policy designed to strengthen our economy, increase our productivity, and provide increased abundance for all Americans.', 'For let me make it clear that if elected President, I commit myself and my party to a sound fiscal policy in the sixties.', 'The failure of our present economic policies has become increasingly evident in the past few months, as the danger signals of economic weakness have begun to mount.', 'Since last June our gold reserves have declined by almost a billion dollars, and almost $4 billion in gold has left this country in the past 3 years. In 1952 American gold reserves were $11 billion more than the debts we owed to foreigners. But today our foreign debts are $3 billion more than our gold reserves, a dangerous deterioration in our world financial position of almost $15 billion. Certainly this is not the product of sound planning and fiscal responsibility.', 'In the past few months our estimated tax revenues have dropped $2 billion to $3 billion, a drop which is due not to lower taxes but to steadily decreasing production.', 'In the last few months our gross national product, the measure of our economic growth, has actually declined by around $8 billion. Our economy not only did not grow fast enough, it actually shrank.', 'In the last few months the cost of living has reached the highest point in the history of this country, the culmination of a steady price rise over the past 8 years which has lowered the value of the dollar by more than 10 percent.', 'These are the danger signals, the growing weakness, which has caused many economists to say that we may be entering our third major recession in 6 years. And growing unemployment and declining production tend to confirm this prophecy.', 'Much of this growing decline in our relative economic strength has been due to Republican failure to realize that a growing economy requires bold and imaginative use of the tools of economic policy and of our abundant resources if that growth is to be maintained and stimulated. But much of it is also due to the wasteful programs of the past 8 years, programs which have consumed our revenues without accomplishing their objective or justifying their cost.', 'From fiscal 1954 to fiscal 1960 we increased the national debt by more than $21 billion, incurred budget deficits of more than $18 billion, and piled up the largest single peacetime deficits in our history, more than $12 billion in fiscal 1959. And these deficits have been incurred despite Democratic cuts of more than $10 billion from administration spending requests.', 'In fact this administration, which promised to reduce spending to $60 billion a year and cut down the size of Government, has now spent 46 percent more than Harry Truman, and has added 106,000 new, nondefense, Federal employees to the Government.', 'Of course we Democrats have programs. And those programs will cost money. But they will not be wasteful programs. They will be soundly financed. And they will return their own cost many times in terms of increased productivity and prosperity for America.', 'Our farm program, through a system of supply management, is designed ultimately to reduce our vast surpluses and huge agricultural payments while raising farm income. It will reduce the enormous costs of the present program which, in the past 3 years, has cost more than the total cost of price supports in 20 years of Democratic administration. And it will work toward cutting down the expenditures of the Department of Agriculture which has spent more in the past 8 years than all the Departments of Agriculture in our history combined while, at the same time, surpluses increased until we now have over $7 billion worth of unused food in our warehouses.', 'Our defense program will strengthen our security, but it will also eliminate the expensive duplication of weapons systems, the costly lag between design and production, and the useless waste in procurement practices which add nothing to strength but which cost billions of dollars. For example, a recent investigation into Armed Forces procurement disclosed that we had been paying $21 for a wall socket worth a quarter. And this was only one of hundreds of similar examples.', 'Our interest rate policies will stimulate economic growth, but they will also tend to relax the artificially high and rigid rates which have added $3 billion a year to the cost of the national debt, increased the cost of living for every American who finances a car or a house or a television set, and failed to keep prices from rising.', 'And all our other programs also - investments, which in the future, as in the past, will repay their own cost many times over by creating the growing expanding economy which will increase our abundance as well as the flow of revenues to the Treasury.', 'I know something of waste in Government. I served as the chairman of the Senate subcommittee which held hearings on the Hoover Commission report, and which steered 30 bills through Congress to carry out its recommendations - bills which former President Hoover said would save the Government billions of dollars.', 'But I also believe that it is not enough to combat waste. We must do more than try to save what we have. We must work to increase our productivity, our national wealth, and our national strength through sound programs of investment in the future of America - and through sound economic policies.', 'First, we Democrats do not intend to devalue the dollars from its present rate. We will defend its value and its soundness.', 'Second, we will seek a balanced budget over the years of our administration - seeking a budget surplus as a brake on inflation in times of prosperity.', 'Third, we will place less reliance on the high-interest-rate policy which has discouraged the investment which is vital to a growing economy - and which has been a major contribution to our current rate of business failure, the highest since the great depression.', 'Fourth, we will immediately begin a large-scale effort to reverse our present economic decline and increase our rate of growth - bringing help to depressed areas - developing our resources - dealing with the problem of automation - eliminating obsolete restrictions on our exports. For perhaps the greatest economic waste of the past 8 years has been the enormous waste of idle plants and idle men - waste which, economists estimate, has cost the United States hundreds of billions of dollars in the past 8 years - money which would have meant an improved standard of living for every man and woman in the United States.', 'Thus, the choice in this campaign is not only between a party committed to a sound fiscal policy, and a party which has wasted our revenues and our resources - it is also between a party with bold and imaginative programs, which intends to develop our economy to new heights of productivity and abundance and meet the urgent unmet needs of our people - and a party which has lacked faith in the future of the American economy and has failed to move America forward.', 'And I am confident that, confronted with that decision, the people of Virginia, like the people of all America, will choose the Democratic Party.']"
433,John F. Kennedy ,"November 04, 1960","['In 1940 this area and this country became the arsenal of democracy. In 1960 this area and this country must become the workshop of freedom.', ""We must become the workshop of freedom in part to meet the challenge of communism. For the Communists have shifted their principal line of attack from the military to the economic. Where once there were Stalin's soldiers, there are now Khrushchev's salesmen. And to stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the world struggle means that we must stay ahead of the Soviet Union in the economic struggle."", 'We must become the workshop of freedom in part to win and to hold the faith and friendship of the underdeveloped countries now coming into their own in Asia, in Latin America, and Africa. For what these countries want immediately are the skills and the capital and the economic foundation that only the wealthy countries can supply. And if this country does not take the lead in building up the basic economic foundations of the new countries, if this country does not enter the vast markets of the new continents, then the Soviet Union will, and then the Soviet Union will profit in increased power and prestige around the world.', 'Yet even if the Soviet Union did not exist - even if there were no underdeveloped countries - we would have to build economically. For like it or not, the economy is moving - pushed forward by the forces of population growth and technological change.', 'Population growth assures that by 1970, we will have to feed, house, and clothe a population of 208 million - up 15 percent from today; find jobs for a labor force of 87 million - up nearly 20 percent from today.', 'Technological change assures that by 1970 we will be able to meet basic economic needs with a far smaller portion of the working force engaged in heavy industry. That will leave scope for a new burst in the standard of living - a rise of about 25 percent to a gross national product of $750 billion by 1970. But doing that requires shifting in emphasis from quantity to quality production; from heavy manufacturing to service industries. It requires diversification of product and site; and a vast expansion in the new fields of electronics, of space, of research and development.', 'The change in this direction is now in progress. It is because the administration has failed to master the drift, has failed to anticipate the change, has failed to ease the adjustment that there is now so much trouble in our basic economy. That is why steel is being turned out at 60 percent of capacity. That is why there are major pockets of unemployment in every center of heavy industry - in Buffalo, in Seattle, in Detroit, in Pittsburgh, in Youngstown. That is why unemployment is edging toward the 6 million mark. That is why the economy seems to be sliding into the third recession in 6 years.', 'Solving all those problems will not be easy. But it can be done. The next Democratic administration will take a giant step in that direction by acting rapidly to free the economy of all the shortsighted policies artificially imposed by the Republican administration.', 'First, we will free the economy from the shortsighted policies of high interest. For high interest is a drag upon the farmer, upon the homeowner and homebuilder, upon communities which must build schools or other public services. To assure full employment and a high rate of growth, the drag of high interest must be lifted.', 'Second, we must free the economy from the shortsighted policies of ""no new starts"" on resource development. For resource development - and the St. Lawrence Seaway and the port of Toledo prove the point - offers the best way there is to stimulate economic growth, to create new jobs, new industries, new needs, new opportunities throughout the country.', 'Third, we must free the economy from the shortsighted policies of an inadequate educational system - of overcrowded and underfinanced schools. For in the next decade to achieve the transition to higher living standards, we will need especially technically trained peoples. We will need probably 40 percent more executives and technically trained personnel than we have now.', 'Fourth, we must free the economy from the shortsighted views that permit racial discrimination. For the economy of the next decade requires, not only the willing work of all citizens but a high degree of special skill, and there will be no room, no excuse for the exclusion of other Americans from the common task and the common opportunity by reason of race, creed, or color.', 'We must free the economy - and the country - from the shackles of the Republican Party. For the Republican Party has always believed in scarcity - in scarce jobs, in scarce goods, in scarce money, in scarce houses. The Republican Party has a philosophy at odds with economy of abundance. But we Democrats believe in the economy of abundance, in full employment, in full development of resources, in full use of skills and plants, in full growth for America.']"

[Applause.] This campaign is coming to an end Tuesday night. Then you have to decide. You have to make your judgment. I made my judgment long ago that the basic issue of this campaign was the question of whether the people of the United States believed it was time they started moving again, that they started going forward again, and that the greatest contribution that they could make to the cause of freedom was to build a strong and vital society here in the United States. Mr. Nixon has chosen a different road. [Response from the audience.] He has gone to the American people in the 1960\'s, in the time of change and revolution, saying, ""We\'re never had it so good,"" saying our prestige in the world has never been higher. I recall in 1935, when Winston Churchill was warning of the dangers of the Nazi rise, Stanley Baldwin, the leader of the Conservative Party, told the people of England that everything was being done in its own good time. He won that election and England almost lost the war.', 'In 1960 we tell the truth. We stand for the public interest, and I believe on Tuesday, November 8, the American people are going to choose to go forward.

This is an important election. It involves a high office. It is the highest responsibility that a citizen of a free country can have, to pick the President, and it is the President's responsibility to set before the American people the unfinished business of our society, to rally them to a great cause."", 'The Presidency, as Franklin Roosevelt said, is above all a place for moral leadership, and I believe in 1960 the people of the great Republic, as in 1932, are going to choose to go forward, and right in the lead will be the Bronx County of New York.

It will be the function of this Counsel to represent the interests of consumers in the administrative procedures of Government, and in the congressional procedures of the Government. The wage earners who pay the rent, the housewives who shop for the families, all have a vital interest in governmental policy, which affects them, and affects their ability to meet their responsibilities. And yet all these great interests, of which all of us have a part, really go unrepresented before the committees of the agencies of our National Government.', 'The congressional committees and the executive department all have a direct impact on the daily lives and the standard of living of the American consumer, and one of the first tasks of the Consumer Council will be to help formulate economic policies which will keep a general rise in the price level from having a discriminatory effect upon the wage earners of the United States and their families.

The cost of medical care has gone up 32 percent in the last 8 years. The cost of rent has gone up 20 percent. The cost of household management has gone up 23 percent. In short, the consumer has had to bear an undue share of the price rises which have lowered the purchasing power of every American family.', 'We intend to halt this steady deterioration in their position.', 'Aside from participation in the formulation of policy, the Office of the Consumer Counsel will have four major functions. First, it will scrutinize the activities of all governmental agencies which have a responsibility of regulating business activities in the public interest. While the railroad companies and the airlines, the drug companies and all the others are represented before these agencies, by high-priced attorneys, the consumers, whose protection is at stake, are not represented today. [Applause.]', 'Second, the Consumer Counsel will represent consumer interests before congressional committees. Each year, dozens of bills are heard before the congressional committees an are acted upon, which affect the welfare of the consumers of the United States. The consumers have no voice to speak for their interests. When I conduct hearings as chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, we hear from representatives of organized labor, we hear from the representatives of business, we occasionally hear from public interest groups. But we do not have anyone who speaks to us about the effect of any policy that we take upon the consumers of the United States. And what is true of Labor is true of the Banking and Currency Committee, is true of the Committee on the Judiciary, is true, in fact, of every committee of the Congress, whose actions affect the cost of living. And I believe that it would be useful to have someone who could go before these committees, when a bill which is important and controversial is before the Congress, and discuss some of the effects that this might have upon the cost of living. [Applause.]', 'I believe that if the interest is properly represented, it will greatly aid the executive department in meeting its responsibilities to the people.', 'Fourth, the Consumer Counsel will keep the President informed about any deficiencies in administration harmful to the consumer and will participate in the formulation, drafting, and presentation of new legislation to advance the interest of the American consumer.', 'I believe that such a Consumer Counsel, perhaps a woman familiar with consumer problems, will be the surest safeguard of the public interest in a Government where private interests are well represented. [Applause.]', 'President Truman used to say that there are 14 million Americans who have sufficient resources, sufficient knowledge of the workings of government, to be able to protect their interests, and it is the function of the President of the United States to protect the interest of the other 150 million, and that is what we are going to do. [Applause.]', 'During a series of congressional investigations into a highly suspicious series of land sales, a Boston lawyer Louis Brandeis, later Justice of the Supreme Court, appeared before the committee as a representative of a group of citizens alarmed at the waste in the public interest. When he took the witness stand, a Congressman challenged his right to be present. ""Who, sir,"" he asked, ""Do you represent?"" ""I, sir,"" replied Mr. Brandeis, ""am the people\'s counsel."" It is my hope and belief that this new officer of the Government will also be the people\'s counsel and speak for the people. [Applause.]', 'Let me say that this campaign, happily for us all, is coming to an end. If somebody told me that it is going to be on November 16, instead of November 8, I might just fade right out. But we can last until November 8. I have been in the last 3 days in eight States, among them California, New Mexico, Arizona, Ohio, Illinois, Virginia, and the Bronx, the ninth State. [Applause and laughter.] And I come here today and ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.]', ""Mr. George Gallup described a week ago our problem as Democrats. He said that in a poll that he had taken we were leading, the Democrats, 49 to 45 for Mr. Nixon. But when he took out the 4 percent who he did not think would vote, based upon their previous experience, the result was 49 to 49. We lose that 4 percent. They are Democrats. I assume Mr. Gallup was reporting the facts as he saw them. They are Democrats. The Republicans vote. We all know that Suburbia turns out and all the rest of the areas of New York, where Republicans live - Riverdale, all those other places. [Laughter.] We know that they turn out. They are going to be out to vote 90 percent. We can't lose 4 percent in any State. Four percent is a terrific vote in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, California - 4 percent will decide the result in any of those States. Now, we can't get that 4 percent out unless you get them out, unless you help get them out, unless you are able."", 'I have attempted to make the issues sufficiently sharp, sufficiently clear, and I believe there are great stakes in the issue, to try to interest the people to come out to vote. But in the final analysis, it depends upon your willingness to assume your responsibilities as you have so often in the past, your responsibilities on Tuesday. Let us see if we can get that 4 percent, and if we do, we are going to win. [Applause.]', 'Last night we had a parade in Chicago of 1 million people. I said to Mayor Daley, ""They are all going to be so tired from being in the parade that they won\'t be able to get up on Tuesday."" [Laughter.] He said, ""No, they will get up."" I thought so, too. I think they will here in the Bronx. This election is important: The Presidency is a great office. It has unparalleled influence over the lives of all of us. Every decision the President makes affects the security and well-being of every person in the United States as it never has before, as it never has before. Its possibilities, its opportunities for service are unlimited in 1960, and I think we don\'t want the Republicans and Mr. Nixon to assume that responsibility. We want progress. We want a Democratic President. We want a President that will move this country forward. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

[Applause.] Lyndon Johnson and I have each been in 40 States. That makes a total of 80. [Applause.] And we have said the same thing in every State. We stand for progress, North, South, East, and West. [Applause.] He is here with his wife. I want you to meet the most popular lady in Washington, Lady Bird Johnson.

[Applause.]', 'We come here tonight in the closing days of this campaign to ask your help in turning the Republican Party out of office and putting the Democrats back in and moving this country forward. [Applause.] I have been called in the last week by the candidate of the Republican Party, who is waging that high level campaign for which he is justly celebrated, a liar, an economic ignoramus, a Pied Piper and I just call him one thing, a worthy member of his party. [Applause and laughter.] He stands in a great tradition, right out of McKinley, Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, Landon, and all the rest of them. [Applause.] He came in here - he thinks he is running as a committee [laughter]. They are not electing a committee next Tuesday. They are electing a President of the United States, and in spite of the fact - all of you have seen circus elephants with tusks, thick skull, thick skin, no vision, and when they move around the circus ring they have to grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. That is what he is doing. [Laughter and applause.] That was all right in 1952 and 1956, but now he is running, and I believe that on Tuesday, November 8, the people of this country face not merely a choice between Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, not merely a choice between parties, but between a position which says that we never had it so good, that our prestige has never been higher, which is right out of the book of Stanley Baldwin, who almost lost England World War II - I believe the people of this country want the truth and they want to move and they want to see us build our strength here and around the world. [Applause.] So we are leaving it to all of you to make the right decision. We will now move on to Waterbury, Conn., and in the next 2 days we are going to cover all the six New England States, and I want to tell them that as New York goes - and I think it is going Democratic - so goes the Nation. [Applause.]', 'I read the New York Daily News poll, not always their editorials, but I think we have a good chance here. So I want to express my thanks to all of you for standing in the rain, and we are delighted to stand with you. The Republicans are home in bed.

[Laughter.] We may all meet next week to get the campaign out of the red with a midnight brunch at $85 a person, and I will be there. [Applause.]', 'I did not come to New York entirely alone. I must reveal before the press reveals it that President Truman and I are staying at the same hotel.

In the last 48 hours or 56 hours, I have been in eight or nine States, from California, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Virginia, Ohio, and Illinois.

[Laughter.]', ""I don't know what is going to happen on Tuesday night, but I must say I think we will all feel that we have done everything that could be done, and for better or for worse, win or lose, I believe, at least I hope, that we have been able to make the issue very sharp in this campaign; that is, between those who are concerned and those who are comfortable. I believe in 1960 the majority of the American people are concerned, and, therefore, I look to Tuesday night with at least hope, and with some equanimity, because I believe that the issues have been sharply enough drawn."", 'Now, what is the question is not just which of the candidates the people want, but what their own judgment is of themselves, what they want personally, what their view is of their country, what their view is of the future and of the President. The time of analyzing the two candidates and the two parties is coming to an end, and now the people of this country have to make their own judgment about themselves. And I believe the interest, the public interest, the conception of the public service, the strong support which the majority of the people have had throughout our history for the public service, I believe that is on the side of the Democrats in 1960, and that we, more importantly, are on the right side, ourselves. [Applause.]', 'I want to thank each of you. As I look around, we have been meeting on many occasions in New York, and New York has been very generous. I hope that it will be possible for us to meet at some affair after the campaign, which will not touch you quite as deeply as this one has, but where we all just buy our breakfast or lunch or dinner and have a chance for me to express my appreciation to each of you. Everyone in this room, as I look around, has contributed a good deal, and while I have the responsibility of being the standard bearer, which is far more than a race between Mr. Nixon and myself, or really between two parties - it is a contest in which all of us are engaged. Therefore, I hope that when Tuesday night comes, that we will all have a feeling of satisfaction, of having done the best job we could, and of having an opportunity in the future to do an even better one.

I come here to Queens and ask your help. This is a district which has been hotly contested in previous presidential elections. It can make a great possible difference in carrying the State of New York. New York is essential for the success of any President, 45 electoral votes. There is no other State to compete with.

And I think in the last week we have had a good chance to assay the good judgment of the two candidates, how they approach this campaign, what their reaction has been to it, how they responded to the pressure which goes with a presidential campaign. We have discussed the issues. We are going to continue to do so. And I believe that on Tuesday night, a majority of the people of this country will decide the same way that we decide, and that is that this country, if it is going to move ahead, if it is going to maintain the peace, if it is going to be strong and respected abroad, it will be because we are strong and vital and secure here at home."", ""I believe the Democratic Party can do the job best, and I come and ask your help in doing it.

He was the President of the United States."", 'And if I am successful on Tuesday, it is my intention to be, in the fullest measure of the word and office, the next President of the United States - and I shall, without hesitation or reservation take a solemn oath on the 20th of January 1961 to ""solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution * * * So help me God.""']"
444,John F. Kennedy ,"November 06, 1960","[""Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, your next Congressman from this district, Otis Pike, ladies and gentlemen, I come to this county which is not celebrated as one of the strongest Democratic counties north of the Mason-Dixon line and ask your support on November 8. [Applause.] I don't know one reason why the people of this county, this county of Suffolk in the State of New York, should not be as concerned as the citizens of any other county, of any other State, with the progress of their Nation. That is the issue in this campaign. [Applause.] As citizens of this county, you have to make your own responsible judgments on November 8 about what the best thing is for our country, about what we must do, and you have to analyze what Mr. Nixon and I stand for and what our parties stand for."", 'Now, what does Mr. Nixon stand for in this campaign? [Response from the audience.] What great issue, what great stream of history, has he associated himself with in the changing years of the 1960\'s? I picked up the newspaper 1 hour ago, flying from Connecticut to Long Island, and the paper says, ""Nixon says America is the strongest nation in the world."" The point of the matter is that isn\'t what is important. The question is, Is the balance of power in the world moving in our direction or that of the Communists?', 'Of course we are first now. We were more than first 5 years ago. There was not even a challenge 10 years ago. The question is, Is our rate of increase, is the rate of increase in our strength sufficient to insure that we shall be first in 1965 and 1970? That is the only question in the 1960 campaign. [Applause.]', ""I have read Mr. Nixon's speeches in this campaign with some interest, and after the personal abuse is separated from the rest of it, it is a continuation of what we now have, and in my judgment, and I state it as a responsible citizen of this country, what we now have is not good enough. [Applause.]"", ""In Mr. Nixon's immediate circle of advisers is Mr. Rogers, the present Attorney General, Mr. Scribner of the Treasury Department, Mr. Seaton of the Interior Department. What possible indication is there in either the personnel or in the speeches that there is going to be a new movement forward in the United States if Mr. Nixon is elected? I want to make it very clear, because my responsibility finishes on Tuesday, November 8, and yours begins. I warn you that the present rate of economic growth, the present rise in the power and prestige of the United States, is not enough, is not good enough. It does not give me any cause for pleasure. I don't enjoy saying the United States is not as strong and powerful and influential as it must be. But it is my responsibility to say it, and I am going to continue to say it until Tuesday, and then you have to make a judgment of what you think. [Applause.]"", 'For a candidate for the Presidency, for a Vice President who is privy to all the information which this administration possesses about our real position in the world, about the rate of economic growth, about the hazards and the opportunities that face us in 1961, for that candidate to run on a program of constant reassurance, with no indication of urgency, in my judgment does not meet his responsibilities as the candidate of a responsible party. I want to make it clear that we are responsible, and we are telling it as we see it. And you have to decide what you want. [Applause.]', ""We have to make a judgment on Tuesday with some perspective. You sit here in November 1960, but you have to make a judgment of the future. What is the world going to look like in 1965? What is it going to look like in 1968 and 1970? Are you satisfied, based on your observation [response from the audience] of the past 8 years? Are you satisfied that by 1964 or 1965, if we continue to drift, that there won't be other Castros in Latin America, that there won't be other Congos in Africa, and there won't be other Chinese in Asia? [Response from the audience.]"", 'This country is the only hope of freedom. If we are not willing to look life in the eye, if we are not willing to measure our needs against our performance, then of course we will follow the fate which other free people have followed in the last 2,000 years when they come face to face with hard tests. I want to be sure that we meet that test. But I want to be sure that we meet it by recognizing it, by being willing to meet our responsibilities as citizens of this country. And I do not believe that any candidate for office who runs in 1960 on a constant program of reassurance, of pallid promises, of vague charges and innuendoes and personal abuse is meeting his responsibilities to the great Republic. [Applause.]', 'This country is a growing country. By 1965 and 1970 it will steadily be increasing, and the property tax in Suffolk County will be overwhelming, if the last 10 years gives us any indication of the future. And one of the ways where I believe this county, this State, and the National Government, can play a cooperative role is in Federal aid to education. [Applause.] Colleges and universities and schools are the basic strength of this society. The kind of jobs that your children will get in the next 10 years will depend in great measure as industry and technology changes - will depend in great measure on the kind of education that you give them, and as an American I am not satisfied when 150,000 men and women who graduate in the top 10 in our high schools in the United States do not go to college because they cannot afford it. [Applause.] It costs today, and I say this to you who have children, it costs today $10,000 for a 4-year college education, a rise of $4,000 in the last 2 years. By 1970 it will cost $15,000 for a college education for your children. That will mean, unless we do something about it, that many of your sons and daughters will never see the inside of a college. Our college population is expanding at a fantastic rate. In 1946, only 22 percent of the men and women between 16 and 21 were enrolled in our colleges. Last year, 36 percent, and by 1970, it is estimated that our colleges will have 7 million students. In order to equip them, in order to make it possible for them to go to college, we will have to build in this country twice as many colleges and dormitories as we now have standing in the United States in the next 10 years.', ""This is one of our responsibilities as citizens. And I want to make it very clear that one of my basic disagreements with the Republican Party has been twofold. First, Mr. Nixon's tie-breaking vote against aid to the teacher's salaries, and, secondly, the President of the United States veto of a housing bill which includes loans to colleges for dormitories and classrooms. That is the kind of leadership the Republican Party gives. [Response from the audience and applause.] Therefore, I suggest these three steps."", 'First, that we provide 15,000 to 25,000 national scholarships for our brightest and most talented boys and girls, who will return that investment many times over in their useful life to our country. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, I suggest that the Federal Government and the State government cooperate to provide a loan program for students who may not be advanced enough to secure scholarships, whose parents may not have enough money to send them to college, but who, if they could borrow the money, to be paid back after graduation, might be able to get an education, and make something of themselves in their lives. [Applause.]', 'The Federal Government guarantees loans on your homes, guarantees your bank deposits. I believe it can guarantee loans to students in order to use their talents effectively for themselves and for our country. [Applause.]', ""This campaign has 2 more days. I come to Suffolk County and ask your help in it. My wife grew up in this county, not that that is any reason to vote for me, but at least it is a reason, I think, and I am particularly anxious to be here today. This county is a suburban county. It is a swing county. The kind of support that we get in this county will tell whether we will carry the State of New York or not. And if we don't carry the State of New York, there is no chance of securing a majority in the electoral college. If we can do well in this county, and I ask your help in doing well, if we can do well in this county [applause] we are going to put this speech to music and make a fortune out of it. [Laughter.] Let me just say the three things that we stand for in making up your judgment:"", 'One, I am concerned, and if elected President will take action to stimulate the economic growth of the United States in order to find jobs for our people and resources for national action.', 'Two, I do not believe that this administration has attracted to Washington men and women of sufficient intellectual curiosity, foresight, vitality, and energy and we will send the best talent we can get to represent us around tAe world. [Applause.]', 'Three, I believe if the United States is going to speak with vigor and strength abroad, it must not only carry on the struggle against the Communists, but it must also identify itself with the people around the globe against poverty, misery, disease, and ignorance. I mentioned last night on TV two villages in Brazil where the health standards were so bad that not one baby lived beyond the first year. And the Communists are working in those areas night and day, and so is Castro. Which side will they choose? The United States, which has been indifferent to their problem? Or will they decide to move to the Communists who raise a banner and identify themselves with them? We are going to have to do much better, and I believe, with a new Democratic administration, committed to progress, committed to justice for our people committed to the development of their talents, regardless of their race or their creed or their color, we can demonstrate that we are a strong and vital and progressive society. And we shall show the people in the world to the south of us that we do care, that freedom is the road for them, because what we do they can do, what we do they will do, what we must do they must do. That is our opportunity on Tuesday. [Applause.] I am confident that on Tuesday, November 8, the American people will not take the old, tired, wornout road, but instead will turn and decide to move forward into the wind, and demonstrate what this country can really do. I ask your help on Tuesday. I ask your help in the days after in building this country strong. [Applause.]']"
445,John F. Kennedy ,"November 06, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Governor Ribicoff Mayor Tedesco, Senator Dodd [response from the audience] thank you. First of all, Mayor Mulvihill, I want to present to you your Congressman, who I am sure you are going to reelect by a great margin, Congressman Irwin, who has begun a great job in the Congress. [Applause.] We need all the talent we can get in Washington, and he is one of the talented, progressive Members of the Congress, and I am sure you are going to send him back. And Frank Kowalski, who runs at large in the State of Connecticut, Congressman at Large. [Applause.] I want to express my appreciation to all of you for coming out. Governor Ribicoff and the delegation from this State in 1956 supported my nomination for the Vice Presidency. In fact Governor Ribicoff nominated me. He is also the first public official that ever supported me for the Presidency, away back 4 years ago, and therefore [applause] I come here to Connecticut to express my thanks, and also to ask you for your support on Tuesday, November 8, for the office of the Presidency. [Applause.]', 'The Presidency and the President has many functions and many responsibilities, many given to him by the Constitution, and others suggested to him by the pressure of events. But among the functions he has is to symbolize the national mood, and I believe the people of this country on November 8 must make a decision about what their national mood is. Is your national mood to sit down and rest in the sun? [Response from the audience.] Or is it to pick ourselves up and move this country forward? [Response from the audience.]', 'Mr. Nixon has chosen, by his career, by the party that he leads, and by his speeches [response from the audience] by his speeches in this campaign, he has chosen to emphasize all of what is bright, all that is shiny in American life. I have chosen to emphasize not what is easy about life here but what we must do as citizens of this country if we are going to maintain our security, if we are going to maintain our obligations to ourselves, and to those who look to us. It is the function of a public official and a candidate for office not merely to go to the people and give them reassurance. It is the function and responsibility of a political candidate for a national office in a free society and it has been since the time of ancient Athens, to tell the truth. [Applause.] The more I see of this administration, the more I see of this campaign, the more important I think it is that we are successful on Tuesday. [Applause.]', 'What good is it for a candidate for the Presidency to travel around the United States and the world saying that I am downgrading America, that the prestige has never been higher, when his own State Department has polls which inform him differently? What good is it? [Response from the audience.] What good is it for an administration to release preliminary figures on employment in those years when it will help them politically, and then when they are in danger and when the figures show something different, they delay them until after election? Who do they think they fool in this country? [Response from the audience.] And how can a society which depends upon the consent of a majority of the governed, how can such a society function and meet its responsibilities unless the truth is told? And the truth will make us free. [Applause.]', ""The fact of the matter is that Mr. Nixon leads a party which has opposed progress for 25 years, and he is a representative of it. He leads a party which in 1935 voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage, and he leads a party which voted 90 percent in 1960 against $1.25 an hour minimum wage. [Response from the audience.] He leads a party which in the 1930's voted 90 percent against the Social Security Act. [Response from the audience.] And he leads a party which voted 99 percent against the medical care for the aged tied to social security in 1960. [Response from the audience.]"", 'The elephant never forgets but he never learns. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon has chosen this week, and I read his headlines, and in between calling me an economic ignoramus, a liar, and a Pied Piper, he has also said we are going to have a depression, inflation, and all the rest. I would like to point out to you the clever fiscal management that this administration has demonstrated.', 'With a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958, the largest peacetime deficit in the history of the United States, $12 billion in 1958, a $4 billion less in revenue this year than they estimated 4 months ago, a $1 billion loss of gold in the last 3 months. We have $18 billion in this country. We have lost nearly $6 to $8 billion in the last 10 years, and we have lost $1 billion in 3 months. And Mr. Nixon says that I am responsible for speculation on the gold market. [Response from the audience.]', 'The only thing I am responsible for is moving him out of office on Tuesday, November 8. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon goes to Michigan and he says that those who talk about an economic slowdown misinform the people; we have never built as many cars in our history, he says in September and October, and he neglects to point out we have never had so many unsold cars in our history in September, October, and November. [Applause.]', 'The choice for you is clear. The choice is between those who sit still and look to the past, and between those who look to the future, between those who recognize that in this deadly age, when we are involved in a close and narrow competition for survival, for the maintenance of freedom around the globe, with our adversaries, the Communists, the best that this country can do is none too good. Therefore, I come here today and ask your help in moving this country forward again. [Applause.]', 'This is an important election. The office of the Presidency is key. The Presidency is the most important office, not only in the United States, but in the free world, and I cannot believe that in 1960 we are going to select as President of the United States a man who is described by his close friend, Governor Rockefeller, as a question mark. We are going, instead, to affirm our conviction that this country has a role to fulfill in the world, and it cannot meet its responsibilities to freedom around the world unless it is meeting its responsibilities to its own citizens here in the United States.

This is the last speech that I make outside of New England, and I come here tonight to a great Democratic city and county and ask your support on Tuesday. [Applause.] This campaign has taken us to all sections of the United States, to every State, over a period of many months, and in the next 30 hours this campaign will come to a close, and then the people of the United States must make their decision. I believe that the people of the United States face two very distinct choices, between a party and a candidate who have opposed progress throughout their respective careers, and a party and a candidate who have supported progress throughout their respective careers.', 'I believe in 1960 that this country needs a Democratic administration. [Applause.] That this country needs the kind of talented men and women to serve in all there is of our National Government, to represent us across the world, to speak with vigor and force. I come from a party and I stand proudly as its candidate, who initiated all the great pieces of social legislation, which means so much in the lives of our citizens, and Mr. Nixon comes from a party, and he is identified with it [response from the audience], that bears the dubious distinction of having opposed every single one of these pieces of social legislation.', 'I asked a month ago in Cleveland if someone could tell me one progressive thing that the Republican Party had stood for or done this century, and when nobody answered, I was criticized the next day by the paper, a Republican paper, who said that I had ignored the accomplishments of President Taft in the field of child labor in 1904. [Response from the audience.]', 'All right, what have they done since 1904, I asked them, and what have they done since 1932? [Response from the audience.] Or what have they done since 1953? [Response from the audience.] I must say, you must have been here for a while practicing. [Laughter.] How did you know I was going to ask that question? [Laughter.] In any case, you have been here, I understand, for about 2 or 3 or 4 hours. [Response from the audience.] Six hours. I want you all to keep your health, because we need you on Tuesday. [Laughter.]', 'This campaign is vitally important to the State of New Jersey, the State of New Jersey is vitally important to the country. This county may well determine what the State of New Jersey does, and the 14 electoral votes [response from the audience] - 16 electoral votes of New Jersey - this is the only audience that knows how many electoral votes they have. [Laughter and applause.] This must be a very politically active city. Is it? [Response from the audience.] There is a rumor to that effect. So it is 16 votes. That is even better. Those 16 votes may well determine who will be the next President of the United States. [Applause.] And the next President of the United States may well determine, not only the great issues of war and peace, but may also determine what kind of a country we have, which direction we are going, what kind of economy we have, what kind of employment security you have, what assurances you have on the education of your children, that they can get to change, that in your old age or your family\'s old age, there will be medical care tied to social security - all these are matters that come across the desk of the President of the United States. President Truman used to have a sign which says, ""The Buck Stops Here."" Sooner or later, every problem which faces us as a people comes before the President of the United States, and on that basis, and recognizing full well the high responsibilities and burdens of that office which are greater now than they have ever been in the past, I still come here and ask your support in order to win that position, not because [applause] - not just because I think it is a major mistake to elect Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party in 1960 [response from the audience] but also because I believe the Presidency is the key office, not only in this country, but in the whole free world, and I believe the next President of the United States has to be, by conviction and not merely by electioneering commitments, has to be committed to progress, which Mr. Nixon in his career has not been. [Applause.]', 'We stand together in this fight. This is a fight that can be won. It can be won in this State, and I come here in the dying days of this campaign, as we leave now for Lewiston, Maine, and Providence, R.I., tonight, I come here to this county and ask you to help us on Tuesday by turning out the largest Democratic majority that this county has turned out for 20 years. [Applause.] We shall not slumber and we shall keep working for the next 36 hours, until we know what decision the people of this country are going to make. Thank you. [Applause.]', 'Let me just say, win or lose, good or bad, up or down, fair wind or bad, I believe that the United States has benefited by this campaign. I believe that Mr. Nixon and the Republican Party have learned a lesson, that in a dangerous and trying time in the life of this country there is no substitute for action. We cannot drift or sleep or lie at anchor. This country is about to begin another great march forward, and in the lead will be the county of Hudson and the city of Jersey. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I am sorry we were late. We were not playing golf. We have been out carrying the message. [Applause.] And I am grateful to all of you, more than I can say, for having been willing to stay here. Ed Muskie's voice is just about gone, but we stay here because we believe it important for Maine and the country on Tuesday, November 8, that a Democratic President and Vice President be elected to lead this country. [Applause.] Maine and the country have a very clear choice on Tuesday. You have to decide between a candidate and his party who opposes progress, a candidate and his party who have opposed those measures which make it possible for us to maintain the employment of our people in Maine and across the country. [Applause.] Mr. Nixon believes that the program which we have recommended, of medical care for the aged tied to social security, is extreme. He believes, and has said so, that $1.25 an hour minimum wage is extreme. [Response from the audience.] He is part of an administration whose administration has seen a recession in 1954, a recession in 1958 and again in 1960, the beginning of a slowdown in our economy."", 'Maine has a chance, and so does the country, to choose progress. I have been all over this State, and I represented Massachusetts, which shares all of the problems that Maine has, for the last 14 years in the Congress. The needs of Maine and the needs of Massachusetts are very much the same, and the needs of the United States are very much the same. We need employment in our textile mills. We need development of our natural resources. We need to provide education for our children, jobs for our people, medical care for our aged tied to social security. We need to do all these things in a country and in a society that is on the move. If we are going to be strong abroad if we are going to win the peace, if we are going to maintain our prestige, it will be not only by speeches and debates and good will missions; it will be by building in this country a strong and vital and progressive society, committed to finishing the unfinished business, building here the kind of country which will serve as an example to freedom all around the globe. Mr. Nixon has stated if he is elected President [response from the audience] - he has stated if he is elected President that he will go to Eastern Europe. I want to make it clear that if I am elected President of the United States, I will go to Washington, D.C., and begin to work. [Applause.]', 'This is where the job must first be done. If we are going to negotiate with Khrushchev, if we are going to help freedom around the globe, we first have to build our strength here in the United States.

[Applause.]', 'We are engaged in a close and hard-fought campaign. This State, it is not easy. Everybody who votes, every bit of support we can get will be most helpful. We are running as the candidates who believe in progress for our country. Mr. Nixon is running as part of a team - [response from the audience]. You have seen these elephants in the circus [laughter] - and as they move around that circus ring, the only way they can get around is to grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. [Applause.] Well, there is no elephant in front of Mr. Nixon this year. He is running, and you have to decide, as citizens of this State and citizens of this country, you have to decide what your view is of Maine and the country, what you think ought to happen, whether you are satisfied with things as they are [response from the audience], whether you believe that things are being done in their own good measure, whether you are satisfied with our economic growth at home, whether you believe our prestige in the world is rising [response from the audience]. If you are satisfied, if you are comfortable, Mr. Nixon is your man. [Response from the audience.] Not really.', ""But if you hold my view that the United States as the great defender of freedom in the 1960's has to move ahead, has to provide opportunity for its people, has to develop in this country a strong and vigorous society which it cannot possibly do under the administration of a candidate who reassures and comforts the people in a time of hazard and a time of peril, I believe this country has a great destiny in the sixties. I don't know any assignment it cannot meet, any responsibility it cannot bear. But it has to first recognize that it needs to move forward, that it needs action, that it needs direction, that it needs to finish the things that are still unfinished. I come to Maine and ask your help in doing that. I ask you to join us.

And I believe that there is a very clear voice, a very sharp difference, between the views taken by Mr. Nixon and myself. [Applause.]"", 'In this time of danger and hazard, Mr. Nixon has chosen to go to the country arguing that our country has never been better, that our prosperity has never been greater, and that our prestige in the world has never been higher. [ Response from the audience.] I do not recall any candidate for office whose speeches have shown less reaction to the actual facts since Stanley Baldwin ran in 1935 in England. [Applause.]', ""I made three points in September. First, that this country's economy was not moving ahead at a rate which would maintain full employment and permit us to meet our national commitments at home and abroad. Secondly, that the prestige of the United States had dropped in recent months, and thirdly, that unless we made a greater effort, there was a danger in the early years of the 1960's that there would be a military gap between the Western world and the Communist world, which would serve the advantages of Communist foreign policy. Those three points. Mr. Nixon denied all of them, and now, in the last 2 months, in the last 2 weeks, one, we are, according to the figures released yesterday, we have more unemployment than we had in the recession at this time since 1958; two, we are going to have more cars unsold by the middle of November, 1 million of them, 1 million unsold cars, the largest inventory in the history of the United States. Three, we have lost since June $1 billion of the $18 billion that backs our currency which has moved abroad; four, in the last 2 months, the administration's figures on the amount of income that would be received from tax purposes from our economy has dropped between $3 and $4 billion. I don't think there is any doubt Mr. Nixon has been proven wrong about our unexampled prosperity in 1960. [Applause.]"", 'The second point that I made in easy September was that the prestige of the United States had dropped in the world. Mr. Nixon said it was at the highest in our history, and he pointed to the votes at the United Nations as evidence. One, since that time, polls which must have been available to him when he made that statement demonstrate very clearly that in 9 out of 10 countries sampled this summer, a majority of the people believe that the Soviet Union is ahead of us now in science, and believe by 1970 the Soviet Union will be ahead of us not only in science but in military power and in the rate of economic growth. And how many countries will follow a leader who is not able to maintain the lead? [Applause.] The Bible tells us. ""Who prepares for battle when the bugle blows an uncertain sound?""', 'So No.2, Mr. Nixon said that the votes in the United Nations indicated how high our prestige is. The next day, on the question of the admission of Red China, of the 16 new nations admitted to the United Nations this summer, not one country voted with us. We brought more students from abroad 10 years ago than we do today to study under the Federal program. The second point, therefore, on our prestige, the facts have proven Mr. Nixon wrong.', ""The third, that a military gap may open between the free world and the Communist world, in this morning's New York Times a study by the Rand Corp. indicated their judgment that at the present rates of military increase in power, by 1970 the Soviet Union would be ahead of us."", 'You have to decide on Tuesday yourselves which candidate, which party, which philosophy, which judgment. [Response from the audience.] Now can Mr. Nixon create an urgency in January and February and March of 1961 to try to persuade the Congress to act on those pieces of business which require national action and national commitments. How can he persuade a Democratic Congress that it is now time for us to move forward, when his entire campaign has been based on the other fact, that everything is being done in its own good time. I have done the best I could. Our position is quite clear. In my judgment, future events will clearly bear out the position which the Democratic Party in this campaign has taken. You have to decide yourselves on Tuesday what your judgment is of our present, what your judgment is of your responsibilities as citizens of the United States. And I believe on Tuesday the people of this country are going to choose to go forward. They are tired of sitting still, and in my judgment I do not recall in 25 years when the Republican Party has ever been willing to move this country ahead on any great national program. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon campaigns on the program that party labels don\'t mean very much, that it is just the man. I say it is the man the party nominates. The record is there. Both of our parties are like great rivers, moving back into history, with different direction, different force, different power. The way they are flowing, what they have done in the course of their run, I believe indicates very clearly what they will do in the future. In this century, I stand in succession to three distinguished Democratic Presidents, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Harry Truman. [Applause.] And in every case, their domestic programs had their counterpart in their success in their foreign policy. The 14 points of Woodrow Wilson was the international counterpart of the new freedom. The four freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt and the United Nations had their domestic counterpart in the New Deal, and the Marshall plan, NATO, point 4, and technical assistance all were the companion piece to the efforts Mr. Truman made here in the United States to move us ahead. Mr. Nixon stands in succession to certain Republican Presidents - Mr. McKinley, ""Stand Pat with McKinley,"" ""Return to Normalcy With Harding,"" ""Keep Cool With Coolidge,"" ""Two Chickens in Every Pot With Herbert Hoover."" [Laughter.] These are the great rallying cries of the Republican Party in the 20th century. [Applause.] ""Repeal Social Security With Alf Landon,"" ""Had Enough?"" with Tom Dewey, and ""You\'ve Never Had It So Good,"" with Dick Nixon. [Response from the audience.]', ""I think these slogans tell us something and so do the candidates and so do the records of the party, and I believe in the 1960's, when the great question before us, and not the usual ones, but our ability to maintain a national and international competition, with a monolithic power which is able to mobilize all of the resources of the state, both human and material, for the service of the state - we cannot possibly afford to drift or lie at anchor, or rest. This has to be a time for action for us. The last 8 years - we do not need the perspective of history to tell us that the relative rate of increase in drive, power, expansion, prestige, scientific and economic development, the relative rate of increase of the Communist world has been at the expense of the free world. I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in World War II to maintain our freedom, is prepared to build this country as an example of what freedom can do in the 1960's. [Applause.] This is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, and in my judgment, on Tuesday, the people of the United States are going to give us an opportunity to pick this country up and move it forward. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"
449,John F. Kennedy ,"November 06, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Distinguished guests, Mr. Ed Mills, Governor Meyner, Thorn Lord, who I hope will be the next representative from the State of New Jersey, who will be a good and responsible and progressive one [applause], my colleagues in Congress with whom I have served for nearly 14 years. Pete Rodino [applause], that aging fullback from Brown, Hugh Addonizio [applause], both men have stood for the interests of the people of their districts and the people of the United States, and I know you are going to return them by overwhelming odds. [Applause.] And we have a chance to elect a Democratic Congressman, and they are very important. Any one of you who followed the session in August knows that we lost vote after vote and we have in the past by 10 or 12 votes in the House of Representatives, minimum wage, the labor bill, all the rest. We need about 10 new Democratic Congressmen, and one of them can be Bob Peacock from the State of New Jersey. [Applause.]', ""Mayor Carlin - and now I want to say a word for Kennedy. I want you to get out there and show [applause] - if there is any group in the United States that should know the importance of this election, it is the men and women who are here today. It is your people - it is your people. [Applause.] It is your people who are thrown out of work when there is a recession. It is your people who retire without medical care when they are older. It is your children and the children of your people who do not get to college if we don't pass a loan program or if we don't build enough buildings. It is your people who are affected by the problems before this election. It is your people who are denied equal opportunity and a fair chance to develop their talents. You know the issues of this campaign. You have lived with them for 25 years, and you know how important it is, with a Democratic House coming up, a Democratic Senate coming up, you know how important it is that we have a President of the United States who believes in progress. [Applause.]"", ""I don't care what promises, commitments, position papers or speeches the Vice President of the United States makes in this campaign. His record is written on the statute books of this country. [Response from the audience.] I have served in the Congress from the day that he came there, and I know that record pretty well. He makes a speech in New York three weeks ago saying that he believes in a progressive housing bill, and in the course of that position paper states the Housing Act of 1949 works well. He forgets that I remember that he voted against it. [Applause.]"", 'When he talks, though he has not been talking much this way since his trip to South Carolina, when he talks about civil rights and about equality of opportunity for all Americans, and how he fought for it in the Government Contracts Committee, I happen to remember seven times in the House of Representatives in the late forties he voted against the Fair Employment Practices Commission that came to the floor of the Congress, that your Congressman voted for. [Applause.]', 'I do not believe in leap year progressivism, every 4 years at election time. I believe that day in and day out the record is written, and Mr. Nixon leads a political party that in the midthirties voted 95 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage, and he leads that same party that in August of this year voted 90 percent in the House of Representatives against $1.25 minimum wage. [Applause.]', ""Now let me make it clear: You, Addonizio, and Pete Rodino and the others would agree, a House and Senate which is Democratic does not provide any assurance at all, any action on any legislation, unless you have a President working with that House and Senate all the time. [Applause.] Twice we passed an area-depressed bill; twice the President vetoed it. Both parties have been promising aid to education for 8 years, and it has not been done. If I ever saw assurance for inaction at the time when action is essential in this country's history, it is to divide the responsibility of our National Government."", ""I come here today and ask your support. [Applause.] That isn't enough. This is a close election. It will be decided by 1 or 2 percent very probably in most of the major States. Now, when Mr. Gallup took his poll a week or 10 days ago among all those who answered he gave the Democrats 49 to 45, and then he threw out, scientifically threw out that 4 percent who he predicted would not vote, based on previous history, their economic condition, and all the rest. Do you know what the final figures then were? 49-49. Do you know what the 4 percent came out of? Us, out of the Democratic Party. Can you tell me, any one of you, that we can throw away 4 percent of the vote in New Jersey and still carry it? [Response from the audience.] We can't. We have to go get that 4 percent this year. We have to encourage them to vote. We have to go and do the work which is necessary on Tuesday. This State will be won or lost by a narrow margin and so will the country, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois; Ohio, Connecticut, Massachusetts - in Massachusetts we might do better than that, but in the other States [laughter] if we don't, we might as well stay home. [Laughter.]"", ""But 4 percent, four out of every hundred, they are people that you are in touch with, they are people that the members of your union are in touch with. We have to get them out to vote. There is not 1 day's work that you will do, whether you are a citizen or whatever you may be in your occupation, that will have as much importance on your life as the selection of a President of the United States in the next 4 years. On his judgment, on his foresight, on his sense of responsibility, on his vigor, on his willingness to work with the Congress, depends in great measure the welfare of this country, its progress, the welfare of its citizens. It may be a hard, cold winter in 1961. Those of you who work in the UAW know that we are building more cars than we have built for 5 or 6 years and we are not selling them, and we are going to have a million unsold cars by the middle of November at the present rate, and then they will begin to lay off when the election is over. Steel is 55 percent, houses are down 30 percent, budget estimates down $4 billion, $1 billion of gold flowed out of the country since June. We have a lot of problems coming across the horizon and they are bigger than a man's hand."", 'Tuesday is one day where you can do something about it, and I come here tonight and ask not just for your support, but I ask you to help us move New Jersey and the United States forward again.

[Applause.]', 'I want to express my regrets at having been late. We have not been playing golf. We have been campaigning. [Applause.] We have been campaigning in Connecticut and New York, and after we leave New Jersey tonight we go to Maine and Rhode Island. We are going to carry the New England States and New York. I come here to New Jersey tonight to ask your help, not only for my own candidacy, and that of Senator Johnson, but because I believe the positions we have taken in this campaign as they affect the security of the United States are in the interests of the United States and this country needs a Democratic victory. [Applause.]', 'Every assumption upon which Mr. Nixon has based his campaign, away back in August, every assumption has begun to crumble. First that this country was enjoying unequaled prosperity. Already that is beginning to have a hollow sound, in Pittston, Pa., along the Ohio River, in southern Illinois, in West Virginia and Kentucky, where we have more people unemployed this month than we had since the October recession of 1958. I cannot - this is the only group in the United States that ever got photographers to do anything they were not ready to do, so we congratulate you. It shows New Jersey is going to go Democratic on Tuesday. [Applause.]', ""Let me say Mr. Nixon based his campaign on three points: First, that this country's economy was never so good; secondly, that our prestige in the world was never higher; third, that the balance of power in the world was moving in the direction of freedom."", ""Now, it has not been 2 months, not 2 years, it hasn't been 2 months, and already every one of those assumptions is beginning to look hollow and will look far worse next January. We are going to have more unsold cars in the middle of November than we have had in our history, l million unsold cars at the beginning of a new season. We are using our steel capacity 55 percent. In the month of September we build 30 percent less homes than a year ago. By January or February this country could be face to face with serious economic difficulties, particularly if led by an administration which 2 months ago said we had the greatest prosperity in our history. [Applause.]"", 'It took 2 or 3 years for some of the predictions which Governor Stevenson made in the 1956 campaign to come true. It is taking 2 months to prove that the assumptions and prophecies of Richard Nixon already are untrue. [Applause.]', 'Second, Mr. Nixon stated that our prestige was never higher, even though he must have known his own information service of the State Department had taken surveys in 10 countries around the world this summer, and these surveys show convincingly that in 9 of 10 countries a majority of the people believe the Soviet Union is ahead of us militarily and scientifically, and will surely be by 1970. He pointed to the votes in the United Nations as evidence of our high prestige and the next day on the admission of Red China not a single new African nation voted with us.', ""Third, Mr. Nixon has said in today's paper that we are the most powerful nation in the world. He does not point out that a study by the Rand Corp. for Johns Hopkins in this morning's New Times pointed out that at the present rate of military power increase by 1970 the United States will be inferior to the Soviet Union."", ""What does this country need to know about a candidate? If he misled the people in this campaign on three matters essential to our survival, does he indicate he is ready to lead the United States in the 1960's? I do not think so. [Response from the audience.]"", ""This country cannot survive unless the political leaders, those who seek positions of responsibility, are willing to tell the people the truth, and you cannot hide the truth in all the department agencies in Washington. The people of this country know what the facts are. And that is why I believe on Tuesday, November 8, they will not choose to place the affairs of this country in the bands of a candidate like Mr. Nixon, in the hands of a political party like the Republicans, who have opposed progress for 25 years. [Applause.] If Mr. Nixon were successful Tuesday, and he has to deal, as he will have to deal, with a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate, how can he suddenly turn around 180 degrees and ask this country to do the very things that he now says are unnecessary? I predict that the United States will make a decision on Tuesday, and that decision will affect its future and its security throughout the entire 1960's. This country is either going to choose to accept the viewpoint that we have put forward, that it is time we started moving again, that it is time we made a greater national and international effort, or it will accept the view of Mr. Nixon and will rest on its oars, and will drift and will lie at anchor and will pay the price. [Applause.]"", 'I ask your support not merely for my candidacy or that of my colleagues, but I ask your support in choosing right for this country, in moving this country forward, in picking it up and sending it into the sixties to meet its responsibilities. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Nixon represents a party which has opposed progress - for many years. He represents a party which voted 90 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage in the midthirties, and voted 90 percent against $1.25 minimum wage in 1960. He represents a party which has opposed the strengthening of our educational system, which has opposed medical care for our older citizens tied to social security, which has brought recession in 1954, again in 1958, and has brought us to an economic slowdown in the vital year of 1960. Since June the United States has lost $1 billion worth of gold, $1 billion. Since June we have cut our estimated tax revenues this year $4 billion. That is the kind of economy this administration runs. That is the kind of a country that this administration now seeks to have its record endorsed from. If this is the experience upon which Mr. Nixon runs, I want no part of it.', 'The decision is yours. You have to decide what you want, what you believe, what your view is. My judgment is clear. After 14 years in the Congress my judgment is that this country, if it is going to maintain its security, if it is going to meet its commitments to freedom, is going to have to do better in the sixties. You have to decide what is your view, what is your view of your responsibilities as citizens of this country. I ask your help in New Jersey. Let us make this State Democratic and let us make the United States Democratic.

You have seen these elephants in the circus, with their heads full of ivory, thick skins, no vision, long memory, and to move around the circus, they grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. And that is what Mr. Nixon is now doing with President Eisenhower. [Applause.] That was all right in 1952, he was led around the ring, and in 1956, but this year he is running, and he has no elephant out in front of him this year.', 'I come here tonight and ask you to join us, ask you to make a decision which will permit this country to have the kind of leadership which will enable us to build a strong and vital society, a society which will serve as an inspiration to people all over the globe.

[Response from the audience.] I run as a candidate for the Presidency with a view that this is a great country, but it must be greater.

If we fail here, if we drift, if we lie at anchor, if we don\'t provide an example of what freedom can do in the 1960\'s, then we have betrayed not only ourselves and our destiny, but all those who desire to be free and are not free.

452,John F. Kennedy ,"November 06, 1960","['We pledge ourselves to seek a system of higher education where every young American can be educated, not according to his race or his means, but according to his capacity.', 'Never in the life of this country has the pursuit of that goal been more important or more urgent. For our universities have become the research and training centers on which American defense and industry and agriculture and the professions depend. Our progress in all these fields depends upon a constant flow of high-caliber and skilled manpower, upon new ideas and creative applications of old ideas, upon the acquisition of skills and the ability to apply those skills. Thus, today, the university is, in the words of Woodrow Wilson, ""the root of our intellectual life as a nation.""', 'And our universities are not only essential to a strong society here at home, they are vital to the cause of freedom throughout the world.', 'Our universities are our hope for success in the intense and serious competition for supremacy in ideas, in military technology, in space, in science, and all the rest in which we are now engaged with the Soviet Union. Other nations will look to us for leadership; our prestige will rise only if we are a vital and progressing society. And, today, the basis of vitality and progress is the trained capacity of the human mind.', 'Our universities must train men and women who can bring the benefits of modern technology to the developing nations of the world, who can help create the framework of economic advance on which freedom in these lands depends.', 'And our universities must serve as centers in which the youth of other lands can acquire the knowledge to run the factories, teach in the schools, and staff the governments of their own countries.', 'But American universities are more than a source of strength, here and abroad, they are the great catalyst of the democratic way of life. Through the gateway of a university education young men and women of all backgrounds, of all races and religions, of every economic group, can find opportunity - opportunity to develop their own capacities, and opportunity to find a fruitful and satisfying outlet for their skills and interests.', 'And that is why we intend to work until a college education is available to every young man and woman with the talent to pursue it.', 'But today the doors of our colleges are closed to some of our most talented youths. It has been estimated that each year 150,000 men and women in the top 10 percent of their class do not go to college simply because they cannot afford it. And, in the sixties, as the cost of running our universities increases, the cost of going to college will also increase. Today it costs approximately $10,000 for 4 years of college, a rise of $4,000 in the past 2 years, but by 1970 it will cost $15,000 for a college education. And this added expense will mean that many more able young men and women will lack the means to attend college.', 'And as the burden on the students increases, so will the burden on the universities themselves. Our college population has expanded at a fantastic rate. In 1946, only 22.1 percent of all Americans between 18 and 21 were enrolled in institutions of higher education. Last year 36.2 percent or 3,400,000 young Americans were in college. And by 1970 it is estimated that college enrollment will double to almost 7 million students.', 'If they are to meet this vast increase in students, our universities will have to spend $6 to $7 billion a year more than the $4 billion they are now spending. They will have to construct more buildings in the next 10 years than all the college buildings which have been constructed since 1760. They will have to recruit and pay 300,000 more teachers. And they will have to raise the pay of teachers they now have. Today the standard of living of the average college teacher is about the same as it was a generation ago, while the standard of living of the average worker has gone up 75 percent.', 'Unless the college teacher is guaranteed a decent way of life, it will be impossible to attract or retain able men to teach our youth.', 'Private contributions and the efforts of State and local governments can do much to relieve this increasing burden. But the Federal Government must also do its share. For the problem of higher education is a national problem. Upon its proper solution rests the future strength of the entire Nation. An the harsh fact of the matter is that only the Federal Government has the resources to fill the widening gap between what is needed and what State and private sources can supply. As John Adams said:', '\n  The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and must be willing to bear the expense of it.\n', 'Federal help for our colleges and universities is an historic policy of our Government. It was 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln signed the first Land Grant College Act. More recently, President Truman proposed and signed the college housing loan program under which more than a billion dollars has been loaned, without a single default, to construct 1,200 dormitories, classrooms, dining halls, and health centers. And 2 years ago, a Democratic Congress passed the National Defense Education Act which has provided loans to many needy college students.', 'But these programs are now inadequate to our growing needs. We need new policies - bold and imaginative leadership - if we are to reach our goal of a college education for all who desire and deserve it. And we will only reach this goal under a Democratic President working with a Democratic Congress.', 'For the Republican Party has opposed almost every effort to help our students and our colleges in the past 8 years. A majority of House Republicans voted against the National Defense Education Act. Only vigorous Democratic opposition saved the college housing loan program from destruction by the Republicans. Two separate housing bills providing for aid to colleges and universities were vetoed by this Republican administration. And the Republicans have killed every Democratic effort to enact a Federal scholarship program.', 'We can no longer afford to let men of little vision and little faith deprive Americans of a college education, and deprive America of the trained and skilled minds on which our strength depends. We must act - and act now.', 'First, we must provide Federal scholarships for a limited number of needy and qualified students, perhaps 15,000 - 25,000 initially.', 'Such a Federal scholarship program, paying a substantial portion of expense, would enable many thousands of bright young Americans, who now cannot afford to go to college, to pursue their education full time.', 'Second, we must increase the funds now available for loans to needy students. This can be done not only by increasing the funds available under the National Defense Education Act, but through a student loan insurance program, modeled on that now in operation in my native State of Massachusetts. Under this program, the Federal Government would guarantee loans made by colleges and universities to deserving students. Thus, schools which do not have adequate loan funds will be able to borrow these funds on the strength of the guarantee. Although initially a special fund will be required, the program will be self-financing through repayments and a small insurance premium paid by the school. All loans made under this program would be administered and controlled by the university itself.', 'Third, we must enact an adequate college housing program, a program which will provide enough help so that colleges can keep pace with increasing enrollment and which also provides for construction of technical and medical schools.']"

[Applause.]', 'I come here to Boston to this garden which is located in the 11th Congressional District of the State of Massachusetts, which my grandfather represented 60 years ago, and which I had the honor of representing 14 years ago when I was first elected to the House of Representatives. I have therefore proudly come back to this spot and ask your help tonight to be elected President of the United States. [Applause.]', ""I run for the office of the Presidency and Lyndon Johnson, my colleague and running mate for the Vice Presidency. [Applause.] We don't run as a committee. We haven't sent a rescue squad headed by a President of the United States to bail us out. [Applause.] I am not asking anybody to hand me the office. I am not running as a protégé. I am running as a Democratic candidate for the office of the Presidency. [Applause.] And I do not believe in a time of change and revolution, of hazard and opportunity, of change and progress, I do not believe the people of this State or country are going to turn over their Government to a party and a candidate who have opposed progress for the last 14 years in the Congress of the United I cannot recall a single instance where the Republican Party in the last 25 years has introduced as original legislation, sponsored, fought for it, and passed, a single piece of progressive legislation on behalf of the people. [Applause.] A month ago at Cleveland I said I could not think of anything in this century that they had done, and the next day a Republican paper corrected me and reminded me of the work that President Taft had done early in this century on child labor. I accept the correction but what have they done since then? [Applause.]"", ""This race is a contest between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who believe that we should rest and lie at anchor and drift, and between those who want to move this country forward in the 1960's. [Applause.] And I believe that there is no doubt where Massachusetts will be found tomorrow, as it has been in the past. [Applause.]"", ""I run against a candidate who reminds me of the symbol of his party, the circus elephant, with his head full of ivory, a long memory and no vision, and you have seen elephants being led around the circus ring. They grab the tail of the elephant in front of them. [Applause.] That was all right in 1952 and 1956, but there is no tail to grab this year. It is Mr. Nixon himself and I don't believe he will secure an endorsement of a majority of the citizens of this country in a time of change. [Applause.]"", 'I come here tonight and ask your help. I ask you to join us tomorrow in putting Massachusetts in the Democratic column. [Applause.] This is an important campaign, because it involves a high and distinguished office, an office which is given great responsibilities and great powers by the Constitution, and also by the pressure of events. The next President of the United States on his shoulders will rest burdens heavier than have rested on the shoulders of any President since the time of Lincoln. War and peace, the progress of this country, the security of our people, the education of our children, jobs for men and women who want to work, the development of our resources - the symbolic feeling of a nation, the image the nation presents to the world, its power, prestige, and direction - all ultimately will come to rest on the next President of the United States. [Applause.] This is the most responsible time in the life of any citizens of any free country, and I do not run for the office of the Presidency after 14 years in the Congress with any expectation that it is an empty or an easy job. I run for the Presidency of the United States because it is the center of action, and in a free society the chief responsibility of the President is to set before the American people the unfinished public business of our country. [Applause.]', ""The world must not sit still. The balance of power does not hang. It moves in one direction or the other like the tide. And I want to make sure in the 1960's, unlike the 1950's, that the tide moves in our favor, that people at a late date and with some perspective will make a judgment that while in the 1950's the tide ran out for the United States in its position around the world, in its prestige and in its influence, in the 1960's, the tide began to come in again. [Applause.]"", 'All this talk about prestige of our position in the world, goes to the security of the United States. It does no good for this administration to lock polls up taken of our position overseas, of the judgment other people have of us. All of us know the truth, and no amount of executive secrecy can hide it. We know that we are not as secure as we were a decade ago, or even 5 years ago. We know that there are great motions at work in the world which have not always reckoned with the position of the United States, new leadership, new countries, new movements. More and more in many of the countries whose favor we must seek, if we wish to maintain the balance of power on the side of freedom, the younger men and women who should be most attracted to us as a dynamic, free society, are beginning to look in another direction, to Castro in Latin America, to Congo and to Ghana and to Guinea and to Africa, to Communist China and Asia. The question is, What will it be by 1970? Will the balance of power be in our favor or that of the Communists? Will the people of the world make a judgment that we are the ultimate winners, or will they make a cold, hard judgment that the ultimate winners of this power struggle will not be the United States and the cause of freedom, but will be our adversaries, and they will want to get right with them.', 'I want them to be convinced that we are at work in this society as a serious, determined people, building in the United States the kind of society which can serve as an example to all those who wish to be free, but may not have determined that freedom represents the opportunity for them. That is the opportunity before us in the sixties, to he the great defender of freedom in a time when freedom is under attack and under test all over the globe. Thomas Paine said in the American Revolution, ""The cause of America is the cause of all mankind,"" and now in the revolution of 1960, the cause of all mankind is the cause of America. [Applause.]', 'The Communist system gets its power not from Mr. Khrushchev. All the speeches and debates and arguments and finger waving to Mr. Khrushchev, all the trips proposed to Eastern Europe by the Vice President, trip proposed for former Presidents to Russia, spreading the good will - this whole struggle is far more serious than that. Who can be so ill informed that he thinks the tensions of the power struggle disappear by good will missions, by debates, and by arguments. They will disappear or they will be overcome only by what we do here.', 'The Vice President of the United States says that he will go to Eastern Europe when he wins this election. I will go to Washington, D.C. [Applause.] For here is where the job must be done. The kind of society we build, the kind of power we generate, the kind of enthusiasm that we incite, all this will tell whether, in the long run, darkness or light overtakes the world.', 'I welcome the opportunity to be engaged in this struggle as the chief arm of freedom. It is a proud privilege that we hold as citizens of this country. I welcome the opportunity, if elected, to serve as President of the United States, and if unsuccessful to continue to serve in the Senate, at a time when the role of Americans should be one of pride and satisfaction. Their history and their own choice has made it possible for them to be the defenders of freedom. [Applause.]', 'And I want to make it clear that while I may downgrade the leadership we are promised for the future, and the leadership which we have had in the past, I have traveled this country from one end to another. I have spent many days in nearly every State, and I come back to Boston, Mass., with a stronger feeling of confidence, of hope, of knowledge of the vitality and energy of this society and our people than I could have ever had before. It is the best education for a candidate for the Presidency. All the criticisms that are leveled at presidential campaigns in my judgment fade away against the knowledge which a potential President may have of the strength of this society of ours and our people. [Applause.] So I come here tonight. I thank you for your past support. I ask you to join us tomorrow, and most of all, I ask you to join us in all the tomorrows yet to come, in building America, moving America, picking this country of ours up and sending it into the sixties.

454,John F. Kennedy ,"November 07, 1960","[""ANNOUNCEMENT: Eleven o'clock, election eve, 1960, Boston, Mass. From Boston's historic Faneuil Hall, cradle of liberty, Citizens for Kennedy-Johnson present an election eve program with John F. Kennedy, Democratic candidate for President of the United States, and from Austin, Tex., the candidate for Vice President, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. * * *"", 'Senator JOHN F. KENNEDY. Thank you, Lyndon. Ladies and gentlemen, we are meeting tonight in old Faneuil Hall, which is the cradle of American liberty.', 'Here in this hall, men and women met days before the American Revolution to work for freedom. The 13 steps behind me celebrate the 13 nations and States that first signed the Constitution. Here in this old part of Boston, which my grandfather represented once in Congress 60 years ago and which I represented first as a young Congressman 14 years ago, we hold our last meeting of this campaign. Our work is now over, and tomorrow you must make your judgment. Your judgment of what you want your country to do, your judgment of what you want your country to be. I want to present to you for just a few minutes some of the highlights of this campaign that has taken us to all parts of the country. I think it shows something about America. It shows something about what America can do and what America must be. Perhaps the most exciting was whistlestopping through the valleys of California, way back in September. This is the meeting of the Houston ministers at Houston, where they were kind enough to invite me, when we discussed the so-called religious issue of this campaign.', '\n  I believe in America where a separation of church and state is absolute. Where no Catholic prelate can tell the President, should he be Catholic, how to act, and no Protestant minister would tell his parishioners how to vote. Where no church or church school is granted public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the President who might appoint him or the people who might elect him. I believe in America. It is officially neither Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. Where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or public acts of its officials. Where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all. This is the kind of America I believe in, and this is the kind of America I fought for in the South Pacific and the kind my brother died for in Europe. No one suggested then we might have had a divided liberty or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened the, I quote, ""the freedoms for which our forefathers died."" If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole Nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world. In the eyes of history and in the eyes of our own people. But if, on the other hand, I should win this election, then I shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the Presidency, practically identical, I might add, with the oath I have taken for 14 years in the Congress. For without reservation I can, and I quote, ""solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, so help me God.""\n', 'Despite the fact that it was a rainy afternoon, the National Plowing Contest in South Dakota gave me a chance to give my views on our No. 1 domestic agricultural problem.', '\n  (Bad audio.)', ""* * * and wait every month for surplus food packages from our Government. There are 4 million Americans in this country who wait every mouth for a package from our Government of surplus food. You wouldn't believe what is in that package. Some grain, some rice, and this summer the Department of Agriculture is adding lard. These aren't just people living in India or Latin America. They are fellow Americans. Some thrown out of work, many of them sick, many of them with families, and here's this country which stores food and lets it rot on occasion. We can't find enough good food to send our own people."", 'Some say the turning point of this campaign might have come with the first of the four nationally televised debates.', ""\n  I don't want historians 10 years from now to say that the tide ran out. No; I want them to say that these were the years the tide came in. These were the years when the United States started to move again. Thus: the question before the American people - and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with your future. I think we are ready to move. And it is to that great task that, if we are successful, we will address ourselves.\n"", 'War is a moving experience. To speak from the house where Franklin Roosevelt often stayed and where he died. The ""Little White House"" in Warm Springs, Ga.', 'Franklin Roosevelt was the champion of the aged, and of children, and the handicapped, and the friend of those who have been forgotten, of those who have not been remembered, of those who have needed a helping hand, and of those who needed a good neighbor. There is still unfinished business before us in the field of health. There are still over 18 million Americans who live out their lives without assistance, without any recognition of the great problem that they face in the field of health. This campaign, like all the rest, reached a climax of party spirit in the final week. Even a driving rain could not dampen the torchlight parade in New York.', ""This is the campaign and it's now come to an end."", ""I think this old hall reminds us of how far we've been as Americans and what we must do in the future. This painting behind me is of the first Thanksgiving, December 13, way back. It was painted in 1821, and of course it was of the first Thanksgiving in the Plymouth Colony. They had had a long, hard experience. Many had died. And yet the first harvest came in, they gave thanks to the Lord for His generosity to them. It reminds us of our great history, of what our people have been willing to do in order to build our society."", ""There's another picture on the wall from the Battle of Bunker Hill. The Battle of Bunker Hill which was one of the key battles of the American Revolution, was fought only a few hundred yards from this old building."", 'This is a great country. It has passed through many trials and tribulations and it has emerged in 1960 as the most powerful single country in the world, as the greatest hope for freedom of the world.', ""It is our function now in our generation in the 1960's to keep it that way, to make sure that this country meets its responsibilities, to make sure that we stand as the sentinel at the gate for the cause of freedom around the world."", 'If we succeed, freedom succeeds. If we fail, freedom fails. That is the sober and awesome responsibility which events and our own choice have put upon our shoulders.', 'I believe that we can fulfill our function. I believe we can maintain our position as the hope of freedom. I believe that we can check the Communist advance, that we can turn it back, and that we can, in this century, provide for the ultimate victory of freedom over slavery.', 'That is our job and I believe that that can best be done if we build in this country a strong and vital society.', 'Our prestige in the world, our strength in the world, our influence in the world - all of these are directly related to the strength, energy, and drive of the United States itself.', 'This is the place where we must start. The next President of the United States must go to Washington and get this country working again.', ""We must provide opportunity for our people. We must provide with their help employment for our people. We can't possibly maintain our own freedom and the freedom of others when we work part time, when we use our steel capacity 50 percent, when we build - as we built this month - 30 percent less homes than a year ago."", 'We have to provide education for our children - the best there is. We have to make sure that talented boys and girls - and nearly 35 percent of our brightest who graduate from high school today never see the inside of a college - we want to make sure they have a chance to develop their talent.', 'We want to make sure that our older citizens have a chance to protect themselves - they have a chance to live out their life in dignity and security under a medical care plan tied to social security.', 'We want to make sure that the great abundance that American farmers have brought to us is used as a blessing around the world.', 'This is a blessing from the Lord. He has been generous to us and we have to make sure that we use all that we have.', 'This is the choice, then, in 1960. Shall we go forward? Shall we move with the times? Shall we progress again in the United States? Shall we stand as the great symbol of freedom around the world, or shall we sit still? Shall we lie at anchor?', 'In my judgment, that is the question that separates the Republican and the Democratic Parties in 1960, as it did in 1932 in the election of Franklin Roosevelt, as it did in 1912 with the election of Woodrow Wilson.', ""I believe we must go forward. You have to decide what you think. Are you satisfied with things as they are? Do you feel we must do better? Do you feel that we have to do better in the sixties? Do you feel that we have to go to work and build this country of ours stronger than it's ever been, more powerful than it's ever been, more dedicated to peace than it's ever been? I believe we should. And I come tonight and ask you to give me the opportunity to serve in this high office, this most responsible office, so that we can once more start on the forward road."", ""My wife could not campaign with me this year because she is having a baby in 3 weeks, so that I haven't seen her very much, or my daughter, and she couldn't be with me here today because she has to stay home and relax. But she is home and I am now going to let you say hello to her. Hello, Jackie. We're switching over to you."", ""\n  Mrs. KENNEDY. Jack, I've enjoyed watching this program tonight. I only wish I could have been there with you at the end of this longest and busiest day for you and the end of the long road that we've traveled together since the primaries in January. The doctor wouldn't let me leave Hyannis Port tonight so I'll be here until tomorrow morning at 6:30 when I drive to Boston to join you en route. I wouldn't miss that for anything. And then we'll have you back with us at least to wait out the election returns together."", ""One of my happiest memories of this campaign has been all of the people who have believed in you, who worked so hard and helped so much. I want to thank all of you who are listening tonight and tell you that we'll never be able to repay our debt to you, and that it is you that we thank tonight with gratitude."", ""Before we go back to Faneuil Hall, there have been so many thousands of messages of support received within the past few days we're going to show you just a few of them that have been recorded on film."", '(Filmed sequence:)', ""Mr. Kennedy, I am going to vote for you because I do not like Secretary Benson and I feel like if I should vote otherwise, we will still have to put up with him for another 4 years and I just don't want him in there. He's not a man for the job."", ""I am voting for Senator Kennedy because I think he's a much greater statesman than Vice President Nixon."", ""I am voting for Senator Kennedy because I have always been a Democrat and I think it's time for a change."", ""Mrs. Burton, Whittier, Calif., Mr. Nixon's hometown. I am voting for Jack Kennedy because of his background, his education, his intelligence, and his stability."", 'I am going to vote for Senator Kennedy because I want to get this country off a dead center. I want to make this country move both domestically and regain our lost prestige abroad.', ""I am a good Democrat and I'm going to vote for Jack Kennedy because I think he is entitled to the office at this time. He is a brilliant, outstanding man and the United States needs a great leader such as I believe that he can give to the United States."", 'I am voting for Jack Kennedy and my dad made the mistake in 1928 or voting for a Republican the first time. I am not going to be cheated in this election for voting for the Republican Party.', 'I am going to vote for Senator Kennedy because he is a sincere, conscientious man and I think will make one of the greatest Presidents of my time.', 'Well, I think the reason that I am voting for Senator Kennedy is because of my tremendous faith in the American people. In our whole history we have seemed to inevitably choosen the right man for the right time. We have had weak times and weak Presidents. But always it has been the man we have named, at that time. These are the days when we need strength and courage. We need inspiration, directed courage and supervision. These we have in Senator Kennedy. This is what America needs. This is why I must vote for Senator Kennedy.', ""Mr. KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank all of you for your kindness in coming tonight. Nearly all of you were present when I was elected to Congress 14 years ago, and I'm delighted that you're present tonight as this campaign of 1960 goes into history."", ""We are meeting in the old hall which was the scene of Otis' speeches and Samuel Adams which led up to the American Revolution."", 'Behind me are three statues of three distinguished citizens of this State who served their country - President John Adams, his son, President John Quincy Adams, and Senator Daniel Webster from our State of Massachusetts.', 'All of the past tells us something about the future.', ""I've traveled all over the United States - been to 50 States in the last month - and I must say I come back to this old city with the strongest possible confidence in the future of the United States, in the ability of its people to meet its responsibilities, to bear our burdens, to strengthen our cause, to identify ourselves and others with the cause of freedom around the world."", 'In 1860, in the campaign a hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln said the issue was whether this Nation could exist half slave and half free.', 'Now 100 years later, the question is will the world exist half slave and half free or will it move in the direction of freedom? Or will it move in the direction of slavery?', 'I believe it will move in the direction of freedom. And I believe that this is especially true if we here in the United States begin to move again.', 'The challenge of 1960, of 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964 is whether or not the people of the United States are determined to move forward again; to build a stronger, more progressive, more vigorous society; to demonstrate what freedom can really do; to serve as an ornament to the cause of freedom around the world; to send the most talented men and women we have in the country to service in Washington, to represent us all over the world as spokesmen for freedom, as well as spokesmen for the United States.', 'I believe we can do these things. I believe we can build a strong and productive society that employs our people, educates our children, provides security for our aged and opportunity for all.', 'That is the responsibility of all of us, and it is especially the responsibility of the next President of the United States to set before our country the unfinished business of our society.', 'This campaign is now over. The responsibility has ceased to be ours who are candidates and it is now yours, the citizens of this great Republic.', 'You must make your judgment between sitting and moving.', 'This is a race not merely between two parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, or between two candidates. It is a race between the comfortable and the concerned. Those who are willing to sit and lie at anchor and those who want to go forward.', 'This country has developed as it is. We are here tonight because in other great periods of crisis we have chosen to go forward.', 'And I am confident tomorrow in 1960, November 8, this country will once again choose progress, this country will once again choose to go forward, this country will once again choose to go to work to build a strong society here and to build a peaceful and productive world.', 'That is our responsibility and that is our opportunity, and the judgment now is yours - the citizens of this country.', 'ANNOUNCER. This program has been presented by the Citizens for Kennedy and Johnson. Portions of this program were prerecorded and edited and live from Austin, Tex., Hyannis Port, and Faneuil Hall in Boston.', 'Good night.']"
455,John F. Kennedy ,"November 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, Governor Ribicoff, my present colleague in the Congress, and I am confident my future colleague, Congressman Daddario, of the city of Hartford [applause], and my present colleague, and I am sure our future colleague in the Congress, Frank Kowalski. [Applause.]', 'I would like to present to you my three sisters who have been campaigning around the United States, and who came with us today for the end of the campaign, my sister Eunice Shriver [applause], my sister Jean Smith [applause], and my sister Patricia Lawford [applause]. I think Mrs. Lawford got a better hand than the other sisters. [Laughter.] And Congressman-to-be St. Onge, from the Second Congressional District.', 'I am delighted to be here. I am proud to be introduced by your distinguished Governor, Governor Ribicoff. [Applause.] In 1956 he presented my name to the Democratic Convention as a candidate for the Vice Presidency, and since that time he was my first supporter for the Office of the Presidency, and has been my constant friend and counsel and I am honored to be in his State with him today. [Applause.]', 'This campaign is coming to an end. This campaign will be all over in 12 hours, and it has been a campaign which has taken, in some form or other, at least many months, stretching all the way back to the first primary in the State of New Hampshire in January of this year. After 12 hours, my responsibility as the standard bearer for the Democratic Party to present the issues in this campaign ceases, and so does that of Mr. Nixon. Your responsibility as citizens of the great Republic then begins, and tomorrow, November 8, you must make the most sober and responsible judgment that any citizens of any free country are called upon to make, to choose the next President of the United States. [Response from the audience and applause.] Thank you. I believe we will do very well in 1964. [Laughter.]', 'I believe that the issues which separate Mr. Nixon and myself present a clear choice to any voter. He must make a judgment about what his view is of the position of our country, what his view is of the needs what his view is of its responsibilities, and when he has made that judgment about his own position, then he can make a judgment between Mr. Nixon and myself, because we hold entirely different views of the position, future, and responsibility of the United States in 1960, and you have to decide which point of view, which party, which candidate, which philosophy you accept. [Applause.]', 'There are three major differences of opinion between Mr. Nixon and myself. They have been developed over a period of 2 months. They are three things:', 'First, a different view of the present state of the American economy; secondly, a different view of our prestige in the world and, therefore, our ability to lead the free world; and, thirdly, whether the balance of power in the world is shifting in our direction or that of our adversaries.', ""Mr. Nixon and I disagreed 2 months ago. I did not know before 2 months were past that on each of these three questions the people of the United States would have it possible to make a clear judgment based on their own facts, because I believe that within the 2 months of Mr. Nixon taking a position that our prosperity was greater than it ever was before, the people of this country have had a chance to see that it is not. We are moving into a period of decline in American economy which has cost us $1 billion worth of gold in 3 months, which has caused our Government to reduce its estimates of its tax revenues by $4 billion in 3 months, which is going to see in 2 weeks 1 million unsold cars in the United States, twice as many in inventory as ever before in our history, which has seen our economic growth, instead of increasing, decreasing in the last 9 months, which has seen us build 30 percent fewer homes. I don't know how many clouds on the horizon we need before we realize that this is not, in Mr. Nixon's words, unexampled prosperity; it is not better than we have ever had it before, and in my judgment if the United States is going to avoid the rigors of another recession in the winter of 1961, we have to have a new administration in Washington. [Applause.]"", 'Secondly, Mr. Nixon and I have disagreed on the prestige of the United States abroad. He has said it has never been higher, and he points to the votes in the United Nations. Even while he said this, the U.S. State Department had in its vaults polls taken in 10 countries of the world this summer, asking them whether they believed that the United States or the Soviet Union was first militarily, scientifically, and in economic growth, and which society they thought would be first in 1970. In 9 out of 10 countries, stretching all the way from England to Indonesia, a majority of the citizens believed that the Soviet Union was now ahead of us in scientific power, in military power and would be ahead of us, perhaps decisively, by 1970. How many countries of the world in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Western Europe, will choose to follow a leader who is not able to maintain his leadership? Which has seen a country which was the most backward country in Western Europe 40 years ago now in a position where a majority of the people in the world begin to believe that it is more powerful than us. How can Mr. Nixon go to the people of this country and how can the people of this country accept the view that our prestige has never been higher, when the very evidence before our eyes indicates that the people of the world believe that a major shift in the balance of power in the world is moving against us? [Applause.] And when on our second television debate - and Mr. Nixon, I understand, will be on television for 6 hours today [response from the audience] - I would have liked to have had him spend just 1 hour with me in a fifth debate, but nevertheless [applause]. When he pointed to the votes at the United Nations as evidence of our increased prestige, the very next day on the question of the admission of Red China not one of the 16 new nations admitted to the United Nations this summer - not one voted with us. Only two countries in all of Africa voted with us, Liberia, and the Union of South Africa.', 'Thirdly, I stated that I believe that while the United States was not first militarily, that the rate of increase in the Soviet Union placed us in danger of being in a secondary position by 1963, 4, 5, or 6. Mr. Nixon denied it. The headline in the papers yesterday emphasized his view of our supremacy. But on a back page of the New York Times, there is a report released by the Rand Corp., under the sponsorship of Johns Hopkins University, of a study now in the departments of Government, hitherto unreleased, which shows that these informed experts believe that at the present rate of increase in military power, by 1970, and I quote them accurately, ""We will be in a position of inferiority.""', 'The people of this country have these facts. Mr. Nixon has chosen to take a different view of them. But I believe that it did not take a year, it took 2 months for the people of this country to realize that this country cannot maintain its leadership, we cannot maintain our security, we cannot maintain our employment, we cannot maintain the image of a vigorous society, we cannot control and hold the imagination of the world, unless this country starts to move forward again. And that is the issue. [Applause.] And I do not believe that Mr. Nixon or the Republican Party by their record are committed to progress, and we need progress in this country.', 'I want to make it clear that all these statements that have been made in the last few days about his proposed visit to Eastern Europe, the proposal to send the President traveling through Russia, accompanied by Herbert Hoover and Harry Truman - in my judgment, if I am elected President of the United States I am not going to Eastern Europe. I am going to Washington, D.C. [Applause.]', 'Because the hope of freedom in Eastern Europe, the hope of stalemating the Communist advance and turning it, depends not upon goodwill missions, of which we have had so many in recent years. It depends on one thing, the power, vitality, conviction, direction, and perseverance of the great Republic of the United States. That is what counts - what we do. [Applause.]', 'Mr. Khrushchev travels around the world, but what gives him his power, what gives him his force, is the drive of the Communist system and the Soviet productive power. Unless we can match it, unless we can be superior to it in the next decade, the balance of power will shift against us, and once we are isolated, what chance of security and what chance of peace.', 'I ask your help tomorrow, not merely as the candidate [applause] - not merely as the candidate of my party. I ask your help in a race tomorrow between the comfortable and the concerned, between those who are satisfied and those who want to move ahead. Two thousand years ago, after the battle of Thermopylae, when 300 Spartans held back the mass of Persians, there was erected in the rocks above their graves these words: ""Passerby: Tell Sparta we fell faithful to her service."" I want it erected on the walls of the world in the 1960\'s, ""Passerby: America is faithful to the service of freedom."" Thank you. [Applause.]']"
456,John F. Kennedy ,"November 07, 1960","['Senator KENNEDY. Ladies and gentlemen, will you put those signs down, please, so others can see? I appreciate them all.', 'First of all, I would like to have you meet my three sisters, who are campaigning with me. In the last 2 months they have traveled in about 40 States and in the last year they have been in all 55. [Laughter.] Well, it seems like 55. I want you to meet - we will go from the oldest to the youngest. My sister, Jean Smith. [Applause.] My sister - she is from New York - my sister, Eunice Shriver, from Illinois. [Applause.] My sister, Patricia Lawford, from California. [Applause.] Somebody asked her last week - somebody asked my sister, Patricia, when she was in Defiance, Ohio, last week, if I was her kid brother, so she knew it was time this campaign came to an end. [Laughter.]', 'I am delighted to come to New Hampshire, for three or four reasons. In the first place - I am glad to come to New Hampshire for three or four reasons. First, because this campaign for the Presidency of the United States started in New Hampshire, last winter, and the success that we had in the primary in this State last March made it possible to go on to be nominated, and I therefore think it appropriate to end up this campaign in this city, in this State, the night before election. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, I am glad to be here because I particularly am proud to be running in company with distinguished Democrats from the State of New Hampshire. [Applause.] There is an old axiom that adversity brings out the best. This State has not been overwhelmingly Democratic - and because the adversity has dealt hard blows to the Democrats in this State, you have chosen the best possible candidates, and I am delighted and proud to be running with them. [Applause.] I hope this State will have the good judgment, for its own future, to elect Bernard Boutin, your next Governor of the State of New Hampshire. [Applause.]', 'I cannot believe that the people of this State, given the two very clear choices that they have, will do anything but elect him by a large majority. [Applause.]', 'Secondly, we are fortunate in the Democratic candidate for the office of U.S. Senator. I think Professor Hill will make a fine Senator, and I hope it is possible that here in New Hampshire they select him to represent them in Washington. [Applause.]', 'You will bring about several welcome changes.', 'Thirdly, we have a chance to elect as Congressman from this district, an old and valued friend of mine, Romeo Champagne, the next Congressman from this district. [Applause.] And from the neighboring congressional district, we have a chance to elect Stuart Nims, as the next Congressman from that district. [Applause.]', ""Now there are good candidates. I don't know any State in the Union where the candidates have more nearly met the needs of the time, Bernard Boutin, Professor Hill, Romeo Champagne, Stuart Nims. I hope it is possible for you to elect them all. [Applause.]"", ""I think there are two or three other reasons why I would like to do well in New Hampshire. I would like to have the Union Leader print a headline that we carried New Hampshire. [Applause.] I believe there is probably a more irresponsible newspaper in the United States, but I can't think of it. [Applause.] I believe that there is a publisher who has less regard for the truth than William Loeb, but I can't think of his name. [Applause.] And when you put that combination together and you put handpicked candidates on the Republican ticket being managed and directed - the affairs of this State - by a man who lives not in New Hampshire, I think in Massachusetts, my own State, who does not even live in this State, and tries to run a political party, I think it is time we threw them all out. [Applause; response from the audience.]"", 'Tell them again?', 'It seems that every time I come to New Hampshire and I read an editorial in the paper, I have to again deny that I am a member of the Communist Party. [Applause.] Only William Loeb and his henchmen [applause] and his pet Governor would suggest it last winter, and others connected with him would suggest it in the fall. New Hampshire is a great State with a long tradition. The last Democratic President from New England came from New Hampshire, Franklin Pierce, in 1852, and I think it is time we elected another one from New England. [Applause.]', 'So look what we have at stake tomorrow. Look at all the chances to enjoy ourselves tomorrow. We can elect a good Governor, a good Senator, two good Congressmen. We can defeat a Governor, and some Congressmen, and, finally, we can throw it all in the lap of William Loeb and wrap it up. [Applause.]', ""We don't get pleasure like that very often. You have a chance given to you that not many people in the United States are given. With one ballot you can do this, and I come here and ask your help in doing it tomorrow. I think it would be the best thing. [Applause.] I think it would be the best thing. I like a country and a State where the politicians are not the bosses, where the editors are not the bosses, where the publishers are not the bosses, but where the people are; and I think we have a chance to show it tomorrow. [Applause.]"", 'I cannot imagine in the long run a more healthy thing for this State than to have a change, than to permit responsible, progressive and honest Democrats to assume responsibility for this State to end this know - nothing movement which has dominated too long the affairs of New Hampshire, and give this State a chance to move ahead. [Applause.]', 'In addition, I come here and ask your support in this campaign for the Presidency. I see no reason why we should journey 3,000 miles to Whittier, Calif., when there is one living in a State 35 miles from here, who comes here and asks your help. [Applause.]', ""The point of the matter, however, I am not coming here as a neighbor asking your vote. I am coming here as a Democrat who is concerned about the future of our country. This State of New Hampshire is an old State and so is Massachusetts. I have traveled in every State in the Union in the last few months. Our area of the country has none of the natural resources which have brought prosperity to other sections of our country. We have no oil, no gas, no minerals. We have no great reaches of land, we have no great space, we have no great waterpower. Our resources are the skilled people who are devoted to their country and their State, who are progressive, who want the best educational system for their children, who recognize that if New Hampshire and Massachusetts and Maine and Vermont and Connecticut, and Rhode Island are going to move ahead, it will require us to have the best trained people coming out of the best schools, using whatever natural resources we have, clean water, transportation, and all the rest, and the advantages of atomic energy. We have in the future promised, as we have in the past, but it will require the best that we have. We can't afford to waste anything. We don't have the resources and the riches that other sections do have, but we have people who are determined to make a go of their life in this State and region. I believe that New England, the oldest section of the United States, the first section of our country, also can be the first section in the future. It can still blaze a trail. Many opportunities lie before us, but New Hampshire and New England cannot move ahead unless the Nation, itself, is moving ahead. Everything that we make here, which we sell throughout the country, depends upon a rising economy. There is an old saying of the New England Council, a rising tide lifts all the boats, and I believe that the boats of New Hampshire can only be raised when the boats are being raised in the rest of the country, so that markets can be developed for our goods, so that ranges and other sections of the United States will equal ours, so that the country and us can move together. That is the prospect in my judgment which the Democratic Party offers in 1960, as the only national party committed to progress."", ""Mr. Nixon represents a party which has opposed progress for 25 years, since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. [Applause.] On television this afternoon he repeated one of the oldest, tiredest stories of the Republicans, that $1.25 minimum wage would cause massive unemployment. That is the same old story that they used to tell in the thirties when the Democrats and Franklin Roosevelt first wrote in a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour. That was going to ruin business [response from the audience], $1.25 an hour, $50 a week, for a business which does $1 million, and it can't be until 1963, and that is going to ruin, that is going to cause starvation. I want to see Mr. Nixon or any Republican, in or out of this place we are now, live on less than $50 a week. [Response from the audience.] He represents a party which totally opposed the social security 25 years ago, and only one Senator in the entire U.S. Senate this summer voted for medical care for the aged tied to social security. Do you know the bill that is now written into law? If you support your parents, or if you are parents who are supporting yourselves, before you can get any assistance, you have to indicate that you are medically indigent. That means your savings, those of your family, go, and then you can get some assistance. What we propose is that all who work contribute under social security less than 3 cents a day in their working years, and when they retire, they will have rights. Now which is the most responsible, which is the most progressive? I must say, the more I look at that sorry record that the Republicans have written in this century, the more convinced I am than ever if this country is going to move ahead in education, in employment, in security, in agriculture, in developing our natural resources, the Democratic Party represents the hope of the future. [Applause.] And we will never be strong in the world, we will never be respected, unless we are strong here in the United States. So I come the full circle to where I began, and the weather is beginning to get cold again. Away back in January I came to Manchester seeking your support in the primary, and now in the closing hours of this long campaign which has stretched almost over a year, I come to Manchester and the State of New Hampshire and ask your support once again. And I can give you my assurance that if we are successful tomorrow, we will move New Hampshire and the country forward, and, if I am unsuccessful tomorrow, I will continue to labor for the best interests of Massachusetts, New England, and the United States. But I believe tomorrow is our opportunity. Tomorrow I believe the people of this country will choose to meet their obligations as citizens, and among them and in the lead will be the great State of New Hampshire. [Applause.]""]"

[Applause.] Let me say that I am sorry we are late. We have not been playing golf. We have been out playing the Democratic message. [Applause.] We have been today - in fact, we started at Waterbury, Conn., at 3 o'clock this morning, and we have been to Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maine, and now we come here to ask the people of Rhode Island to support the Democratic Party in this election. [Applause.]"", 'I am delighted to have been introduced by the next Senator from the State of Rhode Island, an old friend of mine who will make a great Senator to succeed Senator Green, a great colleague of Senator Pastore, who will speak for the Nation and Rhode Island in the Senate, Claiborne Pell. [Applause.] I know you are going to send him down to represent you and the country. [Applause.] And I am confident that you will select as the next Governor of the State of Rhode Island, Lieutenant Governor Notte. [Applause.]', ""We are running a well-balanced ticket in Rhode Island of Kennedy, Pell, Notter, and St. Germaine. So what do we need? [Applause.] I know that you will select as Congressman, Congressman St. Germaine, who will represent and succeed Aime Forand in the U.S. Congress. [Applause.] Rhode Island has a great Democratic tradition, and I think the people of this State understand that the United States has to move forward and progress in the 1960's and the Republican Party does not know what that word means. [Applause.] For 25 years the Republican Party has opposed every piece of progressive legislation on behalf of the people of this country, and for 14 years Mr. Nixon has been associated with that opposition. [Applause.] I have yet to hear anyone suggest one single piece of progressive legislation he ever sponsored, fought for, or passed in the 14 years that he has been around Washington. [Applause.] And I do not believe in the most changing and revolutionary period in the history of the world that the United States is going to select a party whose symbol is the elephant, who has no vision, long memory, yet is going to sit down in the sun when we ought to be moving. [Applause.] I come to Rhode Island and I ask your help in this campaign. [Applause.] I ask you to join us. [Applause.] I want you to get home and get to bed so you can get up early - so I can get up early [laughter] Tuesday morning, November 8. We must make a choice in this country to pick ourselves up and move forward. [Applause.] And having given that message, let's go to bed. Thank you. [Applause.]""]"

[Applause.] Let me make it clear this campaign is now coming to an end, and tomorrow the respective responsibilities of Mr. Nixon and myself cease and yours begin. [Response from the audience.]', 'What are the issues in this campaign that any voter should consider before they vote? In my judgment they are two: First, there is the point of view expressed by the Vice President that this country has never been stronger, that our security is assured [response from the audience], that we are experiencing and enjoying unprecedented prosperity from one end of the country to the other [response from the audience] and that the way to win the peace is by journeys through Eastern Europe in order to inform them of the value of freedom. I want to make it clear that Mr. Nixon may decide, if he is elected, to go to Eastern Europe, but I am going to Washington, D.C., because that is the place. [Applause.] Have we not learned in the last 8 years that parades and trips and good will missions are not the way to negotiate, are not the way to limit, are not the way to expand the cause of freedom around the world? [Response from the audience.]', ""Mr. Khrushchev is not impressed by words. He is impressed by the power of a free society, and the way to get power in a free society is to build the strength of the United States. [Applause.] Do you think after 40 years of Communist experience that the Communists are going to change their whole doctrine by visits? [Response from the audience.] What kind of a policy will that be for the 1960's, the most dangerous and hazardous in our history, to even indicate to people that peace can be won by some overnight gesture? Peace and security and the survival of the United State can only be won by work, perseverance, will, carried out over a long period of time without cease, without fail. In order to win the peace in Eastern Europe, in order to extend freedom around the world, our country has to go back to work again here in the United States. [Applause.]"", 'Thomas Jefferson at the beginning of this country once said the disease of liberty is catching, but if it is going to catch, if it is going to spread around the world, then we here in the United States must meet our responsibilities. We must recognize there are no shortcuts, no easy way, no overnight, weekend meetings, which will bring a change in the balance of power in the world. What gives the Communist system its power and force is the productive strength of the Soviet Union. What gives freedom its power and force are not merely words and speeches but the productive power of the United States put to great purposes. [Applause.] And that is the issue of this campaign, which candidate, which party. [Response from the audience and applause.]', 'You have to make your judgment tomorrow as to which candidate and which party has associated itself and himself with the great issue of our time. On other occasions, in other years, this country has elected Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. They do it when they make a decision that that party and that candidate will serve a great national purpose. In my judgment and the responsibility ultimately is yours, in my judgment the United States will be best served by a candidate and a party who recognizes the basic issues of our time and that is that this country has to go back to work again. [Applause.]', ""For 8 long years, for 8 years we have seen the balance of power in the world change. It did not require the polls taken by the U.S. Information Service to tell us that the balance of power is not shifting in our direction. Cuba, Latin America, Asia, China, Russia - the world is full of hazards and peril and opportunity in the 1960's, and those hazards can be overcome, those perils can be met, those opportunities seized only if we in the United States are building a strong society committed to progress which the Republican Party has never been. [Applause.] Do you believe that when the basic responsibility of our country is to build strength and move ahead that we should entrust the leadership of his society to a candidate and a party who have opposed progress for the last 15 years. [Response from the audience.] Mr. Nixon leads a party which, in the midthirties, voted 95 percent against a 25-cent minimum wage, and he leads a party which in 1960 voted 95 percent against $1.25 minimum wage. [Response from the audience.] He leads a party which in the midthirties voted 90 percent against social security, and he leads a party which in 1960 voted 90 percent against medical care for the aged tied to social security [response from the audience.] The elephant has not had a new idea in 25 years. [Applause.] This choice is your. This choice is not merely between two candidates and two candidates and two parties and the record of the past. It is between their respective commitments to the future. And I come here to Providence, R.I., the United States of America, and secure your help tomorrow in moving this country forward.

Our purpose is clear, and the judgment finally must be yours. Which way do you want to go? [Response from the audience.] Do you want to drift and sleep and lie at anchor, or do you want to start to go forward in the 1960's and build our strength? [Response from the audience.]"", 'Eighteen hours from now this campaign will be over. I want you to know that for 4 years the State of Rhode Island, away back in 1956, was generous enough, under your distinguished former Governor, Governor Roberts, to support me for the Vice Presidency [applause], and in 1960 Rhode Island was a leading State in making it possible for me to carry on this campaign. [Applause.] And now, for the third time I come to Rhode Island and ask your help and support. I can assure you that if we are successful, all of us in this State who seek office under the banner of the Democratic Party, I can assure you that our party in 1961 will meet its responsibilities, not only to the people of this State, not only to the people of this country, but to all those around the world who look to us with confidence and hope. Let me say 100 years ago in the campaign of 1860, Abraham Lincoln wrote to a friend, ""I know there is a God and I know He hates injustice. I see the storm coming, and I know His hand is in it. But if He has a place and a part for me, I believe that I am ready."" Now, 100 years later [applause] - 100 years later, when the issue is still freedom or slavery, we know there is a God. We know He hates injustice, and we see the storm coming. But if He has a place and a part for us, I believe that we are ready. Thank you. [Applause.]']"

I saved the best to last. [Applause.] I am glad to be in Springfield for another reason, and that is that this district is represented in Congress by a distinguished Congressman, Eddy Boland [applause] who has spent the entire fall, the last 2 months, running our campaign in the State of Ohio, which is the kind of man he is.

[Applause.] I come here to Massachusetts, which I have represented in the Congress for the past 14 years, and ask your support tomorrow in the campaign for the Presidency .

I come here as a concerned citizen who wishes to see this country move forward again.

He has also indicated if he is elected President of the United States, President Eisenhower will go to Russia. He has also indicated that if he is elected President of the United States, President Hoover and President Truman will also go behind the Iron Curtain. I want to make it clear that if I am elected President of the United States, I am going to Washington, D.C. [Applause.] If there is any lesson which this country should have learned in the last 8 years, it is that the Communist system and the Communist leaders are not impressed by good will missions. They are impressed by the power, strength, and determination of the United States, and that is what must be built. [Applause.]', 'The Communists have not risen from a small group of conspirators in a back room to being a powerful country which threatens our survival by being impressed by word. They are impressed only if this country is moving ahead with purpose and conviction. And my judgment is that the next President of the United States must supply the leadership which will make it possible for us to move ahead.

You must decide yourselves whether the view of the world which I have tried to present in this campaign, the view of our responsibilities as citizens of this country, the things we must do in the 1960's to maintain our freedom - whether you agree with that, or whether you agree with Mr. Nixon that we should sit in the sun and let history pass us by. [Response from the audience.]"", 'This choice is clear. I do not believe that any candidate for the Presidency can run on a platform that all is well, that all is being done in good time, that our prestige was never higher, and that the tide of history is moving in our favor, and then suddenly, if elected, hope to get the support of the Congress and the people on the programs that must be enacted. I disagree with Mr. Nixon on the trend [applause] - what this country must do to maintain the peace, and maintain our position in the world, and I am very sure if we do not continue to drift and lie at anchor, only seeing the beginning of our difficulties, but if this country goes back to work again, if it moves with purpose, if it moves with perseverance, there is nothing it cannot do, nothing.

They are prepared to bear the burdens which go with the maintenance of freedom, and in my judgment it is the function of the next President of the United States to tap the reservoir of vitality and energy in our great system and our great country. [Applause.] So I come here to Springfield in the last 12 hours of the presidential campaign of 1960, and I ask your support. I ask you to join me not merely in trying to win tomorrow, but trying to win all the tomorrows that are going to come across the horizon, in good times and bad, in fair wind and foul. I have confidence that the United States will meet its commitments to itself and will serve in the future as it has in the past as the great defender of freedom around the world. Thank you.

Of course, both Mr. Nixon and myself share the common desire of all Americans for a peaceful world but throughout this campaign we have differed, and differed sharply, as to the most effective way to pursue peace, on the course American must take if Communist attack is to be deterred, tensions relieved, and the vast resources, which now go to build weapons, are eventually to be used to advance the welfare of all men.', 'Mr. Nixon believes that peace can be achieved through conferences and commissions, through meetings and good-will tours through special missions and propaganda gimmicks. But words and gestures, talks and visits, will not bring peace in the future, just as they have failed to bring peace during the past 8 years.', 'We face a ruthless and implacable enemy bent on world domination. An enemy supremely confident of its ultimate victory and willing to seek that victory by whatever method seems likely to succeed.', 'The Soviet Union recognizes and respects only one obstacle to its ambitions and that is the strength of its opponents; only a strong and vital America can convince the Communists that any attempt at armed aggression will cost them too dearly to be worth the gamble; only a strong and vital America can maintain the leadership of the alliance of free nations. Only a strong and vital America can maintain the leadership of the alliance of free nations. Only a strong and vital America can become the model of Democratic progress to the newly emerging nations who are looking for guidance and for help.', 'Therefore, if elected, I pledge myself and my party to begin work immediately on a program to achieve peace through strength.', 'First, we will strenghten our military power to the point where no aggressor will dare attack, now or in the future. Two days ago an independent study made for the Department of the Army concluded that unless we acted immediately we might ""become a world power inferior to the U.S.S.R."" But America must not become inferior to any nation. For an inferior America endangers peace and the survival of freedom. Therefore, we will build a mobile retaliatory force incapable of destruction by surprise attack, and modernize and strengthen our conventional forces so as to deter limited war.', ""Second, we will act to strengthen America here at home, by working to reverse the current decline in our rate of economic growth and rate of employment, by meeting the needs of our people for medical care, for education, for housing and all the rest, and by assuring every American, of every race and creed equal opportunity in all the activities of our national life. In this way we can convince the people of the developing nations that the road to progress is freedom's road - that democracy, not communism, offers the brightest hope for their future."", 'Third, we will strengthen the political and economic independence of those nations newly emerging on the bottom half of the globe to prevent in those countries the chaos and despair on which Communist expansion thrives.', 'Such an effort requires not only long-term development loans but education, student exchanges, stepped up Voice of America broadcasts, concerned and competent Ambassadors, and a wide range of measures designed to increase the strength of freedom and stimulate the economic advance on which freedom often depends.', 'Fourth, we will strengthen our planning the preparation for disarmament. One of the most glaring failures of the past 8 years has been our failure to prepare properly for any arms control conference since the end of the Korean war. As a result we have allowed the Soviet Union to take the initiative and win the propaganda victories while our blunder often made it seem to others that America, not Russia, was the real obstacle to disarmament. It is no longer enough to have only 100 men, in the entire Government, working on the complex problem of arms control. We must immediately establish a National Peace Agency, an Arms Control Research Institute, to work full time on these problems.', ""Fifth, we will strengthen man's hopes for freedom in those countries where Communist despotism now rules. From Peiping to Warsaw, from Budapest to Havana, millions of people have lost their freedom. We must constantly remind them through stepped-up Voice of America broadcasts, through exchange of information, and through economic help where that help seems likely to decrease their dependence on Moscow, we must remind them that America looks forward to the day when they will be free."", 'If we pursue these programs, if we are willing to forego the easy but fatal course of thinking that we can talk our way into a peaceful world, for the course of the action and effort and sacrifice which the Democratic Party offers, then I believe that we will move toward the day which was promised mankind almost 2,000 years ago, the day when there will be ""peace on earth and good will toward men.""']"

For already, once the start of this campaign, events and facts have given ominous portent of what is to come. And no reassurances, no glib optimism, or attempts to conceal the truth can explain away these events and facts.', 'At the beginning of this campaign Mr. Nixon and I joined issue on three basic assumptions about the vitality of America and its position in the world.', 'First, while I said that the American economy was failing to move ahead fast enough to meet the needs of the Nation or the people, Mr. Nixon said that ""We\'d never had it so good,"" that the Nation was enjoying ""unexampled prosperity.""', 'Since that time unemployment has risen to more than 6 percent, the highest since the great recession of 1958. In the past 5 months we have lost almost $1 billion of our dwindling gold reserves to foreign banks. In the past 3 months our economy has not only failed to move ahead, but it has actually gone backwards as our gross national product declined by $4 billion. In the past few months Treasury estimates as to the amount of revenue we could expect went down $2 to $3 billion, due not to declining taxes but to declining income. Industrial production is down. Average weekly earnings are down. And almost every other economic indicator has declined so sharply that many economists have declared that we may be moving toward the third recession in 6 years.', 'This is the first issue between myself and Mr. Nixon which events have begun to settle.', 'Second, while I said that our position and prestige in the world were declining dangerously, Mr. Nixon said that our prestige was ""at an alltime high.""', 'Since that time our influence in the United Nations dropped until not one of the new African nations voted with us on the question of the admission of Red China. In the past few months the Cuban dictator has become increasingly brazen in his challenges to our position in Latin America. In the past few months the African nation of Ghana, according to our own Secretary of State, has moved closer to the Communist bloc. And in the past few weeks secret polls, which the Republicans refused to release before election, were leaked to the press, proving that our prestige has dropped sharply in the past year; that in 9 out of 10 nations a majority of the people thought that Russia already was, or soon would be, first in the world in military power and silence.', 'This is the second issue between Mr. Nixon and myself which events have began to settle.', 'Third, while I said that the decline in our relative military power meant that the danger of Soviet military supremacy would increase in the early sixties, Mr. Nixon said that our relative military strength was increasing, that we were in no danger at all.', 'To support my statements I cited the fact that every independent survey, and most of our retired military leaders, had concluded that our present military effort was inadequate, that the Russians were gaining. Mr. Nixon offered only Republican reassurances that all was well. And yesterday morning the New York Times published an independent survey made by the Operations Research Office of the Johns Hopkins University, a survey which the Republicans have also refused to release before election, a survey which concluded that unless we act immediately ""The United States may become a world power inferior to the U.S.S.R"" in the next decade.', 'This is the third issue between Mr. Nixon and myself which events have begun to settle.', ""I believe that Mr. Nixon's failure to tell the truth to the American people, or, perhaps, his failure to understand the truth himself, is a clear demonstration of his incapacity to lead this Nation through the troubling and hazardous years which lie ahead. And for that reason I believe that tomorrow the American people will look to the leader of a party pledged to act with boldness and imagination in moving America forward - they will look to the leadership of the Democratic Party."", 'If the Democratic Party is chosen, if I am elected President, then I do not promise an easy life in the sixties. We will call for increased concern and effort on the part of every American. But, in a very real sense, it is not I or my party that demand effort. Events demand it. Facts demand it. The realities of our danger demand it. And we have no choice but to respond or decline, whoever our next President may be.', 'But if we do respond, if we release the great untapped vitality and strength of our society, if we revive the American spirit that conquered the old frontiers, then we will cross the New Frontier to realize the unparalleled opportunities for freedom that lies ahead.']"
462,John F. Kennedy ,"November 09, 1960","['Ladies and gentlemen, I have received the following wire from Vice President Nixon. In that wire he says, ""Senator John F. Kennedy, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. I want to repeat through this wire the congratulations and best wishes I extended to you on television last night. I know that you will have united support of all Americans as you lead the nation in the cause of peace and freedom during the next four years."" I reply to the vice president-- I sent him the following wire: ""Vice President Nixon, Los Angeles, California. Your sincere good wishes are gratefully accepted. You are to be congratulated on a fine race. I know that the nation can continue to count on your unswerving loyalty in whatever effort you undertake, and that you and I can maintain our long-standing cordial relations in the years ahead. Sincerely, John Kennedy.""', 'I received also a wire from President Eisenhower which says, ""My congratulations to you for the victory you have just won at the polls. I will be sending you promptly a more comprehensive telegram suggesting certain measures that may commend themselves to you as you prepare to take over next January the responsibilities of the Presidency. Signed, Dwight D. Eisenhower. And I have sent to President Eisenhower the following wire: ""I am grateful for your wire and good wishes. I look forward to working with you in the near future. The whole country is hopeful that your long experience in the service of your country can be drawn upon further in the years to come. With every good wish, signed, John Kennedy.""', 'May I say in addition to all citizens of this country, Democrats, independents, Republicans, regardless of how they may have voted, that it is a satisfying moment to me and I want to express my appreciation to all of them and to Mr. Nixon personally. I particularly want to thank all of those who worked so long and so hard in this campaign on our behalf and who were generous to me in my visits throughout the country and who were generous enough to support me in the election on yesterday. To all Americans I say that the next four years are going to be difficult and challenging years for all of us. The election may have been a close one, but I think that there is general agreement by all of our citizens that a supreme national effort will be needed in the years ahead to move this country safely through the 1960s. I ask your help in this effort and I can assure you that every degree of mind and spirit that I possess will be devoted to the long-range interests of the United States and to the cause of freedom around the world. So now my wife and I prepare for a new administration and for a new baby.', 'Thank you.']"
