0,Barry Goldwater ,"January 03, 1964","['Ever since the last Republican convention thousands of Americans have asked me to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 1964. I withheld a decision until now, not because of any attempt to be politically coy, but because I have been giving every aspect of such a decision the most serious consideration.', ""Today, here at our home, in this State I love, with my family and with the people whose friendship and political interests have placed me where I am, I want to tell you this: I will seek the Republican presidential nomination. I've decided to do this because of the principles in which I believe and because I am convinced that millions of Americans share my belief in those principles. I decided to do this also because I have not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election."", ""One of the great attributes of our American two party system has always been the reflected differences in principle. As a general rule one party has emphasized individual liberty and the other has favored the extension of government power. I'm convinced that today a majority in the Republican Party believes in the essential emphasis on individual liberty."", 'I\'ve been spelling out my position now for 10 years in the Senate and for years before that here in my own state. I will spell it out even further in the months to come. I was once asked what kind of Republican I was. I replied that I was not a ""me-too"" Republican. That still holds. I will not change my beliefs to win votes. I will offer a choice, not an echo. This will not be an engagement of personalities. It will be in engagement of principles.', ""I've always stood for government that is limited and balanced and against the ever increasing concentrations of authority in Washington. I've always stood for individual responsibility and against regimentation. I believe we must now make a choice in this land and not continue drifting endlessly down and down for a time when all of us, our lives, our property, our hopes, and even our prayers will become just cogs in a vast government machine."", ""I believe that we can win victory for freedom both at home and abroad. I believe that we can be strong enough and determined enough to win those victories without war. I believe that appeasement and weakness can only bring war. I've asked and will continue to ask: Why Not Victory—why not victory for sound, constitutional principles and government—why not victory over the evils of communism?"", ""I'm convinced that in this year 1964 we must face up to our conscience and make a definite choice. We must decide what sort of people we are and what sort of world we want—now and for our children."", 'My candidacy is pledged to a victory for principle and to presenting an opportunity for the American people to choose. Let there be a choice—right now and in clear, understandable terms. And I ask all of those who feel and believe as I do to join with me in assuring both the choice and the victory.']"
1,Barry Goldwater ,"July 16, 1964","['To my good friend and great Republican, Dick Nixon, and your charming wife, Pat; my running mate and that wonderful Republican who has served us well for so long, Bill Miller and his wife, Stephanie; to Thurston Morton who has done such a commendable job in chairmaning this Convention; to Mr. Herbert Hoover, who I hope is watching; and to that great American and his wife, General and Mrs. Eisenhower; to my own wife, my family, and to all of my fellow Republicans here assembled, and Americans across this great Nation.', 'From this moment, united and determined, we will go forward together, dedicated to the ultimate and undeniable greatness of the whole man. Together we will win.', 'I accept your nomination with a deep sense of humility. I accept, too, the responsibility that goes with it, and I seek your continued help and your continued guidance. My fellow Republicans, our cause is too great for any man to feel worthy of it. Our task would be too great for any man, did he not have with him the heart and the hands of this great Republican Party, and I promise you tonight that every fiber of my being is consecrated to our cause; that nothing shall be lacking from the struggle that can be brought to it by enthusiasm, by devotion, and plain hard work. In this world no person, no party can guarantee anything, but what we can do and what we shall do is to deserve victory, and victory will be ours.', 'The good Lord raised this mighty Republic to be a home for the brave and to flourish as the land of the free--not to stagnate in the swampland of collectivism, not to cringe before the bully of communism.', ""Now, my fellow Americans, the tide has been running against freedom. Our people have followed false prophets. We must, and we shall, return to proven ways-- not because they are old, but because they are true. We must, and we shall, set the tides running again in the cause of freedom. And this party, with its every action, every word, every breath, and every heartbeat, has but a single resolve, and that is freedom--freedom made orderly for this nation by our constitutional government; freedom under a government limited by the laws of nature and of nature's God; freedom--balanced so that order lacking liberty will not become the slavery of the prison cell; balanced so that liberty lacking order will not become the license of the mob and of the jungle."", ""Now, we Americans understand freedom. We have earned it, we have lived for it, and we have died for it. This Nation and its people are freedom's model in a searching world. We can be freedom's missionaries in a doubting world. But, ladies and gentlemen, first we must renew freedom's vision in our own hearts and in our own homes."", 'During four futile years, the administration which we shall replace has distorted and lost that vision. It has talked and talked and talked and talked the words of freedom. But it has failed, and failed, and failed in the works of freedom. Now, failures cement the wall of shame in Berlin. Failures blot the sands of shame at the Bay of Pigs. Failures mark the slow death of freedom in Laos. Failures infest the jungles of Vietnam. And failures haunt the houses of our once great alliances and undermine the greatest bulwark ever erected by free nations--the NATO community. Failures proclaim lost leadership, obscure purpose, weakening will, and the risk of inciting our sworn enemies to new aggressions and to new excesses. And, because of this administration we are tonight a world divided--we are a Nation becalmed. We have lost the brisk pace of diversity and the genius of individual creativity. We are plodding along at a pace set by centralized planning, red tape, rules without responsibility, and regimentation without recourse.', 'Rather than useful jobs in our country, our people have been offered bureaucratic ""make work,"" rather than moral leadership, they have been given bread and circuses. They have been given spectacles, and, yes, they have even been given scandals. Tonight there is violence in our streets, corruption in our highest offices, aimlessness amongst our youth, anxiety among our elders and there is a virtual despair among the many who look beyond material success for the inner meaning of their lives. And where examples of morality should be set, the opposite is seen. Small men, seeking great wealth or power, have too often and too long turned even the highest levels of public service into mere personal opportunity.', 'Now, certainly, simple honesty is not too much to demand of men in government. We find it in most. Republicans demand it from everyone. They demand it from everyone no matter how exalted or protected his position might be. The growing menace in our country tonight, to personal safety, to life, to limb and property, in homes, in churches, on the playgrounds, and places of business, particularly in our great cities, is the mounting concern, or should be, of every thoughtful citizen in the United States.', 'Security from domestic violence, no less than from foreign aggression, is the most elementary and fundamental purpose of any government. And a government that cannot fulfill this purpose is one that cannot long command the loyalty of its citizens. History shows us--demonstrates that nothing, nothing prepares the way for tyranny more than the failure of public officials to keep the streets safe from bullies and marauders.', 'Now, we Republicans see all this as more, much more, than the result of mere political differences or mere political mistakes. We see this as the result of a fundamentally and absolutely wrong view of man, his nature and his destiny. Those who seek to live your lives for you, to take your liberties in return for relieving you of yours, those who elevate the state and downgrade the citizen must see ultimately a world in which earthly power can be substituted for divine will. And this Nation, this nation was founded upon the rejection of that notion and upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom.', 'Now those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth. And let me remind you, they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyrannies. Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. Their mistaken course stems from false notions, ladies and gentlemen, of equality. Equality, rightly understood, as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences. Wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.', 'Fellow Republicans, it is the cause of Republicanism to resist concentrations of power, private or public, which enforce such conformity and inflict such despotism. It is the cause of Republicanism to ensure that power remains in the hands of the people. And, so help us God, that is exactly what a Republican president will do with the help of a Republican Congress.', ""It is further the cause of Republicanism to restore a clear understanding of the tyranny of man over man in the world at large. It is our cause to dispel the foggy thinking which avoids hard decisions in the delusion that a world of conflict will somehow mysteriously resolve itself into a world of harmony, if we just don't rock the boat or irritate the forces of aggression--and this is hogwash."", 'It is further the cause of Republicanism to remind ourselves, and the world, that only the strong can remain free, that only the strong can keep the peace.', ""Now, I needn't remind you, or my fellow Americans regardless of party, that Republicans have shouldered this hard responsibility and marched in this cause before. It was Republican leadership under Dwight Eisenhower that kept the peace, and passed along to this administration the mightiest arsenal for defense the world has ever known. And I needn't remind you that it was the strength and the unbelievable will of the Eisenhower years that kept the peace by using our strength, by using it in the Formosa Straits and in Lebanon and by showing it courageously at all times."", 'It was during those Republican years that the thrust of Communist imperialism was blunted. It was during those years of Republican leadership that this world moved closer, not to war, but closer to peace, than at any other time in the last three decades.', ""And I needn't remind you--but I will--that it's been during Democratic years that our strength to deter war has stood still, and even gone into a planned decline. It has been during Democratic years that we have weakly stumbled into conflict, timidly refusing to draw our own lines against aggression, deceitfully refusing to tell even our own people of our full participation, and tragically, letting our finest men die on battlefields unmarked by purpose, unmarked by pride or the prospect of victory."", ""Yesterday it was Korea. Tonight it is Vietnam. Make no bones of this. Don't try to sweep this under the rug. We are at war in Vietnam. And yet the President, who is the Commander-in-Chief of our forces, refuses to say--refuses to say, mind you, whether or not the objective over there is victory. And his Secretary of Defense continues to mislead and misinform the American people, and enough of it has gone by."", ""And I needn't remind you, but I will; it has been during Democratic years that a billion persons were cast into Communist captivity and their fate cynically sealed."", 'Today, today in our beloved country we have an administration which seems eager to deal with communism in every coin known--from gold to wheat, from consulates to confidences, and even human freedom itself.', 'Now, the Republican cause demands that we brand communism as a principal disturber of peace in the world today. Indeed, we should brand it as the only significant disturber of the peace, and we must make clear that until its goals of conquest are absolutely renounced and its relations with all nations tempered, communism and the governments it now controls are enemies of every man on earth who is or wants to be free.', ""Now, we here in America can keep the peace only if we remain vigilant and only if we remain strong. Only if we keep our eyes open and keep our guard up can we prevent war. And I want to make this abundantly clear--I don't intend to let peace or freedom be torn from our grasp because of lack of strength or lack of will--and that I promise you, Americans."", 'I believe that we must look beyond the defense of freedom today to its extension tomorrow. I believe that the communism which boasts it will bury us will, instead, give way to the forces of freedom. And I can see in the distant, and yet recognizable future, the outlines of a world worthy our dedication, our every risk, our every effort, our every sacrifice along the way. Yes, a world that will redeem the suffering of those who will be liberated from tyranny. I can see, and I suggest that all thoughtful men must contemplate, the flowering of an Atlantic civilization, the whole of Europe reunified and free, trading openly across its borders, communicating openly across the world. This is a goal far, far more meaningful than a moon shot.', 'It\'s a truly inspiring goal for all free men to set for themselves during the latter half of the twentieth century. I can see--and all free men must thrill to--the events of this Atlantic civilization joined by its great ocean highway to the United States. What a destiny, what a destiny can be ours to stand as a great central pillar linking Europe, the Americans and the venerable and vital peoples and cultures of the Pacific. I can see a day when all the Americas, North and South, will be linked in a mighty system, a system in which the errors and misunderstandings of the past will be submerged one by one in a rising tide of prosperity and interdependence. We know that the misunderstandings of centuries are not to be wiped away in a day or wiped away in an hour. But we pledge--we pledge that human sympathy--what our neighbors to the South call that attitude of ""simpatico""--no less than enlightened self\'-interest will be our guide.', 'I can see this Atlantic civilization galvanizing and guiding emergent nations everywhere.', 'Now I know this freedom is not the fruit of every soil. I know that our own freedom was achieved through centuries, by unremitting efforts of brave and wise men. And, I know that the road to freedom is a long and a challenging road. And I know also that some men may walk away from it, that some men resist challenge, accepting the false security of governmental paternalism.', ""And I pledge that the America I envision in the years ahead will extend its hand in health, in teaching and in cultivation, so that all new nations will be at least encouraged, encouraged, to go our way, so that they will not wander down the dark alleys of tyranny or the dead-end streets of collectivism. My fellow Republicans, we do no man a service by hiding freedom's light under a bushel of mistaken humility."", 'I seek an America proud of its past, proud of its ways, proud of its dreams, and determined actively to proclaim them. But our example to the world must, like charity, begin at home.', 'In our vision of a good and decent future, free and peaceful, there must be room, room for the liberation of the energy and the talent of the individual--otherwise our vision is blind at the outset.', 'We must assure a society here which, while never abandoning the needy or forsaking the helpless, nurtures incentives and opportunities for the creative and the productive. We must know the whole good is the product of many single contributions.', 'And, I cherish a day when our children once again will restore as heroes the sort of men and women who, unafraid and undaunted, pursue the truth, strive to cure disease, subdue and make fruitful our natural environment, and produce the inventive engines of production, science, and technology.', 'This Nation, whose creative people have enhanced this entire span of history, should again thrive upon the greatness of all those things which we, we as individual citizens, can and should do. And, during Republican years, this again will be a nation of men and women, of families proud of their roles, jealous of their responsibilities, unlimited in their aspirations--a Nation where all who can will be self-reliant.', 'We Republicans see in our constitutional form of government the great framework which assures the orderly but dynamic fulfillment of the whole man, and we see the whole man as the great reason for instituting orderly government in the first place.', ""We see, we see in private property and in economy based upon and fostering private property, the one way to make government a durable ally of the whole man, rather than his determined enemy. We see in the sanctity of private property the only durable foundation for constitutional government in a free society. And, and beyond that, we see in cherished diversity of ways, diversity of thoughts, of motives and accomplishments. We don't seek to lead anyone's life for him. We only seek to secure his rights, guarantee him opportunity to strive, with government performing only those needed and constitutionally sanctioned tasks which cannot otherwise be performed."", ""We Republicans seek a government that attends to its inherent responsibilities of maintaining a stable monetary and fiscal climate, encouraging a free and a competitive economy and enforcing law and order. Thus do we seek inventiveness, diversity, and creative difference within a stable order. For we Republicans define government's role where needed at many, many levels, preferably through the one closest to the people involved."", 'Our towns and our cities, then our counties, then our states, then our regional compacts--and only then, the national government. That, let me remind you, is the ladder of liberty, built by decentralized power. On it also we must have balance between the branches of government at every level.', 'Balance, diversity, creative difference--these are the elements of the Republican equation. Republicans agree, Republicans agree heartily to disagree on many, many of their applications, but we have never disagreed on the basic fundamental issues of why you and I are Republicans.', 'This is a party, this Republican Party, is a Party for free men, not for blind followers, and not for conformists.', 'Back in 1858, Abraham Lincoln said this of the Republican party, and I, I quote him, because he probably could have said it during the last week or so: ""It was composed of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements."" End of the quote in 1958 [sic]. Yet all of these elements agreed on one paramount objective: To arrest the progress of slavery, and place it in the course of ultimate extinction.', ""Today, as then, but more urgently and more broadly than then, the task of preserving and enlarging freedom at home and of safeguarding it from the forces of tyranny abroad is great enough to challenge all our resources and to require all our strength. Anyone who joins us in all sincerity, we welcome. Those who do not care for our cause, we don't expect to enter our ranks in any case. And let our Republicanism, so focused and so dedicated, not be made fuzzy and futile by unthinking and stupid labels."", 'I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.', 'The beauty of the very system we Republicans are pledged to restore and revitalize, the beauty of this Federal system of ours, is in its reconciliation of diversity with unity. We must not see malice in honest differences of opinion, and no matter how great, so long as they are not inconsistent with the pledges we have given to each other in and through our Constitution. Our Republican cause is not to level out the world or make its people conform in computer-regimented sameness. Our Republican cause is to free our people and light the way for liberty throughout the world.', 'Ours is a very human cause for very humane goals.', 'This Party, its good people, and its unquenchable devotion to freedom, will not fulfill the purposes of this campaign which we launch here now until our cause has won the day, inspired the world, and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears.', 'I repeat, I accept your nomination with humbleness, with pride, and you and I are going to fight for the goodness of our land. Thank you.']"
2,Barry Goldwater ,"November 04, 1964","[""I've waited 'til now to make any statement about this election because I wanted to find out more of the details of the vote—not just the total but the spread of it, what it might portend at this very early date."", ""I know many of you expected me to make some statement last night but I held that off. I sent the President the following wire, which I think will be available for you if you don't have it now:"", '""To President Lyndon Johnson in Johnson City, Tex.\n', '""Congratulations on your victory. I will help you in any way that I can toward achieving a growing and better America and a secure and dignified peace. The role of the Republican Party will remain in that temper but it also remains the party of opposition when opposition is called for. There is much to be done with Vietnam, Cuba, the problem of law and order in this country, and a productive economy. Communism remains our No. 1 obstacle to peace and I know that all Americans will join with you in honest solutions to these problems.""', ""I have no bitterness, no rancor at all. I say to the President as a fellow politician that he did a wonderful job. He put together a vote total that's larger than has ever been gained in this country."", ""However, it's interesting to me and very surprising to me that the latest figures that I can get do not reach the totals of the 1960 election. I am disappointed in this because I thought that the American people would have turned out in greater numbers than they seem to have done."", 'But he did a good job and I have to congratulate him on it.', 'Also I want to express my gratitude to the more than 25 million people in this country who not necessarily voted for me but they voted for a philosophy that I represent, a Republican philosophy that I believe the Republican party must cling to and strengthen in the years ahead.', 'I want to thank all of you across this nation who turned out in those numbers to support my candidacy and that of Bill Miller and the Republican party.', ""I don't think that I've ever seen more dedicated people in my life, people who worked as hard or who worked as long and produced the results that they did. These people are dedicated to, as I say, the Republican philosophy."", ""There is a two-party system in this country and we're going to keep it. We're going to devote our days and the years ahead to strengthening the Republican party, to getting more people into it and I feel that the young people coming along will provide the army that we need."", ""This effort that we engaged in last Jan. 3 turns out to be a much longer effort than we thought. It's not an effort that we can drop now nor do we have any intentions of dropping it now."", ""I will devote—being unemployed as of Jan. 3 or thereabouts—I'll have a lot of time to devote to this party, to its leadership and to the strengthening of the party, and that I have every intention of doing. I want to just ask the people in this country who worked so hard in this election not to be despondent, that we have a job to do and let's get along with it, because there are many questions that have to be answered."", ""I'm very hopeful that the President will, now that the election is over, get along with the answers that we've sought during the campaign—the answers about Vietnam, about Cuba, about Communism—Communism's continuing growth all around the world—about the growing tendency to the control of our economy and our daily lives in this country."", ""As I said in my wire, anything that I can do—and I'm sure that I speak for all Americans—anything that we can do to help the President get along with the solutions to these problems, we're ready, willing and able to do."", 'Now with that I have nothing further to say. I will entertain a few questions—not any prolonged period at it. Mr. Wagner will recognize.', 'Q. Senator, sir, you said before you formally announced for the Presidency, you said that you hoped that if you ran you would not run so bad a race that you would hurt the conservative cause. Do you now think that you have hurt the conservative cause?', ""Senator Goldwater. No, I don't feel that the conservative cause has been hurt. Twenty?five million votes are a lot of votes and a lot of people dedicated to the concept of conservatism. I don't think it's been hurt at all."", 'Q. Have the Republican voters not shared in repudiating this philosophy you say the party must cling to?', ""Senator Goldwater. Well, unfortunately I think you're right—that my defeat to some degree, although I wouldn't say a major degree, was occasioned by Republicans in this country who would not vote for the—or work, I should say—for the top of the ticket. Now this is in direct contrast to times when the conservatives did not win at the convention, when we would go out and work our hearts out for the more liberal or moderate members of the Republican party."", ""But I don't—this is not a repudiation. This was announced. They announced this as soon as the convention was over, and I think they're entitled to do what they want but I don't think we can build a Republican party on their concepts, which in my opinion have no difference at all with the Democratic concepts."", ""Q. Senator, this is already being interpreted by other Republicans around the country as a crushing disaster not only because of the size of the Johnson vote but because of the Governors that went down, the Senatorial candidates who lost, the loss of I guess of some 30 seats in the House. What's your feeling on that?"", ""Senator Goldwater. Well, I haven't seen the totals on that end of it yet. I can't tell you how many Governors lost or won. I think if some Governors had—and some Senators and some Congressmen had—more actively supported the ticket they would have been better off."", ""You cannot in this game of politics fight your own party. It just doesn't work. We made some good gains in the South in the Congress, which I think we would have made anyway, but we made them."", ""Q. Senator, if I understand you correctly, you're going to stay in as leader of your party. Well, perhaps it's too early to ask you this, but do you conceive that you might be willing to run again in 1968?"", ""Senator Goldwater. Oh, that's a long time off, and again this would be at the wish of the party. It would be my guess that my role would be better played in helping the party organize, in continuing to raise money for it so that it can operate."", 'As of now I would think that they probably would pick another man to run and as of now that would be fine with me.', 'Q. Senator, do you expect there would be any effort over the next couple of years by some of the Republicans who did not support you enthusiastically to attempt to wrest the leadership of the party from you?', 'Senator Goldwater. Well, I would expect that but you have to keep this in mind. As Jim Farley said the other night, the leadership of the party—the rebuilding of the party — rests with the ticket that was picked at the National Convention, win, lose or draw. And I would see my position here as working with the leadership of the Republican members of the House and the Senate. This is the historic place where the real political power rests.', 'There is no such thing as a titular head of a party out of power. The head—the leadership—is to be found to be with Charlie Halleck and with Everett Dirksen in the House and the Senate. I would be working with them hand?in glove to build a party.', 'Q. Senator, who would you name as among the two or three leading Republican Presidential possibilities for 1968 in the wake of the situation yesterday?', ""Senator Goldwater. Oh, I wouldn't—I have nobody in mind. That's a long time—a long ways—off, four years from yesterday. I wouldn't want to guess anything."", ""Q. Senator, can you tell us a little bit about your immediate plans and then about your plans for after you're unemployed, what you are going to do to maintain this leadership, whether you're going to write, or what?"", ""Senator Goldwater. Well, my immediate plans, I think Peggy and I'll take a little rest someplace, although we're not tired. I don't know where we'll go but we'll go someplace and then I have the problem of moving my effects out of my office in Washington, a rather sizable job. So I don't know what the plans will be after the vacation. We'll come back and be here and just then we'll make our plans."", 'Q. Senator, was there any single factor during the course of the campaign which you think most substantially contributed to your defeat yesterday?', ""Senator Goldwater. No, I was thinking about that this morning when we were talking. I can't think of any major mistake that we made. There's always minor mistakes that you make, regardless of whether you win or lose. I think this just proves that regardless of who the candidate is, it's growing increasingly difficult to upset a man who is in the White House with his tremendous base to start with of Federal employees — not that they all vote for him. The base that he starts with—oh, the power of investigation, the power of news and his ability to control news."", ""I think that the Republicans have to realize that they're up against something that we have seen developing in this country for many years but never have seen it in the nature and the proportion that we saw it this time. It's not—we're not running elections any more as we used to, and I think we have to study new techniques. We have to get closer to the news, closer to you fellows who handle the news, We have to be constantly on television, and so forth and so on, to build over four years some kind of a — Hi, Priscilla, I didn't see you back there — some kind of a machine that can cope with this vast power of the Federal machine."", 'Q. Senator, last night Paul Fannin said that he felt your defeat was due to your treatment by the press. Do you believe that is true?', ""Senator Goldwater. No, I don't think that the working press—I don't think that you fellows, as I said the other night—you've been — I think you've been fair. I realize that you have your own prejudices. Some of you believe in what I say and some of you don't and this is bound to be reflected both ways."", ""I do think, though, that the attempt by the—oh, you might say the columnists, that angle, that end of the press, both TV, radio and in the papers have hurt, because I've never seen or heard in my life such vitriolic unbased attacks on one man as has been directed to me."", ""Now you fellows in the working press haven't done that but I think if—oh, the things I've been called right down the line although sometimes they didn't spell it out—coward, uneducated, ungentlemanly, a bigot and all those things — I never in my life have seen such inflammatory language as has been used by some men who know better, who should write better, who should have enough decency, common ordinary manners about them to know that no man in this country, for example, is ever going to start a war, that no man in this country is ever going to deny anybody what they have coming to them."", 'I think these people should frankly hang their heads in shame because I think they made the fourth estate a rather sad, sorry mess.', 'Q. What are your personal feelings now that you have to leave Washington?', ""Senator Goldwater. Well, I've got a heaven to come home to. Not everybody has. I don't—I'm going to miss the Senate. Any man would. It's a wonderful experience. I wouldn't trade those 12 years for anything in the world. I'm going to keep my apartment in Washington. I don't know what I'll do with it. I'm not seeking any employment there, but I'll miss the Senate and I'll be awfully glad to get back home."", ""Thank you. In closing, I want to tell you that we're trying to get the 727 to stay until Friday and if that's the case you fellows can have another day out here in the sun. A lot of you look like you can use it."", ""And I want to thank publicly Jack Stewart for the use of the hall. Jack, we appreciate all that you've done. And again I want to tell all of you fellows of the press, the radio and TV that regardless of how you feel toward me I have a friendly, warm feeling toward all of you and I hope to see you again somewhere down the pike. Thank you.""]"
