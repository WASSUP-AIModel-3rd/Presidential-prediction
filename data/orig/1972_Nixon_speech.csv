0,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1969","['Ladies and gentlemen:', 'All I can say is that that is quite a welcome for an outside agitator.', 'On this visit to the Roanoke Valley-and I know I am in Salem, incidentally, and not in Roanoke--I can assure you that it is a great honor to be here, to have this wonderful welcome, to remember the time that I was here in 1960 with one of the largest--according to Dick Poff, the largest--political crowd that had ever been gathered in this part of the State, either before or since.', 'Tonight as I stand before you, I realize that you are here because not only would you like to hear from the President of the United States, but because you are vitally concerned in the election of your next Governor and his campaign team.', ""Just so I can lay to rest--I know of very friendly comments of some of the opposition with regard to outsiders. I want you to know something: I don't think the President of the United States is an outsider in any country or any State in this Nation."", 'I can particularly say that in the State of Virginia, because when I happened to have the privilege to be on the ticket in 1952 and 1956, that ticket carried Virginia, and in 1960 and 1968 we carried Virginia.', 'Also, for those of you who would like a little historical reference, you might be interested to know that except for my native State of California, and for Washington, D.C., I have lived in the State of Virginia longer than any other State of the Union, because my wife and I were very proud and happy to live in Arlington, Virginia, in the year 1942 before I went into the Navy, and then for 5 years during the years I was a Congressman, and for 1 year when I was a Senator we also lived in Arlington.', 'So I speak to you as a former Virginian speaking for the next Governor of the State of Virginia.', ""I also want you to know that it has been a very great privilege for me to come here in the company of my colleagues--I call them my colleagues, because having started in the House of Representatives all Congressmen are really, I feel, my colleagues--who are here from the House. They came down on the plane with me. They are going back with me to continue the Nation's business in the Halls of Congress."", 'They have been introduced already. Most of them are from districts other than this one, of course: Bill Whitehurst, Bill Scott, Bill Wampler--Joel Broyhill would be here except that he is making a speech in another part of the State. I could speak about all of them. They are a fine team.', 'But I do want to say in his home county and in his own area, that among the leaders of the Congress on the Republican and Democrat side, there is not a man who has a higher standing and higher respect from his colleagues than your own Congressman, Dick Poff, of the State of Virginia, and particularly in that great field of law enforcement which is such an important objective for this administration, a field in which all we need from this Congress are the laws to be passed, laws that deal with narcotics, laws that deal with obscenity, laws that deal with organized crime, particularly in this field he is one of the real experts.', 'If the Congress follows his leadership, the Congress will give your new administration the laws that it needs to deal with those problems, and I am sure that is what all Virginians and all Americans want at this time in our history.', 'I am proud also to be here because not only do I speak for Lin Holton, but for the whole ticket, for Buz Dawbarn,1 for Dick Obenshain.2 I have spoken with them before. This is a fine team, and later on when I finish, I want them all to come up here so you can show that you are for the whole team, from the top to the bottom, just as I am. I am happy also to speak here because', 'I like the distaff side of the Holton team. I think that Jinks [Mrs. A. Linwood] Holton is one of the best campaigners that I have ever seen on the campaign trail. She will make a great first lady of the State of Virginia.', 'Also I am happy to be here because of some personal matters that have already been referred to in the press, and that I would like to speak to you just briefly about this evening.', 'This is the first time since becoming President that I have gone into any State or into any district speaking specifically for a candidate. I think you wonder why I came to Virginia.', 'Well, first I was invited; second I have a great respect for the man who is running for Governor. I have respect for him first as a man. He ran once before in 1965. It was a hard race. There was very little chance for him to win. He knew it, but he ran. He ran well, and he came back to run again, and I know what it means to lose and then to win, and he is going to win, too. It is that kind of comeback spirit that the people of Virginia like in their political leaders, and that kind of spirit he has.', 'Also, I remember that when I became a candidate for the Presidency, then for the nomination, he was one of the first to support me, and of course I appreciated that. And I suppose that that is enough reason to come into a State for a man, the fact that he has been your friend, the fact that you do happen to admire him.', 'But my support for him goes to much more important issues than those, important as those are. It goes to something else that he has referred to. It goes to the philosophy of the man. I like the way he talks. I like what he stands for. I like the fact that Lin Holton is not a man of the past, but a man for the future of Virginia, and that is what the people of Virginia want. Because, my friends, there is a new era beginning in national politics.', 'We are going to provide the leadership in Washington, D.C., for that new era, for a new relationship between the States and the Federal Government, for a relationship which this State and the people of this State have always believed in and which they deeply want, I am sure, now.', 'It is called the New Federalism. Lin Holton has referred to it; Dick Poff has referred to it. Let me put it to you quite directly. During the campaign some of you may have heard me say right in this State that after 40 years of power going from the people and from the States to Washington, D.C., it was time to have it turn around and have the power come from Washington back to the States and back to the people of the United States of America.', 'Now, the fact that I said that was not an unusual thing, because I want to tell you something--for 50 years politicians in both parties have been talking that way, saying that we had to decentralize government, saying that power should go back to the States, but for 50 years nobody has really done anything about it until this administration came to power, and we are doing something about it.', 'We have offered the most revolutionary legislation in the history of the Republic in this respect. Too much power is in Washington. Governors today, in order to get what they need for their States have to go hat in hand to the Halls of Congress or to the West Wing of the White House. This should stop. That is why we say that a portion of the Federal revenues, because the Federal Government has the greatest tax base, should now be shared with the States without strings, so that the people of the States and the Governors of the States can do and spend the money the way the States want it rather than the way the people in Washington, D.C., want it.', 'Also, that is why in this program for the first time since power began to flow to Washington we have through our manpower training program--we have asked the Congress to provide the means whereby a billion dollar program for the training of manpower, training people for jobs, a billion dollars which is now spent by the Federal Government will be distributed to the States so that they can make those decisions and do that training because, believe me, the States know better how to train manpower than does the Federal Government in Washington, D.C.', 'I could give other examples. Whether it is in the field of water pollution, whether it is in the field of the environment, and all of the others you have been hearing about, a new relationship is developing.', 'This administration is for it in Washington and what we need in the States are men, men with new ideas, men with progressive ideas, men who will recognize as Dick Poff said a moment ago, not only States rights, but States responsibilities, men who will look to the future and who, as they get the funds that will be made available to them over the next years, will use those funds wisely and effectively for the people of those States.', 'That is the way this country began. That was certainly the dream of the Founding Fathers, and it is that dream now that is necessary if this country is going to be able to govern itself effectively in the future because government in Washington is too big, I know. Government in Washington is too inefficient and there is only one way to cure it, through redistributing that power by sending from Washington to the States the funds and those powers which can better be handled by the States.', 'Let me say in that connection, in Lin Holton you have a man who believes in this program. I believe in it at the Federal level. You have a man who will know what to do with it as we work together in years ahead, and you have a man who in my opinion will lead this State among the first ranks of all the States of the Union with the new programs, as the State of Virginia should be an example with its great political tradition, an example to all the other States.', 'Now, my friends, could I also leave one other thought with you? I noted the reference tonight to the two-party system. I noted the reference tonight to the fact that all the people of Virginia should have a chance to participate in politics. I recognize the tradition in this State that goes back for many years of one-party government. I recognize, too, that under that tradition this State has produced some fine political leaders. But I know this: Whether it is in business, or whether it is in the athletic field or whether it is in politics, it is better to have competition because the better the competition, the better the man who wins and that is what you are going to have with Lin Holton and the two-party government.', 'For Virginia, which has provided for this whole Nation this great heritage of democracy, for it to set the example for the whole Southland, for it to set the example of a real two-party system and two-party responsibility, this will serve Virginia well, but it will also serve the Nation well.', ""Finally, one other thought that impresses me as I speak to this great crowd here--and speaking of a great crowd, when we stopped in at the airport, I thought that was where the rally was, there were as many there as there are here. After we got in the car Lin Holton took me down a bit. He said they were just there to see Air Force One, to see whether it would make it or not. But in any event we made it. I don't know whether it will get off or not, but we got in."", 'I was going to say that one of the things that impressed me at that airport, one of the things that impresses me about this crowd tonight, is the great number of young people who are here. That is one of the reasons that I think Lin Holton will win, and deserves to win.', 'His wife told me that the campaign headquarters is primarily staffed by volunteers from 20 to 30 years of age. This means that a vote for Holton is a vote for the future.', 'It reminds me of one of my favorite stories about the two-party system and how it developed in the neighboring State of Tennessee where they have always had, as you have in Virginia now, some Republicans, but where it has not been particularly an asset to have that party label.', 'Howard Baker, the fine young Republican Senator, said that after a very stirring speech to an audience in one of his campaigns a very old man came up to him and said: ""Son, for all my life up to this time I have voted the straight Democratic ticket because that is the way my grandfather would have wanted me to vote. But,"" he said, ""this year I am voting Republican because that is the way my grandson wants me to vote.""', 'My friends, I say to you tonight, I do not put the case for Lin Holton on the basis of my personal friendship or on the basis of my partisan affiliation and his. I put it it on the basis of the man. He is the best man for the job.', 'Democrats or Republicans will vote for the best man for the job. I am convinced that measuring the man, measuring the times and the need of the times, the people of Virginia will be convinced that here is the man who will provide the new look, the new leadership, the new strength that Virginia should have. That is what you want. That is why his campaign is rolling and that is why it will roll on, in my opinion, to victory on next Tuesday.', 'I say to you finally on a personal note that I am most grateful for your very warm welcome this evening, for this great demonstration of support for a fine candidate and for also the personal welcome you have given to me.', 'I only regret that my wife could not have been with me. She unfortunately is a victim of the flu bug. She went to New York on Sunday to dedicate the final wing of the Juilliard School of Music at the Lincoln Center--I am not blaming the flu bug on New York, incidentally--but nevertheless she has been in bed since. She sends her best to all of you.', 'My daughter Tricia will be in Friday to campaign in northern Virginia.', 'I just leave this final thought. I am convinced as I stand here that we are at a watershed period in the history of this Nation, in the Federal-State relationship and at a watershed time in the history of Virginia. Something is happening in this State. I can feel it in this room. I sensed it at that airport. I can feel it in the enthusiasm of these candidates. Something is happening, and you are going to help make it happen.', 'I say to you: Go out and work for these men. Vote for them because as you work and vote for them you can be proud of your vote. You can be proud of Virginia and believe me, I will be proud to work as President of the United States with Lin Holton, the next Governor of the State of Virginia.']"
1,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1969","['I would just like to take a moment of your time to thank you all for giving me such a wonderful welcome on my return to Virginia and to Roanoke.', 'I well recall that my first speech in Virginia in a campaign was in 1952. It was in Roanoke. Some of you here are old enough to remember that, I am sure.', ""I recall out there in the football field that day that Dick Poff [Representative Richard H. Poff of Virginia] said it was the biggest crowd you have ever had in Roanoke or in Virginia; isn't that right?"", 'REPRESENTATIVE POFF. It Was the largest crowd before or since assembled for a political gathering, Mr. President.', ""THE PRESIDENT. I was going to say that I understood that the rally was going to be downtown. I don't know how anybody could be there when you are all out here."", 'But I do want you to know that coming back to this State and to this city and to this part of this State is a very heartwarming thing for me. I only wish that my wife could be here with me. She was with me on all the previous occasions, but for the last 2 days she has been down in bed with the flu bug. But she sends her very best and knows that the ""Ladies for Lin"" are going to come through for Holton.', 'Finally, as I will say a little later at the rally downtown, generally a President does not find it possible to go into all of the contests and all of the campaigns that he would like to. This is the first time that I have made an appearance since becoming President of the United States in behalf of a candidate. And I am proud that it is in behalf of Lin Holton, proud because he is my friend, proud because, of course, he happens to be a member of my party, but proud also because he is one of those new, young leaders of this country who will make all Virginians proud of him. I look forward to working with him when he is Governor of this State. Thank you very much for sending him there.']"
2,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1969","['I want to express my appreciation to all of you for giving me such a warm welcome on a return to Morris County, and, also, as I speak to you here this evening briefly--because, as you know, we are going on to Hackensack, and I also understand we are going to even talk to the area of Monmouth County by telephone tonight, so we will make three meetings before I get back to Washington--I want you to know that it is a great privilege to be here on this platform with the whole New Jersey delegation, Republican delegation from Washington, D.C.', 'I could mention them all--Cliff Case, the Senator from New Jersey, who has spoken so eloquently for the candidacy of our candidate, Bill Cahill.', ""I could speak, too, of all the Congressmen, but this is after all, Peter Frelinghuysen's district, and I am so glad to be here in this district again."", 'I want to say, too, that he has given me all the background about the district. He told me we would get a good welcome. We certainly did. I thought the rally was at the airport. All the way along there were huge crowds.', 'And I mention to you something that I did learn from him on the way up. This is the first time in history that a President of the United States has ever spoken in Morris County. I am glad to be the first President to do that. Because even during the time that Woodrow Wilson was President--as you know, he went to the Presidency from the Governorship of this State--he never spoke here while he was the President. So I would like to be first in that respect.', 'And I have something to say to you today. I can say it very briefly. I can say it very much from the heart. I want to tell you why.', 'In 1960, when I was a candidate for President the first time, I had a very busy year. There were very few times that I could go out and make speeches for others. I was too busy speaking for myself. But in that year, I remember that a young Congressman came to me from Camden, New Jersey. He had been in only one term. He had had a close race.', 'And he said, ""Will you come over to Camden for a fund-raising dinner?"" Some way or other, he appealed to me, the way he talked, the cut of his jib, that good Irish smile. And I said, ""Yeah, I will do it.""', 'Well, I went over to Camden. And I remember it was such an exciting, really joyful meeting. There was a spirit there that I sense here tonight, and that I sensed in those crowds--people like Bill Cahill, because he is a fine man and that is one of the reasons he is going to be elected Governor of the State of New Jersey.', 'It is hard to realize now that I am speaking in behalf of an 11-year veteran of the House of Representatives, one of the most respected men in the whole Congress, a man that is respected by the Republicans, of course, his own party, but respected by the Democrats as well; a man that is respected because he has integrity, he is an honest man, a fine man, and a hardworking man; a man who is respected because of that wonderful family--and that tells you something about the man, too-but a man also who is respected because of his record in the Congress of the United States.', 'Now, naturally, you would expect me to say nice things about him tonight. And I am not going to disappoint you in that expectation.', ""But I want you to know, my friends, that when I look at that record, when I see 11 years on the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives where he has the first-hand experience in the field of law enforcement and crime, when I see that he preceded that with experience in the FBI, when I know that one of the issues in this State, perhaps not in this county, but in this State, is the issue of law enforcement, is the issue of control of crime, just as it is the issue across the Nation, I say there isn't a better man in the Congress or in this country better qualified to deal with crime than Bill Cahill. And I look forward to working with him."", 'But there are other great problems and I speak of them only briefly--the problem of education to which he referred. We know the proud tradition of this State in the field of education, higher education, the great universities that it has and the great colleges.', 'We know also that this State, in recent years, has had problems with regard to maintaining educational quality, particularly at the secondary and primary level.', ""Here is a man who understands that problem. Here is a man who has a program for the future for it. Here is a man who doesn't have to defend what didn't happen in the last 16 years and tell you what is going to happen for the next 8 years. And that is the kind of a man you want in the field."", 'So it is with the other subjects that I could mention, transportation. He has gotten out there. He has been in the traffic. He knows what it is. He knows what the problems are. He knows the needs of this State, and he will meet those needs.', 'He also is a man who knows of the new issues. The young people will know now what I am talking about: the whole area of the environment, the problem of pollution, the problem of the quality of life, the problem of our consumers, all of these, those that people are talking about, those that people want new action about. He knows about that and I am for him for those reasons.', ""But I want to add one other word: I believe Bill Cahill is the man for the times, the man for the job, because, you see, whether you ever mention any of these problems--the problems of education, the problems of the environment, the problems of transportation, all of the rest-what we conclude is that the old ways won't do; what we conclude is that the old leadership won't do. It has failed."", 'We need reform--reform of State government, reform of Federal Government. And I am proud of the fact that in this administration we have sent to the Congress the most significant series of reform requests ever submitted by a Chief Executive over the past 25 years.', 'I am proud of the fact that after 40 years of leaders talking about revenue sharing with the States, we have submitted a program for revenue sharing with the States so that it will reduce your tax burden, which is one of the highest in the whole Nation.', 'After 40 years of everybody talking about turning from the Federal Government, turning some of the functions now being handled at that level back to the States, we have come forth with the program in job training where a $1 billion program is going to be turned back to the States.', 'I am proud of the fact that in the field of pollution, in the field of transportation, in the field of highways, that a new relationship is being developed by our administration. It will be developed with the help of the Congress, with its cooperation, in which the States and the people get control of their government once again, in which Governors do not have to go to Washington hat-in-hand and pace the floors of Congress or the corridors, as the case might be, or come to the White House, but where they will have the opportunity to develop the strong leadership here in these programs.', 'Now let me conclude with this thought: You see, if revenues are going to be shared by the Federal Government with the States, if the Federal Government is going to turn back to the States, as it should, the functions that the States can handle better, if we are going to have progress in all these fields, we need a new, strong State leadership. We need a man who is a man of the seventies, a man who shares the convictions that I have just now expressed and that he has expressed before me, a man who will look at the problems of education and the problems of environment and the problems of transportation and the problems of law enforcement and who will brush aside all the failures of the past and say, ""Here is a new way. Here is a better way."" That is Bill Cahill.', 'And, my friends, I want to say one other thing. I know this is Morris County. I know that in this county being a Republican is a great asset. I know that I carried the county by 33,000 votes, and that helped us carry the State by 60,000 votes.', 'I know, too, as I speak in Morris County, when all you would really have to do is say, ""He is a Republican; vote for him for he is a Republican."" I want to say that isn\'t enough of a reason, and it isn\'t the only reason that I think he deserves your support.', 'Whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat, or an Independent, he is the man for the job. That is the way the people of New Jersey are thinking, that is the way they vote, and that is why he is going to win.', ""I look back over the history of this State, and you know I think you would be interested to know that in my office I had a choice of the desk I could have of the former Presidents. I chose Woodrow Wilson's. I chose his desk not because he was a Democrat, as he was, but because he was one of my favorite Presidents. And I have that desk now."", 'Before I came up here, as I was sitting there making some notes, I thought of the great Governors of the State of New Jersey. He was one of the greatest Governors of this State. He was a reform Governor when New Jersey needed reform.', 'At that period in its history, New Jersey needed a Democratic Governor because the Republicans had not provided the leadership they should.', 'And then time went by, and in another 40 years another Governor came on. This time it was a Republican. It was Al Driscoll.1 He gave the State reform. My friends, now 16 years have passed since those years. Now this State needs reform again. And in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson, in the tradition of At Driscoll, you have got the man, Bill Cahill.', 'What I say to you is that Bill Cahill is ready to lead New Jersey and the people of New Jersey are ready for Bill Cahill.']"
3,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1969","['Congressman Cahill, Mrs. Cahill, Congressman Frelinghuysen, Senator Case-I am being very formal with all of my colleagues and former colleagues--Mr. Mayor:', 'I do want you to know that this is a wonderfully heartwarming welcome.', ""And I think I got a little bit of bad advance dope about this meeting, Peter [H. B. Frelinghuysen]. I thought the rally was downtown. I didn't know it was out here."", 'And I think also you will be interested to note that my background information told me some interesting background with regard to this county and the visits of Presidents. This is a county which has been very good to Republican candidates. It was very good to me in 1960 and in 1968.', 'But I think you will be interested to know this is the first time in history that a President of the United States has ever visited Morris County. I am glad to be here.', 'I have had the privilege of visiting this county as a candidate on other occasions. And I have always had a wonderful welcome. But, believe me, this tops them all. And we are most grateful.', 'I simply want to leave with you, if I can, one thought: I am here not in my own behalf, but in behalf of a man for whom I have very great respect. I like Bill Cahill as a person. I like him because of his experience in the Congress of the United States.', 'He is a man who is trained for the job that he is seeking. I like him because I believe that he is the man for the future of this State. He is a man who has no commitments to those mistakes of the past, and he is a man that can lead New Jersey in the seventies. And that kind of a man, I think, New Jersey wants.', 'Let me put it this way: I just happen to think that Bill Cahill, because of his integrity, because of his experience, because of his program, because of his idealism--I think he is ready to lead New Jersey and, from what I see here, New Jersey is ready for Cahill.', 'I wish we had more time. I do know that there are many, many problems that you would like to hear discussed.', ""On Monday night, I urge you, incidentally, to listen to Bill Cahill's final wrap-up."", 'I also will tell you that I will be speaking to the Nation Monday on a subject-the subject of Vietnam--and I would invite you all to listen to that particular matter.', ""But let me say, finally, that apart from these political remarks that I have made, you can't really understand or estimate how heartwarming it is for a man who serves as President of the United States to come to a State, which has been very good for him and to him on election day, and gets such a wonderfully warm welcome."", 'And I particularly say that because I know how hard it is to get to an airport. I know how far you had to walk to get here.', 'Thank you very much.']"
4,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1969","['I wanted to get all of the group that you have just seen up here so that you could see the people who came up from Washington with me on Air Force One tonight.', 'And I simply want to say, by way of introduction, that I am very proud to serve in Washington with those who represent the State of New Jersey in the Congress and particularly with those that are here tonight.', 'You saw that team here. It is a great team. We would like to keep them all there, but, believe me, we need a Governor in New Jersey and Bill Cahill we are going to spare for that job.', 'I realize that we are running a little late this evening. I think you will be glad to know the reason why. We had enormous crowds at the airport and on the way in to the meeting at Morristown and, consequently, we are delayed.', ""Then there was another reason we were delayed slightly and I would like to be permitted a personal note. I have Mrs. Cahill's permission to share it with you."", 'When we were in the holding room a moment ago, we made a call. You see, the Cahills and the Nixons have a number of things in common. I served in the House and they served in the House. And I have two daughters. They have more than that.', ""But, nevertheless, one of my daughters' name, the older one, is Tricia. They have a Tricia, too. You all know that she had an accident and she is in the hospital. She is a brave, fine girl."", 'So we called the hospital tonight. They got her on the phone. I said, ""Tricia, your daddy is going to win."" And let\'s make him win.', 'And I do want you to know that some of the girls up here in front asked where Mrs. Nixon was. As you probably read, she, after speaking in New York or going to New York to help dedicate one of the new units of the Lincoln Center--she got the flu and was unable to go with me to Virginia yesterday or to New Jersey tonight.', 'But, believe me, she is here in spirit and she joins me in wishing the Cahills the best and everybody the best.', 'And, too, may I say that coming to Bergen County means something to me. I want to tell you what I know about Bergen County.', 'I have campaigned it a lot. It is a tremendously important county from the standpoint of this State, because what you do in Bergen determines whether you carry this State. It is a big county. For a Republican, he has got to bring it in real big.', ""I remember in 1952 I came up to a rally in Bergen County after the election in '53. It was one of the biggest rallies I have ever heard or seen. I remember Bergen County was proud that year, Nelson Gross [State Republican Committee chairman], to point to the fact that it gave the biggest majority to the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket of any county in the Nation."", 'Now, in the year 1968, we knew New Jersey was a key State. We knew that it was a must State. It was one of those we really had to win. We campaigned it hard.', 'You know what happened? We carried the State of New Jersey by 60,000. We carried Bergen County by 60,000. This county did it. You put us over the top.', 'So I thank you in a personal note for that support in that campaign of 1968.', 'Now, tonight, I am here in behalf of another man. I want to speak to you quite directly, as I did to the people in Morris County a few moments ago. I want to tell you why I am for him.', 'I am for him because I like him personally, and I like his wonderful family, as you do.', 'I am for him, too, because I think that Bill Cahill has the experience to qualify him to be the Governor of this State.', 'I like him because he is a Republican, a member of my party. But I know that in this county, while it is a great Republican county, I know that here, as throughout this State, there are Independents, there are Democrats as well as Republicans that are going to make up their minds not on the basis of a party label, but on the basis of who is the best man for that job. And that is why I am for Bill Cahill. He is the best man for that job.', 'So for a moment, and I ask all of you tonight, whatever you are, Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, forget your party label or affiliation. And those of you who are going to go out and work these last critical 6 days, remember what I say now because this is what counts. Think of the race in New Jersey in terms of the man, not the party; think in terms of what New Jersey needs; think of what the other party offers; think of what this party, the Republican Party offers; but above everything else, think of the man, his experience, and his background, and then determine what New Jersey needs.', 'It seems to me the choice is clear. I am not going to try to give a judgment as to what the people of New Jersey should do about their own business, except to say this: that when you consider the background of the man, the people of New Jersey have never had a man who, from the standpoint of experience at the national level, was better qualified to be the Governor of this State than Bill Cahill.', 'Look at him. Eleven years in the House of Representatives, 11 years on the key Judiciary Committee of the House.', 'What does that mean? It means that here is a man who, instead of just talking about law enforcement, talking about controlling crime, will do something about it.', 'We are going to help him do something about it with your help.', ""And Bill Widnall, your Congressman and the man who comes from this town, and who has been a great friend of mine, has for many years told me when you look at Bill Cahill's record in all fields, whether it is in the field of education or the field of transportation or the field of the environment, all of these matters in which you are so vitally concerned in this great county, Bill Cahill has the kind of progressive action record that recommends itself to people who are looking at the man and not just at his party label."", 'That brings me, really, to the key point. As some of you are probably aware, as President of the United States I have had the responsibility and also the great privilege to travel abroad twice during the Presidency---once to Europe and then around the world visiting several Asian countries.', 'This was a very great experience for me as a man and also as one representing a great people. It was very exciting to see the marvelous crowds and to see the exciting events that were planned on that trip.', 'But after traveling abroad, no matter where you go, and when you return to the United States you always come home realizing what truly a great country this is.', 'I just want you to know that we have problems in this country. We have problems that all of you are aware of. You have problems in this State--the problems of transportation, the problems of law enforcement, the problems of education, the others to which I have referred and to which Bill Cahill has referred in his campaign. But the difference between America and most of the other nations of the world is that we have what it takes to solve the problems.', 'We are by far the richest country in the world. We have certainly the greatest well of intelligence and trained people, from the standpoint of our education, in the world.', ""What we need to do in order to solve our problems is to get the leadership and we also need new programs, new methods, new approaches to those problems. And that brings me to the key reason why I 'think the independent voter, be he a Republican or Democrat or unregistered, either one, why he is going to be for Cahill rather than his opponent."", 'Usually, the choice is simply on the basis of one party or the other. This year, the choice is: Is New Jersey satisfied with the leadership that it has had for the last 16 years? Does it want 4 more years or 8 more years of that?', 'Or are the people of New Jersey, with a great tradition over the past of some great Governors, going to turn to a vigorous man, a man well qualified by experience and background, a man with the program for the \'70s rather than talking about what he did in the \'50s or the \'60s, a man who says to the people of New Jersey, ""Give me the chance"" and he is going to do something about crime in this State.', 'He is going to do something about education in this State. He is going to do something about transport problems in this State. He is going to make New Jersey first again in the quality of its State government. That is what he is going to do.', 'At the national level, my friends, I want you to know that we have made a beginning in that direction, and with the cooperation of the Congress, we will present to the American people a record of accomplishment in terms of a new approach to the problems of the State of the Nation, a new approach such as we have not had over the past 95 years.', 'After 25 to 40 years, as a matter of fact, with the power flowing from the States and the people to Washington, D.C., we finally turned it around. We have a program in which we have asked the Congress to enact legislation in which the Federal Government will do what it should have done, what people have talked about doing for many, many years, and that is share the Federal revenues with the States so you can handle your problems here and reduce your own tax burden.', 'We have a new program in the field of welfare, a program in which we provide that minimum assistance, which is needed by any family that is in need in America, but which we also provide that if an individual is able to work, and if a job is found for him, and we should try to find jobs, then he should be given that opportunity to work--in other words, job incentives, getting people off the welfare rolls and onto payrolls. We think that is a good line for the United States to follow.', 'We have, too, a program in which the Federal Government is going to turn over to the States, first in the field of job training, a billion dollar program, where the States can better administer than the Federal Government.', ""What I am really saying to you is this: We are looking at an entirely new situation for State government of the decade of the 70's. We are having in Washington, D.C., a new attitude, in which Washington, instead of grabbing the power from the people in the States and taking it to Washington, we are bringing it back to the people. We are bringing government to the people."", 'We are giving the people of New Jersey a chance to decide their own problems.', 'But, my friends, you see, that is the challenge. If that is going to work, you have to have a man who is thinking new, who is thinking about action for the future, who will assume those responsibilities, and who will develop the new programs rather than to think of the way that it used to be done, and Bill Cahill is that kind of a man.', 'I know it. You know it. And that is the reason that I believe that he deserves your vote, not just because you happen to be Republicans, if you are, but because he is the best man for the job this year.', ""Now my friends, I would close on one personal note. In my office in Washington, D.C., like all Presidents who have the great privilege and the high responsibility of assuming that Office, I had the chance to choose the desk I was to have. And there' was the Eisenhower desk, and the desk of others who had been in that Office, and, of course, they all have a history."", ""I chose the Wilson desk, because it had been my desk when I was Vice President.' It had been Woodrow Wilson's desk when he was President. I chose it because I was always an admirer of Woodrow Wilson."", 'He, of course, was a Democrat. He also was the Governor of this State. Incidentally, right after he had run for Governor, he became a candidate for President. I am just saying to Bill Cahill, wait 4 years at least before you do that.', ""And my friends, as I sit at that desk, I sometimes think of that man and some of the things that he said. He was one of our most eloquent Presidents and among the most eloquent of all the inaugurals was Wilson's first inaugural."", 'Go back and read it, those of you in school here, and you will find it had the great prose which he developed probably to the highest point in terms of eloquence of any President in our history.', 'He spoke of the challenge that he faced in an era of reform for America in the time he became President, in the year 1913. He was elected in 1912.', 'But in reading the history of that inaugural, I found something very interesting. While there were many great phrases in it, there is one that is not in the text of the speech that is more remembered than any other. This is the way it came about.', 'The Secret Service in that year 1912, 1913, March 1913, at the Inauguration, protecting the President, as they always have the responsibility to do, had put the fences way out beyond the Capitol steps. And when Wilson got up to speak, he saw the people far away from him.', 'And very softly, before he started to speak, he said, ""Let the people come forward."" And the people came forward.', ""And that came to be, really, the watchword of Wilson's first term as President of the United States."", 'I think of Bill Cahill today Bill Cahill, a Republican rather than a Democrat--but when great ideas are involved, they transcend all partisan politics--is as he indicated in his own brief remarks trying to bring government to the people. He is listening to the people.', 'He, like Woodrow Wilson, is saying, ""Let the people come forward."" My friends, that is what kind of government the people of New Jersey want. You want to participate. You want to make your own decisions. You want a chance to go into the future with a man of the future.', 'Bill Cahill is ready to serve the people of New Jersey, and, I think, too, that New Jersey is ready for Bill Cahill.']"
5,Richard Nixon ,"October 12, 1970","[""Mrs. Nixon and I want to express our great appreciation for your welcoming us here to this State, her father's State. We are very proud that her father came from Connecticut."", 'I am very proud, too, to have Mayor Ann Ucello here, one of my favorite mayors in the whole country, running for Congress here in this city.', 'On this occasion, too, as I came through the streets, I noted a number of signs, most of them friendly, some not. But this I do know, I know that the people of this State, like the people of America and the people of the world, want peace in the world, and we are working for peace every day, I can assure you.', 'I also want you to know that the people in this State, like all the people of this country, want a better life for their children, better opportunity. We are working for that.', 'I also want you to know that in the Congress of the United States I have known two young men--I call them young, although they perhaps have been there some time. But Tom Meskill, who has done such an outstanding job as a member of the Judiciary Committee--incidentally, I gave his best regards to all of his Irish relatives when I was just there the other day. And Lowell Weicker. An indication of how well he is thought of is that he was elected the president of all of the Congressmen at the same time at which he was elected to the Congress of the United States.', 'You know when you see two men in the House of Representatives doing a fine job for their districts, it is very hard to think of losing them. But when Congressman Meskill can be Governor Meskill, and when Congressman Weicker can be Senator Weicker, that is a good trade. So that is what we are for.']"
6,Richard Nixon ,"October 17, 1970","['Governor Cahill, Senator Case, all of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, my friend Nelson Gross, all of the other candidates on the platform, and ladies and gentlemen, my friends here in New Jersey:', ""As I stand in this hall, one which has such historic memories for the people of the United States, I particularly want you to know that I am honored by the fact that as I look back on the history of this country, in this century, I realize that no man has been elected President of the United States unless he had the support of New Jersey. I had it in 1968, and I'm glad we won it."", 'I am honored, too, to be here with my old friend Clifford Case with whom I served in the House, and with whom I also worked in the Senate. I am honored to be here with Bill Cahill, who had that great victory that encouraged us all last year and who has done such a fine job as Governor of the State of New Jersey. And I am honored here, to be with all the candidates.', 'I am going to speak primarily about Nelson Gross because of the enormous importance of the Senate races, but remember those House races are important. I see some signs around here, ""Nixon Needs Dowd."" 1 Nixon needs every once of those candidates.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, would the Congressmen and all of the candidates for the House of Representatives please strand who are on the platform--and give them a hand.', ""It's a great team. Those that have been there I have worked with and those you're going to send there we will work with as well."", ""Also, I want you to know that I've been impressed by the size of this crowd. I remember my last visit to Monmouth County. Some of you may remember it. I got a little wet on that occasion, I mean outside, at least. But in any event, I remember it was at Eatontowm, at the shopping center, and it rained--it rained buckets. We were 3 hours late, and there were thousands of people there."", ""As we came into the auditorium today-and we're late because the crowds were so large, and we had to wait for the press to get in and set up their cameras and all the rest but as we came in I asked the police captain how many were inside. He said 10,000. He said there were also 10,000 outside. That's an enormous crowd. It means we're going to do well in New Jersey this year."", 'And incidentally, I know that in this crowd are people of both political parties, people of all ages, people from not only this county but other counties in the State, and, incidentally, some who may be rivals in other respects. I say when any meeting can bring together Asbury Park High School and Neptune High School, that has got to be a great meeting.', 'Incidentally, that truce is one we welcome. It will only last to the next football game, I can assure you.', ""And now, my friends, I want to come directly to the subject which I discussed in a previous meeting in New Jersey earlier today, one that I am going to talk to you about, and one that I'm going to cover in Pennsylvania later today, the question of the next United States Senate, what its membership will be, how important the .election of this one man may be in that Senate."", ""Let me tell you first what it's about. As you know, in the year 1968 because there was a division in the country, a third party and all the rest, we found that the Presidency did not carry with it, as is usually the case, the House and the Senate. This was not a disaster for the country, as some predicted. We have worked with the House and the Senate on some matters. We have been opposed on others. And I respect those who oppose."", 'But I think it is important in an election campaign for the people of the United States to know those who are going to stand with the President and those who are going to be against him. And in this case we have a man who will stand for him.', 'But the significant thing about this last Senate--in vote after vote when the issues were involved a majority of determined how they came out, A shift one vote in the Senate, and sometimes would determine whether the program of the administration went over or went down. And, so, this involves your vote, of course. It involves one Senator.', 'But more than that, what happens in New Jersey may determine the fate of policies that will determine peace, determine your pocketbook, determine all of those elements that you believe in for progress for this country in the years ahead.', ""And let me say in that respect that I want you to consider now my endorsement of Nelson Gross, not because I like him as a man, as I do because he was my man in 1968, not because we were born on the same day--he was born a few years afterwards, but on January 9 we celebrate the same birthday--not because he's a member of the same party, but because he stands for those policies that are best for America."", 'Let me come to the one that these young people over there are shouting about right now, ""Peace Now."" Let me talk about that for just a moment, and I think we should have an answer to that.', 'A young man stopped me outside the door as I came in and said, ""Peace now, end the war, get out of Vietnam."" And I said, ""Have you been to Vietnam?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Those men are fighting so you won\'t have to go. That\'s why we\'re there.""', ""Now, ladies and gentlemen, we came into office with a war that had no end in sight, with Americans going into Vietnam, with casualties running at 300 a week, and what have we done? Instead of sending more men in, we're bringing hundreds of thousands of men out of Vietnam. And it's going to continue."", ""Second, instead of casualties going up, we wound down the war so that casualties are their lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they're going to go lower."", 'Third, instead of having no plan for peace, we have set forth last week--you heard it on television--a plan for peace, a plan which would provide for a cease-fire, for a negotiation at the conference table, for an exchange of prisoners, all of the elements that should lead to a peaceful settlement. And I can say to you now we are ending the war. We shall have peace in Vietnam.', ""But now let me come to the key point. Why not now? Why not just bring them home? I'll tell you why. My friends, it's very easy to end the war, but do you realize what has happened to America in this century? Look back. I can remember, you can remember, we've had four wars in this century. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended Korea. But not one generation in this century has had one generation of peace."", ""It isn't ending the war. It's ending a war in a way that we win the peace, and I say let's win the peace as we end the war in Vietnam. And that is what we are doing. We are ending the war in a way that will discourage that kind of aggression in the future. We are ending the war so that the younger brothers and the sons of those fighting in Vietnam won't have to be fighting in some other Vietnam sometime in the future."", ""Now there's your choice. That kind of responsible policy Nelson Gross supports, and that is the kind of support that we need in the United States Senate."", ""Let's go further. Vietnam is not the only danger spot. We have avoided a war in the Mideast, and we trust that we can continue to avoid it. We have a cease-fire. We hope that we can continue it. We're negotiating with the Soviet Union far the limitation of arms."", 'And as we go on with those negotiations, may I say, and I make this statement to this great audience in this historic hall with full knowledge of what it means: My friends, I think that with the fight leadership---leadership that is courageous, leadership that is sound, leadership that will not say just peace for the next election but peace for the next generation--with that kind of leadership we have the best chance since World War II to have a generation of peace. Give us the men that will support that kind of leadership. Give us Nelson Gross.', ""Let's turn to the issues at home. I know that--as I look over this audience I see a lot of men, I see a lot of women. And I know you'll be shopping later in the day and you'll be looking at those price tags-up. And you know that when we came into office that we had this economy so heated up that the prices were on an escalating wave which had to be stopped. And we had to move on it, and we did."", ""We recognized that we had to stop the increases of spending in Washington so that you'd have more to spend at home, and we need the men that will support that kind of policy."", 'Let me put it more directly. You know, it\'s very difficult for a Congressman or a Senator to have a bill come up and for him to say, ""Well, this will spend money for here, and there, and someplace else."" After all, it isn\'t his money. It\'s the taxpayers\' money. And it\'s very difficult for him not to vote for it.', ""But I tell you what we need: We need men in the House and the Senate who have the courage to vote against huge spending programs in Washington that may benefit some people but that will raise prices and taxes for all people. That's the kind of man you have in Nelson Gross."", ""And then there's one other thing that we need. This administration has submitted the most historic program for reform of the institutions of American Government in history: reform of our welfare program, reform of our tax program, revenue sharing for the States, which is of such vital interest to this State, to men like Bill Cahill who are having an increasingly difficult problem in attempting to balance their State budgets and deal with State needs."", ""Let me give you one example of it, and here is a clear choice. It's a choice between the old approach and the new, between the old politics and the new politics. The old politics simply says spend more and more and more for the same old programs; and the new politics, what we stand for, the reform politics, says no, let's quit putting good money into bad programs or otherwise we're going to end up with bad money and bad programs, and let's not have that happen in America."", 'I give you an example of it: The welfare program. Everybody in this room wants to be sure that any individual who is unable to work has proper assistance, and he should have, without the demeaning qualifications that we have in our present welfare system.', ""But let's look at that welfare system. It continues to grow, and people continue to go on the list. And we find that at the present time this system has these problems. I can put it to you quite directly: I say to you when any system makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, it's time to get rid of that system and get another one in its place."", ""I say to you when any system encourages a man to desert his .family rather than stay with his family and support it, that system ought to be changed. That is why our family assistance program, which provides for help for anybody who is unable to work, but which has work incentives and the requirement of work, wet think that is the right approach. Let's re-I form this system. This is the kind of a program that Nelson Gross--his support, as well as that of Cliff Case, it's that kind of support that we need, because I submitted it over a year ago and they still haven't acted on it. Now let's get some men down there that will act on it. You can do it with Nelson Gross."", ""I could cover other programs--an historic recommendation for the environment. We need to clean up the air, and clean up the water. We need better programs in transit, in health, in education. But let's don't continue to put good money into bad programs."", 'This administration offers a new approach, a new approach to the problems, one of reform, one of restoring the beauty of America, one of renewal of the American spirit. That is the spirit in which I address you today.', 'Then, finally, this point needs to be made to this audience and before every audience in America today. I spoke about the necessity to have a program that would bring peace abroad. If America is going to provide the leadership that will bring peace abroad, we have to demonstrate that we can keep the peace at home. That means, my friends, that as we look across America today we see some problems, we see the fact, for example, that last year, up to this point in 1970, I should say, 66 policemen had been killed, hundreds had been wounded.', 'We have seen also an unprecedented wave of violence. We have seen indications on many sides that there has been a growth of crime. This administration recognized this in 1968, and we submitted to the Congress the most comprehensive proposals in terms of a crime program that had ever been submitted, organized crime, dealing with pornography and obscenity, dealing with the problem of drugs and narcotics.', 'The Congress has been slow to act. We just got the organized crime bill last week. And the others, many of them, are still languishing in committees and in Congress.', 'We need a man who understands this problem. Nelson Gross understands it. He knows law enforcement.', ""And, incidentally, he will not simply be one who's for law enforcement during an election campaign. He'll be for it year round. That's the kind of a man we need in the United States Senate."", 'I could go on, but you have been here a long time.', 'I conclude my remarks simply again with an historical reference, with regard to this country, what it means to all of us and how we can make it an even greater country.', 'Some of you know I returned recently from a trip abroad. It took me to a Communist country, Yugoslavia, to Spain, to Italy, to England, to Ireland. And I was enormously moved by the fact that whether it was in Yugoslavia, Spain, or in Ireland, hundreds of thousands of people turned out to welcome me, not as a person but because they were trying to say something about America.', ""We hear these days about what's wrong with America, and there are things wrong. But let us never forget that because we are so strong, because we have the wealth that we have, we're able to correct the things that are wrong. And just remember this: To millions of people in this world today, America is the hope of the world. It's the hope of the world for peace, for freedom, for opportunity, and, believe me, let us live up to that hope; let us not disappoint it here in the United States of America."", 'This is a great country and a good country. I have flown over it; I have visited its towns and its cities. I respect those who may have different points of views, as you do. But I also want to say this--there is a small group in this country, a small group that shouts obscenities, as they did at the last meeting, that throws rocks, as they did at a meeting earlier today in Vermont; a group of people that always tear America down; a group of people that hate this country, actually, in terms of what it presently stands for; who see nothing right with America. And those people night after night appear on our television screens, and people here in the United States get the impression that that, if it is not the present of America, may be the future.', 'Let me tell you what the facts are: That is a minority today. It is not going to be a majority in the future because the majority are the people that I see standing in front of me here in this audience.', 'And I want to tell you now as I leave what you can do. How do you answer those that shout obscenities and shout speakers down, or try to? How do you answer those that throw rocks, engage in violence? How do you answer those that have nothing but invective and refuse to listen to the other side?', ""Don't answer in kind. Don't engage in violence. You don't have to use the epithets. The way to answer them I can tell you--and it's time for the great silent majority to speak out--the way to answer them is with the most powerful voice known in the history of man. That is the voice of the vote, at the ballot box."", ""On November 3d you can walk into that polling booth and in the quiet of that polling booth you, the majority, can vote for what you believe is right about America. You, the majority, can vote for those policies, and for a man who will support those policies, that will bring lasting peace to America, that will provide reform for the institutions of America, that will provide the opportunity for all of these young people that I see here and these bands, not only to live in a period of peace but in a period of progress and opportunity and freedom in which the air can be clean, and the water can be pure, and the parks and the living spaces can be as they once were in this country. And that can happen. That's the promise of America. That's what we stand for. That's what we're trying to work for."", 'But, my friends, we cannot do it unless we have support in the Congress, and Nelson Gross is the man that can help us. Give him that chance.', 'Thank you.']"
7,Richard Nixon ,"October 17, 1970","['Governor Davis, Senator Prouty, Congressman Stafford, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and all of the distinguished members of this audience:', 'As you probably are aware, this is the first campaign stop that I have had the opportunity to make in 1970, and I am proud that it is in the State of Vermont. There are personal reasons for that statement that would be of interest, I am sure, to the young people here. My two daughters have very fond memories of their visit to this State to Camp Teela Wooket. I am glad to be back because of that.', 'The other reason is that as I look back on the record of the State of Vermont, in a personal sense, again, on all the occasions that I have been on the national ticket, I have lost some States but I have always carried Vermont. Thank you very much.', 'A third reason is that I am very proud to be here on a special day which is nonpolitical in one respect, certainly, the homecoming day of the University of Vermont. I also want to say that, speaking of the university, lets pay our respects to the Rice Memorial [High School] Band over here. How about that? And to the Canadian Geese 1 in the back. The Vermont Turkeys are going to go up to Canada on an exchange visit for the Canadian Geese next week.', 'But there is a more fundamental reason in this year 1970 that I am very happy to be here to open this campaign in Vermont. It has to do with the fact that I have enormous respect for the men who are candidates on your ticket here this year. Let me mention them each briefly. Bob Stafford, who has been formerly your Governor, then a Congressman.', 'One thing that you know about the people from Vermont is this--and it is true of all of those representing Vermont in Washington and in the statehouse-whether it is George Aiken, who is a man whose wise counsel I have benefited from as President of the United States and prior to that time, or whether it is a case of Bob Stafford, a man who came to the Congress in the 87th Congress, and all of the Congressmen in the country who were elected that year elected him as their leader.2', 'That is an indication of what they think of Vermont and Bob Stafford in Washington, D.C.', ""I have had the opportunity to meet all the Governors of the 50 States at various Governors' Conferences, and I respect them all. But there are some who stand out and one who stands out is your Governor because he has courage, the courage to do what is right for his State, to take a mess fiscally and clean it up in the State of Vermont."", 'There is another reason that I admire your Governor and also your Congressman and your Senator, and that is their tenacity. When anything involves the State of Vermont, they are down there in my office pounding on that door until we do something about it.', 'For example, over these past 2 weeks they have expressed concern about a possible fuel oil shortage in the State of Vermont. Let me tell you I talked to General Lincoln, the head of the Office of Emergency preparedness before I left Washington.', 'There will be no fuel oil shortage--we will see to that, thanks to what your Governor has told us and your Senator and your Congressman--in the State of Vermont.', 'Now I come to your Senator, Win Prouty, the man who is running in this State for reelection. Can I speak to all of you now about the importance of this one man, this one vote, and your one vote in this State of Vermont?', 'Let us understand that in 1968 the country elected a new President, called for new leadership. We also recognized that at that time we had the Congress, both the House and the Senate, under the control of Members of the other party. Nevertheless, we worked with that Congress. Sometimes they voted against, sometimes for.', 'But in the United States Senate particularly-and all of you, particularly you who studied political science at the university and those who studied it also in high school will know, and all of you who read your papers and listen to television-the United States Senate on the great issues, the issues that involve whether we are going to have a program to bring lasting peace in the world, the issues that involve whether or not we are going to have a program that will stop the ruinous inflation that is robbing your pocketbooks and making it impossible to balance your family budget--when we look at all of these problems we find that in the United States Senate on vote after vote a majority of one determines the outcome.', ""A shift of one Senator, sometimes two, will determine whether the President's program goes through or whether it doesn't go through. I want to say to you, without Win Prouty's vote I couldn't stand here today and speak with pride of a record of accomplishment in this great field. He is providing that majority of one."", 'I would like to take the three issues, and I think I am going to take the hardest one first. I hear some of the young people here say stop the war, and I heard it said outside. I understand that.', 'Let me tell you what we found and then you judge the record and you judge Win Prouty on the basis of that record. When we came into office, we found 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring them home. There was no plan to end the war. There was no peace plan that had been submitted.', 'And what have we done? Let me tell you. We have implemented a plan to bring Americans home, and during the spring of next year half of the men that were in Vietnam when we got there will be coming home. That is what we are going to do.', 'Second, we wound down the fighting by the strong stand that we took to clean up the sanctuaries in Cambodia. We have cut American casualties to the lowest level in 4 ½ years.', 'I am not going to be satisfied until not one American is killed in Vietnam, but we are cutting them down and we are going to continue on that course.', 'And third, my friends, we have presented to the North Vietnamese, over national television--and I am sure many of you heard it--a far-reaching peace plan. We have offered a cease-fire without conditions. We have offered to negotiate all the political settlements with regard to South Vietnam, one that would allow all those in that country to participate in the making of that settlement. We have offered also a plan that would provide for the release of war prisoners on both sides. We have offered a conference on all of Indochina.', 'Now let me tell you exactly where it stands today. As I stand before you today, I can say confidently the war in Vietnam is coming to an end, and we are going to win a just peace in Vietnam. It will come to an end either--if the enemy accepts our proposal for a cease-fire, it can come to an end more quickly.', ""If it does not accept that proposal, then we will bring it to an end by continuing to withdraw Americans and replacing them with Vietnamese and allowing the Vietnamese to have the right to choose their own government without having it imposed by North Vietnam or by the United States. Now, isn't that the fair thing to do?"", 'Now let us see what the other side of the argument is. I know the people in this State. My good friend Consuelo Bailey, 3 who has always advised me about Vermont, she has said to me from time to time, ""The people up in this State, they want to hear both sides of the argument and want to make up their minds.""', ""Let me tell you the other side. I know there are people who say: Why this long road? Why don't we just end the war? I could have done it the day I came into office."", ""I could have brought all the Americans home. Let me tell you ending a war isn't very difficult. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended Korea. And yet, in this century we have not had a generation of peace."", 'My friends, what we want to do is to end the war so that the young people that are shouting ""Stop the War"" will have a generation of peace, and that is the kind of plan that we are trying to implement. So that is what we are doing.', 'We are ending the war in a way that will discourage those who might start a war.', 'We are ending the war in a way that will bring permanent peace in the Pacific. It is that kind of program that Win Prouty has stood firmly by.', ""So I say let us work for what all of us want, not just peace for the next election but peace for the next generation so that the younger brothers and the sons of those who have fought in Vietnam won't have to be fighting in some other Vietnam sometime in the future."", ""So there is the choice. It is a clear one. Win Prouty, who stands for a just peace and a generation of peace, and those on the other side who say without regard to the future, let's simply end the problems that we are in today."", 'This is real statesmanship. That is one of the reasons I am here for him.', 'Let me turn to another subject of equal interest, equal interest in the sense that it affects the pocketbooks of everybody and every family budget. You all know what has happened to prices. You know that when we came into office we found prices going up and up.', 'You will find also that the reason they were going up and up was that in the years previous to our coming into office that the previous administrations had spent $50 billion more than the economy would have produced in terms of taxes at full employment.', 'And what did that do? Because Washington spent more than it was taking in or that it could have taken in in full employment, it raised the prices for everybody.', 'I said when we came into office we were going to stop that. That is why I had to veto some measures--that I felt people were poor in many instances.', 'Let me just say this: What we have to realize is that we need Senators and Congressmen who have the courage to vote against spending programs that may benefit some of the people but that raise prices and taxes for all people. That is the kind of a program that we stand for. That is the kind of fiscal responsibility that your Governor stands for. It is the kind of fiscal responsibility that Win Prouty stands for.', ""And we come to a third area, the area of progress. The great choice that the American people had in 1968 and that we now have a chance to reaffirm in 1970 is this: Do we continue to pour good money into bad programs so that eventually we end up with both bad money and bad programs or do we reform the programs of America? That is why this administration says let's reform the welfare system, let's reform our educational system, let's reform our health system, so that America can move forward on a new road. That is the kind of proposal that we offer."", ""And here the issue is clear. On the one side there are those who say keep pouring the same amount of money, billions, into the welfare program. Let me tell you what I think. I say that when a program makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, it is time to get rid of it and get another program. And that is why Win Prouty's strong support of the Family Assistance Program in which we provide help for all of those who need it, but in which we provide that those who are able to work will not only have an incentive to work but a requirement to work--let them work, I say, and if they cannot work then, of course, the welfare will be provided. It is that kind of reform that we stand for."", 'I could go on in other fields. Take the environment. I noticed that as the plane came down and I looked down on this magnificent countryside, and I know that pretty soon the tourists, the winter tourists, will be coming in, the summer influx having gone home. I can only say to you this, that as I look over America, and I fly over it many, many times, of course, on the way to California, to Florida, and to other States, this is a beautiful country. But, my friends, what we have to realize is that because of our wealth, what we are doing is that we are poisoning our water. We are also poisoning our air. We are having our cities choked with traffic and terrorized by crime. So what we have to do now is to clean up the environment of America.', 'That is why we have presented to the Congress an historic new program to clean up the air, to clean up the water, to provide open spaces for these young people to go to in the years ahead.', 'And, my friends, that is the kind of progressive legislation that Win Prouty supports, and that is another reason we need him in the United States Senate.', ""Then one other program I should mention-and Governor Davis, you will be interested in this and all of your fellow Governors--I think back to the history of this country, to the fact that Vermont has played a proud role from the time of the beginning of America. I think back to the fact, too, that when America was young the States felt that they had responsibilities and then power began to flow, particularly in this century, from the people and the counties and the cities and the States up to Washington, D.C. And Government in Washington got bigger and bigger and bigger, and government in the States found that they didn't have the funds to handle their problems, and taxes, particularly on your property, went up and up and up. So I said this has got to change."", 'That is why we have authorized and asked the Congress to approve, and they will not yet act on it, a program of revenue sharing, where the Federal Government will turn over to the States funds that the States can use to handle their own problems.', 'Let me tell you why this is important. For 190 years, my friends, power has been flowing from the people, from you, and from the States, to Washington. I say that it is time now for power to flow back from Washington to the States and to the people of America. That is the kind of a program, again, that Win Prouty supports.', ""Now one final point. I realize that in this year 1970 there are those who have very deep disagreements with our country's policy, whether it is abroad or at home. I know there are those who demonstrate and say that America is a sick society, that everything is wrong."", 'Just let me say this: I can tell you, my friends, I have seen this country, and I have also been abroad. I have just finished a trip to Europe. I was in a Communist country, Yugoslavia, and 350,000 people stood out in the rain cheering, not for me but for the United States of America. I was in Spain, in Italy, in Ireland, in England, and the same thing happened. The same thing happened in Asia last year, in India, and other countries.', ""Let me tell you something: Yes, there are those that criticize America, many abroad among leaden criticize our policies. But to millions of people ca this earth we can be proud of the fact that the United States of America--not because simply we are the strongest country and the richest country but because we are a country that provides the greatest freedom and the greatest opportunity for people in the history of the world--the United States is respected, and let's be worthy of that respect."", 'Now the question is: The voices are being heard in the year 1970. You hear them. You hear them night after night on your television, people shouting their obscenities about America and what we stand for. You hear those who shout against speakers and shout them down, who will not listen. And then you hear those who engage in violence. You hear those, and see them, who, without reason, kill policemen and injure them, and the rest. And you wonder: Is that the voice of America?', ""I say to you it is not. It is a loud voice, but, my friends, there is a way to answer: Don't answer with violence. Don't answer by shouting the same senseless words that they use. But answer in the powerful way that Americans have always answered. Let the majority of Americans speak up, speak up on November 3d, speak up with your votes. That is the way to answer."", 'My friends, the people in this great State may well determine whether or not on the great issues which will determine whether we can have a program that will bring lasting peace for a generation, progress in the field of the environment and welfare, and all these other areas that I have described, a program of strong and fair law enforcement whether or not we have that majority of one in the United States Senate, a majority that crosses party lines, may well determine on what you do in the State of Vermont. I say this to you because Win Prouty not only provides that vote but because this quiet, confident man has such enormous respect among his colleagues.', ""Let me tell you something. I have known the Senate and the House, served in both, and anybody who has known those bodies will agree with me that there are the doers and the talkers. Win Prouty isn't a talker; he is a doer. He gets things done. He works for the elderly. He works for progress. He works for education. He is a man who for 20 years has given his life. There isn't a man in that Senate that works harder than he does for Vermont and America."", 'And because he is a doer and not a talker, send him back and give us that majority of one.', 'Thank you.']"
8,Richard Nixon ,"October 17, 1970","['Governor Shafer, Senator Scott, Lieutenant Governor Broderick, all of the distinguished guests, the candidates on the platform, and all of the distinguished members of this audience:', 'May I first apologize to you for being late. I started this morning in Vermont and I have been in two stops in New Jersey. We are here now in Lancaster. Then we finish tonight in Wisconsin before returning to Washington--a rather light day.', ""I ought to say that I am so glad to have this wonderful crowd here. I remember my visits here back in 1960. I recall, incidentally, on that occasion that the two bands that played then in 1960 are here today. I am so glad that they are here. Let's give those bands a hand back there."", 'I recall, too, in 1966, my visit here---not outdoors, but an indoors meeting. I recall on that occasion that Ed Eshleman was sent to Washington as your Congressman. I recall, too, that through the years this has been what we call one of the strong areas for support of the Republican Party, and I would like to put it another way, support for those great principles that we believe in in this country.', 'Today I am here in behalf of not myself as a candidate, but I am here in behalf of some very great programs that I deeply believe in. I think they are in your interest. I think they are in the interest not just of Republicans but of Democrats, of all Americans.', 'I would like for you to consider, if you will, in the few minutes that I talk to you, what we stand for, what we believe in, and if you believe that that is what this country needs and what your State needs, then I am going to ask you to go out and work for those candidates that we are here to support.', 'Now let me begin by saying that this is a particularly appropriate State for me to put this whole campaign in the context of not only the past but of the future.', 'As you know, due to the efforts of your Governor and of Senator Scott, who is a very persuasive man, whatever his problems involving the State of Pennsylvania or other problems are involved, that the Bicentennial Commission has selected Pennsylvania for the major event in 1976.', 'In 1976, when that great event, the 200th birthday of America is celebrated, we will look back to the year 1776, and we will look back to this time right now, the year 1970. We will try to evaluate what America was and what it became.', ""Let's think for just a moment in this beautiful countryside which has so much of the history of America around it and in it and in the hearts of the people who are working, let us think of that year 1976 and what we want America to be."", 'Let me tell you what I want it to be, and this will indicate the programs that I support, the programs that Ray Broderick will work for as Governor of this State, the programs that Hugh Scott has worked for during all of his life, the man in whom I have confidence, in whom our party has confidence, who has been our leader, and I know will continue to be our leader in the years ahead.', ""Let me come to these points. What do we want, looking down that road to 1976? Above all else, I find, as I travel this country, the American people want peace. They want peace. They want an end to the war in which we are in, but they want more than that: They want the kind of policies that will give us something we haven't had in this whole century, a whole generation of peace."", 'I think back to the people in that band over there. I think of those young boys particularly, and I think of their future.', 'I want to tell you what I feel about that future, and I feel it very deeply. I feel about the future of this young lad here, who is perhaps about 12 or 10 years old.', ""I remember that in this century we ended World War I; we ended World War II; and we ended the Korean war. And yet, there hasn't been one generation that has had a full generation of peace."", 'So you see, what we need are policies that will not just end a war; what we need are policies that will end a war and win the peace. That is what we stand for and that is the kind of program that we are for.', 'I remember at the last stop in New Jersey a very intense young man, as we were walking through a huge crowd of people, waving signs that were very friendly, came up to me. He sort of shook his fist in my face. That didn\'t bother me. He said, ""End the war. End the war in Vietnam.""', 'I said, ""Have you been there?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Those men are fighting out there so you won\'t have to go.""', ""So you see what we are trying to do is to end this war, and we are doing it in a way that it will discourage this kind of' aggression in the future."", 'What we are trying to do, and we are doing it--we are bringing American men home, whereas they were going in when we came in. We have reduced the casualties. We have presented a peace plan, a program for a cease-fire, a program for a negotiated peace, a program also for an exchange of prisoners, which goes, I think all objective observers agree--it goes to the point that is fair for both sides.', 'We believe that it is possible and that we can proceed along this line. Either we are going to get peace through negotiation or we will get it through our program of Vietnamization, in which Americans come back as the South Vietnamese are able to defend themselves.', ""But, my friends, the important thing is this: Let us end this war in a way that we have not been able to end other wars. Let's end it in a way that the younger brothers and the sons of those who fought in Vietnam will not have to be fighting in some future war in history someplace."", 'That is what we are working for. And I want to tell you, as I stand here referring not just to Vietnam but to the other trouble spots in the world, to the Mideast, our negotiations with the Soviet Union in other areas, while they are very difficult, while the dangers are very great, I believe we have the policies; I believe we have the strength; I believe we have the wisdom to accomplish this great objective that I referred to, not just peace for the next election, but peace for the next generation.', 'I believe, my friends, that we can have that. It is that that we are working for. I believe the chances that we can have a full generation of peace are better today than they have been at any time since the end of World War II.', ""I ask support for that kind of a program. Hugh Scott has loyally supported that kind of a program, and I know that Ray Broderick will support it just as Ray Shafer has in the Governor's chair in the State of Pennsylvania."", 'Looking ahead to the year 1976, what else can we have? We want prosperity for America. We want the kind of prosperity, however, in which Americans have jobs and in which we have prosperity without War.', 'Let it be said that during this administration, over a million men have been let out of defense plants and out of the armed services as we have wound down the war in Vietnam. That has, of course, caused some problems insofar as unemployment is concerned. But this economy is strong. This economy is growing. And all of the people of this country, those who want jobs, should have the opportunity to have them.', 'I simply say this: I think that Americans-every American wants the kind of policy which will provide prosperity without war for the American people and jobs without war. And that is what we are working for.', 'Third, we would like to have prosperity without the cost of the ruinous inflation. I see a lot of ladies here, and I imagine you have been doing some shopping today, and you may be doing some tomorrow or later this afternoon. You look at those prices in the grocery store and other places, and you say, ""Why do they keep going up?"" I will tell you why, because in the previous administration, over a period of years, they spent over $50 billion more than this economy, at full production, would have produced in tax revenues. All that that could possibly do would be to create inflation. We have been fighting against that.', 'As a result, we have cut the rate of inflation in half. But that is why we need the kind of support in the Senate and in the Congress, the kind of support that we will get from Ed Eshleman, George Goodling, the kind of support that has the courage to say when a huge new spending program comes up that might be popular for some people, that we must vote sometimes against the program that might benefit some people if its effect is going to raise prices and taxes for all people.', 'That is the program that I think that Americans also want to support.', ""In 1976 we want to see this country's government reformed in so many areas-the area, for example, of the cost of State government. I know the problems the State of Pennsylvania has had, the problems that you have had, like the other major States, to meet all of the great concerns of your State with inadequate tax revenues."", 'That is why this administration has recommended an historic new program in which the Federal Government will share tax revenues with the States. This does two things: It relieves the burden of property taxation in the States, which is becoming too heavy for people who own property in the States to bear. And, second, it does something else: For 190 years, from the beginning of this country, and its Constitution, we have seen power flow from the people and from the States to Washington, D.C.', 'Now we think it is time to turn it around. Power belongs to the people, and we are, therefore, presenting a program, a new federalism, in which, whether it is manpower training, whether it is revenue sharing, whether it is in the field of welfare or education, the power will/low from Washington, D.C., back to the States, back to the counties, back to the people of the State of Pennsylvania and all the States of this Nation.', 'When we speak of reform, let me talk briefly about another subject that I know is of deep concern to people all over this country. It is our welfare program.', 'First, let us understand what we are talking about. Every American wants to see to it that anybody in this country who is unable to earn a living for himself does not go hungry, that he has an adequate income, to the extent that this Nation can afford it. And this is a rich country.', 'We can be thankful that we are rich enough so that any individual in this country can have an adequate income. But, on the other hand, I think all of us recognize that our present welfare program has resulted in very great inequities.', 'The number on the welfare rolls goes up and up, and people who work hard, people who pay their taxes, have to pay an increasing load for people who are not working, and some of them could work if they would just go out and do so.', 'So, my friends, I say to you today that any program which makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work ought to be abolished, and we are going to abolish it.', 'I say that any program that rewards a man for deserting his family rather than staying with his family and supporting it, needs to be changed, and we are going to change it.', ""You see, that is why we have presented the historic family assistance program for which Hugh Scott has fought, and for which Ray Broderick will fight as Governor of this State. We need to get it through. We need support. We will have it by the year 1976 and it will mean that every family in America who needs help will have it, but it will mean that those who are able to work will be required to work, and if they have a job offered and they are able to work and won't work, then they shouldn't get welfare. We think that is the fair thing to do."", 'Now to another subject. How do we want our country to look in 1976 in terms of what is really basic to a free society, the right, certainly, of everybody to dissent, but also the right of all Americans to be free from fear, free from fear in our cities, in our homes, wherever the case may be.', 'During the 8 years before this administration came into office in 1968, crime went up 150 percent in America.', 'During that 8-year period, there was an attitude of permissiveness in high places. There was also a failure to back up our law enforcement officials. There was also a failure to enact the laws that would give our law enforcement officials the tools they needed to deal with those that engage in criminal activities.', 'That is why one of the first recommendations I sent to the Congress over 18 months ago was a new program to deal with crime in this country, to deal with organized crime, to deal with pornography and filth and obscenity, which is being sent through the mails and that ought to be stopped, and to deal with narcotics and drugs.', 'What has happened? One of those bills has been passed, the organized crime. The others, of course, have been delayed. We hope they will be passed.', 'But the important thing is this: What we need are not only the laws but we also need those men and the backing for those men who have the responsibility to enforce the laws.', 'I simply want to say this: In the case of your Lieutenant Governor Ray Broderick, who will be your Governor, we have a man who has demonstrated his leadership capacity as head of the Constitutional Convention in this State, a man who understands law enforcement and takes a strong, firm line on it.', 'We have in your Senator Hugh Scott and in the congressional candidates here, men who take a strong, firm stand on this issue, men who will not only pass the laws but will back up our law enforcement officials in that respect.', ""I want to say to you, my friends, I recognize that on this particular issue that this does not involve partisanship. It isn't a question of whether you are a Democrat or Republican as to whether or not we are going to have the laws and we are going to have the law enforcement with justice that Americans want."", ""But I do say this: It is time now that the President of the United States gets support from the Congress and support from the country, and that the Governors of the States and the mayors of the cities get support for a program to wage a winning war against the criminal elements in this country. Let's give them that kind of support."", 'So I look down to that year 1976, and I want to tell you what I see. I see a world that will be at peace, at peace largely because America as the strongest free world power will have played a courageous and responsible role to bring peace.', 'I see an America in which we will have new programs to clean up our air and our water where that needs to be done, to deal with the problems of an environment.', 'I see an America in which we will have unprecedented reform, in which every American family will have certainly the opportunity to have a decent living, where all Americans who want to work have an opportunity to have jobs.', ""Let me tell you why that can happen. You know it can't happen in any other country in the world. Because America is the richest country in the world, we are able to stand for programs that will provide more freedom, more opportunity, a better living than in any country in the world."", 'That is the picture of America I see. And yet I hear some other voices in this country. I heard them in Vermont today. I hear a few here today. I understand that. I respect the right of anybody to disagree. But let me tell you what some of those voices do and what some of those voices say.', ""In Vermont some rocks were thrown. That, of course, is happening in other places as well. And in the last place they were shouting obscenities. All over this country we find violence, the bombing and the burning of buildings in this senseless fashion. We find, in addition to that, those who have lost faith in America, those who say that America is on the road to fascism. Let me tell you, don't you believe it. This is a great and a good country."", 'But that small violent minority, because it is on that television tube night after night, appears to many to be either the majority or about to become the majority.', ""Well, I have news for you. That small minority is not the majority in this country and it isn't going to become the majority of the people in this country."", ""But there is only one answer, and that is for the great silent majority to stand up and to speak out and to be counted. I will tell you how. Don't answer them with the same obscenities. You don't need to do that. Don't engage in violence. You don't need to do that."", 'You have a more effective answer, a more powerful answer than any of those things that those on that side who believe that way resort to. You have that vote.', 'On November 3d, you can walk into the quiet of that polling booth and you can vote. Then you will determine the future of America. I say that on that day let your votes be for policies that will bring America real peace, a peace we can keep in the generation ahead, that will bring us reform of our institutions and opportunity for every American, regardless of his background, to have an equal chance, an equal opportunity, to go forward, because let us remember we cannot fulfill the American dream unless every American has a chance to fulfill his own dream.', 'Vote for those kinds of policies that will have respect for law and laws that deserve respect.', 'My friends, that is what I have been working for since becoming the President of this country. That is the kind of leadership Hugh Scott has been giving in the United States Senate. And that is the kind of leadership you will get from Ray Broderick as the Governor of this State. It is for that reason that I am very proud to stand here with this great team, and I urge you to support them.', 'Thank you.']"

Now how about a hand for Bill Cahill, your great Republican Governor?', ""And since we are speaking of winners, can I say that I am very proud today that we have the Hasbrouck Heights Band. I understand they haven't lost a game in 2 years. Good luck."", 'Ladies and gentlemen, in this State of New Jersey in this year 1970, you will make a decision that is going to affect the State of New Jersey. It is going to affect your lives, and it is going to affect the United States of America for many years to come.', 'I want to tell you what that decision means. I could simply speak in terms of the candidates that I am proud to support. I believe we have the best group of House candidates in the State of New Jersey that I have ever seen in campaigning this State for many years. I want to give a hand to every one of these House candidates: those that are in and those who are seeking in.', ""Second, I'm here to speak in behalf of my friend Nelson Gross, a man---1"", 'Thank you, very much. I am very proud to be here to. speak in behalf of Nelson Gross for personal reasons. He was my chairman in 1968. He is a man I deeply respect. He is a member of my party. But, my friends, I want to say to you today that the issue in this election is much bigger than whether I happen to like this man personally, as I do.', ""It's much bigger than whether he happens to be a member of my party, which he is. He stands for what is best for America. That is why we are for Nelson Gross today."", 'And there is a very clear issue, a clear issue between him and those who oppose him. Let me put it to you in the terms that every citizen of the State of New Jersey, young and old, is interested in.', 'What do you want from your Government? We begin, of course, with that item which is more important than anything else in the minds of all of us. We want to build a world in which we can have peace--peace not just for the next election but peace for the next generation. Nelson Gross stands for that.', ""Since I have been in office, after 5 years of men going to Vietnam, we have been bringing them home, and we will continue to bring them home. After 5 years of American casualties going up and up, they've gone down and down to the lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they will continue to go down."", 'After 5 years of the war going on, the war is coming to an end, and you can be sure that we shall move in that direction.', ""So what we stand for here is a program of a just peace. We have offered a cease-fire. We have offered an exchange of prisoners. We have offered a peace conference. We have offered a political settlement. My friends, let me tell you why we need a just peace. It is very easy, I know, as some of those who may be here in this audience today have been shouting, to simply end the war. My friends, we have ended wars. What we want to do is to end this war so that young Americans won't have to fight in another war. That is the kind of program that we are for. That is why we are ending this war in a way that will discourage those who might start another war."", 'We are ending this war in a way that we have a chance for peace in the Pacific in the years to come, and we are maintaining the strength so that we can negotiate that reduction in nuclear arms so essential to lasting peace.', 'Let me put the issue to you very directly. The United States Senate is the body that has the most effect on the foreign policy of this country. We need in the Senate a man who will stand with the President on the great issue of ending the war and building a just peace.', 'Let me turn to an issue very close at home. I see many here that probably took off from their shopping in order to be here. I know that as you go to the stores today you are going to be concerned with the fact that the prices are going up and up. Let me say that when we came into office, we found that we had the worst inflation since World War II. And the reason was that we had had a government in Washington, D.C. that, over the past 8 years before then, had spent $50 billion more than the economy of this country at full production would have produced through its tax system. And when a government does that, it means that spending more in Washington means higher prices here at home.', 'Let me say this to you: We need in Washington a man like Nelson Gross who will support the President on this fundamental issue, and it is a very tempting issue for a political man. It is very easy to vote for every spending program. But we need a man who has the courage to vote against the program that might benefit some people but would raise prices and taxes for all people. That is the kind of a man that we have in Nelson Gross.', 'And, my friends, we need to reform the institutions of government in this country. We need to quit putting good money into bad programs in America.', ""Let's look at our welfare program. The welfare costs in New Jersey go up and up and up by the millions of dollars. That is true all over the country. Hundreds of thousands more people go on welfare."", 'Let me say to you, when I find a program which makes it more advantageous for a man not to work than to work then it is time to junk that program and get something new.', 'When I find a program that will encourage a man to desert his family rather than stay with his family, it is time to get rid of that program and get another one.', ""That is why this administration, over a year ago, submitted to the Congress of the United States a new program that would take care of everybody who needs it, and everybody who is unable to work, but which would say that a man would have an incentive to work, would be required to work, and if he is able to work and is offered a job and then won't work then he doesn't get any welfare. That is the kind of a program that Nelson Gross suggests."", 'We need programs, my friends. You know about what is happening to your local taxes, any of you that are homeowners, how they go up and up and up. You know here in the State of New Jersey how Bill Cahill has had to fight the problems of his budget because the funds that are needed to run State government seem always to get smaller and smaller, and the problems get bigger and bigger. That is why this administration has offered a revolutionary new program in which the Federal Government will share its tax revenues with the States.', ""And you know another thing that that does? It means that for 190 years we have seen power in this country flowing from the people and from the States up to Washington, D.C. I don't think that is fight. I think the power belongs to the people, and I think it is time that we have a program in which power will flow from Washington back to the States and back to the people of New Jersey and the people of America."", 'Now, my friends, there is another place where we need Nelson Gross--in the Senate. Not only will he support the President on this great issue of bringing a just peace in the world, of reforming the institutions of Government, of reducing that kind of spending that would lead to higher prices and taxes. But, my friends, Nelson Gross is a man who knows law enforcement, and he is a man that will stand firmly for the legislation that this President has asked for and that has been delayed and, in many times, not passed that would wage a winning war against crime in this country. It is time that we wage that war, and Nelson Gross will help us win that war.', 'It took the Congress almost a year and a half to pass the organized crime bill. The bill which would stop the obscenity and the pornography from going into the homes of Americans still languishes in the Senate. It is time to get that bill out of the Congress of the United States and enacted into law.', 'And also we have in Nelson Gross a man who is not just for law enforcement during an election campaign, but who stands for it all year round. That is the kind of man that we want in the United States Senate.', 'I turn now to a problem that concerns many Americans. We see here a number of television cameras. We appreciate their covering this rally. On the television tonight I will predict that what you are likely to see is not this great crowd. You are likely to see a few demonstrators here, or in Vermont where there were a few hundred, and thousands who did not demonstrate. I do not say that critically of television because, you see, that small minority with their obscene language, throwing their rocks, engaging in violence, they come across the television screen and many, I think, it seems to me, without justification, have gotten the impression that that small minority is a majority of Americans. My friends, they are not a majority, and I want to tell you what you can do about it.', 'Some have asked me, ""What do we do about those that shout obscene slogans? What do we do about those that throw rocks?"" My answer is, ""Don\'t answer in kind. You don\'t have to shout obscenities back to them. You do not have to engage in violence. You do not have to throw rocks. It is time for the great majority to stand up and be counted and to be heard.""', 'I could tell you how you can be heard: You can be heard in a quiet way but with the most powerful voice that democracy has ever created. On November 3d, you walk into that polling booth and you vote, and one vote is worth a hundred obscene slogans.', 'Vote for Nelson Gross.']"

I want them all to stand up together.', 'The last time I stood in this spot was exactly 2 years ago about this date. Many of you were here. There was a feel of victory in the air then. Ohio State was on the way to the Rose Bowl and I was on the way to the White House.', 'And based on what I have seen on the football fields and what I sense in this great crowd today, there is the feel of victory here today. We are going to win in this year 1970.', ""One word, first, with regard to Ohio State. I can only say that in that respect I recall seeing Ohio State play in that Rose Bowl Game and beat my wife's alma mater, Southern California. This year, I have a complaint to make."", 'I am going to talk about the TV people. I usually leave this to Vice President Agnew. But it is time that I did a little something with that.', ""I have a complaint to the ABC national network, why they didn't have the foresight and the judgment to make Ohio State and Michigan the game of the week so I could see it on TV."", 'When I saw Woody Hayes1 coming in, I said, ""Woody, do you think I could get a ticket, if I came out to see the game?""', 'He said, ""I can\'t even get a ticket. I can\'t get you one, even though you are President of the United States.""', 'All that I can say is this: In the field of football, there is the feel of victory and I can assure you that in the field of politics, I sense that same tide running in our direction. It is running in our direction for a number of reasons.', 'First, because Jim Rhodes, as Governor of this State, has given this State magnificent leadership, the lowest taxes of any industrial State, the lowest unemployment of any industrial State, and it is because Ohio should continue that kind of leadership, that Roger Cloud will follow in his footsteps with the experience, with the ability and the strength that Jim Rhodes has displayed.', ""There is another thing I like about Jim Rhodes. He is a team player. You know, in my political life, I have won a few and I have lost a few. But the real test of a man is not when he wins but when he loses. And what I like about Jim Rhodes is after a tough primary, he is in there fighting for the team, because the team is bigger than any one man and let's give him the appreciation that Jim Rhodes deserves for that."", 'And now I come to the contest for the United States Senate. I spoke 20 years ago in Ohio for another Robert Taft. He was not the favorite that year, but he won overwhelmingly. And it was a great service, not only to Ohio, but to the Nation, that he was sent to Washington, D.C., and that he was immortalized as a result of his service in the United States Senate.', 'Let me say that on this occasion, I am proud to speak for another Robert Taft, not only because he will write a bright new page in the history of a very distinguished family, not only because he happens to be a personal friend of mine over many years, not only because he happens to be a Republican--those are all good reasons to be for a man and here in Ohio to speak for him particularly when I am a grandson of Ohio, and very proud of that fact--but my friends, this election this year is too important to think in terms of family, in terms of personality, even in terms of party labels.', 'Let me tell you this is a year to think of what is best for America, and it is because Bob Taft stands for what America needs, that I am for him for the United States Senate and I hope that you support him for the United States Senate.', 'I hear some people who express concern about various policies that we have. I believe in handling the tough, high, hard ones and here we go right now on the major one. The first responsibility of your Government in Washington, D.C., is to develop policies which will not only end the war, but more important, end it in a way that we can win the peace and a real peace for the next generation.', ""Let me tell you what we have done. When I spoke on these steps 2 years ago, there were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam, with no plans to bring them home. During the spring of next year, one-half of them will be back. We are bringing Americans home, rather than sending them out there. Aren't you for that?"", ""At the time that I spoke here 2 years ago, American casualties were 300 a week. They are the lowest in 4 ½ years and they are continuing to go down. Aren't you for that? Let's get them down."", 'When I spoke here 2 years ago, there was no peace plan on the table. We have offered a cease-fire. We have offered an exchange of prisoners of war. We have offered a negotiated settlement which is fair, according to all standards of international diplomacy.', 'My friends, we are on a program which will end this war and win the peace. But we need Bob Taft in the Senate so that we can support those policies, rather than to fight against them.', 'Why not now? A young man in New Jersey, Saturday, talked to me and he said, ""Bring the men home from Vietnam, bring them home right now."" I asked him, ""Have you been there?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Those men are fighting there so you won\'t have to go.""', ""And my friends, let's look back on the history of this country. We fought World War I and we ended it. We fought World War II and we ended it. We fought the Korean war and we ended it. But did you know that in the whole history of this century, we have not had one full generation of peace? And I say, let's end this war in a way that we we will discourage those that make war. Let's have a generation of peace for the young men that are shouting out there, a generation of peace for all the young men of America."", 'That is our foreign policy. At home, in Vietnam, and throughout the world, it is a strong policy, a policy of strength, and I am proud to defend it here today and advocate those men who will also stand with it.', ""We turn to the problems that many of you are concerned about here at home. I see this immense crowd--Jim Rhodes says it's the largest crowd that has ever been gathered here in this historic place. Let me tell you that I know that when you leave this place, you will go shopping. I know that as you go into the grocery stores and the clothing stores and all the other places, you are going to be concerned about the fact that prices have been going up. Let me tell you what we have found."", ""Two years ago we found that our Government in Washington, D.C., was on a runaway spending binge and now the American people have a hangover in higher prices. I say let's cut spending in Washington, D.C., so you can have more to spend right here at home in Columbus and throughout the State of Ohio."", 'And there is a clear issue here. Are you going to be for the big spenders or a man like Bob Taft or a man like Roger Cloud or a man like Bill Saxbe and the others here in the House delegation who are going to vote to see to it that we handle our Federal budget in a way that people can balance their family budgets. That is responsible government. It is a kind of government you want. If you want to stop the rise in inflation, then ours is the program. Stand with us and not against us.', ""Let me come to a third point. I know that many are concerned about the problems of the escalating costs of our welfare in this country. Let's understand that and understand it in the great humanitarian tradition of this State."", 'Every American wants to see that every individual who is unable to work, every child whose fault is not his in the event that he does not have that income from his family in order to have an adequate living--to see to it that people who need help are helped, and this administration has a new program which will do exactly that. It is called family assistance. I want to tell you what it does.', 'It provides a floor of assistance on which every family that needs help can stand with dignity. But on the other hand, it has a work requirement and a work incentive. And I want to tell you why.', ""Look at the present welfare program. When a program makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when it encourages him to desert his family than to stay with his family, then let's get rid of it and get another kind of a program for the American people."", 'If an individual is trained for a job, is offered a job, and refuses to work, then the taxpayers should not subsidize him on welfare. I think that is the kind of a program you also want.', 'In this whole area of reform, reform of our government so that the Federal Government will share revenues with the States, so that the States like Ohio will be able to meet their responsibilities more adequately and so that power that has flowed to Washington, D.C., will come back to the people of the United States, these programs we need support for in order to get them through the House and through the Senate. That is why I am for these Members of the House and these Members of the Senate who will vote for reform rather than a return to the old ways.', ""Let's quit putting good money into bad programs. Let's have new programs. Reform America. That is what we are going to do. There are so many other areas."", 'The historic program on the environment-- clean up the air, clean up the water, provide open spaces, provide again for our young people the heritage that every young American should have--this we can have but we need support in the House and support in the Senate and not the foot-dragging that we have from the present Congress.', ""Let's have that kind of program, and we ask for your support in that respect."", 'Now I come to another issue that deeply concerns everybody here in this audience, and it should. I read this morning of a report from Minneapolis where a Federal building was bombed. I read a report also, a report in Canada--and I called the Prime Minister of Canada and expressed my sympathy--where a Canadian Government official was kidnaped, held for blackmail, and when it was not paid, he was killed.', 'All over this country today we see a rising tide of terrorism, of crime, and on the campuses of our universities we have seen those who instead of engaging-which is their right--in peaceful dissent, engage in violence, try to shout down speakers with obscene words. My friends, it is time to draw the line and to say we are not going to stand for that.', 'My friends, I want to tell you we cannot provide the leadership that will keep peace abroad unless we can keep the peace at home. And we are going to keep it at home.', ""And, my friends, we need in the House and in the Senate and in ,the Governor's chair, not men who become strong for law and order just at election, but strong for it all the year round, and that is Bob Taft and Roger Cloud. That is the kind of men that we need."", ""My friends, law, order, justice--let me tell you what has happened in this administration's program. I submitted a program to deal with organized crime, to stop the flow of obscenity and pornography into the homes of our children, to stop the traffic in narcotics and drugs 18 months ago. Only 2 weeks ago the first bill arrived on my desk and the others have not been acted upon."", 'I say it is time to give us men in the House and the Senate who will vote for strong laws to deal with law and order rather than against them. That is Bob Taft and that is the Members of the House and our candidates.', 'There is one other point I would like to make. I think it should be made in this great university town, Ohio State, that celebrated its 100th anniversary. A few weeks ago I spoke at Kansas State University. The press was rather surprised that in a crowd of 15,000 there were a few who demonstrated like these. But most of them stood up against violence and because they recognized--and get this-that any society that provides as our society does, a means for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence and lawlessness.', 'Some of those who covered that meeting said that was only Kansas State. That wouldn\'t happen at other universities. Then I was in Wisconsin Saturday night. And a student from the University of Wisconsin came up. And he said to me, ""You know, there are a lot of Kansas States in this country."" Don\'t get the idea that those that bomb buildings, those that shout four-letter obscenities, that they are the youth of America. They are not the youth of America today and they will not be the majority of the youth of America tomorrow.', 'I have a message for you, all of you. This great crowd of 100,000 here, all of you listening on radio and television, wherever you may be, whether you are Democrats or Republicans, whether you are students or workers or employers or whatever you are, all of you as Americans, I have a message for you. Listen carefully.', 'I know people are concerned when there are those that throw rocks at the President of the United States, as they did in Vermont. I know there are those who are concerned when people shout four-letter obscenities, as this crowd over here is doing. And so they say, what do we do?', ""I say, don't answer in kind. Don't engage in violence against them. You don't have to shout four-letter obscenities. But it is time for the great silent majority of America to stand up and be counted. And I will tell you how you can be counted. On November 3d, in the quiet of the polling booth, consider the candidates, consider their record the year round and if that candidate has given encouragement to, has condoned lawlessness and violence and permissiveness, then you know what to do."", 'My friends, here is what you do on November 3d. The answer to those who shout obscenities, who throw rocks, who engage in violence, is not to answer in kind but with the most powerful voice in the history of mankind, one vote. And I say that on November 3d, the American people, the majority, are going to be heard with their votes, by voting for Bob Taft and Roger Cloud and all those who stand for what America really wants.']"

That is the main thing.', 'I met a few of your Ohio people yesterday. The most important thing in a campaign is basically momentum--who is going in the last 2 weeks.', ""About a week or 2 weeks ago, it began to run. I think that this campaign in Ohio and in the Nation will be determined in the next 2 weeks. I think that I have never seen as many undecided voters in the polls that I have seen. I don't know whether it is true in this State."", 'The undecided voters are going to determine it. And that is why these appearances that all of us are making in the last a weeks may have some effect. I think that, in other words, what people will decide in the next 2 weeks will determine the future in all the close races.', ""Also, I have never seen so many close races, close races in all fields. They are real tight. That is why momentum is important. In a close race we want the momentum on our side. So let's move. Let's go."", 'Nice to see all of you.', 'I will see you downtown.']"

I remember my visit here in 1968. I remember that when I came here they were saying that it was not possible to carry Missouri. They are saying the same thing, some of them, about Jack Danforth today. We carried it in '68. He is going to carry it in 1970, because I sense a great tide running in this country and I sense it running in this hall."", 'I see it among the people along the motorcade routes. I feel it among the audiences that I speak to. I feel it also in this country, as I travel over it from State to State.', 'And speaking first of this State, I want to tell you why I feel so much at home here and so appreciative of your welcome.', 'First, as you know, I am somewhat of a football fan. And I am always honored to be in the city of the champions of the world, the Kansas City Chiefs.', ""I didn't make any votes in Minnesota with that one, did I?"", 'Also, I am very honored to be here because Kansas City, Missouri, is right next door to Kansas City, Kansas.', 'And I recall my visit to Kansas State a few weeks ago, the wonderful reception we had there. I met the fine candidates. I know the splendid services being rendered in the United States Senate by Senator Bob Dole and Senator Jim Pearson and I know that they would say, if they were speaking here, that they would like to have just one more vote with them in the United States Senate, in the person of Jack Danforth.', 'And I am very proud to endorse wholeheartedly, as I did in Kansas, and I will do it here, Kent Frizzell, their candidate, the candidate for Governor. I believe that he is a strong man and will be a strong Governor in that State. I am proud to be here on the platform with him today.', 'And now, if I may come to the subject of the Senate race here in the State of Missouri, I want to discuss it in a way that will be somewhat surprising to you.', ""I listened to Doc Hall's1 moderate rhetoric. [Laughter] I am going to have you write some speeches for Vice President Agnew."", 'And I know that in this State and believe me I appreciate the tradition of this State--I know that in this State that it is a great tradition to put on a fighting campaign. I like to put on a fighting campaign, particularly when I am the candidate.', 'But I want to say to you today, that I want to give you today the arguments. I want to talk to you, not in terms simply of why we are against the other fellow, but why we are for Jack Danforth and why he ought to be the next Senator from the State of Missouri.', 'I could say that for a number of reasons, one, because he is a Republican and I am a Republican; second, because he is a man who is one of our bright new stars on the political scene, a young man with all of a great future ahead of him. As he spoke here so quietly with such poise and such confidence, I could think of that voice in the chambers of the United States Senate. It would be a fine voice. It would be listened to, believe me.', 'I know his opponent. I know the other Senator from Missouri. I have nothing personal against either of them. I know them both personally.', 'But it seems to me that when Missouri in 1968 cast its votes for the Republican President, and when he has attempted, as Jack Danforth has so eloquently pointed out, to bring new leadership to this country, new leadership to bring peace abroad, to restore peace at home, to stop the rise in the cost of living, to reform government, and when on virtually every major issue when there was a real test, both votes in the Senate from Missouri were against the president, I think if the President carried Missouri, he ought to have one Senator that is going to be with him from Missouri and that is Jack Danforth.', ""Understand, I don't mean all the time. I don't expect that. I respect and you respect a man that disagrees or a woman that disagrees with you on this issue or that one. But what I am suggesting to you, my friends, is that today what we are going to decide on November 3d, is more important than that I happen to like this man, this young vigorous man of the future, as I do, the fact that he is a member of my party, which I am proud that he is, what is important is that we are deciding the future of America. That future is going to be determined more by the makeup of the next United States Senate, than perhaps by anything that happens in the elections this year."", 'There is a reason for that, a very strong reason, because the Senate, as Bob Dole will tell you, is very evenly divided. I am not referring party-wise. I am referring right at the present time, it is very evenly divided.', 'You have noted whenever the great issues have come up, there is usually a majority of one that determines it, or two or three. And so, it means that you, in this State of Missouri, are going to determine not just one Senator out of 100, you are going to determine, by yours votes, as to whether or not that majority is going to be for the kind of leadership that the President is trying to give or against it-not for him personally, that is not important, but for what he stands for and what he is trying to do for the country.', 'Let me talk to that issue, then. What are we trying to do? What do you want? What do we vote for?', 'I remember that campaign. I remember what I said when I was here. Some of you may remember.', 'In 1968, as I campaigned in Missouri, and in January of 1969, when I was inaugurated as President of the United States, I found that we had been in the war in Vietnam for 5 years.', 'I found that we had 550,000 Americans there. I found that there was no plan to bring them home. There was no plan that had been presented, a peace plan at the conference table in Paris.', 'I found that it was necessary to do something to bring that war to an end and win a just peace, and so we began. Here is what we have done. Listen.', 'Instead of sending more to Vietnam as has been the case for the past 5 years, we have been bringing them home and we will continue to bring men home and replace them with South Vietnamese.', 'Instead of the battle going up and up and up, and the casualties at 300 a week as they were when we came in, they have gone down and down and down, and they are going to go lower because we are for the kind of a program that is reducing the lives that are being lost in Vietnam.', ""And instead of the United States standing there without any kind of a peace plan, we have offered, as you have heard on television 2 weeks ago, a peace plan which offers a cease-fire without any conditions, a peace plan which offers to negotiate a political settlement, a peace plan which offers to have a conference with regard to all of Indochina so that we can withdraw all foreign forces from that area--and further, a peace plan which would do something that ought to have been done long ago. Even though we have far more of their prisoners than they have of ours, we say let's release the prisoners."", 'I think that this is the kind of a plan that is fair and it is certainly one that Americans can proudly stand on.', 'Now, my friends, I can tell you we are on the road to ending this war. We will end it, if necessary, through continuing the process of replacing Americans with South Vietnamese, a longer road; or we will end it, if we can, through negotiation if the North Vietnamese are willing to accept our offer to negotiate.', 'But the important thing for us to bear in mind is how and why we must bring this war to a conclusion in the fight way.', 'Before we came into this hall tonight, I saw, as you saw--and as a matter of fact they were rather loud, I could hear them on the top floor of the Muehlebach [Hotel]--a few people who were saying, a few hundred, I understood this, who were saying, ""End the war."" They were saying it in words a little more expressive than that, but they were saying end the war-now. End it now.', ""Let me ask you something: You all know that the President of the United States as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces could have ended the war the day that I came in. But my friends, ending the war isn't the problem. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. And I say this particularly to these young people sitting down here and who are scattered all through this audience. Even though we have ended three wars in this century, we have yet to have a generation of peace. What we want to do is to end this war in a way that will discourage aggression and reduce the chances of another war. Let's have a full generation of peace for America."", 'That is what we are doing in Vietnam. That is why we have also worked out a cease-fire in the Mideast. That is why we have kept the strength and are keeping the strength of America up, but are indicating our willingness to negotiate with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear arms.', 'The United States commitment to peace is unquestioned. But let us remember, it is important if we are going to have a peace, not just peace for the next election but peace for the next generation, that the United States be strong and not weak unless we get a mutual reduction on the part of our strength and on the other side as well.', 'And so, my friends, I say to you on this great issue, the issue of peace, we stand for peace. We are ending the war. We are going to have a just peace. One that will bring peace in the Pacific and will increase the chances for peace in the world. And we need help, support in the United States Senate for that kind of responsible policy. We can get that kind of support from a man like Jack Danforth.', 'I looked back over my notes in 1968 when I was here in Kansas City. I find I talked about something else, the rise in prices, the cost of living. And you know that it has continued. You remember what had happened. Prices were going up. They have continued to go up until we have finally checked the rate of inflation over the past 3 months.', ""Now let's come to a key point: Why have they gone up? Very simply: because the previous administration, over a period of years, had spent far more than the tax system would produce with full employment. And when you do that, when you have runaway spending in Washington, you have runaway prices at home. And I say, let's get the big spenders out of Washington and get the savers into Washington. And Jack Danforth is a saver."", ""And now, let's turn to that exciting issue of reform. This is enormously interesting, particularly to our young people and it should be, because I suppose for those in our generation, we could make do with the policies of the past. But they aren't good enough for the problems of the future or even of the present, and that's why this administration has offered the most exciting and revolutionary program of reform in this century."", 'Let me tell you some of the things that it does. Jack Danforth has touched upon them. I will spell them out only briefly.', ""Revenue sharing. What does that really mean? I will tell you what it means. For 190 years we have seen power in this great country of ours flow from the people and from the cities and from the States to Washington, D.C. And now I say it's time for power to flow back from Washington to the States and to the cities and to the people of this country."", ""Why is that important? That is important not just simply as an exercise in political science. It is important because I think the people of Missouri and the people of Kansas and the people of Kansas City know better how to plan their lives than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C. Let's get the decisions made right back out here."", 'But you see, that is very easy to say. You talk to a Governor or anybody that wants to be Governor. You talk to a mayor or anybody that wants to be mayor and he will say, ""We don\'t have the money."" That is why we have proposed a program in which the Federal Government would share some of the tax revenues that we collect with the State governments and with city governments so that this matter could be handled there at the city and the State level.', ""Isn't it about time that we did this? And if it is about time to do this, give us the men in the Senate and in the House that will vote for that kind of program."", 'In the field of reform, I want to turn briefly to welfare reform, since Jack Danforth mentioned it in his introduction. First, let us understand what we all feel very deeply in our hearts. Every American wants to be sure that anyone who. needs assistance and who cannot care for himself receives assistance. We can be very thankful that this country is rich enough, as we enter the last third of this century, to provide adequately for the needs of all the people in this country, if they are unable to help themselves.', ""This is a wonderful thing. It has never happened in any country in the history of the world before. It is because we are rich and because we are strong. It is because, for example, our agriculture has produced as much as it has, and our industry has produced as much as it has that America is able now to look at a program in which we can provide for every family that needs it, a floor of dignity on which to stand in terms of its income. That's family assistance."", 'But there is another side to the coin. If a program has the effect of making it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, if it encourages a man to desert his family rather than to stay with his family-and that is what the present welfare program does--I say it is time to get rid of that program and get another one.', 'And if a man is able-bodied, if a man is trained for a job, if a man then is offered a job and if he refuses to work, I say the taxpayers should not subsidize him for loafing. That is something that we believe in.', ""And that will be reform of our present program. Welfare costs go up and up and up. The number of people on the rolls go up and up and up. But let us provide that basis for dignity for every family that needs it, and particularly for the children of that family, but let's quit subsidizing those who are able to work, can have jobs and do have jobs, or could get them, and refuse to take them. This very simply is something that I believe you are for."", 'Since I am speaking in the city, I should mention, too, the programs that we call--generally are described as the subject of the environment. This covers a lot of things, you know, pure air, clean up the air, clean up the water, open spaces, parks, not just parks far out in the West or in the middle of the country but parks in ,the cities and the rest, so that the quality of life may be improved.', 'This administration, as you will note if you have heard my State of the Union Message, has come forth with a program that is more progressive, more far-reaching, more farsighted in this field than has ever been offered before. We still have not had action.', 'We need men in the Senate, men in the House that will support it.', 'And may I say in that connection, we are very proud of the fact that in the House of Representatives from the State of Kansas, for example, we have men like Larry Winn, then from the State of Missouri, men like Doc Hall. We need more. Send us some in the House as well as the Senate.', 'But, my friends, in this field of reform, insofar as our environment is concerned, it is possible now for this great wealthy country to provide the means to clean up our air so that we are not going to find 15 or 20 years from now that we will be the richest country in the world, but choking to death with smog, poisoned by the water, terrorized by crime, and with all the problems that are involved in traffic jams and so forth in our cities.', 'We are looking ahead. But in order to get these programs through, we need a man in the United States Senate who also is looking to the future and not to the past, and Jack Danforth is that kind of a man, a man of the future rather than a man of the past.', 'And now one other subject I want to cover, and that is one that is on the minds of every American, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, whatever their party affiliation may be--Jack Danforth referred to it--the problem of crime in this country, of disruption.', 'I just got a report that in my home State of California, at the University of California campus at Irvine, only 10 miles from where I live, a bomb blew up a scientific laboratory, not one for defense in this case, but one that was used for the purpose of the environment, a senseless act, the kind of terrorism that we see over this country, sometimes in our universities, sometimes in our cities.', 'We all know what was the situation when we came into office. Crime went up over 150 percent in the 8 years of the two previous administrations. And so we tried to do something about it. I will tell you what we have done.', 'I submitted 18 months ago--and Doc Hall and Larry Winn, Senator Dole will bear me out--I submitted to the Congress the most comprehensive crime control legislation ever presented before the Congress, legislation that would deal with organized crime, that would deal with narcotics, that would stop the flow of pornography and filth into the homes, particularly of those of our young people.', 'And yet, what has happened? Only one of those major proposals has come to my desk for signature, the one on organized crime. The others still wait action.', 'What we need in the Senate of the United States, what we need in the Congress of the United States--and listen to me very carefully--is not simply men that are against crime. Everybody is against crime. But we need men who are against it, and will work against it and vote against it, and talk against it all year round, and not just at election time. Jack Danforth is that kind of a man.', 'On this one issue alone, we need him in the United States Senate. He is an expert. He has been the Attorney General of this State. He is for law, he is for order, and he is for justice. And we need all three.', 'If we are going to have respect for law, we have to have laws that deserve respect. He is that kind of a man. He will render enormous service not only to this State of Missouri but to this whole Nation by being in that Senate and working day after day for the kind of legislation that will stop the rise of crime and deal effectively with this problem all over the United States.', 'It can be done, because I am convinced that the people of the United States will back up that kind of program if their representatives in the Senate and House will vote for it. And you can be sure I will sign the legislation when it comes to my desk.', 'I mentioned a moment ago that as we came into the doors tonight, there were a few shouting some slogans. And as I came in, two or three of the ushers expressed concern about it. I want to give you my attitude on that as I have other audiences.', 'Jack Danforth has referred to the fact that on this campaign trail, Saturday and also today, I had a few rocks in Vermont, a few shouters in New Jersey and North Dakota and Ohio and so forth.', ""But let's keep it all in context and let's be absolutely fair as to what is involved. You know, night after night, if you look at your television, what do you see? You will see a few demonstrators shouting their smutty four-letter words, shaking their fists. You will hear about a bombing here or an act of violence there."", ""And you get the impression that that is the majority of American youth. I have news for you, if you didn't have or ever had that opinion."", ""I was at Kansas State 3 or 4 weeks ago, as you know. And when I was there, I found that the great majority of the students were ones that did not approve of that kind of action. Oh, they didn't approve of everything I said, I am sure."", ""And to the great credit of the young generation, they don't like things as they are. They want progress, as I do. They want to change the environment, as I do, and Jack Danforth does. They want, of course, programs that will lead to peace and lasting peace and that is certainly something I am working for every waking hour, you can be sure."", 'But also, let us understand the younger generation has been given a bad name by a few violent demonstrators. They do not speak for youth and they do not speak for America.', 'Now, my friends, when I mentioned that that happened at Kansas State, I think you should know that Senator Dole reported to me that some of those in the press in their columns said, ""Well, that was Kansas State. That wouldn\'t happen on the campuses in some of the eastern schools or the other midwestern schools or the western schools.""', 'Let me tell you why. Sure, that was Kansas State. But I was up in Wisconsin the other day, and you know, they had a very terrible bombing, you recall, in which a university professor was killed, one who was doing research.', 'And a student came up to me, as I was about ready to speak at a testimonial dinner for Bart Starr. He said, ""Mr. President, I just want you to know, I go to the university, and the great majority of the students at the University of Wisconsin do not approve of that kind of thing.""', 'They want an education. They may disagree, but they believe, as you believe, that in a system that provides for a method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence.', 'In Ohio State today, I ran into students, scores of them, and that was the same message that came through loud and clear.', ""And so now, I am talking particularly to all of this great audience here. I want to tell you what your answer should be. How do you answer that--violence, terror, four-letter obscenities? Don't answer in kind. You don't need to, because you have a more powerful answer than that. The most powerful four-letter word is a clean word. It is the most powerful four-letter word in the history of men. It is called vote--v-o-t-e."", 'And, my friends, I say that the answer to those that engage in disruption, to those that shout their filthy slogans, to those that try to shout down speakers is not to answer in kind, but go to the polls on election day and in the quiet of that ballot box stand up and be counted, the great silent majority of America.', 'That is your answer. Vote for those men that your conscience tells you will be best for America.', 'I close simply by saying since I am speaking primarily about this fine young man who is your candidate for the United States Senate--he is a young man; he is a man of the future rather than the past; he is a man who has strong ideas about what is best for America; he is a man that can bridge the generation gap; he is a man that can provide the kind of leadership that we need in the Senate of the United States, particularly on this issue of providing order and progress and justice under law--the great question the voters of this State have to answer this time very simply is this:', 'You have a choice, a choice between one man who honestly believes that he is right in opposing the programs that I have described, most of them on virtually every occasion, and another man, a man of the future, who says it is time for reform, it is time for programs that will win a just peace, it is time for programs that will protect Americans against the rise in crime and the rise, of course, in disruption and in other areas.', ""I say to you, my friends, that this is a time when the voters of Missouri have an opportunity. The man of 'the hour, the man for this year and the man for the years to come is Jack Danforth. Give him your vote.""]"
14,Richard Nixon ,"October 19, 1970","['Congressman Kleppe, Congressman Andrews, Mr. Chairman, all of the distinguished guests, and all of this great audience here in Grand Forks:', ""I first want to express my great appreciation to you for this wonderfully warm welcome and to tell you that I have been to North Dakota more times than Tom Kleppe has mentioned. I started campaigning this State when I was not a candidate for national office back in the year 1948. You'll remember, Mark.1 And I am very proud to say that during my political career, as all of you who have studied politics know, I have won a few and I have lost a few. But I am proud to say that every time I have been on the national ticket, I carried North Dakota."", 'Thank you very much.', ""Today, I am not here in my own behalf. I am here in behalf of the United States of America. I am here in behalf of those things that I think you stand for, all of you stand for, Democrats, Republicans; and incidentally, let me say that I welcome the fact that we have some who express disagreement here. You have every right to be here. I can handle it. Don't worry about it. Go right ahead."", ""I simply want you to know that our great system, that is what gives it life. The only thing that we have to bear in mind is that if you want to know the facts, you have got to listen. When it is your turn to talk, then you talk, but sometimes, listen and don't try to shout the speaker down. That is all we ask."", 'And on that score, I have some things to say to you today, not just about the candidates that I am here to speak in behalf of, and I am proud to be here, not only for Tom Kleppe, but for Bob McCarney running for the House of Representatives, our fine congressional candidate in the other district. But I want to talk to you about what this election means in terms of where America is going to go, where it is going to go these next few years, in terms of the things we want. I am not speaking what Republicans want or what Democrats want, but what we as Americans want.', 'And we begin with something that is tremendously important to everybody here. We begin with what those young people are talking about--peace.', 'I want you to know that when I campaigned 2 years ago in 1968, and when I went into the Presidency almost 2 years ago, this is what I found: I found 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. I found our casualties at 300 a week. I found there was no plan to end the war. I found that Americans were going out there rather than coming home. So we went to work on it.', 'And you know what we have done? After sending Americans, as was the case in the previous administration, to Vietnam for 5 years, we are bringing them home, and we are bringing them home by the hundreds of thousands.', 'Second, after casualties of Americans going up and up and up, we have wound down the war and they have gone down, and if you will look at the records, they are the lowest in 4 ½ years, and they are going to go lower.', 'Third, instead of the United States standing there with no peace plan, those of you who heard on television a couple of weeks ago, you heard what we offered, the most generous peace settlement in the whole history, certainly, of international diplomacy: a cease-fire without conditions, the willingness to negotiate on a political settlement, to negotiate for all of Indochina, and also the vitally important issue, we said let\'s exchange the prisoners of war. We have far more than they do, but we said, ""We will give all we have. You give up yours as well.""', 'That peace offer is on the table. We are bringing home Americans, and I say to you we are on the road to a just peace in Vietnam. And I say to you further that in order to get that just peace in Vietnam, we need support. We need it in the House of Representatives where people like Mark Andrews have given us such great support along with his colleagues. We need it particularly in the Senate of the United States.', 'And listen to this, a majority of one at this time--even before we control the Senate--in vote after vote determines whether the President is going to be supported in his plan for a just peace or whether he is going to be rejected.Let me be very precise on this point.', 'As I speak here in behalf of Tom Kleppe, I am not here to speak personally against his opponent. I know him. I respect him as a man. They have a difference of opinion. One man opposes the President and the other man is for the President. You have got to decide which you are for.', 'I think that North Dakota should think not in terms of whether a man is for the President or against him on a personal basis, but again on the great issues.', 'Let\'s look at the peace issue. Here is the question: These young people say, ""End the war."" I agree. Let\'s end it. But my friends, let me tell you, I see some older people here. You know that we have had in this century four wars. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the war in Korea and yet, we have not yet had a full generation of peace. I say it is time to end the war in a way that we win a peace and that is what we are doing in Vietnam.', 'I say that what we need to do is to end this war in a way that will discourage those who would start another war, and that is why I say, my friends, that we are on that road. We are ending this war. We are training the South Vietnamese so that they can defend themselves against those who might start another war and it means that these young people--and we think so deeply of their future and what we want for them--they will have a chance that none of us have had in the older generation, a chance for a full generation of peace.', 'That is what we are for. That is what Tom Kleppe is for and that is why we need his support in the United States Senate for that kind of quality.', 'There are some other issues that you are interested in. This is one that covers the whole country. It is a question of what everything costs. You go to the grocery store, you go to the clothing store, you go down and buy farm equipment and farm machinery and I know that North Dakota is the State that has the greatest percentage of agriculture in the whole country, at the present time. You can be mighty proud of that. It is one of the great strengths of America, this great productive State of North Dakota in the farm field.', 'But I know from talking to farmers, to workers, to housewives across this country, in 1968 and now, they say, ""What can we do to stop the rise in prices?"" I will tell you what you can do.', 'You can send people to Washington, D.C., who will stop spending more and more money in Washington, so that you will have more and more money to spend right here in North Dakota.', ""Here there is an honest difference of opinion. I realize it is honest. On vote after vote in the United States Senate, where Milt Young has stood with us and other Members of the Senate have stood with us, we have had the situation where Tom Kleppe's opponent--and I know he honestly believes this--has voted every time for more and more and more spending. I say we need a Senator who will vote to stop the runaway spending in Washington, D.C., so that we can stop runaway spending here in North Dakota."", 'Now I want to say something about the farm program. I know that I am among experts here. I am proud to say that among those that advise me on the farm program are Mill Young, who, as Mark Andrews has well pointed out, will be the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the most powerful committee in the Senate, if we can elect Tom Kleppe and six more like him. A vote for Tom Kleppe is a vote for Mill Young to be chairman of that committee. And I am for that.', 'But I can tell you that Mark was in my office with Milt and Tom Kleppe a few months ago. They talked about the farm program. And we have attempted to work on that program.', 'We have not yet got it through the Congress. It is not our fault. The fact is that the Congress has delayed until after the election to move on it.', 'But there is one important thing that you should know: There is a critical amendment in that farm bill. It provides for 100 percent parity for wheat. The man who recommended it, the man who came down to the White House and talked to me about it, the man who got it in the farm bill is Tom Kleppe. He ought to be in the United States Senate so that he can speak for the farmers of North Dakota.', 'He is a man that can get things done. He is a man I will listen to, because I know what he is talking about, because I know that he speaks for the farmers, speaks for North Dakota, and he speaks for America. I respect him for that.', 'Let me say another thing: You live here in North Dakota and I know you are aware of the fact that under the latest census something has happened, something that, incidentally, to me, is not welcome in this country. It is a shift in population. North Dakota may lose one Congressman. The reason that it will lose one Congressman, as you know, is simply that because farm production has become more and more efficient, there has been a movement from the farms to the cities. That is why this administration has an exciting new program, a new program in which we recognize that what was once the old frontier of America, this great Midwest with all of its hope and its promise and its beauty and its strength, becomes a new frontier.', 'You know what it is? It is North Dakota and South Dakota and Wyoming and Montana and all the rest. This is good country. It is beautiful country. It is great country to raise a family in. And we ought to have programs that will provide the jobs that will bring new people into this country.', 'That is what we are for and that is what Tom Kleppe is working for, and Mark Andrews and the rest: a program to revitalize rural America, to see that the counties of America that are emptying out of people and promise then attract by reason of the fact that they offer those job opportunities to the people that would like to live here if they had the chance. That is why in the future in this administration as we locate airports, as we locate defense installations, as we locate government buildings, as we do the planning that could have effect on the development in this country, rather than concentrating it more and more in great cities which are already too overcrowded, we say go into rural America and build it up and that is, I think, a program that you in this great State will appreciate and will support in McCarney and Tom Kleppe.', ""There is another area that I feel very strongly about with Tom Kleppe. He is a man of progress. He's a man that looks to the future. He is a man that believes that we have to clean up the environment in this country, the air and the water and retain the open spaces and develop them for our future, for our children."", 'He is a man also, that believes in those programs that are essential for our older people. He supports the program that is not yet through the Congress, but should go through it, where those on social security will have an automatic escalation or increase in their social security, if there is a rise in prices. You know people that are on social security. You see them try to make their bills time and time again. The prices go up. Their social security stays the same. And it is time that we show concern for those people. We are doing it. Tom Kleppe is that kind of a man. He is one that understands it. He is one that is for people, believes in people, as you believe in them and I do.', 'And now, there is one other point. This is a subject that I am sure needs not to be discussed in this fine city in North Dakota, the home of a great university. May I say, however, it is one that should be discussed, it seems, at every city in this land, due to some of the events that we have been reading about in months and in the past weeks and, as a matter of fact, the past days.', 'Yesterday, I called our neighbor to the north, the Prime Minister of Canada. I expressed my sympathy to him for what had happened there--you remember reading about it in the paper and hearing about it on the television--where a government official was kidnaped; the cause had something to do about the liberation of Quebec. That is not the important thing. But the government official was kidnaped; ransom and blackmail was demanded. The Prime Minister refused to pay it and the government official was killed.', ""That was a terrible tragedy. That didn't happen in some faraway country. It happened in Canada. And that also happens in the United States. All over this land we see a new doctrine developing in recent years, that if the cause is one you believe in, and if the cause is right, any means is right to serve that cause. You can bomb a building. You can burn a building. You can engage in illegal conduct. You can not only demonstrate peacefully, but you can shout four-letter obscenities in a crowd. You can do all these things and the cause justifies it."", 'And we also see a rising rate of terrorism and crime across this country. I have been trying to do something about it, but I need some help. I want to tell you why.', ""I submitted a crime control bill, the whole package, to the Congress 18 months ago. And only one of them, the only major one, the organized crime bill, came to my desk just a week ago. But the one that would stop the flow of obscenity and filth into the homes where children are living, that isn't there yet. The one that would allow me to deal with, as it must be dealt with, the dangerous traffic in narcotics and dangerous drugs, it still isn't on the President's desk. And there is something else, too."", 'If we are going to stop the rise in crime in this country, we not only have to have laws, we have to have judges in the courts of this land who will enforce the laws, and enforce them effectively and fairly.', 'My friends, the President of the United States can ask for the laws and the President of the United States can appoint judges. But the Senate of the United States has to approve those laws and it must approve those judges. And I know where Tom Kleppe stands, not just in election, but all year round. He is strong for law and order and justice. And we need that kind of man in the United States Senate representing North Dakota.', ""Finally, I come to the key point that I think we all have to realize. I do appreciate the fact that in this audience there are those who disagree, those who agree. I appreciate your courtesy in listening to what I have had to say. We have had some rather interesting experiences in the last couple of days. They don't particularly bother me. After all, I have been heckled quite a bit during my political career, not just here but abroad as well. Saturday in Vermont, they threw a few rocks. In New Jersey, they shouted a bit. And so it was today earlier in Columbus, Ohio."", 'And so, the impression gets around the country, a false impression, that young Americans are all like that, that young Americans express their disagreement, not by courteously listening and then arguing their point of view, but that they always have to try to shout down a speaker, use four-letter obscenities, or even engage in violence.', 'And the reason that that is the impression across this country is that on our television screen night after night, you see it, you know, a building burned here, demonstrators shouting here, throwing rocks at the President there, or whatever the case might be.', ""Let me tell you something. I have news for you. That isn't a majority of young America. I have faith in young America, and I will tell you why. Because the majority of young Americans, they want progress for this country, they want peace for this country, they may not agree with every program that we have, but they also recognize that the way to progress and the way to peace is not through engaging in violence. And they also recognize that you are not going to learn anything unless you listen."", 'I simply want to say this: People will tell me; I have been asked, ""What do you do? How do you answer those who throw rocks, shout their four-letter obscenities? Do you do it, do you answer in kind?"" The answer is no, not at all. I will tell you what you do. You have got an answer. It is the most powerful answer in the world. It\'s time for the great silent majority of this country to stand up and be counted, and the way you can stand up and be counted is on election day. Go to the polls and vote.', 'Remember, the four-letter word that is most powerful of all the four letters in the world is vote--v-o-t-e.', 'And so there is your issue, my friends. Two men running for office in the Senate in this State. Both men are what I would call in personal terms good men, but deeply believing in different philosophies. One man, Tom Kleppe, will support the President in his efforts to bring not just peace now but peace we can keep, not just peace for the next election but peace for the next generation for these young people. That is what we want.', 'One man, Tom Kleppe, will vote for that strength that is necessary for America to have if we are going to be able to deter those who might start war, peace for the next generation.', 'One man will vote against those spending programs that will raise your prices and raise your taxes.', 'One man will vote for those programs of reform of our welfare system and reform of our environmental programs.', 'And one man will stand firmly for action, action on laws and action on approval of those judges who will enforce the laws that will stop the rise of crime in this country. That is your issue.', 'And I say that is bigger than whether you are a Republican; it is bigger than whether you are a Democrat. It involves the future of America, because I believe the future of America requires that kind of leadership, that kind of policy that I say the people of North Dakota should give their votes on November 3d to Tom Kleppe, a man who will stand with the President for what is best for America and best for North Dakota.', 'Thank you.']"
15,Richard Nixon ,"October 19, 1970","['I was thinking of Montana. I am going on to Grand Forks, North Dakota, and then on over to Kansas City tonight. Tomorrow we will be in Tennessee and in North Carolina, and Fort Wayne, Indiana.', 'After the meeting today, at the invitation of Dr. Fawcett,1 I dropped in at the university. I have been wanting to do this for some time.', 'As you may recall, I was invited to address the university at the commencement 2 years ago, and the Midway conference came up and I had to fly out there, and Vice President Agnew filled in for me.', 'This year, since we had about 15 or 20 minutes left for the schedule, Dr. Fawcett invited me to stop off at the campus. It was a brief visit. Some of the pool reporters were there to cover it.', 'But what was impressive to me was the chance, even though I was surrounded, as you might imagine, with quite a few reporters, but not many Secret Service or security men, because it was a surprise to them, too, but in that brief visit I got to shake hands with and met quite a few students.', ""I was very impressed by their dedication. I met several students, girls who are going into nursing, some who were going into elementary education, another was going to be a counselor in secondary education and then, also, college after she got her master's degree, and three or four from the law school."", 'The general impression that I had was a sense of great pride in their school and great dedication to their work.', ""But the other thing that impressed me was that on this impromptu visit, while I did not see anywhere near the total number or even a substantial part of the total number of this great enrollment at the university, but the overwhelming number of people on this impromptu visit--where there was no chance for demonstrators to plan in advance--were friendly. I don't mean by that to suggest that we polled them to see whether they support all of our policies. But they were friendly, they were glad that I came, they wanted to talk and they also were willing to listen."", ""That bore out the point that I tried to make in my remarks downtown, that we must not lose faith in young America because we see a few who engage in violence and hurl out four-letter obscenities. They aren't the majority of students, they certainly aren't the majority of America, and are not going to become the majority of students or the majority of America."", 'I think here at Ohio State, as at Kansas State and other universities, there are, of course, a great number of students who are concerned about many of our problems as I am. They want peace in the world, as I do. They want to clean up the environment, as I do. They want a better chance, as I do, as Bob Taft does and Roger Cloud does.', ""But the important point is the means. I think they are turned off this year, as they weren't turned off last year before the violence began to get to them. But they are turned off by the disgraceful conduct of the disrupters, those who close down campuses, those who engage in violence, those who shout four-letter obscenities or any other kind of obscenities and those who try to shout down speakers."", ""Young America wants to talk, but it also wants to listen. And I am very proud of them. And I am glad that my visit to Ohio State, even though it was brief, renewed my faith in young America. I always had it, but it renewed it, recharged it, because every time you get out and see any cross-section of young Americans, they are a very fine and dedicated group. They are concerned not just about themselves, but about their country, about their cities and about the future of the world. That is good. The fact that they don't accept the things, many of the things, that are going on, that is good. We need change and we need young people constantly questioning everything we are doing, but it should be peaceful change in our society. That is what I think the majority of the students at Ohio State think and Ohio State is certainly a representative university among our universities in the country."", 'Incidentally, I hope to get back to that game, too.', 'One of the students offered me his student card. He said, ""Gentlemen, I want to see the game. But if you will come, I will give you one of these cards that you get into the game with.""', 'I said, ""Gentlemen, have you got 30 for the Secret Service?"" And he took it back. But we may come back. It will be the only game I will see, though.', 'Thank you very much. Good luck and see you the next trip.']"

I am very grateful for the fact that every time my name has been on the ticket in Indiana--and that is four times--I have carried this State and that in the year 1968 Indiana gave the Nixon-Agnew ticket the biggest majority of any State in America.', 'When Indiana did that, Indiana expected something from the Nixon administration. It expected that we act on the problems that this country has. It expected that we act on the programs that I discussed during my campaign trips to Indiana.', 'We have tried to act on those problems. We have made some progress. But I can tell you--and I want to be very candid and frank in talking to this, what I know would be a highly sophisticated, political audience, because everybody in Indiana just is born on politics and loves it from the moment that he starts to grow up--I can say that a President can make speeches, a President can submit legislation, but in order to get what is needed in terms of his program, he has to have support in the Congress, in the House and in the Senate.', ""And it happens that in this present Congress, in 1968, we find that both the House and Senate were not under the control of the President's party. I do not complain about that. I respect the right of people to vote, as you do, for the party of their choice or the man of their choice."", 'But on the other hand, this is the time for the people of Indiana and the people of the Nation to look at the various candidates to determine whether or not they feel those candidates have been carrying out their wishes or whether they have been working in interests that they do not approve of.', 'And I will simply say this at the beginning. I think that the State in the Union which gave the Nixon-Agnew ticket the biggest majority, deserves at least one Senator who will support the President and not be against him.', 'I respect the right of people to disagree. I know that there are people who may believe that those who have opposed the various programs--and I am going to discuss them in one, two, three order tonight--that they were on the right side. But you decide.', 'I would like for you to forget Republicans or Democrats. Think of yourselves as Americans. Think of what you want for this country, think whether or not you want your Senator to vote that way or this way and then make your decision.', 'But I can tell you that an the great issues--the great issues involving foreign policy, which I have considered to be absolutely necessary in order to bring peace for a generation, not just for another election--in the next election, on the great issues involving the defense of this country, defense that I believe is vitally important if we are going to have the negotiations to reduce the burden of arms in the world; on the decisions involving the budget, decisions that have involved, in terms of the budget, whether or not we are going to see that runaway spending in Washington is controlled so that we do not have runaway inflation at home; and on the decisions involving some critical appointments to the courts in which judges, who stood firmly for the enforcement of law and order on a strict constructionist basis, were presented to the Senate and turned down---on these decisions both Senators from Indiana had been 100 percent against the President and I think it is time to change that. I think we need one who is for him.', ""Let's look at these various issues. And let's start with the one that is most important of all, particularly with so many young people here, people who are thinking of their future, young men who are thinking of the possibility that they may be in the service, young women who are thinking of the possibility that their husbands or their brothers may be in the service, may be subjected to the penalties of war."", 'When we came into office, we confronted a problem. We had had a war that had been going on for 5 years--men had been going out to Vietnam in increasing numbers for 5 years, casualties had been going up. Five hundred and fifty thousand Americans were in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring any of them home. The casualties were 300 a week. There was no peace plan on the table for negotiation in Paris. And then we came into office. We went to work.', 'First, we adopted a plan, not the cut and run, but a plan in which we were bringing Americans home from Vietnam. And for the past 20 months, instead of sending more Americans to Vietnam, they have been coming home by the tens of thousands, and they will continue to come home under this administration.', 'We have made some hard decisions. We made the hard decision, for example, with regard to destroying the sanctuaries that the enemy had in Cambodia. As a result of that, the casualties that were 300 a month had been cut down so that it is the lowest in 4½ years. And they will continue to go down because of the decisions that we have made.', 'Third, we have presented a peace proposal--a peace proposal that has received universal approval among most observers here in the United States and a great deal of approval abroad, except from those that you might expect to oppose it--a peace proposal that is one of the most generous, one of the most farsighted certainly, ever offered in such a situation: a cease-fire without conditions, a conference for all of Indochina, a political settlement that would be fair to both sides and allow both sides to be represented in the political process, and this--even though we have far more of their prisoners than they have of ours--an offer to exchange prisoners now as a humanitarian act. This is what our proposal included.', 'Where do we stand?', 'Where we stand at the present time is that we are pressing our proposal. We will continue to press it. We are continuing our program of training South Vietnamese and bringing Americans home. If they do not accept our proposal we will end the American involvement in that way and that will work.', 'What I am saying to you, we have a plan which is ending the war, which is reducing our casualties, which is bringing the boys home, but we need Senators and Congressmen who understand the plan and who will support it.', 'Let me come to a very precise point. Why not now? Oh, I have heard all over this country, and I well understand it, particularly some young people say ""peace now."" Or why at least don\'t you go along with what the Senate wanted to go along with--at least it seemed they wanted to go along with it, and we had a very small majority to defeat the Hatfield-McGovern resolution, which, of course, was supported by both of the Senators from Indiana--I, of course, was opposed to it--why not go along with a proposal which will say we will get out in a very brief period of time, regardless of what happens to South Vietnam?', 'Let me tell you this: What all of those proposals finally come down to is end the war, end it now, or end it in 6 months from now, but end it and have peace.', 'Think for a moment. When I was elected President of the United States, I was Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces automatically. I could have brought all the men home right away. I would have ended the war.', ""Why didn't I? I will tell you why. I look back over the history of this country in this century. We have been in four wars. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war."", ""And, yet, we have yet to have in this century a full generation of peace. You see, the problem is not to end the war. The problem is to end the war in a way that you will discourage those who might start another war. And I say let's end this war in a way that we win the peace and have a full generation of peace for the young Americans."", 'That is what I stand for. That is what Dick Roudebush stands for. That is what Ross Adair stands for. He is a tower of strength on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. I need him there. We want him back.', 'And it is that proposition that the two Senators from Indiana, those presently holding those positions, have opposed when key votes have come up.', ""Let's understand I do not question their honesty in reaching the other conclusion. But I say to you, Americans have had enough of fighting wars and losing the peace. This war we are going to win the peace, and we are going to end it in a way that we can have a generation of peace."", ""Let's look beyond the problem of Vietnam. As you know, we have a cease fire in the Mideast. It is a tenuous situation. But at least there is no shooting going on there. That is an accomplishment, and we hope to have it extended."", 'We also are beginning to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union on the limitation of nuclear arms. What a great thing that will be if we can get some kind of an agreement. It will be difficult, because their interests are different from ours.', 'But on the other hand, if we are going to get an agreement, it is essential that the United States maintain its strength so that we have some cards to play when we go to the conference table.', 'And that is why I have asked both the House and the Senate to provide the necessary strength for the United States, including the ABM system, which would be essential in the event that the Soviet Union were to negotiate, because if prior to negotiation we were to give up or reduce our own preparedness, it would mean they would have no reason to reduce their own arms strength.', 'So, here again, it is a very difficult proposition to understand, because I am sure to the average person, they say, ""Why doesn\'t the United States, if it wants peace, just disarm? Why do we build any new arms system?""', 'Let me say nobody wants peace any more than I do. And I know that nobody wants peace any more than young Americans do. I know how you feel. I remember how I felt before World War II.', 'But I can tell you this: We have in the world today an opportunity, better than we have had at any time since World War II, where the United States, because it is the most powerful nation in the free world, if it has the courage, the stamina, the judgment, and the wisdom, can lead the way to a generation of peace. But in order to have that generation of peace, we need to have backing for the President of the United States, and we need it in the Senate; we need it in the House.', 'And that is the reason why Dick Roudebush is so essential. He will back me. He will not be against me on these critical issues of providing for a generation of peace.', ""Let's come to the other issues. I will discuss them more briefly, because I used the first one to prove a point, the point that we do not question the right of men honestly to disagree as to what is the best road to peace. But on the other hand, when you have an administration with the President, with the responsibility, then the question is: Is he going to have the backing that is necessary for him to conduct the foreign policy of this country? I ask for that backing. I ask for it from Indiana."", ""Let's come to the problems at home. I know that all of you are concerned, as I was in 1968, about the rise in the cost of living. I am concerned about it today. I am not satisfied with the way that that problem is being handled, because I would like to see the rise in the cost of living checked more quickly than it has been checked."", 'But let me go to the cause again. The reason that we have seen prices go up at home is that there has been too much spending in Washington, D.C., and one thing that I have got to tell you is that on that score we again have a clear difference of opinion.', 'Everybody wants to certainly appropriate those funds that are necessary for the programs that are in the best interests of this country. But, on the other hand, we must recognize that when Government in Washington, as was the case in the previous administration, year after year spends more than the tax system at full employment will produce, it means that prices are going to skyrocket at home. We have changed that. We have tried to change it. But we have not had the cooperation of the Congress that we should have.', 'Oh, the cooperation of your Congressmen, House Representatives from Indiana, yes. They have been sturdy, strong men, and you can be proud of them and every one of them ought to be reelected, and more, too. We need them there in the House of Representatives.', 'Here again in the United States Senate, if you picked up your morning paper you will find that a bipartisan committee, a joint committee of the House and Senate found, that in this Congress, already the Congress has appropriated in terms of authorizations almost $6 billion more than what the President has asked for.', 'And so the question again comes, do you want to stop the rise in the cost of living? If you do, then we have to have backing, backing again for making the right decisions, the right decisions on this key point.', 'What we need are Congressmen and Senators down in Washington, D.C., who will have the courage to vote against that spending program that might benefit some special interest group, that might benefit some people, but would raise prices and taxes for all people.', ""Let's start thinking of the prices and taxes of all people and get that Government spending down in Washington, D.C. That is what we want and that is what Dick Roudebush stands for."", 'Then we come to the area of reform. The great problem today is whether or not we continue to spend billions of dollars on the programs of the past. Some of them are good. Some of them should continue to be funded. Others need to be reformed. We have reformed the postal system, as you know. And that will pay dividends in the years ahead.', 'And I have offered reforms in the field of the environment. We have offered an historic program that Ed Whitcomb as a Governor and all of his fellow Governors are interested in, in which the Federal Government will begin to share revenues with the States.', ""We have not got it passed yet, because we don't have the votes in the House and the Senate to get it. You can help us get the votes."", 'What does that mean to you? It simply means this: It means that after 190 years of government and power in government flowing from the people and the States to Washington, D.C., it finally begins to flow back from Washington to the States and to the people where it belongs. And I think we want that in Indiana and in America.', ""But it isn't enough to do that, because what we have to recognize, too, if that power is to come back, the funds to handle the programs must come back. That is why revenue sharing is so important."", 'So it is in the welfare field. Here again, rather than to continue a program that has had faults that we are all aware of, what we need to do is to reform it, reform it in a way that every family that needs assistance receives assistance. But, on the other hand, reform it in a way in which any individual who is able to work and is trained for a job and then refuses to take a job should not be subsidized by a taxpayer of the United States of America.', 'I could go on. In the environment, that is an area where we are thinking again of our young people. We want you to have clean air and clean water and cities that are safe to live in without the enormous problems that they have at the present time.', 'We want the open spaces of America not to be despoiled. We must decide now about that or we are going to find 20 years from now that it will be too late.', 'Here again, we need support, and we are going to get it, from the men that I support here on this platform tonight.', 'And now I come to another point of very great interest, I know, to every audience that I have spoken to, all over the United States.', 'When I campaigned in Indiana in 1968, I referred to the fact !that crime had been going up in the previous 8 years of the two previous administrations at an alarming rate. It went up by 150 percent.', 'I also referred to the fact that it was necessary to have two things: one, some new laws, give the law enforcement officials some new tools; and two, some new judges, some judges that would enforce the law with a strict construction with regard to those who were engaged in criminal activities.', 'As I put it, it is time--I believe it was time then, I believe it is time now--that we have judges that recognize the necessity of strengthening the peace forces as against the criminal forces in their decisions in the United States of America.', 'Being against crime is like being against sin. Everybody is against it. What has happened, though? The first proposals that I sent to the Congress of ,the United States 18 months ago were in this field: for organized crime, a proposal calling for action in the field of narcotics and dangerous drugs, a proposal calling for action to stop the flow of pornographic literature and obscenity into the homes of our children, a proposal dealing with D.C. crime.', ""Eighteen months later, for the first time, the first bill reached my desk, the organized crime one. We expect to have one on narcotics next week. The obscenity bill, we don't know what the fate of that is going to be."", ""As far as the judges are concerned, we have found that on two nominations that were sent to the Congress, to the Senate of the United States, the Senate, which it had every right to do insofar as its constitutional power, rejected them. But now, let's come to the critical point."", 'I say that we need in the House and in the Senate, we need Congressmen and Senators who will recognize that it is necessary to vote laws that are necessary to fight crime, to talk against it, to act against it, to support judges who are against it, not just in election time but all year round. And Dick Roudebush is that kind of a man.', 'That brings me to another point. I suppose you wonder in a State like this, ""Well now, Indiana is a big State, an important State. It only has two Senators out of 50. What difference does one vote make?""', 'Do you realize that the present Senate is divided on the major issues that I have already discussed in instance after instance by one vote or two votes, usually? A shift of two Senators could have made the difference.', 'In the field of foreign policy, in the field of defense policy, in the field of the approval of judges, in these areas, a shift of one or two could have made the difference.', ""And that is why it is so critically important to have from this State that man who might make the majority of one, that would determine whether or not the President, not as an individual, because that isn't what matters, but the President, who did receive a vote from the people of Indiana, gets the power to do what he promised to do."", 'That is all I ask, nothing more. And I think that is what Indiana wants us to have.', 'In this great audience in Fort Wayne, Indiana, I cannot miss the opportunity, because there is such a large number of young people here, not only from the colleges and the universities but from the high schools, to talk about a subject that has been certainly discussed on radio and television and in the newspapers as much as any subject that I have mentioned up to this point and perhaps even more.', 'It is the subject of student protest and student unrest. Turn on your television tonight, almost any night. You know what you see. You see a picture of young America, usually violence, bombing, burning, shouting obscenities, shouting speakers down. And you get the impression that maybe that is what young America is.', 'I want to tell you I have been around this country a bit over the past few weeks. I was at Kansas State. I was in Vermont. I was in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio and I went there to Ohio State. I was in Tennessee today and North Carolina. And in many places we had a little problem.', 'Vermont, they threw a few rocks. Several other places, they tried to shout me down. In other places, they shouted the usual four-letter words. And so on down the line.', 'But let me tell you: I think it is time to state what the facts are. If you were to simply read the newspapers and look at the television, the amount of space that those who engage in that kind of protest are concerned, as distinguished from peaceful protest, the amount of space they get gives you the impression that that kind of young American is either a majority of young Americans or will be the leaders of the future.', ""Well, I have got news for you. They aren't the majority of young Americans today and they aren't going to be the leaders of America tomorrow."", ""I know young America. Yes, let's get it very clear. Oh, they don't agree with all of the policies of the Federal administration. They want peace, as I want peace. They want, certainly, action on many problems, and they want it faster perhaps than we can get it. And they criticize this and they want change and I always hope they will, because that is the way a country grows, a great free country. We always want our young people to raise questions--and to raise them, but also to have in mind this great fact: that our system for 190 years has produced the greatest progress that civilization has ever known in any country and the reason is that it provides a means for peaceful change."", 'America is a very different country today from what it was 190 years ago. It has changed over and over again. But it has been changed by peaceful means. And my friends, in a country that provides the method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence or lawlessness. That is what the young people of America believe in.', 'And now, I come to what you can do about all this. In Kansas City the other night, last night, as a matter of fact, some of the people who had to walk through a few demonstrators to get into the auditorium came to me afterwards. ""What do we do about those people?"" They were, you know, the usual lot, shouting a few four-letter words and all that sort of thing.', ""And I gave them this answer, and I am going to give it to you: You don't answer in kind. The answer to violence is not to resort to violence. The answer to smutty four-letter words is not to use them in return. I will tell you what the answer is."", 'The answer to this small, vicious minority is for Americans to stand up and be counted and stand up and be counted for America.', 'The answer, my friends, the answer is for the great silent majority of Americans-and I believe there is a majority-the great silent majority of Americans to speak out, and you can speak out in a very quiet, but with a very powerful voice, the most powerful voice in the history of mankind.', 'On November 3d, you walk into that polling booth and you pull that shutter behind you and you vote. And when you vote, that vote is the most powerful voice in the whole world. That is where the silent majority can make itself heard. That is where the silent majority is going to make itself heard this November. And that is where you will have an opportunity to determine, here in the State of Indiana, whether the State that did give--and I am very grateful for this-the President the biggest majority that he had in 1968, is going to provide for him a strong voice in that United States Senate, as well as people in the House including your own Ross Adair, but a voice in that Senate particularly who, on the critical issue of foreign policy, on the critical issue of strong national defense, on the critical issue of reform, on the critical issue of providing, for example, progress, aid to our elderly citizens through an automatic escalation of their social security-as is the program we have advocated and as he has supported---on the critical issue of standing firm against crime and violence and supporting the President when he appoints judges who are also going to stand firm against those activities. There is your chance.', 'My friends, I think the case for the voters of Indiana is clear. I do not know a State in which a Senate campaign is more clear-cut than this. It has nothing to do with personalities. It goes far beyond party lines. One man honestly believes that the best interests of the country will be served by opposing the President on all of the major issues that I have mentioned tonight.', 'The other man believes that the best interests of the country will be served by supporting the President.', 'And I say to you, I ask not support for me as an individual. I say I ask support for Dick Roudebush, because I think it is best for America, best for Indiana, and best for you.', 'I understand that there are 5,000 people downstairs in the overflow auditorium. And if they are still listening and if they are still there, I am going to go down and say hello to them. Is that all right with you?', 'Thank you.']"
17,Richard Nixon ,"October 20, 1970","['Senator Baker, Congressman Brock, Congressman Quillen, Mr. Mayor, President Culp, the next Governor of the State of Tennessee, Winfield Dunn, all of the distinguished guests on the platform and this very great audience here on the campus of East Tennessee State University:', 'I want you to know, first, that I am very privileged to be here on this great university campus. I am privileged to be here, and I want to express my thanks to the university administration for allowing us to use the facilities of this quadrangle for this meeting. I want to express my thanks., too, for the magnificent marching band for their music when they played a moment ago.', 'And I understand the Buccaneers have been doing pretty well, too, here.', ""The next thing I want to do is to extend my thanks to all of you. I see this great audience stretching out as far as the eye can see. And I heard what was said a moment ago, something to the effect that this was the best Nixon country in the whole United States. All I can say is if I talk too long, some of you are going to get pneumonia. I don't want that to happen so I won't talk too long."", 'But I have a message that can be brought to you very briefly and very directly in the language that I know that you in Tennessee, and particularly in east Tennessee, like. You like it straight from the shoulder. You like it in the great tradition of those in the political field in this State, some have been Democrats, some have been Republicans through the years. This State has furnished three Presidents of the United States. It has furnished great Senators and great Congressmen.', 'And I am very privileged to appear here in this State speaking in this critical year, 1970.', 'And first, I am proud to endorse the candidacy of Winfield Dunn, who will be the first Republican to be Governor of this State in 50 years.', ""And he will be Governor not simply because he got Republican votes, but because Democrats and Independents, too, realize that at this time, it is important to have a man in the Governor's chair who knows the responsibility that he has to think before any money is spent, that every dollar he spends comes out of the pocket of the taxpayers. He is not a high flyer. He is not a big spender. He should be the Governor of the State of Tennessee."", 'I am very privileged here, of course, to speak in the State where Howard Baker has represented it so well in the United States Senate, one of the bright, young, new stars in the American political galaxy, one of my closest advisers.I am proud to be here with him. Jimmy Quillen--I saw some billboards for him on the way and I just wondered why he had them--he got 87 percent last time. I think he wants to get all the votes this time. Well, I hope he does. He ought to have them.', ""And now I come to the Senate race. That is the race, of course, along with the Governor's race, that is being watched all over the country. The Senate race is being watched because--and let me get it very directly, straight from the shoulder just like you like to have it--there is a majority of one at the present time in the United States Senate. I do not refer to party against party. I refer to issues that cross party lines, issues involving war and peace, issues involving the value of your dollar, issues involving whether or not we're going to have laws that will be effective to control crime, issues that involve whether we're going to have judges who will interpret those laws in a way that will be effective in controlling crime."", 'Those are the great issues that have come before the Senate in these last 2 years. Those are the great issues in which the two candidates for the Senate in this State have a very honest difference of opinion.', ""I say honest difference of opinion. I do not question the honesty, the integrity of any man who happens to vote against programs that I, as President of the United States, recommend. But it is my duty, having had the votes of ,the State of Tennessee in '52, in '56, in 1960, and in 1968--every time I have been on the national ticket, I have carried Tennessee; I think that I represent the views of the majority of Tennessee--I think it is my duty to say this: I think that the President that Tennessee voted for should have a man in the United States Senate who votes with him and not against him on the great issues before the American people."", 'And on the major critical issues, on these great issues that I have described, we have a clear-cut choice: One man, Bill Brock, will vote for; the other man will vote against.', ""Let me describe it, however, in terms that are more direct. I am not suggesting here that you should support Bill Brock because he is my personal friend, which he is; that he is a Republican, which he is. I am not suggesting that you vote for him because he is for me almost all the time, which he is. I respect him when he disagrees, and I do when Howard Baker disagrees. We don't expect 100 percent conformity all the time."", 'I say, though, that what you ought to do is to think of what is best for America and see whether or not what Bill Brock stands for and what I stand for, is best for America and best for Tennessee and best for you. If it is, then he deserves your vote.', ""Let's take the great issues. One of the first--and I heard a few young people in the back and we hear it in every one of the meetings, say something about peace now--one of the first issues, the most important issue, before the American people is peace."", ""We all want peace. It isn't a question of being for peace. It is a question of getting it. And let's come down to what we have found and what we have done."", 'When we came into office in 1969, January, there were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring them home. Three hundred were getting killed every week. There was no peace plan on the conference table in Pads. What have we done?', 'Well, instead of sending more men to Vietnam, as was the case for 5 years before we came there, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and they are going to continue to come home.', 'Second, instead of casualties going up, they have been coming down. They are the lowest in 4 ½ years and they are going to continue to go down.', 'And third, we have put on the peace table in Paris the most comprehensive, the most generous peace proposal that possibly could have been considered: a cease-fire, a conference for all of Indochina on peace, a conference which would settle the political questions, and one--and this is enormously important--even though we have far more prisoners of theirs than they have of ours, we say, ""Let\'s release the prisoners immediately as a humanitarian gesture."" These are the things that we have offered.', 'My friends, we are going to press for that offer. But simply, I want to tell you this: We are working for peace in Vietnam. We are ending this war. We are ending it in a way--and this is the critical difference between Bill Brock and his opponent-we are ending this war in a way that we can win the peace.', 'Let me describe what that means. I see a lot of young people here in this audience. And I think of you and your future. I see, also, a lot of older people in this audience that will remember back, as I do, to World War I, World War II, Korea. We have never had problems insofar as ending war is concerned when the time came. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended Korea.', 'But do you realize, and I say this particularly to the younger generation, that in this century, even though we have ended three wars, we have never had a generation of peace. One war has been followed by another one and that is why our program, the program that I support, the program that Bill Brock supports, says, end the war, but end it in a way that will discourage the aggressors rather than encourage them, end it in a way that will win the peace rather than lose the peace.', 'I had it brought home to me very well the other day in New Jersey. A young man came up to me. He said, ""Bring the boys home from Vietnam right away."" I said, ""Have you been there?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""Those boys are fighting out there so you won\'t have to go.""', 'And that is really what the problem is right now. We are going to end this war, but we are going to end it in a way that we can win peace, not just for the next election, but for the next generation.', 'That is what you want and that is what Bill Brock stands for.', 'I mentioned the issue of spending. And I know that this is one that when you think of the billions of dollars that we read about in the papers every day, you wonder, well, really, is there anything we can do about it. And I see all the women here that will go shopping later in the day. And I think of what you are going to say when you look at those grocery prices going up, when you look at the housing and everything else that seems to be going up.', 'Just let me say this: That was the problem that we found when we came in. I want to tell you why it happened.', 'It happened because we had an administration in Washington, D.C., that spent billions more than the tax system in this country would produce at full employment and that always leads to inflation. We have tried to change that. I say tried. We have changed it to an extent. We have reduced the rate of inflation. We have not licked it yet.', 'But I saw a figure in the paper this morning. A joint committee, including both Democrats and Republicans of the House and the Senate, just made a report about the present Congress of the United States. You know what it said?', ""That report said that this Congress already has made appropriations in authorizations almost $6 billion more than the President has asked for. That sounds very good, doesn't it? You think, well, the Congress is appropriating billions of dollars for me, for this program or that one or the other one."", 'Just let me say this: I favor appropriations, as all of us favor appropriations, for those particular items which will be in the best interests of this State and this Nation, for a great project, for example, like the TVA.', 'I favor appropriations for human resources and we have turned the budget around. Rather than spending more for military purposes, we are spending more for human resources for the first time in 20 years.', 'But, my friends, let us remember this: Whenever your Government in Washing. ton, D.C., has runaway spending at Washington, it means you have got runaway prices at home.', ""What we need are Senators who will have the courage to vote for what is right, but the courage to vote against those spending programs that might benefit this special interest or that, benefit some of the people, but would raise prices and taxes for all the people. Let's start thinking of the taxpayers and start thinking of the people who will have their prices raised."", ""Then we have the great issue of progress in this country. And here, again, it is a clear-cut division. Do we go back to the old policies of the past, just putting more and more billions of dollars in programs of failure? Or do we go to new programs, do we reform American Government? I say let's reform it."", ""I say we have put too much good money into bad programs and when we do that we are going to end up with bad money and bad programs, so let's change it."", 'I say to you, my friends, for that reason we are reforming the welfare system. I say to you that when any system makes it more advantageous for a man not to work than to work, when it rewards a man for deserting his family rather than staying with his family, we ought to get rid of that system and get another one in its place.', 'I say to you that in this great, rich country, we are very fortunate that I could recommend to the Congress a program in which under family assistance we will provide aid for every family in this country that needs assistance and is unable to help itself; but, on the other hand, a program which says that if a man is able-bodied, if a man is trained for a job, and then a man is offered a job and he refuses to work, then the taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize him for loafing.', 'That is the kind of a program we stand for. And so it is in other areas, the issue of the environment. I look at this magnificent countryside, the Great Smokies. I think of the future again. It is going to be great for the next 10 years, the next 15. What about 25 years from now?', ""Are we going to despoil not only the air and the water in our cities, but are we going to ruin our countryside? Let's pass down to the children of the future the great heritage that we have of a beautiful country. Bill Brock stands firmly in the forefront for progress on our environmental program and that is another reason I am for him for the United States Senate."", 'Then there is another issue I want to talk about. It was brought home to me this morning. I was in Kansas City. I got up a little earlier than I was planning to, because I had heard that there were two police officers who were in the hospital. The chief of police told me about them.', 'Three days ago, these police officers who were working in a program that was very important, working with young people to get them to respect the law and the rest--these two police officers were the victims of a bomb plot. They were badly injured. One has lost the use of one finger in his hand. Another has a deep cut here [indicating], glass, wood, splinters in them. They are both going to get well.', 'I thought of those officers. I understand that here on this campus, Dr. Gulp, you are building a new science laboratory. In my home State of California, just 10 miles from where I live, yesterday, a bomb blast destroyed an environmental science laboratory.', 'When we came into office we found that crime had gone up 150 percent in the past 8 years. We found, also, that in the District of Columbia that it had become what was in effect the crime capital of the world, in the opinion of many observers. So we decided to do something about it.', ""So I asked the Congress for laws 18 months ago. The first action that I took was to ask for legislation in the field of organized crime, in the field of stopping drugs and narcotics, and also to stop the pornography and the filth and the obscenity 'that is being mailed into the homes of the children of America."", 'And, my friends, what has happened? For 18 months we had to wait before we began to get any action. The organized crime bill finally came to my desk and I signed it. We hope this next week to sign the narcotics bill. The obscenity bill is still waiting.', 'But in addition to the laws--and we need more laws and we need Senators who will vote for them--we need judges in ever), court of the land, on the Supreme Court and in the district court, and up and down the line, who will recognize the importance of interpreting the law in a way that will strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. That is the kind of judges that we need.', ""Now we have the issue very clearly. Everybody is against crime. I don't question whether the opponents of our people that are running here, whether they are against it."", 'The question is when are you against it and what are you going to do about it? What we need in the United States Senate is another Senator like Howard Baker who votes for the laws and works for the laws that will give the President the power that is needed to stop the rise in crime and make our cities safe again throughout this country,.', 'What we need in the United States Senate is another Senator who will not cancel out his vote on those kinds of laws. And also what we need in the United States Senate is one who will confirm the President of the United States when he sends to the Senate a judge who is dedicated to the proposition of enforcing the laws and a strict interpretation of the Constitution of the United States, and not cancel out his vote. It is a clear issue.', ""Let me say we need a man that will speak out, not only by his votes and not only by his confirmations of the President's recommendations on judges, but one that will speak out clearly not just in the few weeks before election but in 52 weeks all year round."", 'If we are going to stop the rise of crime and terrorism in this country, it is a year-round job, and Bill Brock, like Howard Baker and Jimmy Quillen, will work year round on the job and not just in election time.', 'Now, finally, on this great university campus, I do not want to miss the opportunity to speak briefly on another subject that concerns many Americans. You see it nightly, virtually nightly, on your television screens: the problems of what they call student protest. And usually what you see is violence or students shouting four-letter obscenities or students engaging in illegal protests, shouting down schools and the rest.', 'And as you see that, you get the impression sometimes from listening to the commentary that these young people are representative of most young people in America today, and that they are the leaders of America tomorrow.', 'I have news for you. They are not a majority of youth today and they are not going to be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""My friends, let us understand the clearly. I would not want a younger generation that did not question the decisions made by government officials. I would not want a younger generation that did not want progress and change. That is the greatness of America, that our young people do think progressively, that they want change, and this younger generation-and to its great credit is interested in peace, is interested in the disadvantaged people. Let's give them credit for that."", 'But I find on campus after campus, at Kansas State, at Ohio State, in New Jersey, in Vermont, in Wisconsin, every place I go students come up and say, ""Look, those people you see on the television screen, they don\'t represent us. We believe in change, but let it be peaceful change and not violent change.""', 'Now I make the final point. All the voting people here are going to say, Mr. President, what can we do about all this?"" And particularly I have been asked the question---when some people had to walk through a group of students at Kansas City last night that were pretty rough and shouting their obscenities and the rest--""What can we do about those people?""', 'I said, ""I will tell you what you can do. You have got to answer them. And the way to answer them is to stand up for America and to speak up for America. And the way to speak up for America is not to answer in kind; don\'t engage in violence. You don\'t have to shout any four-letter words and obscenities. But the way to answer them is with the most powerful action that a free people had ever devised.""', 'On November 3d you are going to walk into that polling booth and you are going to make a decision. You will think that, well, that only involves one person out of millions of people. But it could make the difference about that majority of one in the United States Senate.', 'And as you make that decision, remember that vote, that vote is the answer to those who resort to .the kind of activities that I have referred to.', 'And so as you vote, I suggest, on November 3d vote for a man who will stand with the President rather than against him where the interest of America, you believe, will be best served, who will stand for a just peace and a lasting peace in Vietnam and the world, who will stand for spending your money in Washington only when he feels that it can better be spent there than be spent by you back here in Tennessee, for a man who will be for reform and progress for this country and for the future of this country, and for a man who will stand foursquare and firm for law and order and justice, not just during the election campaign but 52 weeks of the year.', 'The man is Bill Brock, and vote for him on November 3d.']"
18,Richard Nixon ,"October 20, 1970","['Thank you very much for the very generous introduction. And I want to express my appreciation to this wonderful crowd here in Asheville and in western North Carolina for your welcome.', 'You know, a President of the United States, when he travels around the country, whether it is in Vermont or Connecticut or Ohio--I was in, for example, Missouri last night, in Tennessee this morning--you get lots of big crowds. But you know the kind of a crowd that impresses you the most, people that will stand in the rain and wait for hours.', 'Thank you very much.', 'And I am most grateful that you have. And I particularly want to speak to you very directly as really one of you, because like most people in political life, I have lived in a number of States. I, of course, was born in California and have spent most of my life there. And I lived in New York as a registered voter there for approximately 4 years. But except for California and Washington, D.C., I have spent more time in North Carolina than any other State in the country.', ""I know that in this great State in which there is great rivalry between the various fine universities, that--I probably shouldn't mention it but you know I am very proud to have been a Duke graduate. But I like Carolina, and North Carolina State, and Wake Forest and Davidsan. And I think that of all the States that I have visited that there probably is not one that has a greater educational tradition than the State of North Carolina."", 'If I may also come directly to my subject, as you know, I have not been able to spend too much time in this election year making any kind of political appearances. Saturday was the first day and I was out yesterday and I am out today.', 'I had to limit my appearances pretty much to those States where there were Senate races or gubernatorial races.', 'The only State in the country there is not a Senate race or a gubernatorial race that I am visiting is the State of North Carolina. There are reasons for that that are personal: one, because of my very great affection for this State, the fact that I went to school here, and the fact, also, that in that critical close election in 1968, North Carolina was in our column.', 'Thank you very much.', 'The other reason is that when we think of this election, we must think not only, of course, of the candidates for Governor and the United States Senate, but we must think of the candidates for the House of Representatives.', 'The House of Representatives, a body in which I was privileged to serve when I first came to the Congress 23 years ago, has been a tower of strength in many areas over these past 20 months that I have served in the Presidency. And among those who have been strongest in giving the President the support that is needed, not as an individual, but for those things that we think are best for America, are the men from North Carolina that I am proud to campaign for.', 'I refer to Charley Jonas. I refer to Jim Broyhill. I refer to Earl Ruth and Vinegar Bend Mizell, and I would like to have more of them, more like them here.', 'Luke Atkinson, your own candidate here, is one that would be, along with the others, a very fine addition to that team.', 'And in speaking of them all, however, rather than talking in individual terms, I would like to come directly and very briefly to those great issues that we as Americans, not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans, are concerned about this year.', ""I want you to know what we are trying to do and then you will know how to cast )-our vote. Because, if you believe in what we are trying to do, then remember, a President is very powerful, but he can't do it unless he has got the votes in the House and in the Senate. And we need those votes and that is why we are here."", 'First, above everything else, we want to bring peace to this world. When I speak of peace to this world, I am not referring simply to that kind of peace which is so easy to get, instant peace, which tomorrow leads to another war. We have had enough of that.', ""Let's have peace for a generation. That is what we have never had in this century."", 'In Vietnam, for example, we have been working for that. When I came in, we had 550,000 men in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring any of them home. The casualties were 300 a week. We had no peace plan on the table. And in this past year and 10 months, we have not done as much as I would have liked, but we have moved,', 'Instead of men going into Vietnam, they have been coming out and they are going to continue to come out, and the South Vietnamese will take their place.', 'Second, instead of casualties going up, they are going down. They are the lowest in 4 1/2 years. And they are going to continue to go down. Young Americans are not going to be killed in Vietnam in the months ahead.', ""Third, we have put forward---and some of you may have heard it on television-a peace proposal that is the most far-reaching, the most generous certainly that could possibly be put forward: the offer of a cease-fire without any conditions, the offer of a political settlement, and the offer--even though we have far more prisoners of theirs than they have of ours let's release all the prisoners as a humanitarian gesture and exchange them today. This, we think, is the kind of proposal that can do something."", 'My friends, I now come to the critical point. And I realize that there are those who are very troubled and they say, ""Well, why does it take so long? Why not just bring them home fight now, end the war, get out and then we have got peace?""', 'Let me tell you something: Look back. Those of you who are older will remember, as I remember. Those of you who are younger have read about it in school. In this century, we have been in four wars in this country. We were in World War I. We ended that. We were in World War II. We ended that war. We were in Korea. We ended that war. And yet, we have not had a full generation of peace.', ""And I say, let's end this war in a way that we can win the peace. That is what we are trying to do. That is why, if we were to cut and run, if we were to encourage the enemy by the way that we ended the war, it would only mean one thing: It would plant the seeds for another one."", 'And so I say, if you want real peace, the peace that will last, we need that kind of support, the kind of support we have been getting from your Carolina delegates, Republicans in the House of Representatives.', ""Now, I want to talk about two or three other issues very briefly. Ones that you are concerned about, and I am going to tick them off. The fact that I can't go into any length is not because they don't deserve more attention, but because I see a lot of people out here who are enthusiastic. I think most of you are going to vote for our candidates. I don't want any of you to get pneumonia. We need every one of those votes that we can get."", 'One, I am going to talk about your pocketbook for just a moment. When you go out and shop, you are going to find that prices are going up. Right? And second, you are going to be worried about that. Third, you are going to wonder, why did it happen?', 'I will tell you why it happened. Because before we came to Washington, D.C., the, Government was spending billions more than it was taking in in taxes, even though; those taxes were at a time when we were. at full employment in the economy. And the result is that when the Government in Washington spends billions more than it should, it only has the effect of raising prices and taxes for people at home.', ""I tried to turn that around. I can't do it alone. I need men in the House. The' President needs men in the House and men in the Senate who will vote with him on this principle."", 'You know, we always want to spend everything that we can for those things that are needed. We want to help the needy. We want to help the elderly. We want to do the right thing by the schools and health and all the rest.', 'But remember this: When a spending program is one that might benefit one special group or some of the people and yet raise prices and taxes for all the people, then I say that spending program is one that should not be approved by the Congress.', 'I come to the great issue of reform. I say this particularly because this is a university community. And I see so many young people in this audience.', 'I want you to know that we are not satisfied in this administration with just putting a lot of good money into old programs. We think it is time for a change. Whether it is the welfare program, whether it is the environmental program, whether it is education or whether it is health, we need to spend billions of dollars, but my friends, we need to reform the institutions of government and the place to start is right in Washington, D.C.', 'Let me tell you how. First, we propose to share the revenues of the Federal Government with the States. I want to tell you why. For 190 years--and this was one of the 13 original States--for 190 years, as you know, power has been flowing from the proud, independent States of this Nation to Washington, D.C. Now I say it is time for power to go back to the people, from Washington to the States and to the people. That is why we are sharing the revenues with the States.', 'That is why in the field of welfare reform, in the environment, and all the others, ours is a program of progress.', 'When I look at this magnificent country, when I realize that I am standing in a place where on a clear day I understand you can see forever [laughter], that on a clear day--and listen to this for a moment-did you know that you in Asheville on a clear day in these beautiful mountains can see more of America than you can see any place else in the United States?', 'This is a beautiful country, too. It is particularly beautiful here. But there are parts of America that are not beautiful. Our cities are cluttered up with traffic and terrorized by crime and choking with smog and poisoned by water. And we have got to clean up that environment so that our young people will have the heritage of a decent life in the years ahead. It is that kind of progress that we are for.', ""I say let's reform the institutions of government, of education, in housing, of health, of welfare, of environment so that the young people of this country can move forward rather than simply putting into the programs of the past money which will be wasted."", 'And now a couple of issues that particularly apply to you in this part of the country. In fact, it applies to all of the country, because these two areas that I mention are not limited to North Carolina. They are not limited to the South and they are not limited in terms of any area of the country.', ""First, textiles. We think of textiles primarily of being a Southern problem. You know textiles are produced all over the United States of America. If you don't think so, you should see the Senators and Congressmen that came in with Charley Jonas and these other fellows to talk to me about textiles. They are from all over the United States."", 'We have the problem of imports, imports from abroad. We have been trying to work out a voluntary agreement with the major country responsible for the excess of imports: Japan. We are still working on it.', ""Since we have failed, we have asked the Congress for legislation which would provide a quota for textile imports in the event that we couldn't get a voluntary agreement. And now we need that kind of legislation."", 'But the difficulty is, and the reason that it is hung up, is that in the Congress of the United States there are those who are trying to hang a lot of other things on this bill. And this is a technical matter, but all of you will understand it; they are trying to hang a lot of other products on the bill.', 'They say, ""If you are going to protect quotas, we will protect this and that and the other thing."" The result is that it would raise barriers that would reduce our farm markets abroad. That wouldn\'t be good for North Carolina. It wouldn\'t be good for our great agriculture in this country.', ""So what we are fighting for is for the protection of our textiles and our textile markets, but let's do it in a way that we do not destroy our farm exports for abroad. Let's help ,the farmers as well as those who are in the textile area."", 'Now, the problem of our schools. When I come to the southern part of the United States, I know that ,the question is often asked about what we are going to do with regard to the dual school system. That answer has been given by the courts. This administration carries out whatever orders the courts have handed down.', 'I must say that in the presence of my good friends in North Carolina--and I can say this as I said it in New Orleans and I have said it in other Southern States--it is to the great credit of the Southern States that where they have had this difficult problem, without violence, with cooperation they have worked out a period of transition in district after district after district in a way that is in the great American tradition.', 'Many did not like the law. Many disagreed with what was handed down. But they realized that where the law of the land is handed down it must be complied with. And I congratulate the South for what it has done in complying with the law in an orderly way.', ""I should also point out in that respect, however, that as far as the law is concerned, as I have often mentioned, and this was my position when I spoke in North Carolina in 1968, it has been my position ever since--I stated it again in March of this year in a statement that I issued throughout the country, I have stated it in the North as well as in the South, and I state it here again now--I believe, and I look at these small children here and I see them, I believe that a child--and I don't care whether he is a white child or a black child, what his background is--is better off going to that school closest to home, his neighborhood school. I am for the neighborhood school."", 'And I do not favor for that reason, I do not favor, and the Congress has so stated and I support this proposition, the use of busing solely for the purpose of achieving racial balance because you have two problems here.', 'You have education on the one side. You have the problem of integrating the! school system on the other.', ""I say the important thing for us to remember is: Let us not destroy the quality education of our children. And if we do not bear in mind the fact that if we have these long transportation situations, it is going to have an effect on those children that isn't going to be good for their education."", 'That is our position. We will continue to hold to that position until or unless there is any other finding by the courts.', ""And now I come to one final point. It it one that perhaps doesn't need to be touched upon here in this great western part of North Carolina with its patriotic tradition, this all-American city as it is called, a city with a fine record in law enforcement, a fine record in civic cooperation, a fine record is an example to all the other cities of the country."", 'But it needs to be spoken about, because I want to tell you, my friends, when crime strikes at any part of the country, it hurts all parts of the country. We were concerned that crime went up 150 percent in the 8 years before I came to Washington in January. We are concerned by the fact that as I was in Kansas City this morning, I went to the hospital to call on two policemen who had been injured because a bomb had been thrown into the office in which they were working; and they had received wounds: one had lost the use-partial use--of his hand and permanent use of one of his fingers, and the other had other injuries from the glass and from the wood that got into his system.', 'Others have been killed, 66 in this year alone. Hundreds have been wounded, perhaps thousands.', 'It goes beyond that. We see a rising problem of drugs, a rising problem of pornography, a rising problem of crime. When I came into office, I pledged to do something about it. And as these Members of Congress will tell you, the first request I sent to the Congress was in the field of crime. I asked for bills on organized crime. I asked for the power to deal with the problem of drugs. I asked for bills that would stop the flow of pornography and obscenity into the homes of our children in this country.', 'I asked for other bills. It has taken 18 months to get action on the major ones. The organized crime one finally has been signed. A drug bill may be signed this next week. The obscenity bill is still in a committee, and we still have hopes for it.', 'But my point is this, my friends: I am simply telling you that as far as this administration is concerned, we believe that it is time to stop the attitude of condoning and, by condoning, encouraging the permissive attitude toward crane and criminal elements in this country. It is time to take a strong stand.', ""And this means not only passing laws, it means giving the support to our law enforcement officers that they deserve. When I think that law enforcement officers are called pigs in many parts of the country, I say let us be thankful that men will go into this profession. It is underpaid. It is dangerous. We can't perhaps pay them enough, and we can't remove the danger, but let's give them our respect when they go into the police forces."", 'Then, finally, in that same connection, because this is a university community, I want to bring to you a report from across the Nation on a subject that you see perhaps almost nightly on your television screens. You see the problem of what is called student unrest and disruption. And you see in many instances a bombing. Here, for example, there was one in my home State of California, yesterday, in which they destroyed a science laboratory just 10 miles from my home.', ""You've seen also indications where not only violence and burnings and bombings, but you also have seen those areas where some students will get out and try to shout a speaker down, won't listen to him. They shout out their obscenities. They will not listen to him. They think that's the way to get their message across."", ""I want to tell you this: If you saw that television screen and you saw some of the people that are shouting the obscenities and engaging in violence, you'd get the impression that these are a majority of our America's youth and that they may be the leaders of the future."", ""I want to tell you something. They are not a majority of America's youth, and they are not going to be the leaders of this country in the future. Because I tell you, I have seen our young students."", ""I have seen them at Kansas State; I have seen them at Ohio State; I have seen them in New Jersey; I have seen them in Missouri; and the great majority of America's young people---oh, yes, they want changes in this country, and we are thankful that they do--they aren't satisfied with things as they are, and all young people should be that way."", ""They want to build a peaceful world, and we want to build a peaceful world. But also, they disapprove of violence. They disapprove of disorderly conduct, and let's give a hand to the good young people of America that are a majority of the young people of this country."", ""And I just want to make one pledge to you finally in this State of North Carolina. I remember back. The years were 1934-1937. I drove across the country with four other students. Four of them were divinity students. I was the only law student in the car. I don't know how I ever got across without becoming a preacher. That's probably how I got into politics."", ""But, nevertheless, we drove across the country and we got to Duke University. I remember the excitement of going to that magnificent campus with its 5,000 acres of North Carolina pines. And I remember the excitement of those 3 years. It was the middle of the depression. It was difficult and hard. But we never thought we were poor. We never considered it that way. We thought it was a great privilege to live in this country and to go to that great school. And I've always looked back upon it with pleasure."", ""But, I also remember this: I remember, how strongly I felt about the need to build a better country, a peaceful country, a better chance for all of our people, sol that this country could be an example to all the people of the world. I didn't even dream when I was in school then, 30 years ago, that I'd be standing in Asheville, North Carolina--and I had two people in my class who were from Asheville--talking to this great crowd standing in the rain. I didn't dream then that just 2 weeks ago, I would be traveling all over Europe being welcomed by 350, 000 people in Communist Yugoslavia standing in the rain, being welcomed by a million and a, half people in Spain, by thousands in Ireland."", ""Every place around this world, let me tell you, you hear about what is wrong with America. You hear of people abroad that don't like us. Sure, some of the leaders don't like our policies. But to great numbers of people, hundreds and millions of people abroad, America is still the land with the most freedom, which it has, the most opportunity, which it has, and the greatest progress and prosperity in the world."", ""We are fortunate to live in this country. Let's be proud of it. Let's make it a better country. Let's work for it. And I pledge to you above everything else we are going to have progress, we are going to have prosperity without war, and to this young generation, we are going to have a generation of peace for you."", 'Thank you.']"
19,Richard Nixon ,"October 20, 1970","[""I wanted to say to all of you that I just couldn't miss the opportunity to come down here and to thank you so much for staying here in this room and giving me the chance to greet you and to present our fine candidates and also the Governor and the others."", ""When I think of the fact that you couldn't even get in the room upstairs, you weren't able to see the musical organizations and all the rest and that you have stood here all this time, that is certainly a very heartwarming thing."", ""I thought you might be interested. I will tell you a couple of things I didn't tell them upstairs. Okay?"", 'We found---one thing that we have been very impressed with as we have traveled around the country this year, these last 2 or 3 days, is the way people come out in the rain.', 'Today, down in Johnson City, Tennessee-that is out in east Tennessee--we had rain. There was an enormous crowd. They just were out there. They stood along the roads all the way. I got over to Asheville, an hour later. The rain was pouring down. The people were still out.', ""And it has always been my view, and I will relate this to you, it is when people come out in good weather that, of course is impressive. When people come up and sit up in the hall, that is impressive. When people will stand down in a hall like this where they can't even see the speaker or the entertainment, that is very impressive. But boy, when they will stand up in the rain, that means we are going to win."", 'I want to tell you something else-another thing that was interesting, speaking of rain. I just returned, as you may know, from a trip to Europe. And on that occasion, I visited countries that were very different in political philosophies. I see a lot of you young people here. You probably have social studies tomorrow and the college students in political science. This is something you can report on.', 'I visited Yugoslavia which is a Communist country, somewhat independent in its foreign policy with regard to the Soviet Union but, nevertheless, a Communist country.', 'I visited Spain, where you know is the government of General Franco.', 'I visited Italy and England, a brief stop in England, and also Ireland.', 'In Yugoslavia--and this was extremely, it seemed to me, significant--this is a Communist country, you understand, their policies, their system differs from ours. They have been quite critical of us on many, many issues. But in Zagreb, Yugoslavia--that is in Croatia, the capital is Belgrade, as you know, and then Zagreb is in Croatia--350,000 people stood in the rain and welcomed us as we came into that city.', ""What did that mean? Well, it didn't mean that they were there to welcome me as a person because basically I, to them, was simply a name. But they were trying to say something about the United States."", 'What they were really trying to say in my view is very simply this: To millions of people in the world, in Europe, in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, in Communist countries, as well as non-Communist countries--because I had the same thing happen in Communist Romania, I had the same thing happen 10 years ago in Poland, I have had the same thing happen in Novosibirsk in the middle of the Soviet Union in 1959--for hundreds of millions of people, the United States, our country, is still as it was in the beginning--it is the symbol of hope, of freedom. It is the symbol of opportunity.', ""Oh, they know we are rich, and very rich. We are the richest country in the world. They know we are very strong, and we are the strongest country in the world. But it isn't just that, because there are other countries that are rather rich and rather strong by comparative terms."", ""But the important thing is we stand for something else. They were there because America to them was not a country that threatened their independence, that threatened their freedom. It was a country to which hundreds of thousands, yes, millions of Europeans have come, Asians, others from other countries, and have found opportunity here such as you can't find anyplace else."", 'I just want to say to the young people here that there are lots of things wrong with this country. We ought to do a better job on a lot of things. We would like to get peace sooner than we have had it. We would like to have peace at home. We would like to have better opportunities for all of our people of various racial groups in this country.', ""We are moving along. But the important thing to remember is this: When you think of what is wrong about America, don't overlook what is right."", 'This is a good country. I have been to 70 countries. I have been now to almost 70 countries. And I have enjoyed every visit and I have liked the people of every one of those countries. I liked the Russian people, and I liked the Romanian people, and I liked the Hungarian people, and I liked the Polish people, and the French and the Indians and the Indanesians and all the rest.', 'Never forget that when you do travel to all these continents you will have the same feeling, because once you get to know people, you will inevitably like them.', 'But when you go to these countries, you see what they have, you see their systems and you see what we have. The significant thing to notice is this: that as far as people who have a chance to choose, the traffic is all one way. They are coming this way. They like to come to the United States.', 'And so, I say while we are not perfect, the glory of America is that we have a system that provides the means that we can change what is wrong. And while we are not perfect, the glory of America is that we are so rich that we can use that wealth to raise the standard of people in this country to heights--all people--that have never been realized in the history of the world.', ""And beyond that, because America is the country it is, we can have in this country a quality of life, something that money can't buy, something more important than a new automobile or the television set, or something that you are trying to get for your house or this. It is something that we call freedom, we call opportunity, a spirit that we have had from the beginning."", ""And believe me, we have still got it in America. Don't you ever forget it. You have got it here in Indiana.""]"
20,Richard Nixon ,"October 24, 1970","['Congressman Beall, Senator Mathias, Congressman Morton, Congressman Hogan, all of the distinguished candidates here on the platform, and all of this distinguished audience here:', 'I want to say, first, I am very proud and honored to be in Dundalk.', 'And I am also honored to be in the State of Maryland and in Baltimore and in Baltimore County.', 'I think this year, 1970, is the year that Baltimore will be called the ""City of Champions."" The Baltimore Orioles, thanks to Pete Richert and his colleagues, are the champions of the world in baseball. The way the Baltimore Colts are going, they may be the champions of the world in football.', ""And Baltimore's Ted Agnew is the champion campaigner of 1970."", ""And Maryland's Rogers Morton is the champion National Chairman 1 of this whole country."", 'I am also proud to be on this platform with all of these fine candidates. I can only mention each of them briefly.', 'I refer first to a man with whom I worked in the White House for 18 months, a man who gave devoted service to Ted Agnew and devoted service to this administration. He has competence; he has integrity; he has ability; he is a man superbly qualified to be the next Governor of the State of Maryland, Stan Blair.', 'And in speaking of him, I am very happy to have met and had the opportunity to give my complete endorsement to the fine State team here in the city of Baltimore. Will you all stand up so that we can all see you--the ones on the State ticket.', 'And also, having mentioned Congressman Morton, I want to mention Larry Hogan and to tell you that in the State of Maryland--I have got to remember which State I am in--in the State of Maryland you have a fine group of men who, like your own Congressman, Glenn Beall, have given great support to this administration. I am proud to endorse them all. I only say we need more like them. I would like for all the congressional candidates to stand up. And give them the welcome that they deserve.', 'I would like to spend a little more time on the next man to whom I will refer. And I will do so because what is involved in his campaign is one that is bigger than this State--it affects many States in this Nation, it affects the future of America and the future of the world---the question is the next United States Senator from the State of Maryland.', 'In talking about that question, I have noted, since I read the Washington papers and the Baltimore Sun, that there have been some indications that I am an intruder in this State.', ""Just let me say this: I don't think the President of the United States is an intruder in any State of this Nation."", 'As your President, I have the responsibility to carry out the mandate that I was given in 1968. I am going to talk about that mandate. In order to carry out that mandate, I need support, I need support in the Senate, I need support in the House.', ""The President can speak, the President can ask for the passage of laws, the President can nominate judges, but unless he has support in the Senate and in the House, he can't do what you elect him to do. That is why I am here."", ""Let me say I am not here to talk against Glenn Beall's opponent. I am here proudly to talk for Glenn Beall, for America, and for you."", 'Now for just a moment, forget whether you are Democrats or Republicans or Independents, whether you are union members or members of management, workers or employers, just think of yourselves, if you will, as Americans concerned about this country, concerned about yourselves, but also concerned about your children. And think of what we want for America and see whether or not you believe that the President of the United States, who has the responsibility for the foreign policy of this country and for its domestic policy, should have men who work with him or men who work against him.', ""I am not referring to being a rubber stamp. I don't want that in the United States Senate or the House of Representatives. I want men that will speak out when they feel that we are wrong."", 'But I do say this: There are four great issues in this campaign. They were the four great issues of 1968. I made some pledges to the people of America. I tried to keep those pledges. But I need some help, not for me, but for America and for you.', 'And the first one was this--Glenn Beall referred to it: Above everything else, the people of America want peace. We are a peaceful people.', 'We can say with great pride that the United States, in all the wars that we have had in this century, has never started one. We have never tried to destroy freedom. We have always tried to defend it.', 'We can say with great pride that our foreign policy, at the present time, is designed not to gain any domination over anybody else, but it is designed to build a better world in which, not only Americans but all people can have peace and freedom, a chance to choose.', 'That is what I talked about in 1968. And here is what we found when we came in. We found a war with 550,000 Americans in Vietnam and 300 being killed every week and there was no plan to end it. There was no peace plan at the conference table.', 'I said that I would bring this war to an end. I said that we would bring peace and that we would bring peace in a way that would discourage and perhaps prevent another war.', 'Now this is what we have done: Instead of sending more men to Vietnam, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and more will be coming home.', 'Instead of our casualties being at 300 a week and going up, they are going down, and they are going to continue to go down.', 'Instead of not having a peace plan, we have submitted a peace plan: you know, a cease-fire and an agreement to exchange prisoners and an agreement also to have a negotiated settlement on political issues.', 'Let me tell you where we stand at the present time. We have a plan that is working. It is ending the war. Americans will be out of Vietnam. We also have a plan at the peace table which, if the enemy agrees to negotiate, will end it sooner.', 'The important point of difference, however, is this: The great problem, you see, is not ending the war; the great problem is winning a peace. Think back over this century, not just those as old as I that can remember all four wars, but some of you young ones, who study it here in history or social studies or whatever your course may be.', 'In World War I, we ended the war, and we thought it was the war to end wars. Before a generation was over, we were in another.', 'World War II, we ended the war. And the United Nations came into being. And we thought that was the beginning of the end of war. And within a few years, we were in another one.', ""Came Korea. We ended that war, and then in a few years we're in another one."", 'We have ended three wars. We have yet to have a generation of peace.', 'And I say, my friends, we are going to end this war in a way that will discourage the warmakers and build the peacemakers in the world.', 'I need your help. I need the help of men in the Senate and men in the House, who will support that kind of a policy, who won\'t say, ""Stop now,"" and lead to an American defeat which would bring on another war.', ""My friends, let's stand firmly behind not just the President but behind the United States of America, as it tries to build what we have not had in a generation: a generation of peace--we haven't had it in a century--a generation of peace for all Americans. That is what we stand for."", 'And so it is also, my friends, I spoke yesterday, as you may remember, to the United Nations in New York. I spoke there of the world problems. It happens that the President of the United States, from time to time, must negotiate with world powers. He must particularly negotiate with the Soviet Union. The success of those negotiations will determine whether we avoid a world war and even may determine whether we avoid small wars in the years ahead.', ""And I say to you, we are prepared to negotiate. We are going forward with negotiations. But don't undercut the President of the United States. Let's be sure that the President of the United States negotiates from strength and not from weakness at the conference table, wherever the case may be."", 'Glenn Beall stands firmly with the President on this foreign policy. He has voted for it. He has spoken for it. He will vote for it and speak for it in the United States Senate. We need him there. And I urge you to support him on that ground.', 'And in the second ground--let\'s come to something much closer at home. I see a lot of ladies here in the room. Incidentally, I am very honored to be in this Steelworkers Union Hall. I think you should know, however, that I am going to talk to the ladies particularly, because a moment ago, when Glenn and I were sent to, in effect, the ""holding room,"" before we were to come on stage, we sat there for a moment, a very nice room. As I went out, I saw it was the ladies room. So, I should talk to the ladies.', 'You are going to be shopping later today, and I am going to tell you what you are going to find. You are going to find prices higher than you like--the prices of groceries. You are going to find the prices of clothing, you are going to find the prices of everything that you find going up.', ""Let me tell you what I pledged in 1968. We found then that the United States had been on a course that was raising prices for all Americans and raising taxes for all America. I pledged that we'd do something about it."", 'And this is what you have to do about it, if you are going to bring prices down: You have got to start with spending in Washington, D.C. Let me tell you why.', 'When the Government in Washington spends more than the tax system at full employment will produce, it means that the taxpayers pay the bill, either in higher prices or higher taxes. And I say, give us a Senator who will support the President in trying to cut the Federal budget so you can balance the family budget. That is what we have in Glenn Beall.', 'And to pinpoint this issue, I should leave before this audience what the facts are of the last Congress. A joint committee of the Congress of both Houses made up of Democrats and Republicans reported just a few days ago that this Congress already has appropriated funds exceeding the budget requests of the President by $6 billion.', 'Now if we continue to have that runaway spending in the next Congress, your prices are going to continue to go up. So, I say we can win the battle against high prices. I will fight that battle, but I need some soldiers to fight with me. Give me some. Give me Glenn Beall in the United States Senate.', 'Now, I want to talk about reform. I said in the campaign that instead of putting good money into bad programs, we were going to reform the institutions of government, reform our educational system and our health system, reform our welfare system.', 'I could talk about the many reforms that we have submitted, the environment and all the other areas. But time will not permit it. Let me take one, the welfare program.', 'I want to talk to you very directly about it. I want to tell you what we have found and what we have proposed and why we need this man in the United States Senate.', 'First, we have found that welfare in the previous administration was going up and up and up. The number of people on the rolls went up by the hundreds of thousands in every State and by the millions in some, and the payments went up.', 'And we found that at the same time that welfare was going up, the want ads, people asking people to come to work, were still filled in paper after paper in the major cities. Now there is something wrong about that.', 'I say to you, my friends, and I said it in the campaign and I say it again now, that when a system has the effect of rewarding a man for not working rather than working, when it rewards him and encourages him to desert his family rather than to stay with his family, it is time to get rid of that system and to get another system in its place.', 'You know, we are fortunate we are very rich country. We are rich enough that we can provide, as I have recommended, a floor under the income of every family in America without the degrading of the dignity of the present welfare system of that effect.', ""But, my friends, we also provide this: We say that at the same time that we provide welfare and help for all those who need it, let's be sure that those who not need it have a work incentive and work requirement."", ""I will put it to you quite bluntly. I to you here today that if a man is able to work, and if he is trained for a job and if he is offered a job and he refuses to work, he shouldn't be paid for loafing by hard-working taxpayers in the State of Maryland."", 'For 14 months, that proposal has been lying before the Congress of the United States. We need action. But we need new men in order to get that action. We need Glenn Beall in the United States Senate, because he is for that program.', 'Then there was the fourth program that I talked about in the campaign. I noted in 1968 that in the previous 8 years, crime had gone up 158 percent. I noted that on the streets of our cities, women, even men, children certainly, could not be safe at night or even in the broad daylight. And I said we are going to do something about that.', ""Let me tell you. We can have the best social security. We can have the health program. We can have the best education in the world and it isn't going to make any difference if our children and our wives are not safe on the streets of our cities, whether it is here or any place else in this country."", 'So, the first proposal I sent to the Congress over 18 months ago, was a comprehensive proposal to modify the laws; an organized crime proposal; a proposal to deal with the mailing of obscene literature into the homes of our children, to stop that; a proposal to deal with drugs and narcotics, to stop that kind of traffic. These proposals have been before the Congress of the United States. It took 18 months for the first one to get to my desk--18 months of waiting, of delaying.', 'My friends, we need better than that, because I am going to tell you this: We are going to enforce these laws. If we need more laws, we are going to have them. But I need a Congress that will act and act swiftly to protect the American people from the criminal elements in this country.', 'And we need judges who will interpret and enforce the law as well.', 'And let me just simply say on that score, the President of the United States has the responsibility for nominating Justices to the Supreme Court and to the various district courts and the circuit courts. I am meeting that responsibility. The Senate of the United States has a responsibility to look over those nominations. I respect that right. But I want to say this one thing and then I want to tell you where I stand, where Glenn Beall stands.', 'I can tell you that as long as I am in the Presidency of the United States, I will not nominate a man for any judge in this country unless his record clearly demonstrates that he will interpret and enforce the laws in a way that will strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in the United States of America.', 'But again, I can make nominations and then the Senate can sit on them. They can delay them as have been some of the circuit court nominations. And I can only say on that score, in Glenn Beall you have a man who will consider the nominations, he will give his best judgment, but he stands firmly for the proposition that the wave of crime is not going to be the wave of the future and that we are going to strengthen our laws, we are going to have strong judges, we are going to stop this increase of crime in America. There is something you can do, too.', 'A few days ago in Kansas City I went to a hospital. I saw two policemen. They were not particularly well-educated men by the standards of some of our media. Both of them were high school graduates. Both of them were war veterans. Both of them had served in the police force for a number of years.', 'They had done splendid work, working in a difficult part of the city. A bomb had been thrown. They had been injured and injured badly. So I called on them to express my sympathy.', ""I simply want to say this: We hear a lot about what is wrong with our police forces. And it is a difficult task, and when they are wrong, of course, they should be disciplined. But I also think it is important for us to bear in mind that those men who are the police forces of this country, they're there to protect us. Let us try to do everything we can to give them the laws that they need."", 'We may not be able to pay them as much as we ought to pay them, because of the danger of the jobs they have. Sixtysix were killed already in this year, and hundreds were injured in accidents like the one I have just described. But while we may not be able to pay them as much as we should, there is something that we can give them that money cannot buy.', ""Let's give respect to the men who enforce the laws of this country."", 'And now a final word to the young Americans that are here, and to your parents and to all who may be listening on television and radio.', 'As I have traveled around the country, we have had from time to time a few who have indicated not only their political opposition, but opposition that went a little further, a few rocks in Vermont, and a few obscene slogans in Kansas City and other places, an attempt to shout me down and so forth and so on.', 'And so I want to talk about that subject, and I want to put it in perspective because I went on the campus at Ohio State, and I talked to students from the University of Wisconsin when I was there and from various universities in the other States that I have visited.', 'Night after night on your television screen you see the pictures, sometimes of young people who are bombing or burning or shouting obscenities, shouting down speakers, engaging in violence. And you get the impression that those young people are a majority of young people and that they are going to be the future leaders of America.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have seen this country and I have talked to young people. And that kind of young people-they are not a majority of young people today, and they are not going to be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""Oh, I do not suggest that I want our young people to approve everything that we stand for. Oh, I want them to disagree, I want them to speak up, because that's the way that we have progress. Each young generation has got to talk to its time. And it has got to keep the older generation from getting in a rut."", 'But, my friends, let us remember in a system that provides a means for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies lawlessness or resort to violence in the United States.', 'So to the young people, and if there are parents here, go home and tell your young people this: Sometimes in school, sometimes as they look at television, listen to the radio, read the newspapers, they may get the impression that America is a sick country, that everything is wrong with America, that this is a country of riots and violence and drugs and decadence with a foreign policy that attempts to dominate other countries.', 'I have traveled to more countries than any President of the United States who has ever held this office--74.', 'I have met many wonderful people. I have respect for all the people in all the countries that I have met.', 'But, my friends, I want to tell you this: When you go abroad and when you return home, you realize we are mighty lucky, young and old, to be born or to live in the United States of America.', 'And so I say to you, criticize what is wrong in America, but also speak up about what is right. There is more freedom here. There is more opportunity here. There is a better standard of living here. And no country in the world has a foreign policy which in my view is more generous and more correct than that of the United States of America, insofar as we aid other countries and we maintain our strength not for the purpose of conquering anybody else but for the purpose that every nation in the world will have what we have: the right to choose, the right to freedom, the right to opportunity, the right to progress.', 'My friends, I say that in order that this minority that day after day tries to get on that television tube and to give that impression of America to Americans and the world, in order that they do not seem to be, it is time for the great silent majority to stand up and be counted for America and to speak for America.', ""There is a way you can be counted. You don't have to engage in violence. You don't have to shout four-letter obscenities."", 'November 3, you go into a little polling booth and for that moment you make a decision. I respect those who may make a decision different from what I recommend. That is our system. It is the greatness of it.', 'But I also say that at this time I want you to consider what I have said. The President of the United States over the next 2 years at least is going to have the responsibility to bring peace to the world and to keep it, the responsibility to bring peace at home and to keep it, the responsibility to reform this government, the responsibility also to have the progress that we want, to stop the rise in prices, to have jobs and prosperity without war.', 'I will meet that responsibility. But I need help. We need it in the House; we need it in the Senate. And so I say on November the 3d, if you want those things, if you want to stand up for those great principles that will make a better America, a better country, not only for you, but for your children, then I say vote for Glenn Beall, for Stanley Blair, for these fine candidates for the Congress and for all the candidates on the State ticket here in the State of Maryland.', 'Thank you.']"
21,Richard Nixon ,"October 27, 1970","['Governor Kirk, Senator Gurney, Congressman Cramer, all of the distinguished guests here on the platform, all of the members of this great audience:', 'I am very honored and proud to be back in the auditorium which nominated me for President of the United States in 1968. And I am proud that every time I have been on the ticket in Florida, in 1959, 1956, 1960, 1968, we carried Florida. Thank you very much.', 'And today, I am here not as a candidate, but I am here in behalf of others. I am here as one who speaks as one of you. As you know, my voting residence is California. I also own property in Florida. And I live in very good public housing in Washington, D.C. But as far as where I spend my time next to Washington, D.C., I am very happy that I have been able to spend more time in Florida than in any other State.', 'And so I speak as a taxpayer in this State, as one who loves this State, who sees its great future, and as that kind of an individual, I think I have a right and a responsibility to tell you what I think about the leadership in this State.', 'I believe that the reelection of Claude Kirk as Governor is in the best interest of the people of Florida, and I am for him all the way. He has the vision, he has the courage, to provide the leadership that this State needs. I say the vision and the courage because Florida is a State that has a great future.', 'I would estimate that in the next 25 years, it will probably grow more than any State in this Union. And now is the time to plan for that growth. Now is the time to see to it that that growth does not destroy the beauty of this State. Claude Kirk sees that problem. He gives great leadership for this State. I support him and the whole ticket in the State of Florida with you.', 'I am also proud to be here in behalf of our national candidates, in behalf of those who are the candidates for the Congress of the United States. I cannot mention them all. I know they have been introduced before.', ""But I want you to know that those who are running for the House in this State of Florida are among the best group of candidates I have seen in the whole Nation. They are a great team. Let's support them and elect them to the Congress of the United States."", 'Now I come to the contest in which there is an interest not only in the State of Florida but in the whole Nation, because what is involved here I would put in terms of a majority of one. I am referring not simply to who controls the next Senate. I am referring to the fact that in vote after vote in the past 2 years a change of one vote might have made the difference as to whether America was going to be strong or weak at the bargaining table, as to whether America was going to have a policy that would win the peace or lose the peace, as to whether America was going to have programs which deal effectively with the problem of crime in this country or ineffectively.', 'And it is because that one vote is so important that I am campaigning in Florida and in other States for men who, on their record, will stand with the President rather than against him on the great issues confronting the American people today.', 'Let me ask you to think of those issues for just a moment, not in terms of whether you are Democrats or Republicans, but in terms of being Americans and what is best for America.', 'I know that I would never have carried this State had it not been for Democrats as well as Republicans. I speak to the whole State and, through you, to the whole Nation.', ""I remember over 2 years ago when I spoke in this convention hall I made some promises to the American people, some promises I have tried to keep. Those promises didn't involve simply Republican policies. They involved what was best for America."", 'I promised that I would embark on a program which would bring peace in Vietnam and lasting peace in the world.', 'I promised that I would enact a program and stand for the enactment of a program that would bring peace at home and stop the rise in crime in this country. And I promised that I would stand for a program that would bring what all of us want, prosperity, progress, but prosperity without war.', 'That is what we want, and that is what we can have.', 'My friends, in the past 2 years, I have worked as President of the United States to carry out those promises I made to you and to the people of America right in this hall. We have made some progress. And when you think of the Presidency of the United States, that awesome position with all of its power, the most powerful man in the world, you think that he should be able to do anything.', 'But I can tell you that while the President has great power, he cannot do what needs to be done unless he has help. And I have come here to ask for help. I need more men in the House, more men in the Senate, who will support the President in the great issues which you have elected me to carry out in the campaign of 1968.', 'And here they are. When I came into office, here is what I found: 550,000 men in Vietnam with no plans to bring them home; casualties at 300 a week; no peace plan on the conference table; and we went to work. Instead of sending more men to Vietnam, we are bringing them home by the tens of thousands, and they are going to continue to come home. Instead of casualties going up, they are going down, and they will continue to go down under our leadership.', 'We have a peace plan on the conference table in Paris. Let me put it quite directly.', 'My friends, we are ending this war, and we are ending it in a way that will discourage those that would start another war. The problem is not in ending a war; the problem is in ending a war where we can win the peace.', 'Look back over the history of this country. I see some here old enough to remember World War I, World War II, Korea. We ended all those wars. But do you realize that in America, in this century, we have yet to enjoy a full generation of peace?', 'Well, I think it is time to change that. That is why I have stood for policies, and I am working for policies, that will end this war in a way that we can have a generation of peace for the last generation of this century.', 'And to do that, I need men in the Senate like Ed Gurney, who has given us such strong support, and another man in the Senate like Bill Cramer, who will give that same kind of support.', ""In order to do that, we also need the support for those programs that will keep America strong, so that when the American President negotiates for the limitation of arms, or in any other field, let's be sure that our President negotiates from strength and never from weakness. That is what Bill Cramer stands for and these candidates here on this platform."", 'I turn now to another problem that I discussed 2 years ago right in this hall. I pledged to the American people that the wave of crime in this country was not going to be the wave of the future, and it will not be the wave of the future with your help and with the support of men like Bill Cramer.', 'But listen to what happened. Eighteen months ago, a year and a half ago, I submitted to the Congress of the United States a comprehensive program to deal with organized crime, to deal with drugs, to deal with narcotics, to deal with pornography, to deal with obscenity.', ""And what happened? Nothing happened month after month after month, until just a few weeks ago, during the election campaign, bills finally reached my desk. I say that record isn't good enough."", 'We need a man like Bill Cramer in the United States Senate who would join with Ed Gurney in getting action in dealing with the problem of stopping crime in this country.', 'Let us well understand what the issue is. I realize that in an election campaign everybody is against crime. Everybody, of course, is for peace. But let me say that the real problem is not simply being for the laws and the judges who will stop the rise in crime in an election campaign, but who will be for those laws and will stand for those judges and approve those judges all year round, and Bill Cramer will do that in the United States Senate.', 'And we need also, my friends, men in that Senate who understand the future of America, who recognize that in this great State of Florida, with all the beauty of its oceans and its inland waterways, that we must pass this heritage on to our children. We must stop the pollution of the air and the pollution of the water, and the destruction of our places of beauty.', ""Let's see that our young people have what we have. My friends, this is a beautiful country. Let's pass it on more beautiful than we received it to the young people of America."", 'Bill Cramer, in those weekly meetings of the legislative leaders, has stood firmly for the programs in the field of the environment, to clean up our air, to stop the pollution of our waters. And, my friends, we need that kind of strong support in the Congress of the United States and in the Senate of the United States. And he will provide it.', 'Now, my friends, let me come to a very specific point. That is, why should a man who has the experience that Bill Cramer has, why does he have an advantage over another man who may be well-intentioned but who does not have the experience?', ""I will tell you why: Because I have noted in those legislative leaders' meetings that when Bill Cramer has a problem, with that fine legal mind of his, he advocates action to deal with it. He is the author, for example, for the anti-bombing bills, for the antiriot bills. I say that that kind of experience, which he's developed over 16 years of service in the House of Representatives, will mean that he who is a big man in the House will begin as a big man in the United States Senate. And that is what Florida deserves in the United States Senate."", 'There is another subject on which he has spoken out, and on which he has acted and not just talked. I know that all of you are aware of my position on the very difficult problem of our schools here and in other States in this country. I believe that the first requirement that all of us want, whatever our background, what all of us want for our children, is quality education. And I believe that the best education comes when we send our children to that school that is closest to home, the neighborhood school.', 'That is why a man who stands firmly for that proposition, who stands firmly against that kind of busing which is used only for the purpose of racial balance, in my opinion, represents what is best for all of the people of this State and of this Nation, the right kind of education, education which is in the best interest of equal opportunity for all and fairness to all.', 'Now, finally, I would not want this occasion to pass without speaking, if I could, to this television audience and also to this audience here in this hall with regard to the young people of America.', 'I want to speak to you about them, because night after night on that television screen, you will see violence. A bomb destroyed, for example, a bank 10 miles from my home in California yesterday near the campus of one of our State universities.', 'And we saw violence in the University of Wisconsin. Night after night you see on the television young people shouting out obscene slogans, trying to shout down speakers, even trying to shout down the President of the United States.', 'Well, they are not going to be able to do it.', 'I know the impression that many Americans have, and I read some of the columnists and others who say those who try to shout down speakers, those who engage in this kind of protest, that they are the majority of young Americans or at least will be the leaders of the future.', 'I have news for you: They are not a majority of young Americans, and they will not be the leaders of the future of America.', 'My friends, the leaders of the future of America are the millions of young Americans who go to school to study, the millions of young Americans who want change, and I hope they always do, who are dissatisfied with things as they are, and I hope they always are--people who, however, recognize that the greatness of America is that this country provides a method for peaceful change, and who also recognize that in a system that provides a method for peaceful change there is no cause that justifies violence or resort to violence or lawlessness.', 'To those who are young, and to your parents and to your teachers, could I tell you something about America, perhaps, that needs to be said more often.', 'We hear what is wrong about this country. We hear that our foreign policy should be criticized. I have traveled to most of the countries of the world, and I have traveled recently as the President of the United States to countries, to Communist countries, to non-Communist countries. And hundreds of thousands of people have come .out to cheer the President of the United States.', 'I will tell you why: because they know that the United States is the strongest nation in the world, hut that the United States will never use its strength to destroy freedom; only to defend it. We will never use our strength to destroy the peace.', ""I am proud of the fact that the United States Of America, as the strongest nation of the world, stands for peace in the world. Let's be proud of our country and stand up for America."", 'And again I say, there are problems here at home. Too many of our people are poor. Too many of our people do not have the chance they should have. There are things that should be done in many, many areas.', ""But, my friends, again, look at America. We are fortunate in that we are the only country in the world that is rich enough that we have the means to provide a decent income for every person in America. That is the greatness of America. Let' s be proud of it and be thankful of it."", 'Now I have a final message for you, and for all of you who are listening on television tonight. On November 3d you will be making a very great decision. It will involve your future. It will involve the future of Florida. It will involve the future of America.', 'I ask you to think not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans what is best for America. I ask for the support that I need to bring peace abroad, real peace, to restore peace at home, and to have the prosperity that we all want-prosperity without war and without inflation.', 'My friends, I have another message for you. Oftentimes, as I travel through the country, and as we find, as we have here tonight, a few who indicate opposition, there are those who say, ""How do we answer those who engage in violence? How do we answer those who try to shout down a speaker?""', 'And my answer is, ""Don\'t answer in kind. It is time for the great silent majority just to stand up and be counted.""', 'The way you answer is by the most powerful action, more powerful than any four-letter epithet that you can imagine, and that is by your votes. Go to the polls on election day. And I urge you to vote. I respect you if you vote differently from what I urge you to do. Let it be a majority decision.', 'But, my friends, I say go to the polls and, as you vote, remember 2 years ago the people of Florida elected as President of the United States a man who had made certain promises.', 'I am trying to keep these promises. I will keep those promises. I need help to keep them. I need Bill Cramer in the United States Senate. Give him that opportunity.', 'So, my friends, there is your answer. With your votes on November 3d, you can tell America what the real majority thinks in this country.', 'Thank you very much.']"
22,Richard Nixon ,"October 27, 1970","['Governor Kirk, Senator Gurney, Congressman Cramer, Congressman Frey, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and this great audience here in West Palm Beach:', 'As all of you are aware, I, from time to time, like to come to Florida, and since the election of 1968, this is the first time I have been in Florida to make a political speech. I am glad it is here in West Palm Beach before this great audience.', ""I am glad because, first, it is a great audience and a wonderful auditorium, one I have not visited before. I am very happy, too, because of the program that I understand has preceded me as I was flying down here from Washington. When I think of Perry Como 1 being the master of ceremonies, we can't afford him, but, boy, is he good."", ""I heard that he had something to say about the Vice President's golf. I don't know' about the Vice President's golf. I have never played with him. But I do know this: He is a great campaigner, and we can be very proud of what he has done in this campaign."", 'Perry, I look forward to playing golf with you, but you are going to be my partner; I know how good you are. You get more practice than I do.', 'But in any event, I, too, want to express my appreciation to all of those that have participated in the program. I understand that the Naples High School Band is here. Right?', 'I am in the wrong place. It says the Miami Convention Center.', ""Let's pay our tribute to the Lake Worth High School Band. How about that?"", 'And the New Dawn Sing Out,2 are they here, too? They better be. And to all of the others that have participated in the program. To you, Dr. Moody,3 for your invocation, my deep appreciation.', 'I am going to have something to say about students a little later, so I am glad to have some right up here.', 'And now, I want to talk to you very directly about my views on this 1970 campaign here in the State of Florida, particularly, and in the Nation generally.', 'First, I want to speak about the State campaign, the campaign for Governor-the campaign for Governor and for the State legislature and for the State ticket, generally.', 'As you know, I am a taxpayer in the State of Florida. I also am a resident of the State of California, where I have my voting residence. And then I live in a public housing project in Washington, D.C. As one who lives in three different places, I can say that next to Washington, D.C., I spend more time in Florida than any place in this country.', 'And as a taxpayer in this State, one who has a great liking for this State, who knows its possibilities for the future, for progress, who knows that as we look ahead for the next 25 years, Florida will probably be the fastest growing State of all the major States in this country--looking to this State and looking to the leadership that it needs, let me say that I enthusiastically endorse Governor Claude Kirk, because he is a man of vision, he is a man with the courage of his convictions, who will get up and fight for what he believes is right.', ""He doesn't look to the past; he looks to the future. He is a man who is going to build a greater Florida for the future. I think we need him as Governor and I enthusiastically support him. I just hope he doesn't raise my taxes."", 'And I endorse, too, the whole State ticket, of course, at the same time. Now, I want to speak about the national ticket. And speaking of the national ticket, of course, is my primary responsibility because, as one who has the responsibility of serving as President of all the American people, I also have the responsibility to speak to the people about the needs that I find in the Congress, if I am going to keep the pledges that I made to the American people.', 'It is rather traditional in the last week of a campaign, particularly, to get pretty partisan, to come before an audience like this which is primarily Republican and say, ""Vote Republican,"" or if it is a Democratic audience to say ""Vote Democrat,"" if you happen to be on the other side.', 'I am not going to say that tonight. And in all the speeches that I make this week, I am not going to say, ""Vote Republican"" just because you happen to be a Republican.', 'I am going to say to you here in Florida what I am going to say in California and other States that I am going to visit in these next 3 days: that the future of America is too important and the issues before America are too important to think in terms of the party label a man wears.', 'What really counts is what is best for America. And it is because I believe that what Bill Cramer stands for and has stood for in the House and what he will vote for in the Senate and stand for, along with Ed Gurney, that is what America needs. That is why I am for him, because he stands for what is best for America.', ""Let's forget for just a moment what our party affiliation is, Republican or Democrat. Let's think of these great national issues. Let's think of the responsibility of the President of the United States, sitting there in that Oval Office, his responsibilities to the people of America and particularly to the young people and their future, and, also, as Bill Cramer suggested, to the people of the world, because America as the leader of the free world holds the key to peace in the world."", 'As we look at those responsibilities, I can assure you that number one all across the country is that of bringing peace to the world and keeping peace. You will recall that in my acceptance speech just a little over 2 years ago in Miami, that was the major theme. I pledged then that I would work to end the war in Vietnam in a way that we could build a lasting peace in the Pacific and in the world.', 'We have made some progress. Instead of having men go out to Vietnam, as was the case for the last 5 years, they are coming home, tens of thousands of them, and more will be coming home.', 'Instead of casualties going up, and they were at 300 a week when we came in, they are going down, and they are the lowest in 4½ years, and they are going to continue to go down as a result of the strong action that we have taken to reduce those casualties.', 'And instead of being in a position where the United States did not have a peace plan on the table, we have one on the table, a generous one, one that we are pressing the enemy to accept or at least to negotiate.', 'Now, here is the situation in a nutshell with regard to the United States Senate, which has an enormous effect on the foreign policy of this country, as well as the House, but more so in the Senate, because it approves, of course, any treaties that may be agreed upon by the President.', 'In this particular area, we need men in the Senate who understand foreign policy, who understand the necessity for the United States to be strong if we are to lead the forces of peace in the world adequately, who understand that the real question in Vietnam is not simply ending a war that is easy.', 'The real question is ending a war in a way that we will discourage those who might make war in the future, and have a real peace and not a temporary peace. That is what America wants.', 'We have ended lots of wars. We ended World War I; we ended World War II; we ended the Korean war. And yet, do you know in this century, we have never yet had a generation of peace, one full generation. I think it is time that we did better.', 'And that is why I stand firmly for that kind of a program that will end this war and that will win a peace, that will give these young people a chance to have what no one in this century has had in America, a full generation of peace.', 'That is what we are working for and that is the support that we want in the United States Senate. If we are going to have that generation of peace, we not only have to end this war, it is necessary for the President and his associates to negotiate, to negotiate particularly with the major powers and particularly the Soviet Union.', 'And if we are to negotiate, we must negotiate from strength. It is necessary that we understand that. It is necessary that we have Senators--just as Ed Gurney has stood firmly and strongly in the Senate on vote after vote on this particular matter, so Bill Cramer will stand in the Senate with Ed Gurney. It will be a great team in the field of foreign policy and national defense. We need them. I need them. You need them. America needs them there in the United States Senate.', ""Now, let's come to some issues at home. The issue of peace abroad, as I am sure all of you will agree, doesn't divide us in terms of Whether we are Democrats or Republicans. As Americans, we want peace. We want lasting peace. We want a strong America. That is why I say on this particular issue, vote for what is best for America."", 'And so it is with regard to the problems that we see at home, many of them. I see many people in this audience who are undoubtedly concerned, as are others across the country, about the rise in the cost of living. I have read some of the polls indicating that that is a major concern.', 'It should be. I talked about it in 1968. I noted then that because our Government over the previous 8 years had spent $50 billion more than it took in in taxes, we had inflationary pressures that were driving prices up and up and up. And I said it had to stop.', ""I have been trying to stop it. I haven't had the help that I needed. I haven't had it in the Congress of the United States, enough help. Oh, we have had some that have stood firm. Men like Bill Cramer, men who have stood firm on these particular votes that involve this particular point."", 'You know, when you have a spending program in the Congress of the United States, it is very tempting to vote for all of them, because, after all, most people are for spending money which they think might benefit them.', 'But what we need in the Congress of the United States, in the House and in the Senate, are men who have the courage to look at these programs and to vote against a program that might benefit some people, a special group, but will raise prices for all people. That is what we need to do.', 'In other words, what we need is to recognize that unless we can cut the Federal budget, we are going to raise the family budgets for millions of Americans.', 'So, I say we need in the House and we need in the Senate men who will stand with the President in this very difficult task. Unless we deal with the problem of spending in Washington, D.C., cutting that spending where it can be cut, cutting it wherever we think excessive spending might drive up prices, it means we are going to have runaway inflation.', ""If you want to stop runaway inflation, then let's not have a runaway Congress. Give us men that will stand firm, stand fast. Bill Cramer is such a man. He will stand with us rather than against us on such issues."", 'And now there is a third issue that I believe is completely beyond partisan politics. It is the problem that can best be described as peace at home. We all know that over the past few years there has been an alarming rise of crime in this country. As a matter of fact, in the sixties, crime went up 158 percent in America.', 'And I pledged, during the campaign, that we would have a program, a program starting with a new, strong Attorney General. Incidentally, we have one in John Mitchell, one of the best men that has ever served in that post.', 'We would start with a program of strengthening the law enforcement officials, of appointing judges to the court who would strictly construe the Constitution, and particularly whose record was strong whenever the question came up of coming down hard on the side of the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. And particularly, also, laws, new laws, laws to deal with the problem of rising crime in this country.', 'Let me tell you what has happened. Eighteen months ago I submitted programs, programs to deal with organized crime, programs to deal with drugs, and dangerous drugs, and areas like that, programs to deal with obscenity and pornography.', 'What has happened? For 18 months the Congress waited and waited and waited, and only in the last few weeks have some of those measures reached my desk for signature. I am glad they came. I signed them, and now we are going to enforce them.', 'But I simply want to say this: I have determined that as far as the President of the United States is concerned, he has a special responsibility, not only to adopt those policies that will bring peace abroad but to adopt those policies that will restore peace at home.', ""I will do it, but I need help. I need help in the House; I need help in the Senate. And here again, I know where Bill Cramer stands. I know where he stands because he is a man who hasn't just talked about this issue in election time. In his 15 years in the House he has become an expert in this field. Whether it is an anti-bombing amendment, whether it is an amendment dealing with an antiriot situation, of which he was the author, or in many other areas, he is one of the major experts."", 'I remember meeting after meeting of our congressional leaders where we meet every week down at the White House. Bill Cramer, we turned to him over and over again because he knew what the law was, he knew what could be done, he made recommendations that we were able to adopt.', 'What I am simply saying is this: If you are concerned about the rise in crime, if you are concerned about the drug traffic in this country, if you are concerned about the flow of pornography and obscenity in the homes of this country, if you want to see that the wave of crime does not become the wave of the future, give us another man in the United States Senate who, with Ed Gurney, will stand firm.', 'Bill Cramer is that man. He knows what to do. He will stand firmly with us on that issue.', 'And now here in this great State of Florida, there is one other issue that I would like to touch upon that is completely beyond whether we are Republicans or Democrats, and that is the future of what we have been calling our environment.', 'It is an issue that has stirred a great number of people, and particularly our younger people, and it should, because they are going to have to live in whatever environment is created by what we do.', 'We need to clean up the air. We need to clean up the water. We need to stop those practices that are polluting this country, that are destroying the beauty of this country.', ""We must leave for these young people the heritage that we received. This is a beautiful country. Make no mistake about it. Let's see to it that we adopt the programs now that will keep it beautiful so that the young people in the future will have the kind of America that we have loved and we have enjoyed."", 'In this field, as you know, the administration has advocated a program that is very far-reaching. It is one that is needed. It is one which was sent to the Congress many, many months ago, on which there has been very, very little action.', 'We need men in the Senate, we need them in the House, who will stand firmly with us on this. Bill Cramer understands it. He has fought for it. He has spoken for it. Here is another area where that strong voice in the United States Senate, added to the voice you already have in Ed Gurney, will give us that team that we need, strong for Florida, strong for America.', 'And now, finally, let me say something, if I may, particularly to the young people that are here. I appreciate your coming. I know that as you sit in a political rally you probably wonder about the future of this country. And I know that some of your parents perhaps have wondered about the future of this country as they have seen what pretend to be, or some at least have suggested are, the young people of America parading across the television screens from time to time over the past few months.', ""You have seen them, the bombings, the burnings, shouting obscenities, shouting speakers down. I have seen a few on this campaign. It doesn't bother me particularly. I have a pretty big voice. But I can only say this: You get the impression, sometimes, because it is news when young people engage in activities that are violent, that are illegal, that that is news. And what is not news is the fact that there are in this country a far greater number of young people who obey the law, who are decent, who are trying to build a better America."", 'Just let me say this: For those who have the idea that the violent few that are on the television screen night after night, that they are either a majority of our young people or that they are going to be the leaders of the future, they are not a majority of the young people, and they are not going to be the leaders of the future of this country.', 'I will tell you, I have seen young Americans on the campus of Ohio State, I have seen them at airport stops, I hear them here in this audience here tonight.', ""Young Americans want change, and I hope they always will. Young Americans aren't satisfied with the way things are, and they should never be."", 'But the great majority of the young Americans know that in this country, in a system that provides a method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies violence. That is what they know, and that is what they stand for.', ""So my message to the young people of America is this: You can be proud of your country. You can be proud that your country's foreign policy is one that doesn't threaten any other country. We are a strong nation, the strongest in the world. But when I meet, as I did yesterday, with the leader of a relatively small country, Romania, I could say to him, and he could believe, that he had nothing to fear from the United States of America. Be proud of it, be proud of your country."", ""Let me tell you, when I travel over this country and when I travel over the world--I have been in the world's capitals, and I have seen hundreds of thousands of people come out--I can say that I am proud that I represent the United States of America, a country that believes in peace and stands for peace at its very best."", 'And here at home where we do have problems, just remember, the greatness of America is that we are the only country in the world, really the only one, that is rich enough that we have the means, the means to solve our problems. All we need is the will, the imagination, the leadership. What a great country to live in!', 'That is what we ought to be saying to our young people, and I am glad that most of them really feel that way, too, when we put it to them, as we are doing here tonight.', 'And now, my friends here in West Palm Beach, as you know, we go from here to Miami for another rally. I simply want to conclude my remarks here with this final thought: This is an election campaign in which the result will be determined in this State and in perhaps a dozen States in this country in these next few days. There are great numbers of undecided voters. What you do, what you say, not only how you vote but how you work in these next few days, may determine who is going to be the next Senator from this State, who is going to be the next Congressman from this district, who is going to be the next Governor of this State.', 'I have spoken to you quite directly about what I believe. I am for Claude Kirk as Governor; I am for Bill Cramer. I am for Bill Cramer for United States Senator. I am for our splendid candidates for the House and our splendid candidates in the State government.', 'But what I urge you to do is to remember the way elections are won is not only by your votes but by your work. And in this area, an area in which both of these candidates should do well, particularly in this election, because of the makeup of the area, we need to roll up a majority.', ""And I say to you, let's go out from this hall and between now and next week lees get the votes, the votes that will reelect Claude Kirk, elect Bill Cramer to the United States Senate, and do it for the good of Florida and for America and for yourselves."", 'Thank you.']"
23,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1970","['Senator Tower, Congressman Bush, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and all of this very great audience here in Longview:', 'I want to say first that, as I read on the plane coming from Florida about this stop, I found that I could proudly say today that I was the first President of the United States, while in office, to visit Longview. And I am glad to be here.', 'After this kind of a welcome, I can assure you I think other Presidents are going to come here, too. And I hope to be back.', ""I have noted, of course, that, as we get in the final days of the campaign, there have been a few comments to the effect that outsiders are coming into Texas. I just want to reply in this way: I don't think the President of the United States is an outsider any place in this country."", 'I feel that way particularly because of the editorial that I saw in the Longview Daily News, and also in the morning Journal.', 'I have appreciated very, much the welcome that you have given and the wonderful welcome that we have here. And may I say, too, that I am so delighted to come back to this part of Texas which I visited first in 1952 and to see some of the groups that I saw then still here. The Kilgore College Band--they are out there. I understand they had a picture of the Rangerettes with me when I was a candidate for Vice President in 1959. As I saw them coming in, I can tell you that not a one of them looks a bit older than when I saw them in 1952. And it is one of the really exciting and fine groups.', 'But let me also pay my tribute and also my thanks to the Tyler College Band. Are they here?', 'To the Gladewater High School Band. It is here. To the Jarvis Christian College Band.', 'Now, my friends, I know that you have been standing here for a long time. I realize that to come to an airport is a great chore. I could see, as the plane circled to come down, that some of you must have walked for miles, literally, to get here.', 'So, consequently, I want to bring my message to you as well as I can, as briefly as I can, as directly as I can, in the tradition of this State, because I know that you like plain talk. You like it straight from the shoulder. I like to talk that way.', 'I want to speak to you about your State, your representation in Washington, your representation also in Austin, and, also, if I could, at the conclusion, something about the future of America as I see it, completely beyond any partisan terms, and particularly in view of the fact that we have so many young people here who are the future of America--and it is a good future, believe me.', 'First, I am proud to be on this platform with some very fine candidates. I am proud to endorse, as I have endorsed previously, and I endorse it here, in the heart of east Texas; I endorse Paul Eggers for Governor of this State.', 'I do so because I happen to know him personally and like him. You know that. I appointed him as the General Counsel for the Treasury Department. He rendered distinguished service. And there he learned what it means to handle the great problems involving the finance of the United States of America. He is a man who, in State government, will know how important it is to keep down that spending so that you can keep down your taxes.', ""That is the kind of a man you want in the Governor's office in Austin. He is a man who understands the other problems of government, one who will take a firm stand for the enforcement of the law in a fair way; one who will be firm for equality of opportunity for all people, and, above everything else, who will be for progress for this great, progressive State."", 'I endorse him enthusiastically. I am glad to be here with him on this platform today.', 'And now I would like to turn to the race for the United States Senate. It probably is not news to you Texans, because you follow politics pretty closely out here, that this is a race that is being watched all over the country. It is being watched because this is a race that could go either way. It will be determined, as will so many other races in this year, probably by what happens in the last week before November 3d.', 'So, what I say to you, what I say to you who may be listening on television or radio: Will you listen? Will you listen not in terms of saying, ""Well I am a Republican"" or ""I am a Democrat, and so I am going to listen to see whether or not I should vote Republican or Democrat.""', 'The issues before America these days are too important to think in terms simply of a party label. We have to think in terms of what is best for America. And it is because I believe that George Bush will do better for Texas and better for America that I am for George Bush for the United States Senate.', 'I want my position to be absolutely clear. I could endorse him solely because he is a member of my party, as he is. I could endorse him solely because I like him personally, as I do.', 'But I say to you that in this particular instance I have examined his qualifications. I have looked at them carefully. I would like for you to do likewise.', 'And these are some things that I would have in mind if I were a Texan thinking about the man who was going to go to Washington to represent me in the United States Senate.', 'First, he is a young man, a young man in terms of whoever would be in the United States Senate, but a man who has great experience in the House of Representatives. In the period of just 4 years George Bush has a voice that has been heard in the House of Representatives. His voice will be heard in the Senate, and it will be heard in the White House. You can be sure of that.', 'And with another young man, a young man with very great experience, one of the strongest men, one of the best supporters this administration has, with John Tower and George Bush, you will have one of the greatest teams that ever came out of Texas, and that is saying a lot.', ""I have got to be careful what I say about these Texas teams. The last time I named Texas number one I couldn't go back to Pennsylvania."", 'But now for a moment may I ask you to consider not simply these qualifications that I have mentioned, the fact that George Bush is experienced, the fact that he will work hard, the fact that he will get things done for Texas--all of these things are important.', 'Let us consider the responsibility, if you will, for a moment, that the President of the United States has. I would like for you to think of what I promised I would try to do for the American people when I was elected 2 years ago, and what I need and what I am trying to do, where George Bush stands on those issues, and why I believe that his election would be helpful-not to me as an individual but to those principles that America, I believe, wants implemented by the President of the United States.', 'Let me begin. What do Americans want above everything else? You know what it is. We think of our young people and, of course, we want a good life. We want good education and good health and good security as they get older. But, above everything else, we want them to live in a world of peace. And so, from the moment that I became President of the United States, I have been working for that cause.', 'Let me make one thing very clear in that respect, incidentally. I appear here in Texas, in the home State of the man who preceded me in this office. He, too, was devoted to peace. He worked for peace. And I am very proud to say that we in the Republican Party are showing a former President the respect that he deserves, far more than those of his own party are showing, and we should show that.', 'The question that we have, then, and you should know, is, what are we trying to do to bring peace? I will tell you very briefly.', 'One, we are bringing men home from Vietnam, and they will continue to go home.', ""Two, by moving on the enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia, we were able to destroy the supplies and, therefore, reduce our casualties to 'the lowest in 4 1/2 years."", 'Third, we have a peace plan on the conference table in Paris. And I can simply sum it up by saying that a plan which will end the war and win a just peace has been put in motion. We are going to have peace.', 'But the important thing is this, and I make this distinction so that all of you will understand why we are doing what we are doing and why we need the kind of support that George Bush and John Tower will give us in the United States Senate.', 'Sometimes I see young people, and some older ones, carry signs saying ""Peace now. End the war now."" Why not? I\'ll tell you why. Any President who has the responsibility for the lives of our young men doesn\'t want any war, not one casualty. He would want to end it immediately.', 'But would you look back over the history of this country? I was born in the year 1913. I can see a few others here who were born then or a little sooner. And in my lifetime, in this century, did you know that America has never had a generation of peace?', 'We have ended wars all right. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. But then it seems that we get in another war before that generation ends its life.', ""I say let's end the war in Vietnam in a way that will discourage those who would make another war. Let's have a generation of peace for Americans. We are doing it. George Bush, John Tower support that policy."", 'And then further, beyond this war, it is essential that the United States, and particularly its President, be able to negotiate with any major power--and I speak particularly of the Soviet Union--to negotiate for the reduction of the great burden of arms in the world, thereby reducing the danger of nuclear war in the world.', ""But I would only suggest that if we are to negotiate any kind of a settlement that will last, it is vital that the United States President negotiate from a position of strength and not from weakness. Let's have a strong United States of America."", 'I know that George Bush, just like John Tower, will stand for that kind of strength that a President needs if he is going to be able to work for the kind of peace that we all want--peace that will last for a generation, not just for a next election.', 'And then I come to a related issue at home. When we came into office, we found that crime had been going up in this country at an alarming rate. It went up 158 percent during the sixties. So we decided to do something about it. I asked for the enactment of stronger laws.', 'I appointed stronger judges. I named a strong Attorney General of the United States of America. And, as a result of this, we have begun to make progress in the fight against crime.', ""But I can tell you that we are not finished. There has been too much delay in getting some of these bills on the President's desk--18 months to get a bill to deal with organized crime, 14 months to get a bill dealing with narcotics."", 'And what we need in the Senate, in the House of Representatives are men who will strongly support the laws and the judges that are necessary to stop the rise of crime and to see that the wave of crime is not the wave of the future in America.', 'It can be done, and we need your help in order to do that.', ""And then third, there is another problem that comes very close to home. I see a number of ladies here, and I imagine a lot of you have been shopping today, or maybe you're going to go a little later in the day. You are going to be worried about prices because they have been going up."", 'As you worry about those prices, you wonder about what the Government can do.', 'I will tell you what we have done, what we can do, what we will do with your help.', 'We found that inflation was going up and up at a time we came into office. One of the reasons for its going up was that Government had spent $50 billion more than it took in in taxes in the years prior to the time that we got there. So we have tried to turn that around. That is why we have been cutting areas of the Federal budget, cutting areas of the Federal budget because we realize that unless we stop that kind of spending it will mean that prices will continue to go up.', 'Let me put it more directly. In the first 5 years af the sixties, we had unemployment that was too high. In the next years of the sixties, we had inflation that was too high, and we had it also with war. What this country should have, what it deserves, what we are working for, and we are making progress toward that end, is prosperity and progress without war and without inflation.', 'That is what we can have and that is the kind of a policy that we have adopted.', ""I don't know of any man in either House or Senate who better understands that issue than George Bush--his service on the Ways and Means Committee, his understanding of Government finance, his recognition of the necessity for doing what is important, for spending when it is important for the future of the country."", 'But when it comes to a basic decision of whether he votes for something that is going to maybe benefit a few people, but raise prices for all the people, he has the courage to say, ""I am going to think of all the people,"" and that is the kind of men we need in the United States Senate and in the Congress.', 'And now to the future. I speak of not just ending a war and bringing peace abroad and at home, not just about stopping the rise in prices. But I think of those things that we need to do to build a better America.', 'Every few years in the history of this country we have to have a period of reform. And we have tried to make this a period of reform. We have made some progress, but we need to make more.', 'Rather than pouring billions of dollars into old programs, programs that have failed, we say the time has come to look at our education program, to look at our health program, to look at our welfare program, and to reform those programs so that the money that we spend will do the job rather than just putting good money into bad programs, because when you do that, you end up with bad money and bad programs.', 'And so what we are doing in this field-it involves many areas--the area of the environment, with which so many of you are familiar. But let me take one that I understand has become an issue here in this Texas campaign.', 'I want to talk about the welfare pro, gram. I want to talk about it very directly and I want to talk about it with the concern that I know that every good Texan has for anybody who needs help.', 'First, we in this country, because it is a rich country, do want to provide assistance for any family that needs assistance. But when we look at the present welfare program, do you know what has happened?', 'We have found that millions more have been added to the welfare rolls at a cost of billions of dollars with no end in sight. I will tell you why it is wrong.', 'When a program makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when it encourages a man to desert his family rather than stay with his family, it is time to get rid of that program and get another one in its place.', 'So, this administration stands for a new program, one that will provide a floor of dignity without the degrading aspects of welfare for those families that need it.', 'But, one that will also have a work requirement and a work incentive. I will put it very bluntly: If a man is able to work, if a man is trained for a job, and then if he refuses to work, that man should not be paid to loaf by a hardworking taxpayer in the United States of America.', 'That is the program we stand for. It is the program that George Bush and John Tower stand for. We need that kind of reform. It is something that all of us want.', 'And then one other issue that I know that everybody is interested in: I am so glad to see so many young people. I understand school was let out--probably a good reason for coming to a rally. Was it? Well, let it out tomorrow.', ""In any event, education, let's talk about it very directly. Nothing is more important to the future of America than good education, and particularly education for our younger people so that they can all have an equal chance to go up. Let me say in that respect, I share something in common with the former President of the United States, Mr. Johnson. We both came from poor families. And we beth saw in our own lives the realization of the American dream at the very highest level."", ""We all want to fulfill the American dream. But, you know, we can't fulfill the American dream unless every American has a chance to fulfill his own dream. That is why I want equal opportunity for education, for jobs, for all areas, for every American, and you want it, too."", 'In this field of education, let us recognize that there are some problems. There is the problem of our schools and the law, the legal requirements that have been handed down by the courts. We have the responsibility for following the law. We will follow the law. But I also think it is important to make this point: It is certainly for all of us to consider absolutely essential, that we think, above everything else, of quality education for all of our children--for white children, for black children, for children whatever their background--quality education.', 'That is my first objective in any education program. And in my view, if you are going to have quality education for a child, and particularly for a young child, you will have it best by having that child go to school closest to home in his own neighborhood and not some place else.', 'That is why George Bush, John Tower, and I, Paul Eggers, all stand firmly for the neighborhood school and against busing, which the law does not require solely for the purpose of racial balance. Because that is quality-education and it is what Americans want and what they deserve.', 'And now one final point. I mentioned during my talk here today the fact that I was so delighted to see so many young people.', ""Since I am speaking for the first time in Texas, I would like to tell you a little about where I have been and what we have seen. I have been to a lot of States, and we have had some exciting meetings. I don't think I have ever seen one quite as widespread as this inside this hangar. They said we would have it all in the hangar and look at all those people way out there. I don't even think they can hear."", 'But I can say this: One point that I have noted in several meetings, and perhaps, as you look at television you have seen it, sometimes we have young people who are there.', 'Sometimes, as in Connecticut, they carry the Vietcong flag. Other times they try to shout down the speaker, the President of the United States. Other times they shout out four-letter obscenities in the presence of the crowd.', 'And sometimes you must get the impression out here in this State, as you look at television of those rallies, and as you look at what has happened in recent months--a bombing here, a burning there, a violent protest there, trying to shout down speakers--that this radical few among our young people, that they are a majority of the young people of America or that they are the future leaders of America.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have seen this country. I have been in the North, in the East, in the West, and the South, and the radical few among our young, they are not a majority of the young, and they are not going to be the leaders of the future in the United States of America.', ""I will tell you, don't lose faith in the young people of America. They do not want to see things as they are, and they shouldn't. The great, it seems to me, asset that this younger generation has is that it cares it cares about peace in the world; it cares about the underprivileged."", ""The young people want change, but they want peaceful change, not violent change. And the young people of America deserve credit for that. As we look at the radical few, let's not blame the millions of good young Americans that go to school and believe in what is right in America."", ""And to those young people, may I bring you a message: Sometimes you must wonder about America. You must hear on television sometimes, or you read in a column in the newspaper, that America is a sick society, that our foreign policy has brought us disrespect abroad, that people fear America abroad and at home. Well, let's just understand what the truth is."", ""There are some things wrong with this country. We have made some mistakes and we will make same more. But as you look at what is wrong with America, don't overlook what is right. I have had the privilege, as your President, to travel to a number of countries over these past 2 years, and hundreds of thousands of people have come out."", 'In Communist Yugoslavia, 350,000 stood in the rain for 2 hours just to see a motorcade go by at 40 miles an hour. Huge crowds in Spain and in Italy and in India, all over the world--why?', ""Not simply because I as an individual was there, but because I represented to them America. And you can be proud of your country's foreign policy. Yes, we have made mistakes, but did you realize that while America is the strongest nation in the world, there is no nation in the world that fears that we would use our strength to destroy freedom or to break the peace. We can be proud of that, and we should stand up for that principle."", 'And the millions of people in this world, they look at America and they realize that in this country there is more freedom, there is more opportunity, there is more chance for progress than in any country in the world.', 'So, as we look at America today, let us remember, only in America could a President of the United States make recommendations to a Congress, recommendations in education, in health, to take care of our aged and those who cannot care for themselves, that, in effect, would provide for them a floor which is higher than the ceiling would be for three-fourths of the people in the world.', 'My friends, and particularly my young friends, remember America is a great country. We are a great people, and we share a great future. And you have an opportunity, all of you, to participate in that future. It is because I believe that Paul Eggers is a man of the future, it is because I believe that George Bush is a man of the future that I endorse them for the offices which they are running for in the State of Texas.']"
24,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1970","['Governor Kirk, Senator Gurney, Congressman Cramer, Judge Carswell, and all of our friends here in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida:', 'I want you to know first what a very great privilege it is for me to speak for the first time in the capital of Florida. As I speak here, I particularly want to express my appreciation to all of you who came from miles around to this airport rally. I saw the cars parked as Air Force One began to land. I realize how far some of you had to walk. I know some of you have been standing here over an hour. Thank you very much.', 'I want to thank the musical organizations that have been here. I understand we have the Leon High School Band and the Godby High School Band. At least we brought those two rival bands together.', 'I am also very happy to be in Seminole country. As some of you may have noted, I am somewhat of a football fan, probably because I sat on the bench for 4 years and learned so much from the coach.', 'But in any event, I do know the great rivalry here between Florida State and the University of Florida. And I do know, too, that this year, the Seminoles, who have had some really fantastic years in the last 2 or 3, have not been as good as perhaps some had expected, but they won last week so watch out for the rest of the year.', ""But whatever the situation with regard to that Seminole football team, I found something else: that the Seminole Band is number one. Let's give them a hand."", 'And also, before I respond to that very generous introduction by the Governor of this State, I want to say something about a man for whom I have very great admiration, he is one of your fellow citizens in this county and in this city.', ""I thought that Judge Carswell was a big man when President Eisenhower nominated him to the Federal bench. I thought that Judge Carswell was a big man when I nominated him to be on the Supreme Court. But when Judge Carswell was rejected by the Senate by a very small vote, and when Judge Carswell lost that nomination to Bill Cramer and then came back to be a real man and support the winner, he is a great man. Let's give him a hand for what he is."", ""Because we have to learn that in this life we aren't going to win all the time. We aren't right all the time. And we aren't going to have our way all the time."", 'The real test of a man is not when he wins but when he loses and when he comes back and says, ""I am for the team,"" and Judge Carswell is that kind of a man. And we thank him for it.', 'And now, since I am speaking in what at least on the map is a Southern State, and since Claude Kirk is one of the first Governors of this State who bears the Republican label, and because there has been a great deal of discussion with regard to a Southern strategy on the part of the national administration, I think it might be well before this audience--this audience made up of Republicans, Democrats, Floridians, Southerners, yes, Americans--I think it might be well to discuss the Southern strategy, what it is, and why I believe that it is something that all Americans, not just Southerners, should welcome.', 'First, I will tell you what I believe about it. I happen to believe there are no second class citizens in America. I happen to believe that there are no second class States in America. And I happen to believe there are no second class regions in America.', 'I went to school in the South. I know the problems of the South, as well as the West and the North and the East. I can say this: I think the time has come for the South not to be taken for granted by the other party, and the time has come to quit kicking the South around. The time has come to recognize this is one country with one standard for the East and the West and the Midwest and the South. That is my attitude about the Southern strategy.', 'We have, as you know, a very difficult problem with regard to our school system. We believe, all of us, as law-abiding Americans, that we should carry out the law. And this administration is committed to carrying out that law, and we are doing it.', 'But we are also committed to this proposition: that the law should be carried out not with the idea of penalizing one section of the country, but that the same standard that applies in Florida should apply in North Carolina or should apply in Michigan or New York or any other State.', ""Let's just stop this hypocrisy that the problem in our schools is only in the South. It is all over the country. Now, men of good will, women of good will, children of good will, teachers, students-we can solve this problem and we can meet it. I want to tell you what I believe."", 'I have stated it in the North, in the East, in the West, in the South, and in a major statement that all of you have had the opportunity to read in March of this year. I think it is a sound proposition. I see these young people, these children here, I think of their future. I think of their future, whether they are white children or black children. I want them all to have that chance to fulfill their dreams, just as all of us have had a chance, we think, to fulfill our dreams.', 'Just remember, we cannot fulfill the American dream unless each American has a chance to fulfill his own dream. That is what we believe in. That is why we want quality education, quality education for every child in this country.', ""I happen to believe that if we are to have quality education, the best kind of education, particularly for our young Children, is in the school that is closest to home rather than the school that's clear across the town."", ""I believe in that, because if you put children on a bus for an hour, they are going to be fighting. I don't care whether they are black or white. Just you put them on that bus. And it is better, in my opinion, to recognize, of course, there must be some transportation, but that busing for the purpose, sole purpose, of achieving racial balance is not required by the law and, in my view, does not serve the interest of quality education."", ""So we stand for the neighborhood school in Florida, in California, all over this country. Why? Because we want equality of opportunity for education, and we want better education for all of our children, and that's the way to get it. That is what we are for."", 'That brings me to your Governor, Claude Kirk. Claude Kirk is a man who stands for these propositions that I have just described. He is a man who has fought hard for these principles. He is a man, some say, who is controversial.', ""Let me say this: Any man who does anything is going to be controversial. Show me a man that doesn't stand up and fight for what he believes is right, and I will show you a man who isn't getting anything done."", 'I happen to be a part-time resident of Florida. I am a taxpayer in this State. I have invested in property in this State. I intend to keep that property because I believe in the future of Florida.', ""But I believe that future will best be served by having in the Governor's office a man with the vision and the courage and the strength of Claude Kirk as the Governor of this State."", 'It is very easy, my friends, to go back to the old ways. It is very easy to go back to the ways that this State was in before, the ways where the new ideas were simply brushed under the rug, the new ideas that are absolutely essential for this State that is probably going to grow more--do you realize this?--than any State in this Union in the next 25 years.', 'It is very easy, when you consider a State like this, simply to settle for leadership of the past. But here we have a man who is thinking of the future, who is planning for the future, who is building for the future. And it is for that reason I am investing in Florida.', 'I am staying in Florida because this man, I think, can give the leadership that Florida wants, he and his whole State ticket.', 'Now I turn to those who are on the national ticket. I turn to them because that is my primary responsibility as the President of the United States.', 'I was elected by the people of this country based on certain pledges that I had made. You remember what they were. You remember 2 years ago that we had 550,000 men in Vietnam with no plans to bring them home, that our casualties were at 300 a week, and they were going up. You remember we had no peace plan. There seemed to be no hope to bring the war to an end.', 'You remember that crime had gone up 158 percent over the last 8 years, and was still going up.', 'You remember that we had a weak Attorney General. You remember that as far as the decisions that were being made in this Government at that time, that there did not seem to be the urgency to deal with the forces of crime that were destroying our country.', ""You remember, too, that the inflation in this country was moving up at a rapid pace because our Government had spent $50 billion more in the previous 8 years than it had taken in in taxes. And when your Government in Washington spends more than it takes in in taxes, year after year after year, the inevitable effect is to raise the prices for all the people. That is wrong. It is wrong for people in Washington to spend your money in a way that raises your taxes or your prices, when it isn't necessary to do so. We are going to stop that, but I need some help."", 'My friends, I have pledged to bring into being in the United States a policy that will not only end the war but bring a peace that will last.', 'I have pledged to bring peace at home, to stop the rise in crime. I have pledged to adopt those policies that will bring us progress and prosperity without war, which we have not had, and progress and prosperity without inflation, which we have not had.

It is the most powerful office in the world because this is the strongest nation in the world.', 'But, you know, the President cannot do what he wants to do for the country, what you want him to do for the country, what you elected him to do, unless he has got help from that Congress.', 'I need the kind of help that Ed Gurney, your Senator, has been giving us in the United States Senate. I need the kind of help that we have been getting by the Members of the House delegation who are here, and those candidates who are running for the House.', 'Let me put it quite directly. What is involved in this election campaign on the national level, and I will put it in terms of the Senate race, very simply is your one vote, and your one vote may determine a majority of one in the United States Senate.', 'Did you realize, looking over the last Congress, that a change of one vote meant the difference as to whether we would have had a missile defense and the President of the United States would negotiate from weakness or strength?', 'One vote could have made the difference with regard to the approval of a Supreme Court nominee, with regard to whether or not we had fast action on the bills that we had submitted for stopping crime in this country.', 'One vote could have made the difference as to whether or not we were going to stop the rise in inflation.', 'Over and over again in this closely divided United States Senate, one vote-sometimes two, sometimes three. But we find over and over again the same pattern. If one vote were to shift, it makes the difference as to whether or not the President of the United States is going to have a Congress that is going to work with him or work against him; whether or not we are going to have the support that we need or whether we are not going to have the support that you want us to have.', 'Let me get very precise in these terms on the issue in which you are vitally interested. I am concerned, and very deeply concerned, about those problems that all of us are mentioning as we think about the decision we make on November 3d, but particularly about the future of our young people.

We were in Korea, and we ended it.', ""But, before the generation lived its life out there came another war each time. My friends, the problem with regard to ending a war in Vietnam is not a difficult one. I could end it like that. But the problem is, let's end this war in a way that we will discourage those who would start another war. Let's end this war so that we can win the peace, a generation of peace for Americans in the years ahead."", 'My friends, that is why a great number of young Americans in a very difficult war, far away from home, have gone to Vietnam.

It says ""Listen to America\'s Youth."" I hear America\'s youth. I hear them here. I see them as you see them night after night on television. You see them, and you get a distorted opinion of America\'s youth.', ""Let me say in that connection I think it is very unfortunate, and I have talked to some older people who express great despair about our young generation. They are wrong, because what they see on television is this: Oh, they see the bombing of a building, the burning of the bank in California a couple of days ago. They see a few trying to shout down the President of the United States, and they think that those are a majority of America's youth and the leaders of the future."", ""Let me tell you: They are not a majority of America's youth, and they will not be the leaders of the future."", ""I am proud of young Americans. I want to tell you why: Because they care. They care about peace. They care about the people that don't have the same chance that they have. They want a better America. They are not satisfied with the way things are.

I am proud of America's young people."", 'And to our young people, sometimes, as you study about our problems in school, sometimes when you hear on television or read editorials and columns about everything that is wrong about America, could I remind you and your parents about some of those things that might be right.', 'I have had a very great privilege since I have been President to travel to many countries. And as I traveled to those countries, Communist countries, Romania, Yugoslavia, non-Communist countries, it has been the same kind of a reception every place: hundreds of thousands of people cheering.', 'What were they cheering? They were cheering not because America is strong, because leaders of other strong countries have come there and not had that kind of reception. And not because America is rich, because leaders of other countries that are rich have come there without that kind of reception. But because they know that the United States, the strongest nation in the world, does not threaten the peace or the freedom of any country in the world.', ""In other words, America's strength is for peace and for freedom."", 'There is another reason: They cheer the President of the United States because they know that of all the nations in the world, there is more freedom in America, there is more opportunity in America, there is more progress in America than there has ever been in any country in the history of the world.

We want to move forward with programs in the welfare system--a program which will enable people to have a floor of dignity on which to stand.', 'But, my friends, let us recognize that only in America, because we are a rich country, can we do all those things.', 'Do you realize you can travel to nation after nation, and all of them would want these things.

I can tell you we are part of a great people, and together we share a great future.', 'Now, I want to tell you the answer to those who may not, as you have--most of you--shown the respect to any speaker, whether you agree or disagree with him, by listening.', ""The answer is not to try to shout them down. The answer is not to answer in kind with violence, if it is violence. But what to do is for the great silent majority of this country to answer in the way that is the most effective over 190 years of our Nation's history. You have a powerful weapon. It is a weapon of peace. It is a weapon of a majority."", 'On November 3d you can vote, and as you vote, remember--remember that, as you vote, you are going to determine the future of Florida. I hope you vote for Claude Kirk, because I think he is best for the future of Florida. You are going to determine the future of America. I hope you vote for Bill Cramer and our candidates for the House, because I believe they are best for the future of America.', 'Because, remember, a majority of one may determine whether the President of the United States, in these next 2 years, has the backing that he needs to do what you elected him to do, a majority of one.

26,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1970","['Governor Kirk, Senator Gurney, Congressman Cramer, all of the other distinguished platform guests, and to all of you who have given me such a very warm welcome here in St. Petersburg and to this county:', 'It has been mentioned, and I take notice of this fact, that I can proudly say today that I am the first President ever to visit this city of St. Petersburg.', 'After a reception like this, I can assure you I will not be the last President to visit St. Petersburg.', 'I am very happy to be in the Sunshine City of the Sunshine State. I am happy to be here because of my very good memories of the years that I have been here before, the many meetings I have attended, the friends that we have in this area. And I particularly want to thank you for coming out in the middle of the day in such great numbers. I want to thank all of those who took time from their jobs to be here, people who also took time from school.', ""In the very few days that I have been traveling around the country, I have seen a few bands, but never so many as I see here at St. Petersburg. Now, let's hear them all. The Largo High School Band of Gold, the Dunedin High School Band, the Meadowlawn High School Band, the Dixie Hollins High School Band, and the Gibbs High School Band. And also my deep appreciation to the First United Methodist Chancel Choir for the music that they presented before the meeting."", 'I do not think that it is any secret as to why I am here in Florida. I am here because of my very great interest in the future of this State, in the future of this Nation, and in your future. I am here because I believe that future is going to depend in great measure on what happens on November 3d in the elections in Florida and across this Nation.', 'First, let me speak about the State contests. Generally speaking, I do not cover State contests because my problems, my responsibility, are on the national scene. But in Florida I have a special interest. After all, as you know, I have a legal residence in California and a home there. I also have property and a home in Florida. I live in the best public homing in the United States in Washington, D.C. And I can say that as I have noted over the last 2 years that except for Washington, D.C., I spent more time in Florida than any other State in the country.', 'So you see, I like this State as you like this State, and I know that most Floridians, like most Californians, are people that came here because you wanted to come here. And I want to say that as a taxpayer in this State, as one who has invested in property in this State, as one who intends to keep that property because I consider it is a good investment, I am interested in the future of this State.', 'And when I speak of the future of this State, I want you to know that I believe that it is vitally important to have leadership in Tallahassee that will not go back to policies of the past, but leadership that has courage, leadership that has vision, leadership that believes in progress, and the man who stands for those things is Governor Claude Kirk. That is why I am for him for Governor of the State of Florida. So, I commend him and the entire State ticket to you today.', 'Also, on the national level, before I arrived on this platform, I am very happy that the candidates for the House of Representatives have been introduced. I endorse them all. I, particularly, of course, in his home district, endorse your next Congressman, Bill Young, who will make a fine Congressman in the United States Congress.', 'Now, I come to the Senate race. There is an enormous interest in this Senate race in Florida because Florida is one of those States that is going to determine what I have described across this country as the majority of one in the United States Senate.', 'By a majority of one, I am not referring simply to party control. This is far more important than whether the Democrats or the Republicans vote one way or another in the Senate or in the House, or in the Nation. But the majority of one will determine whether or not we are going to have an adequate defense for the United States; whether we are going to have a program and backing for the President on a program that will bring lasting peace; whether we are going to have backing for the President on a program which will stop the rise in prices in this country; whether we are going to have backing for a program, with knowledge, on a program that will stop the rise in crime in this country; and a program of progress for all Americans.', 'Now, listen to the words that I have used: peace abroad, peace at home, progress, stopping inflation, employment, jobs--all of these things we all believe in.', 'The question is, how are we going to get them? These are not partisan matters. And I ask you for a few moments to think not just of your Republican background, and most of you, of course, here are Republicans, but to think of yourselves as Americans, what is best for America.', 'Think of the fact, for example, that 2 years ago in the State of Florida, this State gave to the present President of the United States one of his biggest majorities.', 'Think of the fact that I was elected for the purpose of carrying out certain promises I made to the American people. I promised to work for a just and lasting peace, to work to stop the rise in crime, to work to stop also the rise of prices in this country, and for a program of progress-progress for all Americans, which is what we want, particularly for ourselves and even more so for our young people.', 'My friends, I have been working for those goals. And when you think of the President of the United States, and all of you, particularly you young people, you study about the Presidency, and you think of the man sitting in that great Oval Office in Washington, D.C. You think of all of the world leaders coming to that office.', 'You recognize that whoever is President of the United States is probably, in terms of power--because he represents a powerful country--the most powerful man in the world.', ""And yet let me tell you, a President can be for peace, a President can be for progress, a President can be for stopping crime at home, a President can be for stopping inflation, but he can't do it alone. He isn't that strong. He needs help. I need more help in the House; we need it in the Senate. And you can help by giving us the men that we need."", ""So it really gets down to that. It doesn't get down to personalities. I am not here to campaign against anybody. I am here for the men that I believe in. That is what you want. And I am for these men because I know they are going to be for those programs that are best for Florida, best for America, and best for you."", 'Let me tick them off. First, I noted here, as I have in other cities that I have visited, numbers of people, particularly young people, who held up their signs, ""Peace now."" I am for peace. All of us are for peace.', ""But let me describe it. Let me tell you what we have done about it. We haven't just talked. We have done something. When we came into office, there were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. Our casualties were at 300 a week and going up. There was no peace plan on the conference table. We came in. I went to work. We are bringing men home by the tens of thousands rather than sending them to Vietnam. We are bringing the war to an end. Because I took and made the difficult decision which I made for the purpose of destroying the enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia, we have cut American casualties. They are the lowest in 4 1/2 years; they are going to continue to go down in Vietnam."", 'Now we have a peace proposal on the conference table in Paris, a reasonable proposal, dealing with the cease-fire, a negotiated settlement, and exchange of prisoners of war, and a willingness to negotiate without conditions on those matters.', 'Let me tell you where we are in a nutshell. We are on the road to a just and lasting peace in Vietnam, but we need support. We need support for that kind of responsible policy.', 'Now let me tell you what the other policy is. There are men who disagree. It is very close in the United States Senate in this respect. Sometimes it is a majority of one. There are men who say, ""Peace now"" or, at a time certain, a few months from now.', ""There are people that say that it doesn't make any difference about how we get out, just get out. Let me tell you this: When I came into office, I could have ended the war immediately, but what I want is not just to end this war; I want to end this war in a way that the younger brothers and the sons of those that are fighting in Vietnam aren't going to have to fight in some future war sometime in the future."", 'And so to you young people, I say to you, I know this is a difficult period. I remember before World War II how I felt. I know how you feel as you look at this very difficult war, far away. I can simply say this: We have ended World War I, we have ended World War II, we ended Korea in this century.', 'Do you realize if you study your history that there has not been one full generation of peace in this whole century?', 'The question is not ending a war. The question is ending a war in a way that we can win the peace. And we are going to win the peace this time. We are going to win it for America and the world.', 'In order to win it we also are going to have to be strong. It is necessary for the President of the United States to negotiate with other nations, and particularly with other major nuclear powers, including the Soviet Union.', ""We are going to negotiate, if we can, a limitation on nuclear arms so that we can reduce not only the burden of arms but the danger of war. But if you are going to send your President into negotiation, I say let's be sure the President of the United States negotiates from strength and not from weakness in any negotiation that takes place."", 'Why is that important? Because a strong United States will be respected in the world, and a strong United States will use its strength never to destroy freedom but to defend it; never to break the peace but to defend the peace.', 'This is why, standing for a strong United States means that you are standing for peace, not just peace for the next election--that is easy--but peace for the next generation. That is what we want and that is what w-e are going to have with the support that you can give us.', 'I turn to a similar problem at home. If the United States is going to be able to lead the forces that will bring law and order and respect for it abroad, we have to establish respect for law, respect for order, here at home in the United States of America.', 'I spoke to that subject, you remember, in 1968. I pledged to the American people that the wave of crime would not be the wave of the future.', 'I pointed out that over the past 8 years, crime went up 158 percent. I said that one of the reasons for that was that we did not have strong enough law enforcement officials, that we needed stronger judges who would recognize that it was necessary in their decisions, following the Constitution, to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country.', 'My friends, I pledged to do something about it. I have tried to do. something about it. I have appointed judges. I have appointed a strong Attorney General, John Mitchell, who is doing the job that needed to be done, and that was not done by the previous Attorney General. We have also taken action to ask for legislation.', 'Now listen to this: Eighteen months ago, a year and a half ago, I presented proposals to the Congress to deal with organized crime, to stop the traffic in narcotics and drugs to the extent that we can under the law, to stop the flow of obscenity and pornography into the homes in this country, and to deal with these problems in a way that would be effective, that would strengthen the peace forces in this country.', ""Eighteen months have gone by and only a few weeks ago, as we get into election, did these laws finally, some of them, come to my desk for signature. That isn't good enough."", 'I say that we need men in the House and men in the Senate that will not just talk about the necessity to stop the rise in crime and the enforcement of the law during an election, but who will talk and work and fight for it all year round. And Bill Cramer is that kind of a man.', 'He is a man, as you know, a skilled lawyer and an able one, a man who is one of the top leaders in the House of Representatives, and has met with me week after week in the Cabinet Room determining the future policies of this country, and one who, in this field, knows what needs to be done.', 'He comes to the Congress, and particularly will come to the Senate, with 16 years of experience, experience in this field, experience in the field of the environment, experience, for example, in another field that is of enormous interest to the people of this State, one of the coauthors of the historic highway program.', ""Here is a man, in other words, who can do for Florida what needs to be done, who not only will be for what Floridians want, but will be able to do for them because he knows how to do it. He is a man with the experience that a man ought to have when he goes to the United States Senate. He and Ed Gurney will make a great team. Now send him down there. Let's have him there."", ""And now we come to another issue of enormous importance to this State, to this Nation. Everybody is aware of the fact that here in Florida, as in California, there are great numbers of retired people. I think of your problems. I remember my own mother and father, how they worked hard, saved a little money, and I remember how the life insurance which they thought would mean so much in later years didn't mean a lot because of what inflation had done to it."", 'I think the cruelest tax of all is to raise the prices of people. I say that we have got to stop this situation in which, in Washington, D.C., we have runaway spending and have runaway prices at home as a result of it. We can stop it. What we need, though, are Members of the House and Members of the Senate who will have the courage to vote against those spending programs that may have the effect of benefiting some people, but have also the effect of raising prices for all the people.', 'Let me tell you what has happened. Why do you have inflation today?', 'In the 8 years before we came into office, this Government spent $50 billion more than it took in in taxes. This year, over the past 2 years, in this Congress, this Congress already has authorized more than $6 billion more than I recommended.', ""Let me say, all of us want to have those programs that will bring progress for America. But it is the responsibility of the President of the United States to do everything that he can to wage a winning fight against inflation and against the rising cost of living. I need your help. I need Bill Cramer's help. He will help in this. We need him in the United States Senate."", 'And we need it also, and now particularly to the younger people, we need it because this is a great country with a great future. You recall the programs that I have introduced, that I have asked the Congress to follow, which would bring progress for America--a program for the environment which goes far beyond anything that had ever been proposed before. It is needed.', ""We have got to see to it that our younger people have the heritage that we received from our fathers, our mothers, our grandfathers--a beautiful country. That is why I have made decisions that any program by the Federal Government, any program that is adopted, before it goes into place, whether it's a barge canal or anything else, will not go into place unless we are given assurance that it is not going to affect the environment of our country in the wrong way."", 'So, in this field, you have a man again in Bill Cramer who knows the subject, who supports us, who has worked for us.', 'In the field of progress also, I think of those--and in this State we have great numbers--who are retired, who are on social security. I think of the fact that you have always been behind; the Congress sometimes brings you--catches up with the rise in the cost of living. That is why in the campaign of 1968 I recommended that we adopt a new approach in which there would be an automatic increase in social security benefits to compensate for any increase in the cost of living. That is only fight. That is only fair.', ""It hasn't been passed by the Congress yet. It ought to be passed. You get a man like Bill Cramer down there, he is going to work to pass it because he has been for it all the years. But we need him. We need that kind of support for that kind of program."", 'Now, finally, my friends, I never want an opportunity to pass, before an audience like this, such a cross-section of America, a cross-section geographically. I can imagine that many of you came from the Midwest. My mother was from Indiana, my father from Ohio. Many of you came from other parts of the country.', ""But, above all, you are thinking of America and its future and the future of this State. And also at this time, you must have concern about the future of America because of what you may recently have seen over recent months on your television screens. I think it is a distorted picture of America you've seen."", ""I am not blaming those who put it on television. I am simply suggesting that because it is more news and bigger news when something is wrong, that usually gets on, and we don't hear enough about what is right about the United States of America."", 'Some of you may have heard the program from Miami last night where there were a rather considerable number of people trying to shout down the President of the United States.', 'The television showed the very good judgment, incidentally, to blip out some of the four-letter words, and I hope they will continue to.', 'But just let me say this: The impression that those who try to shout down speakers, the impression that those who engage in violence, the impression that those who engage in lawlessness, that attempt to close down schools, the impression that those that bombed a bank near the University of California campus at Irvine just 2 days ago, 10 miles from my home, the impression that those young people are a majority of Americans, or that they are the future leaders of America, is wrong. They are not a majority, and they are not going to be the future leaders of America.', 'I will tell you who the future leaders of America are. They are young people--young people who are not satisfied with the way things are. Young people should never be satisfied. They should always want progress and change--young people who want the world to be better, young people who are concerned about war and concerned about inequities, young people who are concerned about inequality, young people who want a better chance for everybody.', 'For example, I noted that a little Korean girl, a young Korean girl, sang ""The Impossible Dream."" I think of the fact that I grew up in a little town in California, and I consider the fact, as I was working in a grocery store, what an impossible dream it was that I would ever be standing here today in the position that I hold.', 'And Bill Cramer, I am sure, thinks in those lines. He worked far apart and a few years different, here in this area, in a grocery store, as a poor boy. And here he is, running for the United States Senate.', 'But let me say this: What is an impossible dream in most countries is possible in America.', 'Let me say this: Never forget the fact that if we are to realize the American dream, we have got to make it possible for every individual to have a chance to realize his own dream. That is what our young people want. That is what I want. That is what we stand for.', 'But let us never forget, you hear about what is wrong about America, you see our policies criticized at home and abroad. Let us be proud of the fact that when the President of the United States goes abroad people come out, whether in a Communist country or a non-Communist country, they cheer.', 'Why? Because they know that the United States of America, even though it is the strongest nation in the world, stands for peace. They know there is more freedom, more opportunity, more progress in America than in any country in the world.', 'Let me say, did you know that the program that I have offered to the American people, which would provide for every family in America that needs it, a decent income, a minimum income, that the floor for that income that we would provide in America, which we consider a floor of poverty, would be a ceiling that three-fourths of the people in this world never will have a chance to reach.', ""Let's be proud of being American. Let's be proud of what we have accomplished."", 'In your time, because of what happens in America, we are going to have, in my opinion, peace in the United States, and we hope peace for a generation for the whole world. Because of what happens in America, we shall raise the standards of our people in a way that most people never dreamed was possible even 25 years ago.', 'Because of what we have in America, we must recognize that our young people not only will have a chance to have a better life materially, but because the burden of toil will be lifted from their backs, they will have a chance to develop the quality of life such as it has never been developed before.', 'As we think of what is wrong with America, I repeat: It is time now to recognize what is right. As we think of what is right, one of the things that is most right is that on election day you can answer all of those, that minority, the radical minority, that strike out against things that they think are wrong about America--you can answer in the polling booth. That is the time for the great silent majority to stand up and be counted. Vote on election day and vote for Bill Cramer, our candidate for the United States Senate.']"
27,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1970","['Senator Tower, Congressman Bush, Congressman Collins, Congressman Price, all of the very distinguished guests on the platform, and all of this very distinguished audience here in the hall, all of the people who are waiting in the overflow hall, and the thousands outside:', 'I just want you to know that I am very proud and honored for the first time, as President of the United States, to be speaking here in Dallas. And as I speak in Dallas, I know that this State likes to think of itself as being number one in a number of ways.', ""Dallas likes to think of itself as being number one in a number of ways. And I have been trying to think of what I could say which wouldn't get me in trouble in Ohio or some other place."", 'So, I will just make a few comments in this respect about this city, this State, some of the current headlines we have been reading on the sports pages.', 'First, I find that, and I must be very careful what I say here, that the AP poll puts Texas as number one.', 'Second, I find that the Dallas Cowboys, after a slow start, are now tied for number one in their division.', ""Third, I understand that SMU [Southern Methodist University] isn't having its best year, but I do know this, and a little bit of history long before those from high school or even the present members of the SMU band will recall: In the year 1934, which was my senior year in college, I remember that, for the first time, a southwest conference team came to the Rose Bowl, SMU came there. They won 7 to 0. That was not something that was particularly new, because other teams from the East or the West or the South had won in the Rose Bowl. But what really made the news was the SMU band. It was the greatest they ever had."", 'I am very proud tonight that the SMU band, as I understand, for the first time for what is labeled as a political event, is here.', 'I appreciate your coming. I shall keep my remarks as nonpolitical as I can under the circumstances. I can only say in that respect, however, that after the reception, the wonderful reception, we had in Longview earlier today, after this enormous reception here in Dallas, it is quite clear that most of the people in Texas do not consider the President of the United States to be an outsider in the State of Texas.', 'Now, my friends, since this is a State that thinks of itself and is very proud of its number one teams and its number one band, I will tell you that I am very proud to be standing here with what I think is a team of champions, George Bush and Paul Eggers, your great candidates for the Senate and the governorship.', 'You will expect me--and you will not be disappointed in this respect--to endorse them strongly. However, I am going to surprise most of you by the way that I do it. You know, as you get to the last days of a campaign, the oratory gets more strident, the charges get more wild, and you hear ""Vote Republican"" or ""Vote Democratic""--""The other fellow is bad, and this fellow is good.""', 'Let me simply say this: First, the issues before the American people today are too great to be thinking in partisan terms. We have got to think of what man is best for America. And George Bush, in my opinion, is the best man for America.', 'I would like for you to consider, for example, the fact that in this election campaign there are vitally important issues-vitally important issues--that involve the future of all Americans. They involve the future of particularly young Americans. They are ones that involve your vote on November 3d, and they are ones that I would like to address myself to, not in partisan terms, but in the terms that I know you in this State appreciate and understand.', 'You want the best man for Governor; you want the best man for the Senate. And it is because I believe these are the best men for Governor and for the Senate that I am for them.', 'First, for your candidate for Governor, I appointed him as the General Counsel of the Treasury Department. I watched him working there for over a year in that very important department. I know that this is a man who had responsibility in the field of taxes, who knows what a dollar means, and who will do what needs to be done by the Governor of a great State, who will see that he will cut the spending so that your taxes are not going to go up in the State of Texas.', 'Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, I urge you, consider him as a man, a strong man, a qualified man, an experienced man, and one who can be a great Governor of a very great State.', 'Now I turn to the national scene. Here, I unqualifiedly, of course, endorse Jim Collins, Bob Price, our candidates for the Congress--Frank Crowley. I endorse them because we need the assistance in the House and in the Senate of men who will work with us on those great issues that I am going to describe.', 'I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about George Bush. I spoke for him before. I remember that election many years ago--1964. It was a hard year. George ran hard. He lost. But he came back. And you remember he was elected to the Congress in 1966. I have watched him in those 4 years, and what I have seen is that a man who came there 4 years ago has become a very big and strong man in the Congress of the United States. His is a voice that is heard in the House of Representatives because of the quality of the man, because of the honesty of the man, because of his integrity.', 'His voice will be heard in the United States Senate, and I can assure you it will be heard and paid attention to in the White House. George Bush and John Tower will make a very great team in the United States Senate--young men, experienced men, speaking for Texas, speaking for America.', ""I don't suggest that when George Bush gets to the Senate that he is going to support the administration all the time any more than he has in the House. He is independent. He is independent like most Texans, I can assure you. I admire him for that. And when he believes that we are wrong, he will not support us."", 'But I do know that on the great issues that I am discussing here tonight, the ones that have counted, George Bush has stood firm and strong. We need him. I need him in the United States Senate, and I hope you are going to send him there so that we can have him there.', ""Now listen to the issues. Don't think in terms of being a Republican or a Democrat. Think of America, think of its future, think of our young people, what you want for this great country of ours."", 'And what you want first of all, of course, and what we all want, is peace-peace at home and peace abroad. And when we think of that, we think of the war in Vietnam and the record of this administration. I want to tell you about that.', 'What we have done is that after 5 years of men going into Vietnam, we have been bringing them home. We have brought them home by tens of thousands.', 'What we have done is that by our strong action in Cambodia, we have reduced our casualties to the lowest in 4 1/2 years. And what we have done is to offer a peace plan for a cease-fire, a negotiated settlement, and exchange of prisoners.', 'My friends, we are ending the war in Vietnam, but the important thing is how we are ending it. You see, the difficult problem is not ending a war. The difficult problem is ending it in a way that you can win the peace.', ""Look back over the history of this country. If you haven't lived as long as I have, you have studied it. The United States has been in four wars in this century. We ended World War I. You will remember that was the war that was going to end wars. And yet, before a generation was over we were in another war, World War II. We ended World War II. That was a war that was going to be the last."", 'The United Nations came along. And within a few years, we were in Korea. We ended that war, and then came Vietnam.', 'You look over the whole century and what do you find: that we have yet to have in this century a full generation of peace for the American people. I think we can do better. That is why our policies will end the war in Vietnam, but end it in a way that will discourage those that would start another war and will win that generation of peace that we want for all Americans.', 'This is not a partisan issue. I can assure you that when I was talking tonight to former President Johnson on the phone, I told him that I knew that he tried, just as I am trying, to bring peace to this country.', 'The problem is doing it and doing it in a responsible way.', 'And again I come back to our candidates. Here are men, George Bush, John Tower, our candidates, who understand this issue, who will be responsible, and this is why--one reason--I urge your support.', ""Now I come to another point. This is the problem of peace at home. This is something that you usually wouldn't think would be discussed in an American campaign. But it had to be discussed in 1968. You will recall what the figures were. You remember that over the period of 1960 to 1968, crime went up 150 percent in this country, and we saw a growth in the use of drugs and narcotics. We found, also, that there didn't seem to be a program that would stop it."", 'I pledged in that campaign that I would ask for new strong laws, that I would appoint new strong judges, that I would put in a strong Attorney General, and that I would see to it, if I got support from the Congress, that the wave of crime did not become the wave of the future in America. And we are going to do that with your help and your support.', 'We are succeeding in that program. The Congress has not come along as fast as we would have liked, but I can assure you that pledge will be kept, and it must be kept so that our young people, all of our people, can have the feeling that there is going to be respect for law and justice and order in this country, something that we must have if we are going to be able to stand for law and order in the world.', 'A third promise that I made in the campaign had to do with another problem that concerns every American family. And that is how you balance your family budget. You know how prices have been going up.', 'You remember that when we came into office they had been going up for the past 3 years. And you will recall that I said that we had to get at the heart of the problem, that we had to recognize that when your Government in Washington spends billions of dollars more than it takes in in taxes year after year, inevitably that means that it raises prices for all of the people.', 'That is wrong, and that is why I have stood firmly for a program that allocates those monies and asks for the monies that are necessary and the funds for the programs that we need, but that will cut the Federal budget where we can so that we can take the pressure off of prices.', 'Let us put it this way: Unless we cut the Federal budget, you are not going to be able to balance the family budget, and we need support on that proposition.', 'It goes beyond that. It goes to all of our economic policies. We have found that in this country too often we have sometimes enjoyed prosperity in wartime, and too often we have not had full employment without war in a period of peace.', 'The objective of this administration, and I believe we can have it--I think we are on the right road; I think we are making progress is to have the transition from war to peace--and a million men have been let out of the armed services, and from defense plants, as a result of the wind down in Vietnam--to have that transition so that young Americans, all Americans, can have what we really want.', ""Let's have prosperity without war, and progress without inflation. That is what we want, and that is what you can help us achieve."", ""Now let's look to the future in terms of progress for America. Every American, Democrat and Republican, is for progress. The question that I found when I came into office was this: I found huge Government programs for very good causes, billions for education, billions for health, billions for welfare."", 'And all of us who have a feeling about our fellow citizens want to see that programs are adequate to take care of those who are in need, and to see that all Americans have an opportunity to move up, to have the chance that all of us would want to have, the chance to realize the American dream.', ""However, I determined then that we had to examine the programs, because I found that in program after program we were putting billions of dollars into old programs, and they weren't working. It doesn't make sense to put good money into bad programs because you end up with bad programs and bad money both. And so we started to change it."", 'The way we have Changed it? I can use as an example: First, I determined it was time to have a different approach to the whole relationship between the States and the Federal Government.', 'To all of you young people, again, I know you study American history and you are very interested in politics. And you will remember that in the early days of this Republic we used to talk about States rights and States responsibilities. And for 190 years we have seen those rights and those responsibilities go down and down. Power has flown from the people and from the States and from the cities to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., until ,it is concentrated there, an enormous amount of power.', 'And now I think after 190 years of power going from the people and from the States to Washington, it is time to turn it around and have the power come back to the States and back to the people of Texas and all of the other States of this Nation.', ""But it isn't enough to say the States have the responsibility unless the States have the funds. And that is why we have the revolutionary program, one of revenue sharing, in which the revenues that the Federal Government collects will be shared with the States so that the States will make the decisions; the Texans will make decisions about Texans rather than Washingtonians making them about Texas."", 'This, I think, is the proposal that we support.', 'George Bush supports this proposition. John Tower supports it. Paul Eggers helped to develop it in his position as Counsel for the Treasury Department. He will be a great Governor to handle those responsibilities when that power does come to the State of Texas, and the funds to deal with it.', 'There are many other programs that I could discuss, but one in particular, I think, needs to be discussed very frankly, very honestly, because I understand it has become an issue in this campaign.', 'That is the question of our welfare program. I want to tell you why I made some recommendations about changing it. This is what I found when I came into office: I found that welfare costs in this country were going up and up and up. The number of people on the welfare rolls just went up and nothing was being done to stop the increase both in the numbers and the costs of welfare. And it was breaking cities and counties and States, and also even the Federal Government was having enormous responsibilities to meet the cost.', 'So, I decided something had to be done about it. And I took the city of New York as an example. Did you know--listen to this---New York City in 1966, just 4 years ago, had 600,000 people on welfare. Four years later, New York City had 1,200,000 people on welfare--double.', 'I will tell you what is wrong with it. The difficulty is that in that same period of time in the city of New York, the great newspapers there had want ads, pages after pages, offering work for people, and no takers.', 'I say to you that when a program makes it more--as far as an individual is concerned-where it rewards a man for not working rather than rewarding him for working, when it, in effect, gives him an incentive not to work rather than to work, when it gives him an incentive to desert his family rather than to stay with his family, it is time to get rid of that program and to get another one in its place.', 'So, we have offered a reform, a reform that will provide, as it should in this rich country, for those families in need, without the degradation of welfare. But, on the other hand, one that will have a work requirement and a work incentive. Everybody in this great audience wants to see to it that any family in this country, and particularly children, do have an adequate income, because this country should be able to afford that if they need it.', 'But, my friends, I say also that when a man is able to work, when he is trained for a job, when he is offered a job and refuses to work, that man should not be paid to loaf by a hard-working taxpayer in the United States of America.', 'I have outlined these programs for you to give you a broad sweep of what we have been trying to do, to bring real peace for a generation abroad, to restore peace, respect for law at home; a program of progress for Americans, progress without inflation; a program in which we can have real prosperity, prosperity without war; and a program of reform of the institutions of government in which government comes back to the people where it belongs and to the States, and in which we reform those institutions that are draining from the American people funds that could better be used for other purposes.', 'This can happen in America. This is what we stand for in this administration, and I say to you that these principles that I have outlined tonight--and think back to what I said a moment ago--they are not Republican; they are not Democrat; they are what are best for America, and George Bush stands for those things and for what is best for America.', 'I would not want the opportunity to pass while I was here in Texas before this great audience, and particularly with so many young people in the audience, both here and in the other hall and outside, without giving you an impression of what I have seen in the country in these past few weeks as from time to time I have visited States all over this Nation. It is a very different impression than you see night after night on that television screen. It is a very different impression than you may see, even, when you see coverage of rallies that we have had.', 'For example, on the television screen, if you saw what happened in Florida when we were there, you would have seen a few hundred over on the side trying to shout down the President of the United States with four-letter words, trying to engage in that kind of conduct which I think many Americans have grave questions about.', 'So, you get an impression as you see that. One night you see a bombing or a burning--a bank, 2 days ago, 10 miles from my home in California, near the University of California at Irvine campus, burned senselessly, no reason at all.', 'You see violence. You hear hecklers, not there for the purpose simply of trying to learn but trying to shout down a speaker, the President, anybody else who happens to come. And the impression is created, when you see that, that the violent few are really a majority of American youth and that they are probably the leaders of the future of this country.', 'Well, I have a different view. I have been around this country. I have talked to students. I have seen them at meetings in great numbers. And I can tell you that the violent few that you see on your TV screens, they are not a majority of American youth today, and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""I want to tell you what I think about American youth. I believe in them. I have faith in the young people. It is an idealistic young generation. They care-they care about peace in the world, and they care about it at home. They care about those who don't have the chance that they have. They want this country to be a better country. They aren't satisfied with things as they are. And that is what we want from our younger generation. We don't want them simply to ape what we have done and what we have said."", ""That is to their credit. They are going to be great leaders of this country. But also America's youth, the great majority, recognize that the greatness of America is that for over 190 years, we have had a lot of changes in this country, and that in a country that provides a method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence and violent change."", 'To the young people, I want to say something to you--just to you, if I could for a moment:', ""Sometimes you must wonder about your country. You hear about how we are not liked abroad, that our foreign policy is a Fascist policy or an imperialist policy. You have seen the signs. You hear about the situations at home in the United States, about all the things that are wrong, the fact that the air isn't clean and the water is poison, and that our system is one that has grave inequities in it, and that the United States of America should be held up to scorn to other nations of the world."", ""Let me tell you what the truth is. There are some things wrong about this country. We make mistakes abroad; we make them at home. But as we look at the things that are wrong, and we should look at them and we should correct them, let's also stand up and talk about what is right about the United States of America."", 'I will tell you what is right. As I traveled through other countries, I was very proud of the fact that whether it was in a Communist country, Yugoslavia or Romania, or in a non-Communist country, hundreds of thousands of people came out to cheer for the President of the United States.', ""Why? Because they know that while the United States is the strongest nation in the world, to our credit, they have nothing to fear from the United States. We keep our strength not for the purpose of destroying freedom but for the purpose of defending it. We will not use it to break the peace, only to keep the peace. Let's be proud of that."", 'Here at home, you look over this great country of ours and why is it that people abroad, as they look at America, why is it that the traffic is all one way, coming here? I will tell you why. Because they know that this country is rich, yes, and that it is strong, but also that in America there is more freedom, there is more opportunity, there is more progress than in any nation in the world. There is no country in the world, for example, where the President or the leader of that country could do what I have been able to do-to offer to the American people programs in education, programs in health, programs of care for those that are in need, on the massive basis, and be believed.', 'But because America is rich, because America has produced what it has, we are able now to offer a better life to Americans than any people have ever enjoyed in the history of the world.', 'So, as you consider those things that are wrong, I repeat: Remember, what is right about America is that we have the ability to correct what is wrong. We have the idealism to do it.', 'I simply leave this final message with you: My friends in Texas, all over this great State, I have never been prouder of the United States of America than as I have traveled abroad and as I have traveled in this country. This is a great country. We are part of a very great people, and we share a great future. And one of the proofs of that greatness is what is going to happen on November 3d.', ""I don't mean all of you are going to vote the way I want you to vote, but you are going to vote and you are going to make a decision. I have been often asked: What is the answer to those that try to shout you down in a meeting? Do you shout back? What is the answer to the violent few?"", ""No, you don't shout back. The thing to do is simply this: To those who try to shout down, to those that engage in violence, it is just time for the great silent majority of America to stand up and be counted; and the way you can stand up and be counted is with the strongest weapon ever given to a free man--the right to vote."", ""So, I say vote on November 3d, vote for the candidate of your choice. If you ask my advice, and even if you don't ask for it, I can say I believe that the election of your candidates, the men that I have mentioned here tonight, the election of Paul Eggers as Governor, the election of George Bush as United States Senator, will be good for Texas. I know it will be good for America, and I am convinced it will be good for you."", 'Thank you.']"
28,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1970","['Governor Tiemann, Senator Curtis, Senator Hruska, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and all of our great friends here in Nebraska:', ""As I move across the country today from Illinois to California, where I will speak later this afternoon, and stop at Nebraska, I know how much you realize this welcome means to me. Here in the middle of the afternoon, at 4 o'clock, to find this great hall, where I have spoken before, the Ak-sar-ben auditorium, completely jammed, to find thousands outside, to realize that you have taken off from your jobs--many of you--to be here, to realize that you have waited, and then to get such a warm reception, makes me realize how much I owe to this State."", 'I am proud of the fact that in 1952, when I was on the ticket, in 1956, when I was on the ticket, in 1960 and 1968, Nebraska was the best Nixon State in America, and I thank you very much for that.', ""I wish to express my appreciation, too, to the University of Nebraska at Omaha Band back there. Let's give them a hand, in the back."", 'Toward the conclusion of my remarks, I have a special message for some of the young people who are here today and their parents, but I particularly wanted to take note of that wonderful musical organization that is here.', 'And since I have mentioned universities, I understand from a little bit of polling that I have done around here, that there is a holiday in the schools. I found I have never seen children so delighted. I said, ""What happened? School is out?"" They said, ""Oh, no, the teachers are in a convention."" We welcome all the teachers who are here today from all over Nebraska.', 'My wife, Pat, as you know, was a high school teacher. In other words, she subsidized me while I was trying to practice law before going into the Navy. And many teachers do that, or did in those days, at least. And my daughter, Julie, who is married to David Eisenhower, who is now in the Navy, is studying to be a teacher.', 'So, we have a very special place in our hearts for those who are in this profession which is so important to the future of our country. I am glad that you are here, so many of you. I wanted to pay my respects to you.', 'Also, as I speak of education generally, some of you are aware of the fact that I am somewhat of a football nut. I understand I have a lot of company here in this State.', 'You know, my wife went to the University of Southern California. I recall in that first game of the season that the Trojans, who were rated one of the top teams in the country, and Nebraska went out there, I asked Nobby [Governor Norbert T. Tiemann] what happened and he said they tied them 21 to 21, ""but,"" he said, ""we should have won by two touchdowns.""', 'Then I asked Nobby, ""You know, I may be in Florida, and I would probably go to the Orange Bowl if Nebraska came."" I said, ""Which bowl is Nebraska going to?""', 'He said, ""Nebraska wants to go to the bowl where they play the number one team, whichever one it is. They are going to be number one.""', 'I would like, particularly since I am in Nebraska, to go a little bit further and say that Nebraska is number one. I got into trouble last year trying that in Texas. I have already been in Texas. They think they are number one. I was in Ohio. Ohio State thinks it is going to be number one.', 'I am now in Nebraska. You think you are going to be number one. All that I can say is: While I am in Nebraska, Nebraska is number one. That is for sure.', 'Since I have been talking about football and champion teams, I am glad to be here on this platform with a group of very, very fine candidates. They are really champions in the great tradition of this State, a tradition of politics which goes back many, many years, and many, many good men, good men in both parties.', 'I particularly want to pay my respects to those in the congressional delegation and those who are going to be in the congressional delegation. I want to express appreciation for the years of service that Glenn Cunningham has rendered to this State of Nebraska, and I want to thank him particularly when, having not succeeded in the primary, instead of sulking, he is getting in there pitching. That is the fine team spirit that we like in anybody who is in political life.', 'And to Charley Thone, the candidate in the first district, I remember what a great help he was in that 1960 campaign, when we rolled up that huge majority, and John McCollister in the second district. These, with Dave Martin, give Nebraska a three-man delegation in the House that will be one of the best in the country.', 'We are for them all and I hope you will support them all.', 'All of you are aware of the fact that I have a very high regard for your Governor. I remember when he first ran--this new face in the national political scene-a man who brought some new ideas to State government, a man who recognized that it was not possible simply to talk about States rights without also talking about States responsibilities, a man who looked to the future of this State in terms of doing what was necessary for better education, for progress in all fields.', 'I want you to know that as I have looked at his record and as I consider the kind of leadership he can give to Nebraska in the future, that Nobby Tiemann is a man who, among his fellow Governors, is rated as one of the best. I think you consider him one of the best. That is why I believe he deserves his reelection as Governor of the State of Nebraska.', ""Now, I come to the Senate races, to the national campaigns generally. When I speak of the Senate race, I realize that talking about Roman Hruska is, in Omaha, something that is not considered to be necessary in terms of getting any votes that he didn't already have."", 'I remember when I spoke for Roman Hruska, or with him, in a campaign years ago, I said, ""Roman Hruska is a man you can count on."" I simply think that you here in Nebraska should know that in the almost e years that I have had the high honor to serve as President of the United States, there has not been a man in the United States Senate who was more strong, more sound, more courageous, more dependable than Roman Hruska of Nebraska.', 'And with his colleague, Carl Curtis, they make a great team, the kind of a team that Nebraska likes to be proud of, and you can be proud of them in Washington, D.C.', 'And may I say that in this respect for all of you now if, for the next few moments, we might think of the national issues where I have a primary responsibility. I would like to discuss them, discuss them in terms of these fine candidates for the House, the candidates for the Senate, and to the extent that those issues do affect State government, as is the case with one or two. Think of them in terms of your candidates for Governor and State office.', 'I remember when I spoke in Nebraska in the 1968 campaign. I remember the big crowds. I remember what you responded to. It was the same here as it was all over the country.', 'The major issue in 1968, the major concern that Nebraskans were worried about, just as other Americans were worried about, was about how could we bring peace to the world. And I pledged in that campaign that I would work, as President of the United States, to bring peace, lasting peace, to the world.', 'I want to report to you. I want to give you a report on my stewardship as President of the United States on that vitally important first responsibility of whoever is President of this country.', 'When I came into office, this is what I found: There were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring them home. Our casualties were 300 a week; they were going up. There were no plans that would bring them down. There was no peace plan on the conference table, and no plans as far as we knew to submit one. And so, we went to work.', 'We have had some success. We are moving along. We have put into effect a plan to bring an end to the war and to win a just peace. Instead of men going to Vietnam, which had been the case for 5 years before we got in, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and more of them will be coming home in the months ahead. Instead of our casualties going up, they have been coming steadily down, until, as you have noted, if you saw your papers yesterday, they are the lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they will continue to go down.', 'And finally, we have been able to submit at the peace table a comprehensive proposal in which we have offered a cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners, a negotiated political settlement in which all people in South Vietnam will have the chance to participate in the political process, and we will abide by the result. This is what America has done and this is what we have offered.', 'We are bringing the war to an end. And now comes the critical question.', 'I know it is on the minds of many people, people who may support our general goal of peace, but wonder why not sooner, why not now, why not just bring the boys home right away.', 'That would be very, very easy, particularly for whoever was Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, as I am.', 'But the problem, you see, my friends, is not to end the war. Look back over the history of this country. I was born in the year 1913, and in my lifetime, we have had four wars. In this century, as a matter of fact, there have been four wars. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. And yet, we have yet to have in this century a full generation of peace.', 'So I determined, when I became President of the United States, that we would end this war, but we would end it in a way that would discourage those who might start another war so that we could win our objective of a full generation of peace for Americans. That is what we are working for and that is what we are getting support for.', 'It goes beyond that. It requires a strong America because the strength of America is essential--- essential if those who might engage in war will be discouraged from doing so. And that is why the strength of America is so important if we are to have this full generation of peace.', 'I will simply say this: We are on the road to that great objective. I believe it can be achieved. I think the chances that America can have a full generation of peace are better now than at any time since the end of World War II.', 'That is why across this country I am asking support for those men like Roman Hruska, like those who are candidates for the House of Representatives here in this State, who will support the President in trying to win a just peace, a generation of peace for young Americans and for all Americans.', 'As we end a war, we confront problems, and among those problems is the transition from a war economy to a peacetime economy.', 'One of the problems since World War II has been that the United States has found it difficult to have full employment without war.', 'I think what the American people want is prosperity without war, full employment without war. That is what we are working toward and we are on the road to doing that.', 'A million men have been let out of the armed services or out of defense plants as a result of the wind down of the war in Vietnam and other policies.', 'We are making the transition of moving those people into not wartime but to peacetime-related activities. This will rake some time, but it is something which I think the American people want to have happen. We are going to make it happen.', 'And also moving in that direction we have another problem that I know all of you are concerned about. That is the problem of rising prices. You recall in 1968, I talked about that, too, the fact that prices seemed to go up and up, and there seemed to be no program to stop it. So we looked at the cause and what we found was that in the years before we came into office our Government in Washington had spent $50 billion more than it took in in taxes, with the result that there was a pressure on the rise in prices for every family budget in America. So we have gone after that problem.', 'Let me be very precise on this question. There are lots of things Government should do. We should appropriate money for the needs, the needs of education, the needs of health, the needs in all this country that we have.', ""But we also must bear in mind this: that when you have a kind of spending that goes so far that it may benefit some people but raise prices and taxes for all people, then let's cut that Federal budget so that we do not raise and destroy the family budget of millions of Americans."", ""A third problem that I discussed when I was here in Nebraska was the problem of peace at home. It is a problem which is not limited to this State; it is all over the country. It isn't limited to our cities; it is even in some of our smaller towns. It is the fact that in the 8 years before we came into office, crime went up 158 percent in this country, and we looked at the causes of that crime."", ""One of the causes was that we didn't have strong enough law enforcement officials; we didn't have strong enough laws; we didn't have, in my opinion, strong enough judges in many areas-judges who, as far as their records were concerned, clearly realized that it was important to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. So we went to work."", 'We went to work in several areas. I appointed a strong Attorney General of the United States. We strengthened the law enforcement officials at the Federal level. We have appointed strong men as U.S. attorneys across this country at the Federal level.', 'We have strengthened the LEAA [Law Enforcement Assistance Administration] program in which we have, of course, a program in which the Federal Government helps the States and the counties and the communities in their law enforcement programs.', 'And then in addition to that, I went to the Congress 18 months ago, and I submitted a comprehensive proposal to deal with organized crime, to deal with the problem of narcotics and drugs, which not only is damaging people in our big cities, but particularly young people in not just the poorer families, which is the usual mythology that you hear, but even among other families throughout this country. We had to do something about it.', 'I submitted this comprehensive proposal to the Congress 18 months ago and it took 18 months to get the first bill on my desk to sign just a couple of weeks ago.', 'That isn\'t fast enough, but I do want you to know this: If there is one man in that Senate and one man in that House who should be known as ""Mr. Law Enforcement,"" it is Roman Hruska of Nebraska.', 'His has been a powerful voice for law, for order, for justice in the United States. And that is another reason why I am glad that he is going to win, and win big again in Nebraska this year.', 'Then we come to another area. I recognized that in 1968 it was essential that we examine everything this Government had been doing over previous years to see whether we were putting too much money into bad programs.', ""We found that that was the case. It isn't just enough to be for education and for better housing and for better welfare and the like. What you have to find out is to see whether or not the programs you have inherited are doing the job. If they are not doing the job, you need to reform them."", 'So we have embarked on a program of reform for America, reform that covers the whole gamut of all of our problems: a new program in the field of housing, a new program in the field of education, a new program in the field of welfare.', 'Let me touch upon that just briefly in terms of what we are trying to achieve in that area, because there has been some lack of understanding in this field.', ""First, let us recognize why we had to change the present welfare system. It isn't because we wanted to do anything that would be damaging to people who needed help. But look at what had happened."", 'I looked at the figures in New York City. Do you know what I found? Between 1966 and 1970, here is what happened: There were 600,000 receiving welfare--600,000 receiving welfare--in New York City, one city, in 1966. There were 1,200,000 in 1970. The cost went up. The number on the rolls went up. And yet, jobs, help wanted ads, went begging.', 'I determined right then and there that it was necessary to get a new approach to welfare because I say to you that when a program, any program, makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when it encourages him to desert his family rather than stay with his family, it is time to get rid of that program and get another one in its place.', 'That is why we are asking the Congress to consider a new program which will provide a floor of dignity for all families that need it--that is what we can do and what we should do in this very rich and good country of ours---but on the other hand, which has a work requirement and a work incentive. Because if a man is able to work and if a man is trained for a job, and then if he refuses to work, he should not be paid to loaf by a hardworking taxpayer anyplace in this country.', 'Other programs could be mentioned, particularly in the field of the environment, where we finally are recognizing that we must leave to our children the heritage that we had, of a beautiful country, not with the air unfit to breathe, the water unfit to drink, and with all the problems of our open spaces being destroyed.', ""What we must recognize is that if we don't deal with that problem now, it will be too late to deal with it later."", 'That is why we have submitted a massive program in this field. That is why we appreciate the cooperation we have had from Nobby Tiemann and other Governors, forward-looking ones at the State level.', 'That is why we have submitted a new program in terms of the relation of the Federal Government to the States. It is called revenue sharing.', 'I will tell you what it is really about. We have found that for 190 years, power, money, has flown from the people and from the States to Washington, D.C., and it is concentrated there.', 'And after 190 years, I decided that it was time for power to flow from Washington back to the States and back to the cities, power to the people of the United States. So we will share the revenues if the Congress gives us that approval.', 'That is why your election of a Governor is so important, because if the revenues are going to be shared with the States, we must have State Governors who will have the foresight, the farsightedness to use those revenues and use them effectively for the benefit of the people of the State.', 'I have touched briefly these issues to give you an indication of what we are trying to do: to bring peace, lasting peace abroad, peace for a generation, to bring peace at home, peace with law and order and justice and safety for our citizens, a program of reform of our institutions of Government.', 'All of these things I am sure we want, and we want that with progress and prosperity without war and without inflation. We have made some progress, but a President, as powerful as he is, needs the help of a Congress, of the House and the Senate, to do a job. That is why I am talking in Nebraska.', 'That is why I am glad to find we are going to have that kind of help from the people of Nebraska and their Senators and their Congressmen from this State.', 'Now one closing word. I am delighted to see, as I mentioned earlier, such a great number of young people here. And I am also delighted to see a lot of your parents here. I want to say a word to the parents first and then perhaps a word to the young people.', ""I think that young America has been getting a bad rap. I want to tell you why. Night after night on that television, what you will see is a minority of young Americans. You will see a bombing here, a burning, for example, of a bank, 10 miles from my home in California, near one of the University of California campuses. Or you will see, in some places it doesn't happen here, but in most places where I appear hecklers trying to shout down the President of the United States, four-letter words, what have you, and that sort of thing."", 'You see them shouting, some of them engaging in violence, night after night.', 'The impression is created that that is a majority of young Americans. Now, I have traveled across this country. I have been in Ohio, I have been in California, I have been in the East and the West and the North and the South. And I have seen young people by the thousands and the tens of thousands, I should say. I can tell you that that picture that you see of the radical few is inaccurate.', 'The idea that the radical few is a majority of young Americans today or that they will be the leaders of America tomorrow is not true. They are not the majority and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""I will tell you what young America is. Oh, young America isn't satisfied with the way things are, and they should never be. Young Americans want change, and they should always want it."", ""It is to the great credit of the younger generation that they care--they care about people that don't have the equal chance that they have."", ""That is the kind of a system we want. Because we can't fulfill the American dream until every American has a chance, an equal chance, to fulfill his own dream. All of this is good to report about young Americans today."", ""But, also, they know that in the history of this country, the glory of it is that we have a system that provides a method for peaceful change. And when you have a method peacefully to change a system, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence. For that reason, let's keep our faith in our young Americans."", ""And may I say to them, to young America: Don't you lose your faith in America. I know sometimes you get an impression from the columns, maybe again from television, radio, and so forth, that the United States is an imperialist power engaged in Fascist activities--oh, I have seen some of the signs and this and that--and hear in this country that everything has become rather a sick society."", 'Well, that is a distorted picture, too. I know. I have had the great privilege, as President of this country, to travel abroad, to visit countries in Asia, in Europe, all over this word. And hundreds of thousands of people in Communist countries-350,000 the other day in Yugoslavia, stood in the rain for a hours to cheer the President of the United States in Spain, in Ireland, in Italy, every place.', 'Why does this happen? It happens because they know that the United States is the strongest nation in the world, but they also know that the United States, in this century, has never started a war; that we have never used our strength to break the peace; that the United States will use its strength not to destroy freedom but to defend it, not to break the peace but to keep the peace.', ""In other words, people abroad know what we in the United States should be proud of: that our strength is for the purpose of keeping the peace and not breaking the peace. Let's stand up and be proud of it."", 'And there is something else you should know about this country. Oh, there are a lot of things wrong. There are too many people that are poor. There are too many inequities. The air and the water is polluted in some places, and we have got to do something about it.', 'But never forget this: In the United States of America, there is more freedom; there is more opportunity; there is more progress than in any country in the world. And only in the United States of America could the President of the United States offer to the country a program which would provide a floor for families in need, which is higher than the ceiling than three-fourths of the world could ever hope to achieve. That is what the United States of America is.', 'So, I say to you, we live in a great country. We are part of a great people. We share a great future. And the way that you can participate in that future on November 3d is to go to the polls, express your views. Naturally, I hope you express them in the way that I urge.', 'But the most important thing is to express them, because this great country is one that all Americans now should recognize in this time of trouble through which we have passed--we should recognize we are fortunate to be alive at this time. We are fortunate to be living in this the greatest country in the world, because what happens in America will determine whether peace and freedom survive in America and the world.', ""Let's be worthy of the challenge. I know the people of Nebraska will meet that challenge.""]"

Do you realize when you elect a man like that to the United States Senate you are electing a man who can serve for four terms?

I have been to Dallas, however, already. I have already been to Kansas City. But I am going to Los Angeles tomorrow.', ""All that I can say, based on the Vikings' record up to this point, it is good to be in the land of champions, and I am proud to be here with champion candidates."", ""I don't know who does the recruiting for the Vikings, but if they need anybody for that front four or for blocking, just go downtown. Those young people downtown are the strongest, most vigorous young people we have ever seen."", 'I also want you to know that I realize that in the middle of the day for so many of you to come is a sacrifice of your time.', ""I also am aware of the fact that we have some wonderful musical entertainment here. The Lourdes High School Band--which side are they on?--and the West Concord High School Band, on the right? Well, let's give them all a hand. And the Mayo High School Southtown Singers, are they here?"", 'For all of those who have come, thank you very much.', 'What I have to say today will be primarily directed to those in this audience who can vote on November 3d, but what I have to say also will be directed to you, those of you in these bands, most of whom are not yet old enough to vote, but most of whom will be thinking about your future and how this election might affect it.', 'I want to talk about the future of America as I see it today and as I base it on my travels around this country and around the world.', 'In talking about that future, I have already indicated how proud I am to be here on this platform with the candidates from the State of Minnesota. Naturally, your Congressman and all of his colleagues in the Congress Al Quie, John Zwach, Ancher Nelsen--they are a fine group.', 'The candidates that are running for the House of Representatives, one of the best teams I have seen around the country, I enthusiastically endorse them all.', ""And at the State level, I remember when Harold LeVander ran 4 years ago. I remember the polls indicated that he couldn't win. He did win and this election can be won this time in the State of Minnesota."", 'I am glad to see that Harold LeVander, who has made such an outstanding record as Governor of this State, has coming up in Doug Head a man who is in the great tradition of very great Minnesota Governors. I say that because, first, he is a young man with a great future ahead of him, a man who, as attorney general of this State, was recognized by his colleagues as the outstanding attorney general of the United States, which indicates that he knows something about law enforcement; he knows how to handle that difficult problem in a just and effective way; a man also who is an expert in the field of the environment in which Minnesotans, with this magnificent land of lakes that you have, are so proud of, and where you want action--action that we are going to take at the Federal level, supplemented by action at the State level.', ""As I look across this country, as I think of candidates for the governorship, I don't know of one who is better qualified, who has a better future and a better future for the State of Minnesota than Doug Head, your candidate for Governor in the State of Minnesota."", 'Bob Forsythe, Val Bjornson,2 the whole team, what a fine team. Again, I am proud to be here with them.', 'And now I come to the campaign for the United States Senate. I want to talk to you quite directly about this man, first, personally, then, what he means to Minnesota, and then, what he means to this Nation.', 'I am here in Minnesota because Clark MacGregor, in my opinion--and I have seen many men come to the Congress in the 24 years that I have watched Washington pretty close at hand-Clark MacGregor is one that ranks very high at the top among his colleagues and in the Nation. He is a man with brains. He is a man with courage. He is a man of great character. And also, he is a man who has enormous determination and that vision that is so essential for the future of America. He is a man that never looks back. He looks to the future.', ""At a time when Americans are examining our society, when they are looking at the old programs that have failed in the past, when they see how much we have wasted on those programs, no matter how good intentioned they are, they don't want to go back; they want to go forward."", 'It is because Clark MacGregor is a man of the future, a man that will carry you forward, that is why I am for him for the United States Senate in the State of Minnesota.', 'I come here to Minnesota not to speak against anybody, but for the candidates that I am supporting. I am for Clark MacGregor. I want you to be for him. I want you to be for him for the right reasons, not simply because he is a Republican and you may be a Republican; not simply because you like him and his family, his wife and his three charming daughters, because it is a fine family, as I like them; but because Clark MacGregor stands for something. He stands for something that America needs. It needs it very deeply. It needs it in the United States Senate. It needs his voice, a voice of the future, rather than a voice of the past. A man, and this is also important, who will stand with the President rather than against the President on the programs that the President was elected to carry out in 1968.', 'Most important, and this is true in Minnesota and all over this Nation, is the promise that I made in 1968 that I would work to bring peace to this Nation and to the world.', 'I want to report to you on that promise. I want to tell you why Clark MacGregor is, in my opinion, one who will give the support that we need to achieve that goal of a lasting peace.', 'When we came into office, here is what we found: 550,000 men in Vietnam, no plans to bring them home, casualties at 300 a week and going up, no plans to bring them down, no peace plan on the conference table in Paris.', 'I pledged we would do something about it, and I went to work. We have made some progress.', 'First, instead of men going to Vietnam, which was the case in the previous administration during that 5 years, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and more of them will be coming home.', 'Second, instead of American casualties going up, they are coming down, the lowest in 4½ years.', 'Look at your papers this morning and you will find that is the case.', 'Third, instead of America not having a peace program, we have offered a cease-fire; we have offered a political settlement; we have offered to negotiate without conditions in all of these areas. It is on the table.', 'Let me tell you where we stand right now. We are on the way to ending the war and winning a just peace in Vietnam.', 'And now comes the critical point at issue in virtually every campaign in this country.', ""The problem is not to end the war. Every President, every American, wants to end the war. No President, no American, wants to start a war. We don't want to see young Americans die anyplace in the world. But, you see, the problem is not to end the war. All of you who have studied history, the older people who have lived it, the younger people that have studied it, know that in this century we have been in four wars."", 'We ended World War I, you remember. That was the war to end wars. We ended World War II, and you remember the United Nations came and that was supposed to end wars. Then we ended the Korean war.', 'But did you realize that despite the fact we have been in three wars and ended three wars in this century we never yet have had a full generation of peace?', 'That is why what I am trying to do, and what I ask for support for is a program to end this war in a way that will discourage those that would start another war so that we can win a full generation of peace for Americans.', 'Clark MacGregor understands that. He will support it. As he has supported it in the House, he will support it in the Senate. He recognizes the necessity to make the hard decisions.', 'We must think not just of peace for the next election but peace for the next generation. It can be done.', 'And remember, too, that a strong America, one in which the President of the United States when he goes to the bargaining table with the Soviet Union or any other power negotiates from strength rather than weakness, is essential if we are going to have this generation of peace. And he stands for that strong America.', 'So if you want to help the present President of the United States in a goal that Americans want, not just Republicans or Democrats or this President, then I say Clark MacGregor is a man who is committed to that program. He is one I will count on. I need his support in the United States Senate.', 'We turn to the problems at home, and I can speak with the same feeling and the same conviction about Clark MacGregor because, again, I know his record over the years in the House and I know what he will do when he gets to the Senate.', ""First, let's look at the problem of the cost of living. Everybody is concerned about it. When we went in, we saw inflation, and so we tried to find out why. And we found that this country had been on a spending binge, a spending binge in which, during the previous 4 years, we had spent $40 billion more than we had taken in in taxes."", 'When you go on a spending binge you have a hangover, just like when you go on any other kind of a binge. And so how do you cure the hangover? By more spending? No. What you do is to cut the spending so that you can get rid of the hangover, and that is what we are trying to do in Washington, D.C., at the present time.', 'That does not mean that we do not stand firmly for programs, as we do, where the United States will commit itself to those expenditures that are necessary and appropriate for the better life that all Americans want.', 'But it does mean that every time a spending bill comes before us, a hard decision has to be made. Is this a bill that is going to benefit some people but is going to raise prices for all people? If it is, you have got to think of all the people and not just the special interest group.', 'Clark MacGregor is that kind of a man. That is why I am for him for the United States Senate.', ""There is another area that has been talked a lot about in this campaign--I will touch it only briefly because everybody agrees on this now, as we approach the election--and that is the fact that during the previous 8 years, before we came into office, this country had a rise in crime that was totally unacceptable to the American people. It was due to the fact that we didn't have strong enough laws. It was due to the fact that we did not have strong enough administration of those laws."", 'So we decided to change it. We came into office, so I asked for new laws. It took 18 months for the Congress to get the first one to my desk just 2 weeks ago.', 'Clark MacGregor, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, helped to get that law there. He understands it.', 'Let me say this: In this field, we are going to use the new laws that we asked for and that finally the Congress is beginning to give us, laws dealing with organized crime, laws providing more of an opportunity to handle the problems of street crime, laws which deal with the traffic in pornography and the situation with regard to dope and narcotics.', 'All of these areas are areas in which we have new laws. But what we need in the United States Senate is a voice of a man who is for the laws and will support the President in the strong stand that I believe the people of the United States want their President to take with regard to law enforcement, who will talk that way and vote that way, not just in election time when it is an issue, but all year round and through his public life. And that is Clark MacGregor.', 'I can pledge to you we are meeting this problem. We are making progress. We can make more if we get more help.', 'Then there comes another area, the whole area of government reform. And there is a critical difference in this State, a very honest difference of opinion between two men who have different philosophies. I understand that difference. I respect those who may differ with our position.', 'But I want to tell you what we found.', 'We found a lot of programs when we arrived in Washington, programs dealing with problems that all Americans want to deal with--education, health, housing, welfare. Now, you go around and take your own private poll and you will find everybody is for better education and better housing and better welfare for the American people.', ""But when you look back over the history of this country, what you will find, particularly over the past 8 years before we got into office, is we were pouring billions and billions of dollars into programs in this field, in which money was being wasted and we weren't making progress in solving the problem. So we have instituted an exciting and certainly a revolutionary program of reforming the institutions of government."", 'What we have very simply said: that it is time to quit putting good money into bad programs, because you end up with bad programs and bad money both. And that is why Clark MacGregor again is the man, the man of reform, the man of the future.', 'Whether it is in education, whether it is in the environment, whether it is in the field of health, whether, of course, it is in the field of welfare, he stands firmly.', 'Speaking for just a moment about the welfare problem, an excellent example of the problem: Everybody wants to see that no family in this country, particularly families with children, does not have some kind of an adequate income.', 'In this rich country it is possible that that can happen. But, you know, under our present welfare program what has happened.', 'Let me give you an idea about the city of New York. In the city of New York between 1966 and 1970, the welfare rolls went from 600, 000 to 1,200, 000. And the number of want ads in the major New York Sunday papers were hundreds and hundreds and, yes, thousands of ads with no takers, as far as jobs are concerned.', ""So our new program has two approaches: One, we provide a floor of dignity for families who need assistance without that kind of situation that we have in the present welfare program, which has a very bad effect on family morale. But we also provide work incentive and work requirement, because I will put it very simply: When a program, which is like the present welfare program, has the effect of making it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when a program has the effect of encouraging a man to desert his family rather than to stay with his family, let's get rid of it and get another program in its place."", 'That is why we say we will care for every family that needs it and without the degrading aspects of the present welfare program.', ""But if a man is able to work, if a man is trained for a job and if a man is offered a job and refuses to work, he shouldn't be paid to loaf by a hard-working taxpayer in the State of Minnesota or by any of the people of America."", 'I have talked about these four issues because I think they best indicate the problem: Honest men honestly disagreeing about what is best for America. I will simply indicate to you my own conviction in these concluding remarks.', 'We all know that when a President of the United States is elected he becomes President of all the people. He has responsibilities to all the people. And the President of the United States is a very powerful man--powerful because this country is rich and because it is strong.', 'But a President of the United States cannot use that power, he cannot work for the best interests of the people for his programs, unless he has support in the House and support in the Senate.', ""We have had some support. We haven't had enough. We need more. One man, one vote in that United States Senate, could make the difference as to whether or not we are going to have the kind of leadership that will bring a lasting peace rather than a temporary peace; that will bring prosperity and progress without war, which is something we haven't had for a long time; and that will bring, also, a reform of the institutions of government rather than pouring good money into the programs of the past."", 'My friends, Clark MacGregor is the one. He is the one we need. He is the one I am for. He is the one you should be for on November 3d.']"

I think that all of you inside the hangar should know that there are at least twice as many outside the hangar, and I understand, if they can hear on the public address system, I have delayed our flight to our next stop so that we can come out and say hello to you in just a few moments.', 'I particularly want to express appreciation to those that have been entertaining you before we got here. I understand we have a number of high school bands: the Gilford High School Band, the Jefferson High School Band, the Auburn High School Band, the East Rockford High School Band, the West Rockford High School Band. Any rally that will bring East Rockford and West Rockford together has got to be quite a rally, believe me.', 'As I speak here in this State, I wish first to say that I am very proud to be in the State in which the chief executive, Dick Ogilvie, has made an outstanding record, one of the finest Governors in this Nation. I look forward to working with him in the future, as I have in the past, for the better progress of this State and of this Nation.', 'I welcome the opportunity to endorse, not only the national candidates about whom I will be talking in a moment, but also the State ticket--men like Ray Page, who is one of the best commissioners of education in the whole United States. I am glad to endorse him here in Rockford. And, also, while he is not on the ticket this year, I wish to express my appreciation for the fact that we have in Illinois a team--a team in Governor Ogilvie and Senator Percy, all of the others working together, because they know, as I know, that Illinois is the key State in this Nation.', 'I want to talk about the role of Illinois. I want to talk about the role you can play and how important it is to you, to Illinois, and to America.', 'Now, all of you are aware of the fact that there used to be an old saying in politics that, ""As Maine goes, so goes the Nation."" That doesn\'t happen to be true now.', 'I think it could be said, however, as Illinois goes, so goes the Nation. In 1960, in a very close election, I did not carry Illinois.', 'In 1968, in another close election, I carried Illinois. That is why I am here as President of the United States today, because of the people of Rockford.', 'As I stand here in this city, in this airport, I remember the great welcomes we have had over the years past. I recall a meeting in the rain in 1956--you remember?---down in the armory, where people came by the thousands.', 'But when you come to the airport and stand like this, this means something is happening. It means in this strong area of the State people are thinking about the issues. They want to hear about them directly. They want to know what their votes mean. And I want to talk to you about that for just a moment.', 'First, in the United States Senate today, we have a contest in Illinois that will affect not only your Senator but will affect the votes in that Senate over the next 2 years.', 'In the past 2 years, in vote after vote, a change of one vote would have made the difference--one vote as to whether or not the President of the United States would either be backed or not be backed on his program for peace abroad, for a strong America, for peace at home.', 'And as I look back on that record, I realize that it is vitally important for the people of Illinois to know that in the United States Senate, the election of Ralph Smith means something, of course, to him--I believe it is in the best interests of the people of Illinois. But Ralph Smith may be the one that will make the difference. We need him in Washington, D.C.', 'Now let me describe how that one vote can affect you, how it can affect your family, your children, the future of this State, and the future of America.', 'In the campaign of 1968, I made some promises to the people of Illinois and to the people of America. I have been trying to keep those promises. We have made some progress and we are going to make Some more.', 'I can also tell you, however, that while the President of the United States, because of the wealth of this country and the strength of this country, is the strongest man, perhaps, in the world, in terms of power, the President of the United States cannot do it alone. He cannot do the job that the people of the United States elected him to do unless he has a Congress that will work with him rather than against him. And Ralph Smith will work with me and not against me for these great goals.', 'Your own Congressman John Anderson can tell you how it works. Week after week I meet with him as one of the leaders of our Congress, in the White House. And he will tell you that in week after week as we count the votes it is a question of one vote that will determine whether the President, not as an individual, but because he is trying to keep his promises to the people of America, the promises that the people elected him to carry out; whether he is going to have the support in the House and the Senate.', 'My friends, we have had some support. We have had not enough. But let me say the vote that we have in this case, of Ralph Smith, along with Chuck Percy, these are the votes that can make the difference on these issues.', 'First, above everything else, in 1968 I recognized that the American people wanted leadership that would end the war and bring us a lasting peace.', 'Look what we have done: We found 500,000 men in Vietnam with no plans to bring them back. And we have been bringing them home by the thousands and more of them will be coming home.', 'Second, instead of casualties going up at the rate of 300 a week, they are the lowest in 4½ years because of our strong action to deal with the problems in Vietnam.', 'Third, we have a peace plan on the conference table calling for a cease-fire, calling for a political settlement, calling for an exchange of prisoners.', 'Now let me come to the key point. I realize that there are those who disagree with our policies here. I realize that there are those--and in this Senate campaign you have a pretty good choice in this respect-who honestly believe that we should either bring the boys home now or 6 months or 12 months from now without regard to what happens.', 'Let me say ending the war is not the problem. America has ended three wars in this century. You know. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended Korea.', 'And we have yet to have a generation of peace. I just want to say to these young men that are calling ""Peace now"" out here, that our men in Vietnam are fighting in Vietnam for a lasting peace so that they won\'t have to fight in Vietnam, or someplace else in the future.', 'You see, I pledged to the American people that our goal will be to end this war in a way that will discourage the warmakers, to end this war, that will bring us what we have not had in this century: a generation of peace.', 'Now, that is something to be for, it is something Ralph Smith is for. We need him in the United States Senate to work for that policy. And I thank you for sending him there as you have, and as you will on November 3d.', ""I can give many other examples. Quickly, one that I discussed in the campaign of '68: We saw prices going up. I pointed out that we had to get at the cause of it."", 'One of the major causes of your prices going up at home for groceries, for clothing, and everything else, is that your Government has been spending far more in taxes over the past 10 years than it has been taking in, far more in expenditures than it has been taking in in taxes.', 'I pledged that we do something about that. It has required some hard decisions. But what we need, you see, are men in the House and men in the Senate who will have the courage to vote against a spending program, spending not their money but yours, that might benefit some of the people but that would raise prices for all the people. That is the kind of man that you have in Ralph Smith, and it is the kind of man that we need.', 'My friends, what we want, in other words, as we move from a wartime to a peacetime economy, as a million men have been let out of the armed services and out of defense work, what our goal is--and this is what we are working for and we are making progress toward is progress without inflation, and prosperity and full employment without war. That is something to be for. And it is something that we are accomplishing on behalf of the American people.', 'And that majority of one can make a difference in another area: I know that you are concerned not only about peace abroad but peace at home. I talked about that in 1968. I pointed to the fact that we have seen crime go up by 158 percent over the past 8 years before we came into office, and I said we would do something about it.', 'I pledged stronger judges. I pledged a stronger Attorney General. I pledged to submit new laws. I have done all those things.', 'We have made some progress, but it took the Congress 18 months to send the law down that I asked for 18 months ago to deal with organized crime, to deal with pornography, to deal with the problem of narcotics, and to deal with the problem of drugs.', 'My friends, let me say I pledged to the American people in 1968 that we would have the strong action to deal with the criminal elements in this country in a way that would see that the wave of crime is not the wave of the future in America.', 'I will keep that pledge. But in order to keep that pledge, my friends, I will tell you what I need: We need in the United States Senate a man like Ralph Smith who will not only vote for the laws that we need, but will speak for those laws and vote for them and speak for them, not just in election time, but all year around. He is that kind of a man, and that is why we need him there.', 'And then, of course, we need support for our programs of reform. Many of you are concerned, as I am, about our welfare program. I have found, for example, that in the city of New York, from 1966 to 1970, a period of 5 years, welfare rolls went up from 600,000 to 1,200,000.', 'And yet, in that same city, the want ads for help wanted--there were scores of pages in the Sunday papers week after week.', 'I want to tell you what we propose to do about that and where we need some help. I say that when a program, like the present welfare program, makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when it rewards him for deserting his family rather than to stay with his family, we ought to get rid of that program and get another one in its place.', ""I say that in this great, rich country-and I have submitted a program which will do this--we should provide for all of those who are in need. But, my friends, I say that if a man is able to work, and if he is trained for a job and then if he is offered a job and he refuses to work, he shouldn't be paid to loaf by a hard-working taxpayer in the State of Illinois or anyplace else in this country."", 'And now I would like to report to this audience, as I have to all of those in these last 2 days, as I have traveled from Florida and now on to California later in the day, about what I have found across America on an issue of great concern to you.', 'Over here are a lot of television cameras, and tonight you will have an opportunity, perhaps, to see this rally on television or parts of it. Over the past few months, you have seen on television, night after night after night, what purports to be young America. And you know what you have seen: a bombing here, or a building burned down, or people trying to shout down a speaker, some of them shouting obscenities, others engaging in discourtesies. And you get the impression that the radical few are a majority of young Americans or are the leaders of the future.', 'Just let me say this: The radical few in this country that you see on your television screen night after night, they are not a majority of young Americans, and they are not going to be the leaders of America in the future of this country.', ""And to the young Americans here, and particularly to your fathers and your mothers, I say I am proud of young America. I am proud of your idealism. I am proud of the fact that you want peace. I am proud of the fact that you care-care about the people that don't have as good a chance as you have."", 'But also, I am proud of the fact that the great majority of young Americans, while they want change, they recognize that in a system that provides for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies violence. That is the kind of young Americans we are proud of.', 'And to young Americans, may I bring you a message?', 'Sometimes you may get an impression that this is a sick country, that we have policies that are held up in disrespect in other nations of the world.', ""Don't you believe it. I have traveled to Communist countries in recent weeks, and to non-Communist countries. I have found that every place I go, hundreds of thousands of people come out to cheer the President of the United States. Why? Because they know that this country, the strongest in the world, does not threaten the peace; it does not threaten the freedom of any other country. They realize that a strong America is necessary if we are going to have peace in the world. You can be proud of that."", 'They also are aware that in America, whatever we may see of its faults, there is more freedom, there is more opportunity, there is more chance for progress than in any country in the history of the world.', ""So, I say to you today, let's look at what is wrong with America, let's correct it, but as we talk about what is wrong, let's stand up and speak up about what is right about the United States of America. It is time for the great silent majority. You can speak up. You don't have to speak out in obscenities. You don't have to try to shout down the other side."", 'I will tell you the way you speak. The most powerful weapon ever devised in a free nation--November 3d you go into a quiet place for a moment and you vote. You are the most powerful person in the world at that moment. Your vote can make the difference about that majority of one in the Senate. Your vote can make the difference as to whether the President of the United States in his efforts to bring lasting peace abroad, to bring peace at home, to have prosperity and progress without war--your vote will determine whether you are going to have, in the Senate, a man that is going to work with the President or against him.', 'I ask you, give me a man, Ralph Smith, who will work with the President for the good of America and the good of Illinois.', 'I wanted you to be sure to see Mrs. Smith, because the wives are the unsung heroines of this campaign. My wife, Pat, is not with me on this trip, because she is off campaigning in another State in the West and we will join up in California tonight. My daughter, Tricia, I think, is in New Jersey today. My daughter, Julie, is going to be in another State another day. They care a great deal, not just about their father, but about this country. And so does Mrs. Smith.']"
32,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1970","['We want to express appreciation to all of you for coming here and for waiting outside. Of course, it is a beautiful day. I remarked of the fact that the last time I was in Rockford it really rained pitchforks. But on this beautiful day to have so many of you here is most heartwarming and I am most grateful.', 'I am very proud to be here in the company of your Congressman, John Andersen, who is one of our leaders in the Congress.', 'I meet with him every week, of course, with the other legislative leaders. He is a great representative of this district at Rockford, and he is a fine Congressman working for the good of America in, of course, the leadership meetings that we have at the White House.', 'And, of course, I have already spoken about Ralph Smith, a man who has come to the Senate by appointment, a man who comes before the people of Illinois for election.', 'I think on his record he has demonstrated that he is the kind of a man that will do the job that the people of Illinois want done. He is an effective Senator. He is an honest Senator. Above all, he is one who has the courage to stand for those kinds of policies that are essential if we are going to have not just a temporary peace but a lasting peace; not just a situation where we have employment based on war, but prosperity and jobs without war.', 'That is what we want for America and that is what we are going to get.', 'Thank you.']"
33,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1970","['Governor Ogilvie, Senator Percy, Senator Smith, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and this very great audience here in Mount Prospect at Prospect High School:', ""In checking my notes, I find that I have a proud distinction today: the first President of the United States ever to visit Prospect, and I'm glad to be here."", 'I appreciate very much the warm welcome that we received. I remember the meeting in 1968. I recall something about ""Ooh-Aah"" then. And I had forgotten. Now I remember.', 'Thank you very much.', 'I want to express appreciation, I know all of you will, for all of those that have participated in the program. That marching hand from Prospect High School-how about a hand for them--the marching band from Elk Grove; the marching band from Hershey High School; and from Wheeling High School--that is one way to bring all these high school rivals together. They are all for each other today. Also, I am very proud to stand here today on this platform in the presence of a number of fine candidates. I am going to talk particularly about the candidate for the United States Senate. But I am also very happy to have here our candidates for the county offices and candidates for the Congress.', 'I have a special feeling about the man who is running for the office of county executive here--Joe Woods. He has been the sheriff of this county. He has been one whom I have known for many, many years.', 'All of you have known him and I have known him as a man who has a marvelous record in the field of law enforcement. But I know him, too, as a man--and this is the important thing--who has the respect of the men with whom he works. And he only gets that by being a good administrator. He is the kind of a man you need to run this county, Cook County.', 'I am very proud, too, to be here with the people whom I have worked with in Washington, D.C., some of whom are on em again. Send them to Washington and we will get the job done. This is your team, our team. Thank you.', 'I want to talk to you about this Senate race here in Illinois, both in terms of the State of Illinois, but also in terms of the Nation. The eyes of the Nation are on this State. It is a critical State. It is a State that makes the difference in a national campaign as to whether a man will be elected President or not be elected President. It is the State that this year could well make the difference as to whether we have in the United States Senate--and listen to this very carefully--a majority of one.', 'I am not referring to a majority of one in terms of who is going to be the majority leader or the minority leader, but a majority of one in terms of great issues that are beyond whether you are Republicans or Democrats, issues that involve our children, their future, your future, peace abroad, peace at home; the chance that all of us want to develop in this country what we have not had for many, many years: prosperity and progress, but without war and without inflation.', 'And in the United States Senate, we have a very closely divided situation. In vote after vote over these past 2 years, we have had men who honestly disagreed, but men who reached different conclusions from the programs that we have tried to implement from the national administration.', 'And in instance after instance, a change of one vote would have made the difference.', 'So, you are talking today not simply about another Senator from Illinois who will go down there to continue the fine team of Chuck Percy and Ralph Smith in the United States Senate, you are talking about the man, the one man, who might make the difference as to whether the President of the United States, who has the responsibility to carry out policies for all the people, will have people who will vote with him or will vote against him. on the great issues that you asked him to do something about.', 'We need Ralph Smith because he will be with us and not against us on those great issues. That is why I am here.', 'I do not suggest that we expect a United States Senator or United States Congressman to come to Washington and vote 100 percent for whatever the President says. I like a man who is independent. You have independent men from this State, and you have one in Ralph Smith.', 'But I am going to talk today about just four issues, four because, particularly with so many young people here, I know you study these things in your social studies and in your history classes and political science. To all of those who are voting age, it seems to me fight now, as I travel around the country, there are four great concerns the American people have.', 'Do you know what is interesting about it? I recall so well, just 2 years ago, speaking in this very hall. I remember the four things that I talked about. And interestingly enough, those four great issues that I talked about 2 years ago are the ones that people are concerned about today. They wanted action then. That is why I won the election in 1968. The people wanted action on those particular issues.', 'And what I am here to do is to try to get the support that we need, that I need, but particularly that the Nation needs, so that we will be able to carry out the pledges that I made right here in this hall, I made to the people of Illinois, I made to the people of America.', 'All of you will remember the first pledge. It had to do with a major concern of older Americans and younger Americans, all Americans, and people throughout the world, and that is: I pledged that I would work for lasting peace in the world. Here is what I found when I came into office.', 'I found that we had a war with 550,000 men in Vietnam, no plans to bring them home, casualties 300 a week, with casualties going up, no peace plan on the conference table.', 'I went to work. And what we did is that instead of sending men to Vietnam, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and we are going to continue to bring them home.', 'Instead of having the situation with our casualty list going up and up, they are the lowest in 4½ years, and they will continue to go down, because of the leadership we have provided. And we have a peace plan on the conference table, a peace plan that we were finally able to make because of the success of our other programs, a peace plan which offers a cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners, a political settlement, and a mutual withdrawal of forces.', 'Let me tell you where the situation is right now, today. The war in Vietnam is being brought to an end. It will bring peace in Vietnam, but the important thing is how we are bringing it to an end.', 'Here is where we have the difference, the difference between the various candidates throughout the country. We see it here in Illinois. We see it in many other States. It is a very simple one. There are those who say, ""End it now,"" or ""End it 6 months from now,"" or ""12 months from now."" ""Set a date. The most important thing is to end it, no matter how.""', 'Let me tell you, that would be the easiest thing I could do. After all, the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. I could simply order all the men home and everybody might have a sigh of relief and say, ""The war is over.""', 'Could I recount a little history for you? Look back over this century. I was born in 1913, and in my lifetime there have been four wars. There was World War I; we ended it. There was World War II; we ended it. There was the Korean war; we ended it.', 'But do you know, and I say this particularly to this younger generation, that in this whole century, we have not had a full generation of peace.', 'The problem is not to end the war. The problem is to end the war in a way that we discourage the warmakers so that we can have a generation of peace for Americans and that is what we are working for and that is what we are doing.', 'Your Senator, Ralph Smith, understands that issue. He has supported this administration on that issue. Because he understands it, because he supports us, it means that he has often provided what could be the majority of one. We need him. If we want that generation of peace, if the President is going to be able to carry out the pledge that he made to the American people, not just peace for the next election but peace for the next generation, we need a man like Ralph Smith in the United States Senate that will stand with him and not against him on this great issue.', ""After talking about foreign policy, let's come right close to home. I see a number of people here who will probably be out shopping a little later in the day, some of the ladies will. You are not going to like what you find as far as the prices are concerned. Prices seem to be going up. They were in 1968. You remember I talked about it here in 1968. I remember exactly what I said. I said that what we had been having over the past 8 years had been the situation where government was spending billions of dollars more than it was taking in in taxes, and that when a government spends more than it takes in in taxes year after year after year, $50 billion--that is the amount that was spent, more than we took in in taxes in the previous 8 years from 1961 to 1968--when that happens, the effect is to raise prices throughout the country."", 'That is one of the major causes of inflation. I said to the American people, I said to the people of Mount Prospect, to the people of Illinois, when we get to Washington, we are going to cut the Federal budgets where we can cut them, cut the Federal budget so that we can take the pressure off of prices.', 'So, we need help on this issue.', 'Let me tell you why it is vitally important. There are many programs that we need for the spending of Federal funds, and those programs I have asked for, those programs we will approve.', 'There are others, however, that go far beyond what we need, which involve runaway, irresponsible spending. Now, the big spenders think that they are going to be the big winners on November 3d. Well, they are going to be the big losers, because the people are tired of big spenders in Washington, D.C.', 'I say quite directly, if you want to stop the rise in your grocery bill, if you want to stop the rise in your clothing bill, if you want to stop the rise in prices, one of the major things you can do is to elect a man who has the courage, as Ralph Smith has, to go to Washington and, when he finds that he has to make a decision, will make the hard and courageous decision to vote against a spending program that might help some few people someplace in the country, but would raise prices for all people. He is that kind of a man. That kind of courage we need in the United States Senate. A majority of one could make the difference. There might be the one-- Ralph Smith, the one.', 'All over this country I have found that there has been an enormous interest in the problem not only of peace abroad but peace at home. Americans are concerned about that. I understand it. All of us understand it because we are a peaceful people, we are a law-abiding people. We are very proud of that tradition in this country.', 'Americans have been shocked by the fact that in the sixties, for example, crane went up 158 percent in this country: the use of drugs and narcotics, the flow of pornography and obscenity into the homes of our children, the fact that we find organized crime going up and up, and street crime, the fact that we needed action. I talked about it in 1968.', 'I pledged that I would do something about it. And we have done something about it.', 'First, we have gotten a strong Attorney General and we have backed him up, right up and down the line.', 'Second, I have appointed strong men to the judiciary up and down the line, men who will strengthen in their decisions the peace forces rather than weaken the peace forces as against the criminal forces.', 'Third, I have asked for legislation-now listen to what happened to this legislation. Eighteen months ago--Chuck Percy will bear me out, Bob McClory, who worked on this and contributed to it enormously in the House of Representatives, will bear me out--I submitted legislation to deal with organized crime, with pornography, with obscenity, with drugs and narcotics. And it stayed in the Congress. Nothing happened until just a few weeks ago, as we approached the election, the bills finally began to reach my desk, and I have signed them. It is better late than never.', 'But I say to you that we have to have a sense of urgency more than that. And what we need in the United States Senate is a man that will vote for the laws, who will also speak out on this subject very strongly, not just at election time but all year round. And Ralph Smith does that.', ""He is the kind of a man that stands firmly with us on this issue. Now, that is what we are going to do. We are going to see to it through our laws, through our courts, through every other device that we can legitimately use, that the wave of crime isn't going to be the wave of the future, the heritage for these young people whose fate is entrusted to us."", 'But, you know, there is something you can do, and I do not want to miss this opportunity to mention it. A couple of days ago in Kansas City I went to a hospital to visit two policemen. They were very brave men, rather young men; they were men who had been injured in a bomb blast when they were working in a very depressed area of the city and working in a very humanitarian cause in one of our major Federal programs, to try to bring better information to the people of that area with regard to respect for law, the decencies that make a society livable.', 'Yesterday, as we were driving in one of our motorcades in Florida, a motorcycle officer was hit by a truck. He fell off the motorcycle. It fell on top of him. I stopped the car; I went over to shake his hand. His arm was broken; his leg was broken. His head was bleeding.', 'I said, ""I am sorry that this happened."" Do you know what he said? ""Gee, I am sorry I spoiled your day. I am sorry I can\'t stand up and salute.""', ""Let me say something to you. Our law enforcement officials in this country have a hard job. It is a dangerous job. Sixty-six have been killed already this year, many of them in senseless murders and bombings. Hundreds have been injured. They aren't paid enough. Now, we may not be able to pay them enough and we may not be able to give them the laws that we need, but there is one thing that we can give the law enforcement officials and not just at election time. Let's give them the respect and the backing that law enforcement officials deserve in this country."", 'Then, finally, there are programs for progress--I have talked about here--it seems so long ago, 2 years ago--programs in which we would reform our government: a program of revenue sharing which Governor Ogilvie is so very much interested in, in which the revenues of the Federal Government will be shared with the States so that the States will be able to handle their problems here rather than having them handled from Washington, D.C., programs of welfare reform, programs of cleaning up the air and the water, the environment, so that these young people can have what we have, a beautiful America, and not have the air polluted and the water poisoned and all of the beautiful places destroyed.', 'These are all programs of reform that this administration stands for. They are programs that we have had support for from these men who are in the House.', 'We have had strong support from Chuck Percy. We have had strong support from Ralph Smith. There, again, we need Ralph Smith in the United States Senate so that we can, I can, not as an individual, but as a man who was elected President, who made certain promises to the American people, so that I can keep the promises that you elected me to keep. We can do that only with your help.', ""Let me say a word about the President. When you go back, they will ask you to write, many of you, a little theme, I suppose, about what the President talked about. And one of the things you read a lot about these days is the power of the President. I don't want to be self-effacing about that in a personal sense, but let me talk about the office for a moment."", 'The President of the United States, because we are the most powerful and the richest country in the world, is the most powerful man in the world. But the President of the United States, while he can do a great number of things with his power, cannot act effectively for his people, for the American people, to carry out the pledges that he makes to them unless he has help from the Congress, from the House and from the Senate. That is what this is all about. It is part of our system.', 'I respect the right of people who disagree with my policies. But, after all, I was elected in 1968, and I intend to keep my promises, and I need Ralph Smith in that Senate to help me keep my promises to the American people.', 'One note: With all of these young people here, and particularly, perhaps, I should say this to the older ones, I am so delighted to see you here. I have appreciated the way that you have listened.', ""I know that sometimes these days when you look at television night after night you see on that television screen a distorted picture of America. I don't blame the television people. After all, what is news is usually bad news rather than good news. That is what makes the news."", 'So we will have a rally with thousands and thousands of people, and there will be a few demonstrators out shouting four-letter words or trying to shout down a speaker, and they will show their picture on the television screen.', 'Or you will see rocks thrown, as was the case in Vermont, at the President of the United States, you will see their pictures on the television screen, or you will see a bomb thrown or a building burned.', 'So the violent few, the radical few, over and over again, they come across your television screen. So Americans get the impression that the radical few are either a majority of American youth or are going to be the leaders of the future.', 'Let me tell you something. I have been around this country. I have been to most of the major States, and I have seen lots of young people. I have seen some of the radical few.', 'But despite what you have seen on that television screen, despite what you have read in columns, and despite what you have seen in the newspapers, the radical few are not a majority of American youth today, and they are not going to be the leaders of America tomorrow.', 'American youth, to its great credit, is idealistic. It wants change; it wants peace in the world; it wants peace at home; it is not satisfied with the way things are. And that is the way young people should be, because that gives vitality and strength to our system.', ""But they also recognize that our country's glory is that it provides for peaceful change, and that when a system provides for peaceful change there is no cause that justifies resort to violence."", 'So I simply say to you, all of you here, on November the 3d you have a chance to speak out. People often ask me, ""How do you answer those that shout, try to shout down a speaker? How do you answer those that give a false impression of America?""', ""Don't try to answer them in kind. You don't have to. You can do it another way. The way you can answer them is by your votes on November 3d. That is the time, on November the 3d, that is the time when we are really going to see what America is like. That is the time when the great silent majority of America can stand up and be counted with their votes and stand up and be counted for America, for those programs that will build America, and for, in my opinion, a man like Ralph Smith and our congressional candidates here who will stand with the President of the United States so that he can carry out his promises to you and to the people of America.""]"

And I want you to know, too, that as I come to San Jose at the end of a rather long day of campaigning, as I have come across this country, it is good to be home in California, and to speak to my fellow Californians about this campaign of 1970, what it means to you, what it means to California, what it means to America, and what it means to the world.', 'Before going into that particularly, however, I do want to thank those that have participated in the program up to this time.', ""I didn't get a chance to hear it, but I know Johnny Grant 1 was here, and I know, too, that you have had some excellent musical entertainment: the Blue Saints Jazz Band--was it here tonight?

And right back of us the Cupertino High School Band that is going to be in the Rose Parade. Let's give them a hand."", 'We look forward to seeing them on television on January 1st.', 'Also, I understand there is some talk to the effect that perhaps the representative in the Rose Bowl this year may come from northern California.', 'As you know, I am somewhat of a football bug or nut or whatever you want to call it. But, in any event, I find that I can get into deep trouble when I am traveling as President of the United States all over this country.', 'I was in Texas yesterday, and all the Texans were telling me that Texas was number one. I was in Ohio the week before. And in Ohio, Ohio State is number one. I was in Indiana just last week, and there they told me Notre Dame is number one. And then today, when I was in Nebraska, I was told that Nebraska is going to be number one.', 'Well, all that I can say, when I am in California, Stanford is number one.', 'There may be some argument about which is the number one football team, but there is no argument about this: California is the number one State, and Ronald Reagan is the number one Governor in the United States of America.', 'As a Californian, I am proud that he is the Governor of my State. I am proud that I am going to be able to cast my vote for him and for the whole State ticket when I vote on November 3d. I am proud not only to be here with him, but with all the fine candidates on the State ticket, with Ed Reinecke, the Lieutenant Governor, with the Flournoys, with Hugh Flournoy and Jim Flournoy,2 two great teams. We want them both.', 'I am also very happy that Mark Guerra, the congressional candidate, is here. Charley Gubser 3 was here earlier, but he is over attending another meeting.', 'I do want you to know that at a political meeting like this, it is very gratifying for somebody who has the responsibility to travel all over the country to realize that when he stands on the platform and speaks about a group of candidates, he can be proud of every one of them. And I am proud of every one of these men.', 'Now, I would like to talk to you about the race for the United States Senate in California, what it means to you, to California, to the Nation, and to the world. As I speak of that race, I speak first of a man that I have known for 25 years. I am very proud to have George Murphy represent me and my State in the United States Senate. I am also very proud to have known him for 25 years as a friend. He is a fine Senator but, more important than that even, he is a very fine human being.', 'He is a man that is devoted to his family. He is devoted to his church. He is devoted to his State and to his country. He loves this country. He is working for this country.

But it can't stop there."", ""This year we can't just think of whether the man is a good man or whether he is our friend or whether he even bears our party label."", 'The important thing is what does a man stand for? What does his election mean in terms of the next Senate? What does it mean in terms of what this Senate has been over the past 2 years in which a majority of one in that Senate can determine whether the United States has an adequate defense?', 'A change of one vote, for example, would have determined whether the United States did or did not have a missile defense, whether the President of the United States was able to negotiate from strength or from weakness.', 'And over and over again, in vote after vote after vote, that is the way the present Senate is divided.', ""So what I would like to talk to you tonight about is what George Murphy's vote means, what his position means, in terms of those larger issues, the larger issues that are the responsibility primarily of the President of the United States."", 'When I was elected President 2 years ago, I made some pledges to the American people. I remember those pledges. The American people, I think, remember them, too.', 'They included the four subjects that I will talk about tonight and which I particularly have been emphasizing in this campaign. They are the four great issues of this election campaign. They are the ones on which the American people must make up their minds as to whether they want a man in the United States Senate who will stand with the President or against him on these great issues.', 'George Murphy stands with me. I need him not because he is with me, but because, as President of the United States, I have the responsibility to keep my campaign pledges. I can keep them only if I have help.', 'Let me put it another way: I am very delighted to see a lot of young people here, high school age, and I know that you study history, social studies, much more deeply than we did when I was in school many years ago. And I know that you read--and it is true--that the President of the United States is probably the most powerful man in the world, because .our country is richer than any other country in the world and it is stronger than any other country in the world. So, who ever is President is a very powerful man.', ""But, my friends, the President of the United States can do a lot of things, but when it comes to these issues that I am talking about, his power is limited by the support that he has in the Congress. If he doesn't have the House and the Senate working with him rather than against him, his power is limited. And what I ask for the people of California tonight--I ask that they give to the present President of the United States the support that he needs to carry out the pledges that he made to the American people, and that the American people want carried out because they are in their interest."", 'Because here they are: The American people want, above everything, peace-not temporary peace but lasting peace.', 'The American people also want to restore peace at home. They are concerned about violence and they want to restore peace. And they expect the President to provide leadership in that field.The American people want prosperity and progress. They want it without inflation and without war.', 'And they want full employment-jobs--jobs for everybody, but without the cost of war.', 'And, finally, the American people want progress. They want to have programs that will mean better education and better health, better housing, better opportunities for all of our people, whatever their backgrounds may be.', 'That is what they want from their President. That is what they want from their Government. And that is what I have pledged, and that is what we will get. But I need help. We need it in the Senate; we need it in the House; and you can help by giving us men that will work with us rather than against us.', ""Now let's come to the issues."", 'First, the problem of peace. Here is what I found when I came into office: There were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam. There was no plan to bring them home. Casualties were at 300 a week, and they were going up. There was no plan that would reduce them. And as far as a peace plan was concerned, there was none, none on the table, and no plans that would bring peace, either short-run or long-run.', 'I went to work. I adopted a program in which, instead of sending men to Vietnam, which we had been doing for 5 years, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands, and they are going to continue to come home.', 'Second, I took some very strong action. I took action against enemy sanctuaries in Cambodia. Why? Because I knew that if we did we could reduce American casualties. And we have. They are the lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they are going to continue to go down.', 'And, third, we took action on the peace front. As a result of our increased strength, we were able to offer, and we now have offered, a forthcoming policy, a cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners without any conditions, the negotiation of a political settlement, the mutual withdrawal of troops.', 'There is where it stands.', 'And here is the prospect for the future: The war in Vietnam is being brought to an end. We will bring peace, as far as that section of the world is concerned.', 'But now we come to the difference, a difference that is vitally important to the American people. The question is why not now--why not? And we see the signs and we hear them: ""Why not peace now? Why not bring the boys home right away? Why do we care about doing it this long way?""', 'I will tell you why.', 'My friends, do you realize that in this century we have been in four wars? I was born in 1913, and in my lifetime we have had four wars: World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam.', 'We have ended each of the three of those wars. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. And did you yet realize that not one generation in this century of Americans has had a full generation of peace?', 'The question, you see, is not ending a war. The question is ending a war in a way that you discourage those who will start another war and, therefore, have a generation of peace for Americans. And that is what we are doing.', 'That is what our men in Vietnam are fighting for, and that is what they are going to win. They are going to win a peace. They are fighting in a way that will end this war, to discourage those that might start another war, and that will bring peace in the Pacific and increase the chances that we can have peace in the world for a full generation.', ""They are fighting in Vietnam so that those young men that are outside shouting their obscene slogans won't have to fight in Vietnam or anyplace else any time in the future."", 'If we are going to have a generation of peace, we need more than that. We must think also of the whole world scene. The President of the United States at present leads the strongest nation in the world. This is important for peace. It is a guarantee of peace. It is a guarantee of peace, because the United States, never in this century--and we never will has never used its power to destroy freedom. It has never used its power to break the peace. It has used it to defend freedom or to defend the peace. And, therefore, a strong United States is essential if we are to have peace.', 'Here, again, we come to the candidate for the United States Senate, what it means.', 'It is very easy to talk about reducing our spending for defense, reduce it beyond what the President has recommended. It is very easy to vote against, as did half the Senate, an adequate missile defense for the United States of America, when our potential opponents in the world already have one. But, my friends, we are entering a period of negotiation with the Soviet Union. I hope that negotiation--I believe that it can reduce the burden of nuclear arms and increase the chances of real peace in the years ahead.', ""But if we are to succeed in those negotiations, I say to you, don't send the President of the United States to the negotiating table in a position of weakness. Send him there in a position of strength. We need a strong United States of America."", 'George Murphy stands for those things. He has voted for, he has talked for, a strong United States. That is why we need him in the United States Senate, because that kind of strength is what the President needs to back him up in that vitally important body.', ""Now, let's turn from the problems abroad to the problems at home."", 'One of them is related to what has happened abroad. As a result of our turning down of the war, we have found that a million men have been let out of the armed services in the past 2 years or out of defense plants, and we have had to begin to work into that transition from what we call a wartime to a peacetime economy.', 'Listen carefully to what I say. Did you realize that when we look back to World War II and through World War II, that the periods when the United States of America has had full employment have usually been in times of war?', 'My friends, I think we want to have full employment and prosperity without war, and we can have it and we need it with your support.', 'This presents a temporary problem in some places, like California, in which we have a trained force of highly skilled people working in aircraft and in other industries that are associated with war production. But let me say this: that trained force is an enormous asset for the future, because as America moves from wartime production to peacetime production, the possibilities are enormous, the possibilities in the field of the environment, the possibilities in the field of health care, the possibilities in the field of education, the needs as far as transportation is concerned, the needs as far as housing is concerned.', ""In all of these areas, California's trained, skilled manpower will now move from the wartime economy to jobs for peace. This is the kind of a program that we are working on."", 'I realize that in a political campaign, particularly in the last days, some rather wild charges are made. And an attempt has been made, I understand, to inject into this campaign, an issue that is completely false and one which creates fear among people right in this area. I heard about it when I came off the plane today.', 'One of the reporters said, ""What about the Ames laboratory? George Murphy\'s opponent has charged that the United States Government plans to close that right after election and that as soon as it is closed, 3,000 men will be put out of jobs.""', 'This is what I find: First, anyone who checked, and a Congressman of the United States has the same right to check as a Senator or anybody else, would have found there has never been any intention of closing the Ames laboratory. It has never been discussed. It is not going to be closed and anyone who made that kind of charge did so with knowledge that it was false.', 'My friends, I think that is the fact.', 'California will move forward in this period with better jobs, jobs based on a far firmer foundation--not on the demands of war which can be temporary, and we hope will always be temporary, but on the sound progress of peace in the future.', 'Now, we come to a third point, the problem of peace at home.', 'George Murphy referred to it. I realize it has been an issue here in California, as well as in other places. Let me tell you what I found here.', 'When we came into office, I found that in the previous 8 years, crime in the United States of America listen to this-had gone up 158 percent, all kinds of crime: organized crime, street crime, drugs, narcotics, obscenity, pornography. And there was no program to do anything about it.', 'And I said over and over again in that campaign of 1968 that I intended to do something about it, that I was going to appoint stronger judges, that I was going to appoint stronger law enforcement officials, and that we were going to get stronger laws.', 'I tried to keep those promises. But let me tell you what happened: Eighteen months ago, I asked the Congress of the United States to send to me a program to deal with organized crime, to deal with narcotics and dangerous drugs, to deal with obscenity and pornography. And it has taken 18 months for that Congress, on this very urgent problem, to get the first bill to my desk for signature. They had to wait until an election was coming up.', ""That isn't soon enough. Let me say that we need in the United States Senate a man who not only talks and votes for supporting the President in his effort to stop the rise in crime, who not only talks and votes that way in the 2 months before election, but all year round. And George Murphy is an all-year-round crime fighter and that is the kind of man we need in the United States Senate."", 'Now, we move to the area of progress. There are so many areas here we could discuss: the plans this administration has submitted to the Congress for our environment 14 months ago---still not the action that we need--the plans in so many other areas. But whether it is in the environment or health care or housing, or in the case of our welfare program--and I will discuss that briefly so you can understand exactly where we stand here--I feel that it is essential to recognize that this government of ours has got to quit putting good money into bad programs, or we are going to end up with bad programs and bad money.', 'That is why we are reforming the institutions of government.', 'Let me discuss briefly the welfare program as we presently found it, what we are trying to do about it, and what we believe we can do about it if we get the proper support in the Congress of the United States.', ""Why change it? We don't want to change it because we are not interested in helping people in need. Let me say that in this great, rich country of ours, we ought to feel fortunate that any family, and particularly any children in a family, can be assisted when they are unable to take care of themselves."", 'Look what happened to our welfare program. Let me tell you about what I found as far as New York City was concerned. In 1966, in New York City, there were 600,000 people receiving welfare. In 1970, just 4 years later, there were 1,200, 000 receiving welfare. They just go up and up and up, the number on the rolls, the costs, and no plans to bring it to an end.', 'What did we decide? I will tell you why we decided it.', 'We looked at that program; it was one that had no incentives for work, no incentives for job training, no requirements for work that were adequate.', 'I say to you, my friends, let us take care of all those who need, but when a program makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when a program encourages a man to desert his family rather than stay with his family, we ought to get rid of it and get another program in its place.', 'That is why we are working on a welfare reform which provides, as we should, for assistance to all families that need it, but which also provides for a work requirement and which, in very simple language, makes this particular point: If a man is able to work, if he is trained for a job, if he is then offered a job, and if he refuses to work, he should not be paid to loaf by a taxpayer in the State of California or anyplace else.', 'Now I have one message particularly for the older people here, and then perhaps one for the younger people as I complete this day which started in Illinois and has taken me to Minnesota, Nebraska, and now California. I have been in now 15 States over the past couple of weeks: north, east, west, and south. I have had a chance to see the temper of America, to see great audiences, some of them supporting my proposals, others not. But most of them, like you, listening, trying to know what the issues are, trying to make a decision about your country and your future.', 'From time to time there have been problems in some of these rallies, as you may have noticed. Sometimes there are a few people in the hall or, like tonight, outside the hall. The Secret Service told me there are 900 demonstrators outside shouting their hatred for the United States and shouting also the usual obscenities that you expect from this kind of a crowd.', 'But let me just say this, my friends: I have seen America. Young Americans are getting a bad rap, and they are getting it because night after night on that television, what you see are the violent, radical few. You see a bombing here, a building is bombed, a bank is burned--just 10 miles from my home near the California campus at Irvine--or you see, as has been the case in some meetings, of people trying to break up a meeting, shouting down speakers, shouting down the President of the United States. And as you see those people on the television, you think that they are the majority of young Americans or, if not a majority, that they are going to be the leaders of the future.', ""Well, I have news for you: Those violent few, those radical few, they aren't a majority of young Americans, and they are not going to be the leaders of America in the future."", 'Now, again, all of you parents and others, you listen: I know young America. Young America is idealistic, and that is to their credit.', 'They want peace in the world, and that is to their credit.', ""They are not satisfied with things as they are, and that is to their credit. They care. They care about people that don't have the chance that they have, and that is to their credit."", 'They want change in America, and that is to their credit. Because a younger generation that was satisfied with things as they were would not be a great generation, and this has the potential for greatness.', ""But, my friends, the young generation that I have seen around this country, the great majority, while they want change, recognize that the greatness of America is that this country, for 190 years, provides a method for peacefully changing what you don't like."", 'And in a country that provides for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies violence and lawlessness in the United States of America.', ""My friends, how do you answer them? There is a very simple way. You don't answer in kind. You don't resort to violence. You don't try to shout them down."", 'The way you answer is with the most powerful weapon that free men have ever had, or women. And that is with a vote.', 'On November 3d, each person here of voting age has the opportunity for a moment to be the most powerful person in the word, because with his vote, he determines his future, the future of his State, the future of his Nation, and possibly the future of the world.', 'Tonight, I have tried to tell you how I believe that future would be served.', 'I believe, very honestly, it would be best served by supporting the candidates that I have mentioned tonight: Governor Reagan and our fine team at the State level, George Murphy and our team at the national level.', 'But, my friends, I simply want to say this as I conclude: The most important thing is you on November 3d--remember, that is when the power is to the people. Use that power and vote for what is best for America, and it will be best for you.', 'Thank you.']"
35,Richard Nixon ,"October 30, 1970","['Governor Reagan, Senator Murphy, my fellow Californians, my fellow Americans:', 'I cannot tell you what a proud moment it is for me to be addressing the Nation, for the first time in this campaign, from my native State of California. And I join with all of you in this great hall, and those of you in California, in giving my enthusiastic endorsement to the entire State ticket, and particularly to the leader of that ticket, a man who is the first man of the first State---Ronald Reagan.', 'And I also give my enthusiastic endorsement to all of those on the national ticket, the candidates for the House of Representatives, and to our candidate for the United States Senate for reelection-George Murphy.', 'I should like to give a personal testimonial with regard to George Murphy. I have known him for 25 years. I have known him for 6 years as a United States Senator. He is a very, very fine Senator. Just as important, he is a fine human being.', 'For all the years that I have known him, he has been dedicated to his family, to his church, to his State, and to his Nation. I am very proud that a man like George Murphy, who is a man of unquestioned integrity, unquestioned loyalty, unquestioned honesty, is my Senator from California and is my friend.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, after giving that personal testimonial, I am sure that that would seem to be enough with regard to why I feel George Murphy should be reelected Senator from California.', ""But to this audience here in California and to all of you listening across the country, I say it isn't enough simply that the individual is one who is a personal friend and is a member of your party."", 'In this year 1970, the issues are so important that we must not think in personal terms, we must not think in party terms, we must think of what is best for America. And it is because I believe that what George Murphy stands for, what the candidates for the United States Senate that I have campaigned across this country stand for--because I believe what they stand for is best for America, that I am for them and I hope you are for them, too.', 'This is probably the most important and decisive Senate election in the 190-year history of this country, because the present Senate is divided very narrowly. In vote after vote, a change of one vote, a majority of one, could make the difference as to whether or not the policy that the President of the United States pledged in his campaign is going to be adopted or whether it is going to be rejected.', 'I made some promises in the campaign of 1968. I am trying to keep those promises. The people of the United States expect their Presidents to keep their promises.', ""The President of the United States is a very powerful man. He is probably the most powerful man in the world because he heads the world's richest country and the world's strongest country."", 'But the President of the United States cannot do the job that needs to be done fully unless he has the support of the House and the support of the Senate.', 'That is why I say that tonight, whether it is in California or in your State where there is a Senate contest or a House contest, I ask you to vote for those men who will vote for the President rather than against him, so that the President can keep his promises to you, the American people.', 'Let me begin with the most important promise that I made in the last campaign. You all remember it. I made it right here in this very hall. It was that I would work to bring peace to America and to the world.', 'I have tried to keep that promise. I want to tell you what I found and I want to tell you what I have done. I want to tell you what we need if we are going to meet that great objective.', 'When I came into office, I found 550,000 Americans in Vietnam with no plan to bring them home. I found that our casualties were 300 a week and no plans to bring them down. I found that there was no peace plan being offered at the conference table in Paris.', 'I went to work. We adopted a plan to bring the war to an end. Instead of having a situation which had been the case for the previous 5 years when men were going to Vietnam, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and they will continue to come home.', ""Instead of casualties being at 300 a week, as a result of the strong action we took against the Cambodian sanctuaries, we have destroyed the enemy's capability to the point that our casualties are the lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they will go lower as a result of that policy."", 'And the United States, because of the actions we have taken, has been able to present a peace proposal as far-reaching, as generous as anyone could possibly recommend, a proposal that contains a cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners, a negotiated settlement, and, of course, the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own government and our willingness to abide by that decision, whatever it is.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we have done. But now we come to the issue, the issue that divides the present Senate sometimes by one vote, sometimes two, sometimes three.', 'The issue is whether or not we should move faster. Some say, ""Peace now."" Some say, ""Why not 6 months from now? Why not a deadline?""', 'Let me simply answer that in this way: The problem is not to end the war in Vietnam. After all, the President of the United States as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces could have ended the war the day that he came into office.', 'Let us remember that we have been in four wars in this century. We ended World War I. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. But let me say to these young people here particularly, because your future is involved: Do you realize that in this whole century, the 20th century, the people of America have not had a full generation of peace? So, what we want to do now, is to end this war in a way that we will discourage those that might start another war, so that we can have a full generation of peace for all Americans.', 'You may have noted that one of the Senate critics of our peace policy toward Vietnam, who was asking for a more precipitate withdrawal, said that our best young men were going to Canada.', 'I disagree. Our best young men, my friends--our best young men are in Vietnam risking their lives so that those that protest ""Peace now,"" won\'t have to go to Vietnam or fight another war in the future.', 'And tonight I can say to you, with assurance, we are bringing the war to an end. We are ending it in a way that will discourage those that might start another war, and that will give us a chance to have peace, not just for the next election, but peace for the next generation.', 'And if you want that, then it is important that we get backing, backing for the President from the Senate, backing that men like George Murphy and the others that I have campaigned for across this country have been giving. If you want that, it is also important that the President of the United States, whenever he negotiates with other countries--and particularly when he negotiates with the Soviet Union, as I will be negotiating in the future, and as my representatives will be, for the limitation of nuclear arms-when we negotiate, let us be sure that the President of the United States negotiates from strength and not from weakness.', 'So the issue is clear: We need Senators, we need Congressmen, who will recognize that a just peace in Vietnam, one that discourages the warmakers, and that a strong America are essential if we are going to have a generation of peace.And that is what I ask the American people to consider as you vote on November 3d.', 'And as we consider the problem of peace abroad, let us turn to a closely related problem, that of peace at home.', 'The United States cannot lead the forces of peace abroad unless we can demonstrate that we can restore peace and keep peace right here at home in the United States of America.', 'Let me again tell you what I found; When I came into office, I found that in the previous 8 years crime had gone up 158 percent in this country, street crime, organized crime, the use of drugs and narcotics, the flow of obscenity and pornography into the homes.', 'I pledged certain things. I remember pledging it right here in this hall and in halls all across this country in the 1968 campaign.', 'I said that I would appoint stronger judges. I said that I would ask for stronger laws. I said that I would appoint a stronger Attorney General.', 'I have tried to keep those promises. But what have I found? We have had delay in the confirmation of the judges, and it took 18 months for the Congress to get the first one of the major crime bills that I asked for 18 months ago to my desk for signature, just before the election.', 'My friends, I tell you what we need in this field. Again, we need Members of the House and the Senate who will vote for the President and not against him, so that we can see to it that the wave of crime does not become the wave of the future in the United States of America.', 'Let us clearly understand the issue. The issue is not being for crime or against it. Everybody is against crime. But the issue is what do you do about it; how do you act; how do you vote; how urgent is the problem to you?', 'I should point out to all of you here that as I look over this situation, I find that there are men in the House and the Senate who, as we approach an election, become very concerned about the issue. But what we need are men in the House and the Senate of the United States who not only talk that way in the 2 months of the election campaign, but who work and talk and vote for those measures that are necessary to stop the criminal elements all year round. And George Murphy and those that I am supporting are that kind of men.', ""And now, I turn to an event related to all this, that occurred in San Jose yesterday. You saw it on your television screens, an incident in which you saw 3,000 people inside listening to the speakers and 1,000 demonstrators outside, demonstrators who shouted epithets, but, in addition to that, who hurled bottles and rocks and bricks, broke windows, damaged the President's car, damaged the buses, injured some of the people in those buses."", 'It was a violent demonstration. And as that demonstration was concluded, there were those that were trying to indicate what it meant.', 'I want to give you tonight my judgement as to what that demonstration meant.', 'I say to you tonight, it is time to draw the line. I do not mean a party line. Because, when I speak of a line, I am referring not just to Republicans or Democrats, I am referring to a line between those who understand this problem and deal with it effectively and those who do not.', 'You recall what happened at the University of Wisconsin, where someone was killed in a lighted building. Listen to what the Wisconsin State Journal said in an editorial. ""It isn\'t just the radicals that set the bomb in the lighted, occupied building who were guilty. The blood is on the hands of anyone who encouraged them, anyone who talked recklessly of revolution, anyone who has chided with mild disparagement the violence of extremism, while hinting that the cause was right all the time.""', 'Here is what we must understand: We must recognize, my friends, that simply. because the cause happens to be peace, no protest for peace justifies violence, justifies shouting down speakers, justifies lawlessness, or any kind of action.', 'My friends, what we must recognize is that in a system that provides a method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence or lawlessness in the United States of America.', 'And it is time, also, for us to recognize that candidates for the Senate and the House who, in the past, have either condoned this, defended it, excused it, or failed to speak up against it--that these are men who do not have the qualifications now to take the strong stand that needs to be taken against this kind of lawlessness and this kind of violence.', 'I can say again, that across this country, I am proud to say that every candidate that I have spoken for is one that has not adopted this permissive attitude toward either crime or toward this kind of violent protest. So, stand with these men who understand the issues and whose record is clear on this point.', ""But now, let's keep this in perspective. As you saw that picture in San Jose yesterday of the violent few, and as you look at your television screens night after night, you may get the impression, with the rocks being thrown, the shouting of the obscene words and the like, that the violent few among our youth are a majority of American youth today, or that they may be the leaders of America tomorrow."", 'My friends, I have good news for you. I have traveled this country. I have seen thousands of people over the past few months. I have seen thousands of young people. And I can tell you that the radical few that you see on your television screens night after night--they are not a majority of American youth today and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""My friends, it is time to answer those who have given this distorted and inaccurate picture of America. It is time for the great silent majority of Americans to stand up and be counted. And the way you can stand up and be counted is not to answer in kind. You don't have to resort to violence. You don't have to shout down speakers. You don't have to shout four-letter words."", 'The way to answer them, my friends, is on November 3d, to go to the polls and vote. And in that very moment when you vote, in the loneliness of that polling booth, you are the most powerful person in the world.', 'Vote for men who have a clear record of understanding these issues. Vote for men who have always stood against those who would tear America down.', 'And I urge you to vote for those men who will stand with the President, rather than against the President, for these policies, for progress without inflation in this country, for prosperity without war, for the reestablishment in America of respect for law and of laws that deserve respect.', 'And, above all, for the great objective that young Americans want, that all Americans want, a generation of peace for America and all the world.']"
36,Richard Nixon ,"October 31, 1970","['Senator Bennett, President Tanner, President Smith, all of the distinguished guests here on the platform, and all of the distinguished members of this audience in this historic room, and all of you listening on television and radio tonight:', 'This is, as you perhaps are aware, the last appearance that I will be making during the campaign of 1970, and I am very honored--I am very honored that it could take place in this historic room that has, for me, so many memories and which has meant so much, not only to the people of this area, and those of this faith, but to all of America.', 'I am honored because I remember the meetings that I have attended here previously, and I can tell you that having been here previously, and being particularly impressed by the fact that I was allowed to speak here as a candidate on two previous occasions, I am particularly honored to stand here for the first time as the President of the United States.', 'I would like to pay my respects, too, to those who have preceded me on the program, to the magnificent Tabernacle Choir. I was so honored that they came to our inauguration. And I hope they sing another number at the conclusion of my speech. I am going to quit a little early so they can have the time.', 'And also, I want to pay my respects, too, to a very, very great American, David Kennedy, a man, who incidentally, is one who has contributed enormously to this administration, a man who is sound, a man who is strong, a man who is honest and---and I say this emphatically--a man who always tells the truth.', 'And, of course, to Secretary Romney, who has rendered such enormous service to his country as Governor of Michigan and then as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and to my longtime friend, Wallace Bennett, who introduced me a moment ago.', 'He is a tower of strength in the United States Senate for me, I should say--not me personally, but for the policies of our administration, particularly with his great expertise in the field of finance and in business.I therefore was very honored to be introduced on this occasion by Wallace Bennett.', 'I have been told that it is accepted in the heat of a campaign that whoever appears here is given the opportunity or the right to speak in somewhat political terms. I intend to use that right. I want to use it responsibly.', 'I want to use it, however, in the context that I am sure all of you in this great Tabernacle will appreciate and understand, and that all of my friends in Utah will appreciate and understand.', 'In 1968, when I appeared in this room, I made some promises to the people of Utah and to the people of the United States. Those promises were well known. They were made by a man as a candidate for President of the United States.', 'When a President makes promises, the people expect him to keep the promises. And they should expect the promises to be kept.', 'All of you are keenly aware of the fact that the President is a very powerful man. As a matter of fact, because of the wealth of this country and the strength of this country, the President is probably the most powerful man in the world.', 'But the President of the United States, I should say, has limits on his powers, and one of those limits is that the President, when it comes to keeping the promises that he makes, can only do what the Congress will support him in.', 'Therefore, the issue is very simple: Where the President makes a promise and the people want him to keep the promise, if the Congress votes with him he keeps the promise; if the Congress votes against him, he cannot keep it. That is the issue. It is a very simple issue in 1970. It is the issue particularly in the races for the United States Senate.', 'And in speaking of the United States Senate race, I particularly selected to talk about tonight because Utah is one of the key States, and it is one in which, interestingly enough, one of the clearest distinctions and differences occur in whole country.', 'Let me be quite precise. Two good men are running for the United States Senate in Utah; two men who want to be the next United States Senator. Two men, however, who are diametrically opposed to each other on a fundamental issue; one, on the great issues which I will now describe, has a record of opposing the President approximately 100 percent of the time. The other does not support the President all the time. The other in his record in the House has not been a rubber stamp. I would not respect him if he were. As a matter of fact, he has voted to override two of my vetoes.', 'But, on the other hand, on the four great issues that I will mention tonight, he has voted to support the President. So the question before the people of Utah tonight is this: In the next 2 years, do you want the President to keep his promises?', 'If you want him to keep his promises, do you want to give him a Senator who will vote with him or against him? And Larry Burton will vote with me. That is why I am here, for Larry Burton.', ""Now to the issues, and let's understand clearly what they are."", 'The first issue is this: Right here in this great Tabernacle, I remember in 1968 I pledged to the people of Utah and to the people of America that I would work for a lasting peace in the world. I have been trying to keep that pledge. We have made some progress.', 'Let me tell you what has happened. This is what I found when I became President: There were 550,000 Americans in Vietnam with no plans to bring them home; casualties were at 300 a week; we had no peace plan at the conference table. I went to work.', 'Instead of sending more men to Vietnam, which had been the case for 5 years before I got there, we have been bringing them home by the tens of thousands and they will continue to be brought home.', ""And then by the strong action that I took in Cambodia, we were able to destroy the enemy's capacity to kill Americans and, as a result, our casualties have been reduced to the lowest in 4 1/2 years, and they are going to continue to go down."", ""And then, third, and most important, as a result, again, of the success of what we had done previously in destroying the enemy's capabilities, we have presented a peace plan, a very generous peace plan, as it should be: a cease-fire, an exchange of prisoners, a negotiated settlement in which we will accept the result of whatever the people of South Vietnam determine for their future."", 'Now, here is where we are and here are the differences between the two candidates in the State of Utah on this great issue of Vietnam and peace in the world.', 'We are on the way to ending the war in Vietnam. The question is how you end it. And there are those who say, ""We are on the way, but we should end it faster."" They say, ""Peace now,"" or they say, ""Why not set a deadline? Why not 6 months from now?""', ""Let me tell you why. The problem, my friends, is not ending a war. I see plenty of people in this room that will remember that in this century we have been in four wars. We ended World War I. Remember? We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war. And yet, the younger people here should know that never in the history of this century, in this entire century, have the American people had a full generation of peace. That is why I say let's end this war in a way that will discourage the warmakers so that we can have a generation of peace. Let's have that kind of end to the war."", 'We are doing that. I believe that that is the policy that the American people will support. It is the policy that Larry Burton supports. It is the policy that his opponent opposes.', 'They honestly disagree. You have to decide.', ""And then we go to the larger area. If we are going to have peace in the world, it isn't just ending the war in Vietnam. It is a question of working out the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Here I have implemented an era of negotiation as distinguished from confrontation."", 'There will be, as there have been over the past 2 years, more negotiations with the Soviet Union, particularly in the field of limiting nuclear arms.', 'And now the very simple question is: How do we negotiate?', ""I can only say this: Don't send your President to the negotiating table with the Soviet leaders, or don't send his advisers to the negotiating table with the Soviet leaders, in a position of weakness. Let's be sure we negotiate from strength and not from weakness with the Soviet leaders."", 'And here again, we have a very precise difference between the two candidates. One has consistently supported those appropriations, those measures, which would maintain the strength of the United States, that would build, for example, a system, an antiballistic missile system, which the Soviets have already, and which would give us a bargaining position as we attempt to negotiate the reduction in nuclear arms. The other opposes it.', 'My point is this: I know the Soviet leaders. I know them not personally, but I know, certainly, what their attitudes are in such negotiations. And it is vitally important, if we want negotiations to succeed, if we want to reduce this burden of nuclear arms on ourselves and the danger of nuclear war for the years ahead.', 'Let us see to it that the United States is not weaker than they are at the conference table.', 'And then, finally, if we are to have peace in the world, the strength of the United States is needed to guarantee it, because remember this about our strength: Our strength is not kept for the purpose of destroying the peace; it is kept for the purpose of keeping the peace. A strong United States that is respected will guarantee peace.', 'My friends, I will put it very simply: I deeply believe, more deeply than in any other thing I believe in all my life, my political life, my personal life, that we need, that we want for the young people, for all the people of America and the world, a generation of peace.', 'I think we are on the road to a generation of peace. But I need a man in the United States Senate who will work with Wally Bennett rather than work against him, and with me rather than against me on the policies that are necessary to have a generation of peace. And that is Larry Burton.', ""Now, let's come down to a precise issue at home. I know the people of Utah are very sophisticated politically. I know that you study these issues and you are extremely interested in all of the nuances."", ""So I am going to take one that many audiences, frankly, are not particularly interested in because they do not see the enormous importance of it. Let's look at it this way."", 'The United States has an enormous budget, in the magnitude of around $200 billion, as you know. And we all are interested in--we want better education, we want better housing, we want better welfare for all of our people.', 'And we are a rich country. We want to do everything that we can for people who need it.', 'But, on the other hand, I determined when I became President, and I made this promise when I stood right in this place 2 years ago, I promised that instead of putting good money into bad programs, which means you end up with bad money and bad programs, we would reform the institutions of government.', 'So, I have asked the Congress for a historic program of reform--reform of education, reform of health, reform of housing, and reform of welfare.', 'Now, I want you to look at welfare as an example of why reform is necessary.', 'This is what I found when we came in. I found that in the city of New York, for example, in 1966--and listen to this number--there were 600,00 people on welfare. That is more than live in Salt Lake City.', 'And yet, in just 4 years, there are 1,200,000 people on welfare in New York City. By 1980, there will be 2.5 million people on welfare in New York City unless we change the program.', 'I will put it very simply to you. When a system makes it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when a system encourages a man to desert his family rather than stay with his family, I say it is time to get rid of that system and get another one in its place.', 'Our program provides for assistance to all those that need it. It does not provide for a guaranteed annual income, because we do not stand for that. It provides for assistance to all needy families.', 'But it has a work requirement and a work incentive.', 'I will put it very bluntly: If a man is able to work, if he is trained for a job, and if he is offered a job, and if he refuses to work, that man should not be paid to loaf by a hard-working taxpayer in Utah or any place else in the country.', 'So there is another very clear difference between your two candidates: One honestly believing we should continue to pour billions of dollars into the old welfare program, and another saying and supporting by his vote, as Wally Bennett does in the Senate, a new program, reforming it, so that we can have work requirement and work incentive, and help for all those that need it.', 'I say on that issue, again, there is a clear choice. Do you want to support change or do you want to go back to the old way or continue it?', 'Now we come to the third great issue. The third great issue involves peace at home. We have heard some discussion of that tonight, and I am going to discuss one aspect of that a little later in my remarks, but I want to tell you what I found when I came into office almost 2 years ago.', 'I found that crime had gone up in the previous 8 years, 158 percent in this country. And that included everything--organized crime, street crime, drugs and narcotics, and obscenity and pornography flowing into the homes of our children.', 'And the reason it had gone up, one of the major reasons, was an attitude of permissiveness-permissiveness in the courts, permissiveness in high places in the Congress, in the Senate, permissiveness, even, in some of the educational institutions, and I must say some of the churches.', 'That had to change. So, I pledged in the campaign, I remember pledging it standing right in this place. I remember saying that if I were elected President I would appoint stronger judges. I remember saying that I would appoint a stronger Attorney General of the United States who would not be permissive. And I remember saying that I would ask for stronger laws.', 'I tried to keep the promises. I have appointed a stronger Attorney General. I have asked for stronger judges.', 'And here we come to a difference between the two candidates again. When those judges have come up for consideration, delay, delay, delay has occurred. And finally two have been rejected. And yet those judges were two men who were absolutely opposed to the permissiveness of the past.', 'I say we need judges on every court in this land who will recognize that the time has come to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. The laws were debated for 18 months before any of the laws came to my desk for signature just before the election time.', 'What we need are men in the House and men in the Senate who, not just in the 2 months before election, but all year round, talk and work and fight for the kind of laws and the kind of men that will see that the wave of crime does not be come the wave of the future.', 'Mention has been made of the fact that there was in San Jose, my home State, a days ago, a rather ugly incident--you remember it; you probably saw it on television-an incident in which there were 3,000 people inside the hall listening to the President of the United States, the Governor of California, and the senior Senator from California, and 1,000 ugly demonstrators outside shouting their four-letter obscenities at those who went in, terrorizing the people that were going in, throwing bricks and rocks and chains at the cars that went by, damaging the Presidential limousine, breaking windows in the press buses and in the police cars.', 'And after that incident, the question is: What does it mean?', ""I will tell you what it does not mean. Don't blame the people of San Jose. I heard from the mayor of San Jose. I heard from the president of the student body of San Jose State College. And they pointed out that the very few that were there did not represent what the people of San Jose thought or the people of that university thought."", 'But, my friends, what it does mean, and what we have to recognize, is this: These people were carrying signs saying ""Peace,"" and we are all for peace. But I say that those who carry a ""Peace"" sign in one hand and who throw a bomb or a brick with the other hand are the super hypocrites of our time.', ""But, my friends, don't get the wrong impression. Don't let what those violent few do give you a bad impression of all of American youth. Oh, I know on television night after night you see what the bad young people do, and not enough about what the good ones are doing."", 'Let me say, my friends, if you were to just look at television and read the newspaper accounts, you might gain the impression that the radical few among our youth are a majority of American youth today and may be the leaders tomorrow.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have been around this country. The violent and radical few are neither a majority of youth today, and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""I say to you, I believe in American youth. You should believe in American youth. The great majority, to their great credit, they are idealistic. They care. They want peace, just as we all want peace. They want a better life for all people. They are concerned about people that don't have the chance that they have had, and this is to their credit."", 'And they also recognize this fundamental point: They believe in change. They want change. And all younger generations should. But they realize that we have to have peaceful change. And that in our society, a society that provides for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to Violence or lawlessness.', ""And to the young people today, could I say to you: Don't you lose your faith in America. You may get the impression that this is a sick country. You may get the impression that America has a foreign policy that is imperialistic. But I have traveled around this world and I can tell you, my friends, what I find."", 'When I find hundreds of thousands of people on the streets in a Communist city like Bucharest, Romania; when I find hundreds of thousands in the street in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, as well as in the free countries, the others that I visited, just let me say these people are out cheering. What are they cheering? Not the President of the United States as an individual. They are cheering the United States of America and what we stand for--not because we are rich and not because we are strong, but because this is a good country.', 'The United States of America is the strongest nation in the world, but everyone abroad knows that we do not threaten the peace or the freedom of any other country.', 'And they all know abroad that the United States of America in this great, good country--it has faults; it has problems. But there is more freedom, there is more opportunity, there is more progress than in any country in the world.', ""My friends, we must recognize, as we look at America's faults, that we are very, very fortunate to live in this country, to enjoy it."", ""One hundred and ten years ago, in one of the most tragic incidents in American history, after the bloody raid at Harper's Ferry, John Brown was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be hanged. He was taken to the gallows in a wagon, and the coffin was fight by him on the wagon."", 'As he was going through the countryside, and as he looked out at the Virginia countryside, speaking to no one in particular, he was heard to say, ""This is a beautiful country.""', 'If John Brown, at that time, with his own death imminent, and with a terrible civil war just to come--if he could say that, let us, with all the problems that America has--let us truly recognize today, this is a beautiful country, and we in America are so fortunate that we have in our powers, through our votes, in a free election, to make America an even more beautiful country in the future for our children.', 'I understand that we now have to leave to go back to our home in California. And I wonder if I could just say one word in a very personal vein to those in this Tabernacle with regard to one aspect of our work that is completely without partisanship and has no political considerations whatever in the usual sense.', ""As you know, we have instituted a custom of having worship services in the White House, and we have taken a little heat for that, as you do for making any new breakthrough or new decision. We have done it because I felt it was important to bring to the Nation's Capital representatives of various faiths, and most have been represented, but particularly to bring right to the White House, where the President, members of the Cabinet, the members of the diplomatic corps, the Members of the Congress, Democrat and Republican, could be reminded of the fact that while this Nation is the strongest nation in the world and the richest nation in the world, that all the wealth and the strength in the world is as nothing unless the spirit of America is sound and good."", 'And I do not know of any group in America--and I would say this not only here, but in other places in this country-who have contributed more to that strong, moral leadership and high moral standards, the spirit that has kept America going through bad times as well as good times--no group has done more than those who are members of this church.', 'I want to thank you for what you have done for the spirit of America. And however the outcome of elections, if you can continue to emphasize those spiritual values, I am sure America is going to go ahead and do very well.', 'Thank you.']"
37,Richard Nixon ,"October 31, 1970","['Governor Williams, Senator Fannin, Congressman Rhodes, Congressman Steiger, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and all the distinguished members of this audience:', 'I appreciate very much your wonderful reception. I understand, incidentally, that traffic is backed up for 3 miles. We saw it as we came in. I hope, incidentally, that our friends in radio and television that they have this on the radio, so the people in the cars can hear on the radio, and my greetings to you.', ""I am very happy to be back in Arizona. I remember my very young years when I was in Prescott on three different summers. I have very warm feelings about this State. As Barry Goldwater says, too, I was raised on Arizona's water, so we share something in common."", 'I am particularly impressed by the size of this crowd when I realize what we are competing with today, the homecoming _at the University of Arizona at Tucson. I understand the Arizona State Fair--is that right?--it is going on now, and the opening of deer season.', ""And also, I am very appreciative of the fact that we have had some wonderful musical organizations that have been entertaining us and entertaining you before we were here. If I could just mention them briefly. I want all those who are listening on television and radio to hear it, too. I understand we have had from the choral groups--and let's give them all a hand--the Phoenix Boys' Club chorus, the Coronado High School choral group, The Phoenicians barbershop chorus, the Scottsdale High School Band, and the Arizona State University Band."", ""After that reception from that band, I can't resist just saying something to you that is going to get me in trouble someplace else. When I was in Texas a few days ago, they told me that Texas was number one. When I was in Ohio the other day, they told me that Ohio State was going to be number one. When I was in Indiana, they told me Notre Dame was going to be number one. When I was in northern California, they told me that Stanford was number one."", 'But, boy, when I am in Arizona, Arizona State is number one.', 'I am glad to be in the State of champions, a champion United States Senator and a man who belongs not only to Arizona but the whole Nation Barry Goldwater.', 'And a champion in the form of the man that I am proud here to endorse, a very great Governor, one who has served this State and one who is among the top ranks among the Governors of the Nation, Governor Williams, of Arizona.', ""And champion Congressman, too, Johnny Rhodes, who serves in the leadership with me, and Congressman Steiger. Let me say for our congressional candidates, let's give them the hand that they deserve, too."", 'And finally, your United States Senator, the man who is up for reelection, the man who is among those for whom I am particularly campaigning across this country, because what happens in the Senate this year is perhaps the most important Senate race in the 190-year history of this country.', 'I simply want to say this about Paul Fannin: I have known him as you have known him for a number of years. I have known him as a fine Senator and as a fine man.', 'I also know this: that he is a man on whom I depend. I value his advice. I know that he fights for Arizona, but I also know that he fights for the defense of the United States of America, and we need that, too, in the United States Senate.', ""I am proud to endorse him. I don't know what I would do without him. Give him back, will you? How about it? We want him back."", ""Now, ladies and gentlemen, you are all standing here and I know you have been standing for a long time, jammed up, and I don't want you to get tired. But I have selected this particular occasion for a major statement. A major statement that needs to be made, needs to be made now, not because it is the end of a political campaign, but because this problem has been building up in America."", 'It is time for the President of the United States to speak out clearly to the American people, not because he personally has been affected by it but because all of America is affected by what happened a couple of days ago in my home State of California, in San Jose.', 'You saw some of it on television. You saw the crowd inside, a crowd like this, 3,000 people, listening, cheering, indicating their interest in who might be the Governor, who might be the Senator, and, of course, showing respect for the office of the President of the United States. You saw also the crowd outside.', 'The crowd inside were exercising their right to peaceable assembly, as you are today. They were listening to political speakers. They were weighing the issues in the campaign of 1970.', 'And outside the hall there was a mob of about 1,000, maybe a few more. We could see the hate in their faces as we drove into the hall, and the obscene signs they waved. We could hear the hate in their voices as they chanted their obscenities.', 'And inside the hall, we could hear them pounding on the doors as if they could not bear the thought of people listening respectfully to the Governor of the State of California, the senior Senator, and the President of the United States.', 'Along the campaign trail we have seen and heard demonstrators, but never before in this campaign was there such an atmosphere of hatred. As we came out of the hall and entered the motorcade, the haters surged past the barricades.', ""They began throwing rocks. These were not small stones; they were large rocks. They were heavy enough to smash windows, windows in the press bus, windows in the staff cars. They weren't directed at me, though some did hit the Presidential car. Most of the rocks hit the buses and the other cars behind."", 'What is the reaction of the people who came--people like you? They are at a rally, peaceably at a rally. Many who brought their children were terrified. Others were incensed at the insult to their elected leaders. And all were repelled by the atmosphere of violence and hatred that marred the event. And they thought to themselves, ""Is this America? Is this the land where reason and peaceful discussion is the hallmark of a free society?""', 'Some say that .the violent dissent is caused by the war in Vietnam. Well, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow Americans, it is about time we branded this line of thinking, this alibi for violence, for what it is: pure nonsense.', 'Those who carry a ""peace"" sign in one hand and throw a bomb or a brick with the other are the super hypocrites of our time.', 'My friends, the war is ending. Instead of sending men to Vietnam, we are bringing them home. Instead of casualties going up, they are coming down. A peace plan is on the table. And we are ending the war in a way that will discourage aggressors so that we can have not just peace for the next election, but peace for the next generation. That is what is happening, and that is what Americans are for.', 'And yet, as the war ends, the violence continues, and this is proof that these alibis are worthless.', 'Others say that the cause of violence is repression, but the people who came peaceably to the rally in San Jose-they were not repressing the haters outside. There is more freedom in the United States than anywhere else in the world, and it is about time that we cut out the nonsense--it is simply pure nonsense that repression is the cause of violence in the United States of America.', ""Violence in America today is not caused by the war; it is not caused by repression. There is no romantic ideal involved. Let's recognize these people for what they are. They are not romantic revolutionaries. They are the same thugs and hoodlums that have always plagued the good people."", 'And now the reason, a major reason, that they have gained such prominence in our national life, the major reason they dominate our television screens as they do night after night, the reason that they increasingly terrorize decent citizens, can be summed up in a single word: appeasement. When you permit an imbalance to exist that favors the accused over the victim, you are inviting more violence and breeding more bullies.', 'For too long, and this needs to be said and said now and here, the strength of freedom in our society has been eroded by a creeping permissiveness in our legislatures, in our courts, in our family life, and in our colleges and universities.', 'For too long, we have appeased aggression here at home, and, as with all appeasement, the result has been more aggression and more violence. The time has come to draw the line. The time has come for the great silent majority of Americans of all ages, of every political persuasion, to stand up and be counted against appeasement of the rock throwers and the obscenity shouters in America.', 'My fellow Americans, let us understand this is not a partisan issue. There is no candidate of either party that is for crime, that is for violence. The choice before the American people next week is not so simple as picking between the proviolent and the antiviolent. Everyone denounces violence.', 'The choice is between approaches to the same goal. One approach holds that violence will end as we end the war; that violence will end as we give more power to those who demand more power; that violence will end as we end hunger and poverty in America.', 'The people who believe in this approach are sincere Americans. They have every right to this point of view. But I believe that their approach has led us down a path of appeasement that has resulted in the very thing that they abhor most: the increase in violence, the limiting of personal freedom.', 'For years now, it has been fashionable to portray ours, this great country of America, as a sick society; to belittle its successes and breastbeat about its shortcomings; to make automatic heroes out of those who protest as if the act of protest--regardless of what was being protested, or how it was done, or whose rights were being infringed, or even whether the protesters had anything better to offer-as if this act itself were the mark of some higher virtue, and when rituals of protest began establishing a tyranny of their own, there were many who somehow forgot that tyranny is wrong, whatever its form-whether the tyranny of government, or the tyranny of terrorists, or the tyranny of those who shout down speakers, or the tyranny of those who would shut down colleges or blockade streets in an effort to impose their own views on others.', 'That way is not the American way and that way will not be the American way as long as those who care about freedom and decency and respect for the rights of one another stand up and be counted.', 'For a decade, now, this approach dominated America. It has obviously failed. The time has come to try a new approach.', 'Let me first point out what this new approach, our approach, is not. The answer to bluster is not more bluster. The answer to bluster is firmness. The answer to a wave of violence is not a wave of repression. That is exactly what the violent few want so that they can enlist the sympathies of the moderates.', 'The answer to violence is the strong application of fair American justice.', 'And the answer to violent dissent is not oppression of legitimate dissent. The great danger to dissent today comes not from the forces of law, but from the organized tyranny of some dissenters.', 'Now, let me spell out what the new approach, our approach, is:', 'First, the new approach to violence calls for new and strong laws that will give the peace forces new muscle to deal with the criminal forces in the United States of America. And in the United States Senate, Paul Fannin, and in the House of Representatives, Johnny Rhodes and Sam Steiger, have stood firmly with the President for that proposition and we need them back.', 'I have called for a whole series of laws. But because we have not had enough support in the House and the Senate, Congress has dillydallied; Congress has bottled them up in committee; Congress has passed only part of a program I asked for; and then they waited until just before the election.', 'The new approach to violence requires men in Congress who will work for and fight for laws that will put the terrorists where they belong--not roaming around civil society, but behind bars. That is where they belong.', 'And our new approach calls for a new approach to the interpretation of the laws we already have. I will continue to appoint judges to the Supreme Court and to all the courts who have an awareness of the rights of the victim as well as the rights of the accused.', 'And I need men in the United States Senate like Paul Fannin who will back me up when I send those recommendations for such judges to the United States Senate.', 'Third, our new approach to violence calls for a new attitude on the part of the American people---on your part, all of us. ""Law and order"" are not code words for racism or repression. ""Law and order"" are code words for freedom from fear in America.', 'This new attitude means that parents must exercise their responsibility for moral guidance. It means that college administrators and college faculties must stop caving in to the demands of a radical few. It means that moderate students must take a position that says to the violent: ""Hit the books or hit the road.""', ""This new attitude means that all Americans should stand with the men who are assigned to carry out the laws. After all, my friends, the first step toward respect for law is respect for the lawman. Let's give him the respect that he deserves."", ""Today I have been describing two approaches to violence in America. While the goal of ending violence is the same, the two approaches are very different. But don't let anybody tell you everybody is against violence, it is not an issue. The two approaches are deeply different. It is an issue, one of the central issues in America today."", 'If we do not act now to protect our freedom, we will lose our freedom. If we do not choose the tough-minded approach to violence, we will allow violence to gain a terrible momentum. If a man chooses to dress differently, to wear his hair differently--if he has any---or to talk in a way that repels decent people, that is his business. But when he picks up a rock, then it becomes your business and my business to stop him. Because, you see, that is what American freedom is all about.', ""When a man cannot bring his child-and I see so many wonderful children here today--when he can't bring his child to a political rally for fear that the person in the next seat is going to start yelling some filthy obscenity; when a man can't bring his wife to a rally for fear she is going to be pushed around by an unruly mob; and when any American faces the risk of a rock being thrown at him when he rises to speak, then I say appeasement has gone too far and it is time to draw the line."", 'Since 1776, this great Nation of ours has never knuckled under to the tactics of terror, abroad or at home, and we are not about to start in the year 1970.', 'And now could I add a personal note? The terrorists, the far left, would like nothing better than to make the President of the United States a prisoner in the White House. Well, let me just set them straight. As long as I am President, no band of violent thugs is going to keep me from going out and speaking with the American people wherever they want to hear me and wherever I want to go-. This is a free country, and I fully intend to share that freedom with my fellow Americans. This President is not going to be cooped up in the White House.', 'To keep this country free, to adopt the new approach to violence, to answer those who shout their four-letter words and abuse the right of free speech, what can you do, particularly you of voting age, as an individual? I will tell you what.', ""You don't have to shout back the same obscenities. You don't have to pick up a rock or a stone or a bomb. You have your vote. That is more powerful than any obscenity, any word; more powerful than a bomb. That vote of yours is what makes this Government respond. That vote of yours can bring about the new tough-minded approach to violence that threatens freedom."", 'Many people have asked me why I have been campaigning so hard in the past few weeks when my own name isn\'t on the ballot. ""You are risking your prestige,"" they say. ""After all, if some of the people you campaign for lose, you are going to be hurt."" I am a lot less interested in my prestige than I am in the future of this country that we all love.', 'The American people, and the people of Arizona joined with them, elected me 2 years ago to do a job. I am trying to do that job, and I need help. I need help in the Congress to put across the programs that wall make America strong enough to bring a full generation of peace abroad and strong enough to turn back the threat to peace and order at home.', 'My fellow Americans, America is a great country. Americans are a great people. And Americans together share a great future. I have seen this. I have felt this from an airplane hangar in Vermont to the warmth and good will of that vast majority of the people in San Jose.', 'I want to say, too, to young Americans, as I said last night and I repeat it here with so many young Americans: Night after night on the television screen you get an inaccurate picture of young Americans. You see the bomb throwers, the rock throwers, those shouting out the filthy words, trying to shout down speakers. And you get the impression that they are a majority of young Americans or maybe the leaders of the future.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have seen young Americans all over the country and those that appear on the television screens night after night, they are not a majority of young Americans today and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', 'My fellow Americans, the message in the campaign of 1970 is very simple. It is this: Have faith in this great country. Have faith in your ability to improve this country with your vote. And have faith in a system that has resisted attack from the violent few for almost two centuries.', 'Nobody is going to tear this country down as long as you are ready to cast your vote to build this country up.']"

First, before speaking of those that are running, I want to say something about a man who is not on the ticket, but with whom I have been very proud to work over the past 4 years: Paul Laxalt.', 'He has made a record for progressive leadership in this State which has been an example for all of the Governors of the Nation. And I am very, very happy to pay respects to him, to thank him for his public service and tell him that I look forward to the day when he returns to public service at some time in the future.', 'I am very happy that in the State of Nevada, and I think the people of Nevada should be happy, that in the Lieutenant Governor of this State, Ed Fike, you have a man who will continue in the tradition of Paul Laxalt.', 'May I say something quite personal about him? I have known Ed Fike for 15 years. Long before he became Lieutenant Governor, I knew him as I campaigned in this State. He is a man of very great intelligence. He is a hard-working man. He is a man who knows government. He is a man of unquestioned honesty and integrity. I am proud to endorse him.', 'And now I turn to the race for the United States Senate. This is, my friends, in Nevada, one of the most important races in the Nation. It is one of the most important races in the Nation, because the contest for the United States Senate this year is probably the most important contest for the United States Senate in the whole 190-year history of this country.', ""I say that because we have a Senate over the past 2 years that is evenly divided. On vote after vote, a shift of one vote makes the difference as to whether the policies that the President recommends-I don't mean everything, but I mean those policies he recommends in which he has pledged action for the American people-a shift of one vote determines whether those policies are going to be approved or whether they are not going to be approved."", 'And so, today, I want to talk to you about your next United States Senator, what the vote means, why I am here, and what I would hope you would do.', 'I am not going to talk to you in terms of: if you are a Republican I want you to vote Republican, or a Democrat, vote Democrat, or as the case might be.', ""As we get toward the last days of this campaign, I say what happens to America is far more important than whether you are a Democrat or Republican. Let's vote American this year."", 'Both of the candidates for the United States Senate are good Americans. I know both of them. It happens that in the case of one candidate, the man who is the present incumbent Senator, I have had some differences. I respect his right to differ.', 'It happens also that as far as the candidate I am supporting, Bill Raggio, I find that he does not agree with me on everything.', 'In the great tradition of Nevada, he is not going to be a rubber stamp. He is going to vote his convictions and I respect that in any man. That is the kind of man you want in the United States Senate.', 'Now, let me put it right straight from the shoulder like the people of Nevada like it. And I have been here enough to know how you like to hear it.', 'I was elected President of the United States in 1968. Nevada voted for me for President of the United States. When I was elected President of the United States, I made some promises to the people of America. The people of America expect their Presidents--and they have every right to expect their Presidents--to keep their promises.', 'The President of the United States is a very powerful man. Because this is the richest country and the strongest country in the world, he is the most powerful man in the world, probably.', 'But the President of the United States cannot do what needs to be done. He cannot keep the promises that he made to the American people and that the American people want him to keep and expect him to keep, unless he has people in the Senate and in the House who will vote with him, rather than against him on the big issues.', 'Let me be more precise: There are many, many votes in the course of a year in the United States Senate. Nobody votes with the administration all the time. I do not expect it. I would not respect one who agreed with me every bit of the time, because no one in our country is right all the time. We just try to be right.', 'But, on the other hand, I think it is only appropriate that the voters of Nevada know what the facts are with regard to this Senate contest.', ""Again I repeat, the present Senator from Nevada is a man who with sincere conviction has voted against the President 70 percent of the time on the key issues. Now, let's repeat again. Let us understand what we are talking about."", 'I was elected President. I made some promises. If I can keep those promises I will, if I am able to. I can do so only if I have support from the United States Senate, a Senate that is divided usually by a majority of one.', 'I respect a man in the Senate when he votes against me from time to time. But, it seems to me, that the man who is elected President of the country and who received the endorsement and the support of the State of Nevada in that election, should have a Senator--not one that votes with him 100 percent of the time, but certainly one who will vote with him more than 50 percent of the time. And Bill Raggio will do that.', 'So you see the key question that you are going to have to answer. You want me to do a job, you want me to keep my promises. I am going to do that job and I want to keep my promises. The question is: Do you want a Senator who is going to vote against me 70 percent of the time or one who more than half the time will support the President on the big issues?', 'Now let me come to the big issues and you can then give your own evaluation as to whether or not you believe the President deserves support on those issues.', 'I begin with what is certainly the most important issue of all. You remember when I spoke in the campaign that I said over and over again that the primary responsibility of the next President of the United States would be to develop policies that would bring lasting peace in the world. I have been working toward that end. We have made progress toward that end.', 'The war in Vietnam, in which we had 550,000 Americans there when I arrived in office, instead of having the situation where for 5 years we were sending men into Vietnam, they have been coming out by the tens of thousands. I think the American people like that policy.', 'We have a peace plan on the conference table in Paris.', 'Casualties are down as a result of the strong action I took in Cambodia. And so, as a result of this, we are on the road to ending the war in Vietnam and ending it in a way that we will discourage those who might start another war.', 'And let me make that point very precisely, because I note here as I note in some other places people who understandably say ""Peace now.""Let me tell you, the problem is not ending a war. America has ended three wars in this century. We ended World War I, you remember. We ended World War II. We ended the Korean war.', 'But listen to this, you younger people that are here, all the members of those high school bands and the college students: Do you realize that in this century, despite the fact that we have ended the three wars, we have never had a full generation of peace?', 'And so I have made a pledge to myself, and I make a pledge to the American people: We are going to end this war in a way that will discourage the warmakers so that we will have a chance to have a generation of peace for all Americans.', 'That is why when key amendments like Cooper-Church come up, that is why it is very important that we have in the United States Senate men who will back the President, back the President in a chance to get a just peace, one that will last, rather than a temporary peace.', 'Now we come to the broader aspect of peace. I speak here in Nevada, a State which is one of the key States in our whole defense and space complex. Let me tell you about that defense program, why it is so important.', 'The President of the United States and his colleagues are going to have to negotiate in the months and perhaps the years ahead with the Soviet Union in the critical area of nuclear arms. I have indicated that we should move from a period of confrontation to negotiation.', ""As we negotiate, it is vitally essential that we have something to negotiate with. In other words, it is essential, when you are negotiating with somebody else, that the President of the United States negotiate from strength and not from weakness. So let's keep America strong."", 'And now I come to one of those key votes, a key vote where a majority of one determined whether the United States President would negotiate from strength rather than from weakness.', 'A year ago, I made a very hard decision, a decision that because the Soviet Union had an ABM missile defense, the United States should try to have one.', 'I recommended it to the United States Senate. The vote came up in the United States Senate. The vote was 50--50. The present Senator from Nevada, who is running against Bill Raggio, voted against the President of the United States.', 'Let me say, my friends, I think that on that particular vote that you must realize that had that vote gone against the President of the United States, had that majority of one gone that way, it would have meant that we would not have had that missile defense, which is essential to see to it that America has the strength, and that the President has the strength at the bargaining table that he is going to need if we are going to be able to negotiate a peaceful settlement.', 'I give this only as an example, and I simply leave to you the question again that comes: Remember, in the next Senate, one vote may determine whether the President has the strength that this Nation needs when he goes to the bargaining table or whether he negotiates from weakness.', 'Also, it relates to the State of Nevada in a very direct sense. The test center here in Nevada is essential and indispensable to our defense program. The test center here in Nevada is essential and indispensable to our space program.', 'Unless we have a Senator who votes for what the President says is necessary for national defense, we are not going to have anything to test at the test center. So why not Bill Raggio on that particular point?', 'What I am simply suggesting is this: Everybody, of course, is for peace and everybody is for defense, in the general sense. But you get down to the critical votes we must realize that America first needs defense, and second, that if we are going to have that defense it means we have to have Senators and Congressmen who will back the President in those critical votes that make the difference between whether we have strength or weakness at the conference table.', ""I know where Bill Raggio stands. I know that on those votes involving national security, involving not only the security of this Nation but involving Nevada's participation in that program, he will be with the President of the United States more than 50 percent of the time."", 'And the other point that I would make is this: You know, in the last days of a campaign rumors begin to fly around. I frankly have been quite shocked to find rumors to the effect that immediately after this election unless the present Senator from Nevada is reelected, that Nevada can simply forget the programs for the test center and the rest that presently it is participating in.', 'Well, I can tell you that is pure nonsense. Bill Raggio is a man in whom I have confidence. He is a man who will have, certainly, the ear of those who make the decisions in the Defense Department and in the White House, and when Bill Raggio comes to talk to us about those matters he will be listened to.', 'Nevada is not going to be shortchanged. It will play a great role in the future as it has in the past in the defense and space programs of the United States of America.', ""Now we come to issues that are at home. And here there is one that is directly related to something that we are all concerned about, the whole problem of reform of government in America. We don't want to go back to programs of the past."", ""We realize that it doesn't make sense to put good money into bad programs. And that is why this administration has recommended a whole series of programs to reform the institutions of government. I want to give you one example, the welfare program."", 'Here is what we found when we went in: We found a program in welfare in which the number on the welfare rolls all over America was going up and up and up, and that costs were going up into billions of dollars.', 'Cities and counties and States were practically going bankrupt because of the cost of welfare. New York City alone-listen to these figures in 1966, in New York City there were 600,000 people on welfare. In 1970, 4 years later, there were 1,200,000 people on welfare. If the present welfare program continues, we will find that by 1980 there will be 2.5 million people on welfare in one city, New York City.', 'My friends, that kind of a program does not make sense.', 'I say this: That when a program has the effect of making it more profitable for a man not to work than to work, when it encourages a man to desert his family rather than stay with his family, you ought to get rid of that program and get another one in its place.', 'That is why I am very proud that in this great, rich country of ours I have been able to recommend a program in which we will provide for every family in America that needs assistance, assistance that could provide, certainly, the needs that they require, but provide that assistance without the degrading aspects of the social snoopers of the present welfare program, but also one that would have work incentive and work requirement.', ""Because, my friends, if a man is able to work, if a man is trained for a job, if a man is offered a job, and if he refuses to work, he shouldn't be paid to loaf by a hard-working taxpayer of the State of Nevada."", 'I made another promise to the people of Nevada and the people of America, and you well remember it. In 1968, I found that over the previous 8 years, crime had gone up 150 percent in this country: organized crime, street crime, drugs, narcotics. I said that I would appoint stronger judges. I said that I would ask for stronger laws. And I said I would appoint a stronger Attorney General and stronger U.S. attorneys.', 'I have tried to keep my promises, my friends. I appointed a great Attorney General-John Mitchell who is doing a fine job in that particular aspect.', 'I have appointed strong judges, but here, again, the United States Senate comes in. When I appoint a strong judge, one who is strong on the issue of law and order, one who believes in strengthening the peace forces against the criminal forces, I think the President deserves the support of the Senator rather than his opposition. And I think we will have that support from Bill Raggio.', ""I asked for strong laws and it took 18 months for the first law--I presented the program 18 months ago---for the first, the one on organized crime, to reach my desk. That isn't soon enough."", 'We need a man in the United States Senate who knows the subject, a man who will work on it, a man who will vote on it, a man who will fight for it all year long and not just talk about it during election time.', 'Bill Raggio knows this subject. He has been one of my chief advisers in the field of law enforcement. He is a man who will be invaluable to us in the United States Senate. I say send him down there so that he can help us see that the wave of crime is not becoming the wave of the future in America.', 'And now, my friends in Nevada, could I make reference to a very gracious remark that was made by Paul Laxalt in his introduction. He referred to an incident in California e days ago, in San Jose. He referred to the fact that the reception here in Nevada was a very warm one.', 'When I was in Phoenix, I saw a sign which said, ""Welcome, Mr. President. This is Phoenix, not San Jose.""', 'My friends, I think it is well that that incident be put into context. San Jose is one of my favorite cities in California. It is a great, growing city, like this great, growing city of Las Vegas. It is made up of fine people, just like this city is made up of fine people. And what a few violent radicals did should not smear the good name of San Jose, California.', 'The president of the student body of San Jose State College--24,000 strong-sent me a wire and said, ""The great majority of our students disapprove of what happened there at San Jose.""', 'So let me put the whole thing in perspective very simply by saying this: Night after night on our television screens we see these evidences of violence, rather than seeing, often, huge crowds like this, or 50,000 in Columbus, or 35,000 in Johnson City, or 20,000 standing in the rain in Asheville, or 35,000 in Longview, Texas.', 'You may see a little of that, but what makes bigger news are the violent few throwing rocks, shouting their obscenities at the President or anybody else who happens to be in view.', 'My friends, let me simply say that on that score, I think young America is getting a bad rap from that kind of thing because, my friends, I think it is well for you to realize that as a result of what we see night after night on our television screens, as a result of the fact that bad news makes most of the news, many Americans are getting the impression that the radical few among you are a majority of American youth today or may be the leaders of American youth tomorrow.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have been all over this country. I have been in the great States and the smaller States. I have been in the North, in the East, in the West, and the South. I have seen big crowds of adults and I have seen lots of young people.', 'I can tell you that the radical few that you see on your TV screen night after night, they are not a majority of American youth today and they will not be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""Let's separate out the problem. Let us understand. American youth is and deserves our commendation for its idealism, for the fact that they want change, for the fact that they want peace in the world, for the fact that they want a better chance for people that don't have the opportunity that they have."", 'And for this idealism, they should receive the high marks, and we should be proud of our American youth.', 'But, my friends, let us recognize that when we talk about being for peace and the rest, we have to separate those things that are right and those things that are wrong in a free society. I simply want to lay it right on the line, and I lay it on the line to you as clearly as I possibly can.', 'I say to you here today that those who carry a peace sign in one hand and throw a brick or a bomb with the other are the top hypocrites of our time.', ""And to the young people of America, let me tell you: Don't you lose faith in your country. You sometimes must get the impression from what you read, maybe what you hear at school, that America abroad is not held up in high regard, that we are considered to be imperialists; and at home, that America is a sick society."", 'I know different. I have had a very great privilege in these past few months as President of the United States to travel all over this world--to Asia, to Europe, and to all parts of the world. And every place I go, I have been moved by the fact that hundreds of thousands of people come out.', 'In Communist Yugoslavia and Communist Romania, hundreds of thousands came out and stood in the rain, cheering the President of the United States. And the same was true in Spain, in Ireland, and other countries, and India.', 'Why? I will tell you why they cheered the President of the United States: not because of who he was but because of the country he represented. They know that the United States of America is the strongest nation in the world. But they know that the United States of America will not use its strength ever to destroy freedom, only to defend it; that we will not use our strength to break the peace, only to keep the peace. And we can be proud of that, that we represent that kind of a country.', 'And they know something else, too. They know America has problems, but they know that in America there is more freedom, there is more opportunity, there is more progress than in any nation in the whole history of civilization.', 'Listen to this: I mentioned a moment ago the program that I have recommended, which will provide assistance for every family that needs it in America. Now, the level of that program, what it would provide, the floor for income for every family in need in America--the floor for the poor in America--is higher than the ceiling for three-fourths of the people that live in the world today.', ""Let's recognize once and for all, America has its faults. But because we are rich, we are able to do things that other countries can only dream about. We can lift the burden of toil from our people, not just a few elite but from all the people of the United States. We can provide opportunity for all."", 'And with this in mind, let us be proud of our country. Let us be proud of it, and let us answer those who run it down and knock it down and tear it down and express their hate.', ""I will tell you how to answer them. You don't have to answer them by throwing rocks back. You don't have to answer them by answering with their four-letter epithets."", 'The way to answer them is for the great silent majority just to stand up and be counted on November 3d.', 'By your votes on November 3d you can--some of you will vote how I recommend, some will vote otherwise--but by your votes, you will say, in effect, to the people of America, to the people of the world, this is what we believe.', 'And I leave this final message with you: As the President of the United States, I would not urge anyone to vote anything other than his convictions. But I have made some promises to the American people. I want to keep those promises. I need help. I need Bill Raggio.', 'And as I make those promises, and in keeping those promises, I want to tell you what I see for America.', 'A vote for Bill Raggio and for support for the programs that I have pledged to the American people will mean that we can achieve these great goals in our time: We can achieve prosperity without war. We can have progress without inflation. We can stop the wave of crime and have respect for law and order and justice in America.', 'And we can have what everybody wants, peace for a generation for America and the whole world. That is what we are fighting for. That is what I ask you to vote for.', 'Thank you.']"
39,Richard Nixon ,"October 31, 1970","['I wanted to make a brief statement because the question was raised--and you can all cover it--about one of these Halloween rumors.', 'I have found, in three States that I have visited, and this always happens in campaigns, the Halloween fear tactic being used by some of the opposition.', 'First, in California, they told 3,000 workers in Mountain View, California, that the Ames laboratory was going to close.', 'It was an absolutely false statement. There have never been any plans to close it. There has never been any discussion of it. It was made up out of the whole cloth.', 'Then when I got to Nevada, I found today from Mr. Raggio 1 that his opponent had indicated that we intended to close down or sharply restrict the use of the Nevada test center.', 'Exactly the contrary is the case in Nevada. As everybody knows, I am for the antiballistic missile system and for a strong defense, and we are going to have more use for the Nevada test center rather than less. So I reassured the people there.', 'But I think perhaps the most shocking thing was when I learned here from one of the people over at the fence said that somebody came by door to door and was telling people that were at the Hill Air Force Base that that was going to be closed immediately after the election.', 'I checked into it. There is absolutely no truth whatever in that rumor. It is another one of the scare tactics of the opposition. The Hill Air Force Base is going to be maintained, and those who engage in this kind of tactic, I think, owe an apology to the families, to the workers that they have frightened, and, frankly, an apology to their opponents for making such charges.', ""I understand hard campaigning. We should campaign on the issues. But the idea of going around and trying to scare families and scare workers that bases are going to be closed when they are not going to be closed is, in my view, absolutely unconscionable. It is the worst kind of fear campaigning and it isn't even worthy of Halloween.""]"
40,Richard Nixon ,"October 31, 1970","['Governor Cargo, Congressman Foreman, Congressman Lujan, all of the distinguished guests on the platform, and this wonderful audience here in Albuquerque:', 'Somebody reminded me, as I was at the airport, that I had not campaigned in New Mexico in the 1968 elections. I did, however, campaign when I was running for President in 1960. I remember what I said.', 'I said that I would return to New Mexico as President of the United States. I am returning, but a little later than I thought.', 'I want to express my appreciation to all of you who have come here, to the enormous overflow audience outside. I hope they can listen by loudspeakers. We tried to shake hands with a few as we came in.', ""My appreciation, too, to the musical organizations that are here. I don't want to overlook any of them, but I understand that outside we have the Manzano High School Band."", 'So that there is no discrimination, the Manzano choral group is inside, right over here.', 'I understand that inside we have also the Paul Muench Jazz Band. That is here someplace. And somebody told me the Highland High School Band is here.', 'I just hope our candidates score as well as Highland High School has been scoring in its football games.', 'On this occasion in the closing days of the campaign, I have come to New Mexico, as you know, to talk to you about a very important decision that you will be making next Tuesday. I am not going to talk to you in the usual terms that you hear at the close of a campaign--you know, vote Republican or vote Democratic, regardless of what you may think of the man.', 'I would like to talk to you in terms that I think are more appropriate to the times and ones that the people of New Mexico particularly appreciate.', 'I realize that I would not have carried New Mexico in 1968, had it not been for the fact that I had the support, not only of Republicans but of great numbers of Democrats and Independents.', ""And so today, I address my remarks to all the people of New Mexico, and to those that may be listening in other parts of the country, to all the people of America. I don't expect all of you to agree. I only ask you to consider what I have and my responsibilities are, and to consider my recommendations in that light, and then make your decisions on November 3d and let it be a decision of the majority and not just of the few who might take the time to go to the polls."", 'Therefore, in that spirit, I would like to talk to you about our candidates, the people that I think deserve your support.', 'First, at the State level: I think you have a great State ticket right here in the State of New Mexico. Pete Domenici is a man that I have not known well in the past, but that I got to know during the course of this campaign.', 'What I like about him is that he has his eyes on the future. He is thinking of the future of young people. He is thinking of jobs. He is thinking of jobs and progress.', 'Like Dave Cargo before him, also a man who thought of this State in terms of the future, he is thinking of how this great, beautiful State can move into the seventies and the eighties with all of the promise that it has.', 'As our plane circled Albuquerque, and as we came down, I thought what a beautiful country this is. I thought what a really beautiful country it is.', 'And I thought how wise it was that we were putting so many of our Federal installations here, our defense installations.', 'And incidentally, they are here because this is the place they should be, because this is the area where I believe we can best serve the interests of America, not just the interests of New Mexico.', 'I think, too, of the future. I think of other Federal installations and why, instead of going as they so often do too often, to the overcrowded centers of population on one end of the country or the other, they can come to this great area in the middle of the country, in which people have a chance to live in a State with all of the progress and all of the possibilities that New Mexico has.', 'It is because Pete Domenici is a man of the future, a man who understands the problems of the future. I am for him all the way and I hope you are for him.', ""Now, I am going to talk about the House races a moment. Normally, I haven't had a chance to go into House races, because usually when I appear in a State like California or Ohio, there are so many House candidates that if I mention the candidates, I will have no time to mention the Senate candidate, and I have to say something about him, too, usually."", 'As far as your House candidates here, you have two. They are men who surprised everybody by winning in 1968. They are going to win again in 1970. I can tell you.', 'Ed Foreman and Manny Lujan, I have valued their support. They have been with the President on the great issues. I value them as friends. I believe they are wonderful representatives of their districts, of this State, and of America. I ask you to support them.', 'And now, I come to the candidate for the United States Senate. Let me say first that I understand there was a primary in this State, as there were in others. Let me say, second, that I think that in the best interest of the State and the best interest of the Nation, it is in a fine tradition that the man who was not successful in the primary is supporting the man who was.', 'Let me say I have won a few elections, I have lost a few, and believe me, winning is a lot more fun.', 'Therefore, my hat is off to Dave Cargo, who is giving his support to the man I am supporting, Andy Carter, for the United States Senate.', 'I want to tell you now why it is so very, very important that that happen. Why even despite the fact that you have a primary campaign--and you know how people can get pretty stirred up about the other fellow, what he said and what his people said about you and all the rest.', 'But this year, personal differences, personal attitudes, party labels cannot be the major consideration in our decision. What is involved in the campaign for the United States Senate is a decision that is more important than in any Senate race in the whole history of this country, in my opinion.', 'Let me tell you about the United States Senate today. It is divided very, very closely. If you have watched the votes, a change of one vote on national defense, a change of one vote on our peace policy in Vietnam, a change of one vote on the approval of a judge who would take a strong line on law and order, a change of one vote in issue after issue might have changed the result.', 'So what we are talking about is the man--it happens to be in this case Andy Carter, in other States it happens to be the other candidates I am supporting-but a man, who could make the difference as to whether the people of New Mexico want to send down to. Washington, D.C., a man who, on not all votes because we want a man to be independent but on the great votes, the votes that make the difference, the ones which enable the President to keep the promises that he made to the American people---whether that man is going to be with the President or against him.', ""And I say I come here to New Mexico because I made some promises to the people of this Nation in 1968. The people expect me to keep those promises. I am trying to keep those promises. I can't keep them unless I have more support in the Senate, more support in the House of Representatives."", 'And it is because Andy Carter will be with me rather than against me in the big issues, I ask you to support him for the United States Senate.', 'Now for just a few moments, listen to me carefully as I outline what I consider to be perhaps the four major issues that you are thinking about, that the people of America are thinking about, the four big issues where there is a clear difference of opinion between two men in this State. I respect both. I am not here to campaign against a man personally, or the rest.', 'But four great issues where Andy Carter will be with me and where the present man who is in the Senate has opposed me--not me as a person, but opposed those policies and those programs that I pledged to put into effect if I were elected President.', 'First, let me talk about the problem of peace. I am referring not to just peace for the next election. I am referring to peace for the next generation.', 'Here is what I found. When I came into office I found 550,000 men in Vietnam, no plans to bring them home; casualties 300 a week, going up; no peace plan. We went to work. And as we went to work what we did is that instead of sending more men to Vietnam, we are bringing them home by the tens of thousands.', 'My friends, our casualties are the lowest in 4 1/2 years. We have a peace plan on the bargaining table in Paris. And I will say this, we are on the road. Our plan is working. The war is coming to an end. And we are going to end it in a way in which we are going to discourage those that might start another war.', 'Now let me tell you why it is important to do it that way. The problem, my friends, is not ending a war. To all of you young people here, you study this in college, and you study it in high school, and you have read about what has happened in this century. We ended World War I, you remember. We ended World War II, you remember that. We ended the Korean war. But did you know that in this whole century we have yet to have a full generation of peace, and I have pledged to myself and I have pledged to the American people we are going to end this war in a way that will discourage the warmakers so that we can have a full generation of peace for the American people.', ""And the question then is very clear. Andy Carter's opponent has voted consistently for those proposals in the United States Senate that would not back the President on this issue; that would call for a precipitate withdrawal; that would mean that we would end the war all right but end it in a way that the United States would, in effect, suffer either humiliation or defeat."", 'My friends, defeat or humiliation for the United States anyplace in the world hurts the cause of peace. We have to have a United States that is respected in the world, and we are not going to be defeated.', 'There is also a second important principle if we are going to have a generation of peace. We have to keep America strong.', 'Let me tell you why: The President of the United States has a responsibility, along with his associates, for negotiating with the Soviet Union and other major powers, and particularly with the Soviet Union on limiting nuclear arms so that we can reduce the danger of any war, and particularly a nuclear war.', 'We are going to proceed in that era of negotiation. But in order to do so, we have to have some cards on our side of the table. And what we find here, then, is another clear difference of opinion. On the one hand, the present Senator, against whom Andy Carter is running, voted-and I know he believed this way, he was sincere in voting that way--voted to take one card away, voted against having a missile defense for the United States when the Soviet Union had it.', ""I say don't send the President of the United States to the bargaining table with the Soviet Union in a position of weakness. Put him there in a position of strength. That is what we need to have."", ""And it doesn't do any good to talk about bases in New Mexico and vote against the programs for the defense of the United States in Washington, D.C."", 'There is a clear difference of opinion between two honest men, and I say to you one is for, one is against. But I have the responsibility, and I am going to have it for the next 2 years, the responsibility to make the decisions that I think will bring an end to the war in a way that will promote a lasting peace for the world. And I ask for your support, the support of the people of New Mexico on that issue.', 'We have another problem closely related to this: the problem of peace at home. Why is peace at home related to the problem of peace abroad? Because the United States is the leader of the free world. As the Nation that has in its hands the responsibility for being an example of a society of order, if we are not able to keep order at home, we are not going to be able to exert the leadership that is necessary to advocate a rule of law and order abroad.', 'So the question of peace at home is very important. It is, of course, important another way: because it affects the safety of our homes, the safety of our children, of our wives, of all of us in this country.', ""Here is what I found there: I found, when I came into office, that crime had gone up 158 percent in 8 years, and I found the reason for it---one of the reasons, at least, the major reason, was an attitude of permissiveness toward crime, again by well-intentioned people--I just don't happen to agree with them--but well-intentioned people. Permissiveness by judges, permissiveness by law enforcement officials, and permissiveness by lawmakers who didn't pass the strong laws that were needed."", 'In the campaign of 1968, if you heard me on television, if you heard my acceptance speech at Miami, you heard what I said.', 'I said that I would appoint a stronger Attorney General. I said I would appoint stronger judges. I said I would ask for stronger laws. I have tried to do all of those things.', 'This is what has happened: We have the Senate of the United States delaying and delaying and delaying in approving the judges who will take a strong stand in strengthening what I think the American people want. We need to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in the United States of America.', 'I asked for stronger laws, and what happened?', 'Ed Foreman can tell you, and Manny Lujan can tell you.', 'For 18 months, they dillydallied and waited, and I just got, just as the election was coming, the first bill on organized crime, and the next one dealing with drugs and narcotics. We must do better than that. We need men in the United States Senate, a man like Andy Carter, and the two men that are your candidates here, men who will support the President when he asks for stronger laws, men who will vote to approve those judges, who are going to take that strong position for respect for law and for enforcing the law.', 'We need men who will do that, because only that way can I keep the promise I made to the American people. And I make it again here to you today.', 'The wave of crime is not going to be the wave of the future for these young people of America.', 'And now to the fourth point. I direct this particularly to those thinking of the future of this great western part of the United States which we all love and which we share together.', 'That is: What does the future hold? Here we have programs of progress, what kind of an America are we going to build? You know, we are a rather young country by some standards but very aid in terms of the democracies in the world--190 years old. We are going to celebrate our 200th anniversary, as you know, the Declaration of Independence, in 1976. And I have been thinking of what we want America to be then.', ""Among those things that I want, I say it is time to reform the institutions of government. One thing we need to do: Instead of having, as has been the case for 190 years, a power constantly flowing from the States and from the people to Washington, let's reverse it. I think it is time to have the power flow back from Washington to the States and to the people. Let's bring power to the people of the United States of America."", 'I am sure you young people here say, ""That is just a good political science point. What is it all about? Why does it mean something?"" I will tell you why it means it: because it means better government. It means government that is closer to the people. It means that decisions that are made with regard to the future of the people of New Mexico will be made by people closer to home rather than some bureaucrat back in Washington, D.C., who may not know what is best for people here.', 'It means also, looking to the period of reform, that we in Washington now--and this is part of our exciting new program-we are thinking of where people are going to be. We are thinking of what is really the new frontier in this country. It is no longer in the Far West; it is no longer far across the oceans.', 'But it is in that section of the country over which those who went clear to the Far West traveled.', 'Here in New Mexico, in Arizona, in Nevada, in Colorado, in Montana--what a great part of the country in which we need to see that there is the development of opportunities-opportunities for jobs, opportunities for progress---so that people that want to live in one of the best parts of America can have a job so that they can live here. That is what we stand for.', 'And now, finally, I want to speak briefly about a sign I saw at your airport. The sign said, ""This is not San Jose. Welcome?\'', ""And, friends, I expected you to react that way when I said that. But now I want to tell you what the truth of the matter is. Don't get the wrong impression of San Jose, and don't get it, because, my friends, I have been to that beautiful city in California many times. It is a city, like the city of Albuquerque, that the people are very proud of. It is a city of peace-loving people, a city in which people come out, as they do here, 3,000, to hear the President of the United States, who listen, who try to give him an opportunity to express his views, and then give others the opportunity to express contrary views if they want to."", 'I simply want to say to you that what happened in San Jose was the work of a very few, a violent few. Let me also say that in every city I have seen young people, some of them carrying signs saying ""Peace now,"" some of them indicating opposition to the President, opposition to his proposals. They have every right to do that. They have a right to speak out.', ""What I do say, however, is this: I say that for--and here is where we draw the line--that those who carry a peace sign in one hand and a bomb or a brick in 'the other are the super hypocrites of our time."", 'And to the older people here, don\'t get the wrong impression of San Jose--a fine, good, American city, or of San Jose State College, a college of 24,000. The president of the student body wired me and said, ""The overwhelming majority disapproved of what happened there.""', ""Don't get the wrong impression of our young people, I say to you older people here. You see on your television screen night after night the bad young people. Well, it is time we saw more of the good young people on television.Show them. Here they are."", 'I know from what you see on television night after night, you would think that the violent, radical few are a majority of American youth today and may be the leaders of America tomorrow.', 'Well, I have news for you. I have been around this country, and the radical few are not a majority of youth today, and they are not going to be the leaders of America tomorrow.', ""To those of you who are young, may I say, don't lose faith in this country, and don't just agree with everything that those of us who are old, what we have done. I admire American youth. I have faith in American youth."", 'I have faith in you, because you are idealistic, because you do care, because you do want peace, because you want a better life for all people. May you always want it. May you always want to change America for the better.', 'But, remember--and I know you all know this--that in a system that provides a method for peaceful change, there is no cause that justifies resort to violence or lawlessness. That is the simple rule.', 'What can you all do about this? How do you answer the rock throwers and the obscenity shouters?', ""You don't answer them in kind. You have got a more powerful weapon. You have got a peaceful weapon--the weapon of a vote."", 'November 3d you go into the polling booth and vote. Some of you will not vote the way I want you to vote. That is not important. You are going to vote.', 'The important thing is that when you vote on November 3d, that vote is going to represent not the minority but the majority in this country.', 'And I say that it is time for the great silent majority to be heard.', 'Be heard on November 3d. Vote and let America know what you think.']"

It is customary as we get close to an election to speak of voting Republican or voting Democratic.', 'But the issues this year are too important to speak in partisan terms.', 'What we must consider is what is best for America. When I was elected President 2 years ago, I promised that I would work to end the war in Vietnam and win a just peace in the world, that I would work to stop the rise in crime in America, to stop the rise in inflation, and to bring about a period of reform in which we could have progress and prosperity and full employment in America, but without war.', ""We have made progress in all these fields, but not enough. The President of the United States is a very powerful man, but he can't do the job alone. I need the help of the Congress, more help than I have had. I need your help, your help in electing men to the House and the Senate who will work with the President, rather than against the President, for these great goals."", 'For example, in Vietnam we have been bringing men home. We have reduced casualties. We have a peace offer on the table. We are ending the war. We are ending it in a way that will discourage aggression and win a just peace.', 'We need men in the House and the Senate who will support the President in this great objective.', 'And here at home, in the fight against crime, we need laws, we need judges, and we need men in the House and the Senate who will speak out on this subject and who will vote and speak out, not just at election time but all year round.', 'In the fight against inflation, we need men who will have the courage to vote against a spending program that might benefit a few people, but that would raise prices for all the people. And we need men who will vote for our historic and very imaginative programs of reform, which will lead to what we all want: that progress and prosperity without war.', 'There is one final note I would like to leave with you as we approach this election: In recent weeks and in recent months, you have seen on your television screens some of our young people engaging in violence, trying to shout down speakers, and engaging in activities that you disapprove of. And some may get the impression that that is a majority of young America, or that they are the leaders of the future.', 'Well, I can assure you that I have traveled all over this country, and that violent few are not the majority of young Americans, and they are not going to be the leaders of the future.', 'I am proud of the great majority of our young Americans today.', 'They want change, but they believe in peaceful change, as you do.', 'I finally want to say what you can do to answer those who do engage in violence, who do engage in activities that you disapprove of.', ""Don't answer in kind. It is time for the great silent majority to stand up and be counted, and the way you can be counted is by voting on November 3d. I urge you to vote for those men who are candidates for the House and the Senate who will support the President, rather than vote against him on these great issues which I have described tonight."", 'But, however you vote, I can assure you, you have my respect and my very best wishes.']"

As a matter of fact, I was nominated in 1952 and '56, for Vice President, and I have twice had the honor of being nominated for President and tonight makes it the third time."", 'Now, to put this all in the historical context, all of you know that this is the first time in the 195-year proud history of America that young voters 18 to 21 are going to participate in the election decision. And I believe that it is particularly appropriate that the first appearance of the President of the United States, after his nomination, be made before first voters who are voting as you are.', 'Now as I was coming in, I was stopped by one of the fine television commentators, a commentator for the ABG network, and he asked me--as we were trying to talk over the rather, shall we say, quiet audience at the moment--he asked me what was going to happen to the youth vote.', ""He said he was beginning to wonder whether I had concluded that perhaps the estimates that the youth vote was just automatically going to go to our opponents might be a little high. I .can say this, and I want to give you an answer that I want you to think about a bit. I don't think the youth vote is in anybody's pocket. I don't think it ever will be. I think young people are not likely to vote party label. I think they are going to vote what they believe in. They are going to be independent. I think the young people of America are going to listen to both candidates. They are casting their first vote, they want it to be a good vote."", 'We have just as good a shot at it as the other side, and we are going to get it-with your help.', 'Now, I want to express appreciation to all of the celebrities--that is the word we use for them, for Sammy Davis, Jr., and the marvelous groups that you have been hearing here, to Pam Powell--and I want to ask all of you to realize what it means for them to be here.', 'Now, my business is the business of politics. It is a very honored business. I hope lots of you get into it, maybe full time. But I want you to know that when you are in politics you assume--you have to under our system--that what you are trying to do is to get somewhat over half the vote and the other man, or woman, as the case might be, is going to get somewhat less than half.', ""Now, in show business, which is Sammy Davis, Jr.'s business, and the business of others who are here, they are not trying to get half; they are trying to please everybody. So you see, when somebody in show business comes and participates in a political rally, he or she is doing something that is a very great personal sacrifice and even a personal risk."", 'I heard on Monday night one of the television commentators question Sammy Davis, Jr., when he was sitting there with Mrs. Nixon in the Presidential box. He pointed out what I have known and what Sammy Davis, of course, quickly agreed with, that he had been a very enthusiastic supporter of President Kennedy when we ran against each other in 1960. He said he was still a very good friend of the Kennedy family. Then the commentator said, ""What is your reaction, Sammy, to the fact that many people who have been your friends and your supporters, perhaps many who think you are great in show business, think maybe that you have turned against them and that you have done so""--as he put it--""you have sort of sold out because you were invited to the White House to see the President?""', ""Well, just let me give you the answer. You aren't going to buy Sammy Davis, Jr., by inviting him to the White House. You are going to buy him by doing something for America, and that is what we are doing."", 'When Sammy and I and his wife were chatting there that day, I want you to know it was one of the most moving experiences for me and I hope it was for him. We talked about our backgrounds. We both came from rather poor families. We both have done rather well. [Laughter]', ""I know Sammy is a member of the other party. I didn't know, when I talked to him, what he would be doing in this election campaign. But I do know this. I want to make this pledge to Sammy. I want to make it to everybody here, whether you happen to be black or white, or young or old, and all of those who are listening. I believe in the American dream. Sammy Davis believes in it. We believe in it because we have seen it come true in our own lives."", ""But I can assure you, my friends, that the American dream can't be fully realized until every person in this country has an equal chance to see it come true in his life."", 'Today I pledge to you we have worked toward that goal over the past 4 years, we are going to work toward it over the next 4 years. And I want you to know that we are grateful for the celebrities who have stuck their necks out--stuck their necks out, taken the chance, as they have, that they might lose some support, because they realize it is important to get into a campaign that affects their future and the future of their country and the future of their children.', 'Now, I would like to just close on one note about you. This is your first election campaign. It will not be your last. I know that many of you will go into public service. I hope all of you will continue to participate in politics.', 'As you go along, some of you will go into business. Some of you may go into show business. Some of you may go into some other kind of activity where somebody is going to come up to you one election year and say, ""Stay out of the campaign because you might risk some money, you might risk some customers or clients or whatever the case might be.""', ""And I just want to urge you, don't ever do that, because what you do for America is more important than anything you do for yourself. That is what really counts."", 'I want all of you, the young voters of America listening here and those who might be listening on television now, simply to know this: I have been trying to work for your future. We have had some disappointments, but we have had some successes, and I am going to talk about both tomorrow as I make the acceptance speech.', 'But should the opportunity come to serve 4 more years, I am not going to be resting on what we have done in the past.

I hope to address some of you when you are in the hall tomorrow night. But I would like to say a word to you just now: Based on what I have seen on television at this convention, based on the reception that I see and feel here today, those who have predicted that the other side is going to win the young voters are simply wrong. We are going to win them.', 'If I could put that in the proper context, I want you to know that as young people, as new voters, for the first time in history you are going to play a role in electing the next President of the United States. You, as young voters, I know, find this exciting.', 'I know, too, that when the election is over, particularly when we win the election, as we hope we will win it, you will feel very, very cheered up by that and you will want to go on in political life. But I want you to know what your participation in this campaign, what your enthusiasm, what your hard work means to me. I will tell you what it means:', 'Of course we want your votes. We want them very much because your votes could make the difference. And we are going to work for them; we are going to talk to you; we are going to work with you. But we also want something else. We want an Administration after the election, in the next 4 years, in which we can be worthy of the enthusiasm and the trust and the hopes and the ideals of young Americans.', ""As I look at your faces, I know what you want. I know that you are filled with the desire to find America at peace in the world, not just a temporary but a lasting peace.

Let us reject any philosophy that would make us the divided people of America."", 'In that spirit, I address you tonight, my fellow Americans, not as a partisan of party, which would divide us, but as a partisan of principles, which can unite us.', 'Six weeks ago our opponents at their convention rejected many of the great principles of the Democratic Party.

We must cut it further so that we can continue to expand on the greatest accomplishment of our new economic policy: For the first time in 5 years wage increases in America are not being eaten up by price increases.', 'As a result of the millions of new jobs created by our new economic policies, unemployment today in America is less than the peacetime average of the sixties, but we must continue the unparalleled increase in new jobs so that we can achieve the great goal of our new prosperity--a job for every American who wants to work, without war and without inflation. The way to reach this goal is to stay on the new road we have charted to move America forward and not to take a sharp detour to the left, which would lead to a dead end for the hopes of the American people.', 'This points up one of the clearest choices in this campaign. Our opponents believe in a different philosophy.', 'Theirs is the politics of paternalism, where master planners in Washington make decisions for people.', 'Ours is the politics of people--where people make decisions for themselves.', 'The proposal that they have made to pay $1,000 to every person in America insults the intelligence of the American voters.', ""Because you know that every politician's promise has a price--the taxpayer pays the bill."", 'The American people are not going to be taken in by any scheme where Government gives money with one hand and then takes it away with the other.', 'Their platform promises everything to everybody, but at an increased net in the budget of $144 billion, but listen to what it means to you, the taxpayers of the country. That would mean an increase of 50 percent in what the taxpayers of America pay. I oppose any new spending programs which will increase the tax burden on the already overburdened American taxpayer.', 'And they have proposed legislation which would add 82 million people to the welfare rolls.', 'I say that instead of providing incentives for millions of more Americans to go on welfare, we need a program which will provide incentives for people to get off of welfare and to get to work.', ""We believe that it is wrong for anyone to receive more on welfare than for someone who works. Let us be generous to those who can't work without increasing the tax burden of those who do work."", ""And while we are talking about welfare, let us quit treating our senior citizens in this country like welfare recipients. They have worked hard all of their lives to build America. And as the builders of America, they have not asked for a handout. What they ask for is what they have earned--and that is retirement in dignity and self-respect. Let's give that to our senior citizens."", 'Now, when you add up the cost of all of the programs our opponents have proposed, you reach only one conclusion: They would destroy the system which has made America number one in the world economically.', 'Listen to these facts: Americans today pay one-third of all of their income in taxes. If their programs were adopted, Americans would pay over one-half of what they earn in taxes. This means that if their programs are adopted, American wage earners would be working more for the Government than they would for themselves.', 'Once we cross this line, we cannot turn back because the incentive which makes the American economic system the most productive in the world would be destroyed.', 'Theirs is not a new approach. It has been tried before in countries abroad, and I can tell you that those who have tried it have lived to regret it.', 'We cannot and we will not let them do this to America.', ""Let us always be true to the principle that has made America the world's most prosperous nation--that here in America a person should get what he works for and work for what he gets."", 'Let me illustrate the difference in our philosophies. Because of our free economic system, what we have done is to build a great building of economic wealth and money in America. It is by far the tallest building in the world, and we are still adding to it. Now because some of the windows are broken, they say tear it down and start again. We say, replace the windows and keep building. That is the difference.', 'Let me turn now to a second area where my beliefs are totally different from those of our opponents.', ""Four years ago crime was rising all over America at an unprecedented rate. Even our Nation's Capital was called the crime capital of the world. I pledged to stop the rise in crime. In order to keep that pledge, I promised in the election campaign that I would appoint judges to the Federal courts, and particularly to the Supreme Court, who would recognize that the first civil right of every American is to be free from domestic violence."", 'I have kept that promise. I am proud of the appointments I have made to the courts, and particularly proud of those I have made to the Supreme Court of the United States. And I pledge again tonight, as I did 4 years ago, that whenever I have the opportunity to make more appointments to the courts, I shall continue to appoint judges who share my philosophy that we must strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in the United States.', 'We have launched an all-out offensive against crime, against narcotics, against permissiveness in our country.', 'I want the peace officers across America to know that they have the total backing of their President in their fight against crime.', 'My fellow Americans, as we move toward peace abroad, I ask you to support our programs which will keep the peace at home.', 'Now, I turn to an issue of overriding importance not only to this election, but for generations to come--the progress we have made in building a new structure of peace in the world.', 'Peace is too important for partisanship. There have been five Presidents in my political lifetime--Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson.', 'They had differences on some issues, but they were united in their belief that where the security of America or the peace of the world is involved we are not Republicans, we are not Democrats. We are Americans, first, last, and always.', 'These five Presidents were united in their total opposition to isolation for America and in their belief that the interests of the United States and the interests of world peace require that America be strong enough and intelligent enough to assume the responsibilities of leadership in the world.', 'They were united in the conviction that the United States should have a defense second to none in the world.', 'They were all men who hated war and were dedicated to peace.', 'But not one of these five men, and no President in our history, believed that America should ask an enemy for peace on terms that would betray our allies and destroy respect for the United States all over the world.', ""As your President, I pledge that I shall always uphold that proud bipartisan tradition. Standing in this Convention Hall 4 years ago, I pledged to seek an honorable end to the war in Vietnam. We have made great progress toward that end. We have brought over half a million men home, and more will be coming home. We have ended America's ground combat role. No draftees are being sent to Vietnam. We have reduced our casualties by 98 percent. We have gone the extra mile, in fact we have gone tens of thousands of miles trying to seek a negotiated settlement of the war. We have offered a cease-fire, a total withdrawal of all American forces, an exchange of all prisoners of war, internationally supervised free elections with the Communists participating in the elections and in the supervision."", 'There are three things, however, that we have not and that we will not offer.', 'We will never abandon our prisoners of war.', 'Second, we will not join our enemies in imposing a Communist government on our allies--the 17 million people of South Vietnam.', 'And we will never stain the honor of the United States of America.', 'Now I realize that many, particularly in this political year, wonder why we insist on an honorable peace in Vietnam. From a political standpoint they suggest that since I was not in office when over a half million American men were sent there, that I should end the war by agreeing to impose a Communist government on the people of South Vietnam and just blame the whole catastrophe on my predecessors.', 'This might be good politics, but it would be disastrous to the cause of peace in the world. If, at this time, we betray our allies, it will discourage our friends abroad and it will encourage our enemies to engage in aggression.', 'In areas like the Mideast, which are danger areas, small nations who rely on the friendship and support of the United States would be in deadly jeopardy.', 'To our friends and allies in Europe, Asia, the Mideast, and Latin America, I say the United States will continue its great bipartisan tradition--to stand by our friends and never to desert them.', 'Now in discussing Vietnam, I have noted that in this election year there has been a great deal of talk about providing amnesty for those few hundred Americans who chose to desert their country rather than to serve it in Vietnam. I think it is time that we put the emphasis where it belongs. The real heroes are 2 1/2 million young Americans who chose to serve their country rather than desert it. I say to you tonight, in these times when there is so much of a tendency to run down those who have served America in the past and who serve it today, let us give those who serve in our Armed Forces and those who have served in Vietnam the honor and the respect that they deserve and that they have earned.', 'Finally, in this connection, let one thing be clearly understood in this election campaign: The American people will not tolerate any attempt by our enemies to interfere in the cherished right of the American voter to make his own decision with regard to what is best for America without outside intervention.', 'Now it is understandable that Vietnam has been a major concern in foreign policy.

Spending less than we need could cost us our lives or our freedom.', 'So tonight, my fellow Americans, I say, let us take risks for peace, but let us never risk the security of the United States of America.', 'It is for that reason that I pledge that we will continue to seek peace and the mutual reduction of arms.

45,Richard Nixon ,"August 24, 1972","['We want to express our very, very great appreciation to you for the wonderful welcome that you have given us as we return home to California.', 'Incidentally, some people have suggested if you would put your signs down, they could see a little better. I like the signs, but you put them down for them.', ""I think you probably are aware that we were attending a convention yesterday across the country, and at that convention there were some very distinguished people. I didn't bring them with me on the plane, but they haven't been introduced, and before I say a few words, I would just like to present some of these people to you."", 'First, the Governor of our State, Governor Reagan, who was the temporary chairman.', 'GOV. RONALD REAGAN OF CALIFORNIA. This is once when we can say ""fellow Californians"" not only to all of you, but to our guests, and we are so happy to have them here. As the President explained to you, there were 3 days of preliminaries, but finally, for the climax of the convention, on the fourth day, here we are in San Diego.', 'Mr. President and Pat--because she is the First Lady of our land, but I think in the hearts of all of us she is ""Pat,"" and we are just going to take advantage of it and keep it that way--we are also very proud, proud to have you here, proud that you are one of us. And, of course, those people who tried to pretend that what was taking place the last few days in Miami Beach was unexciting because we knew how it was going to turn out, well, I have never seen a John Wayne movie that was unexciting because you knew he was going to get the bad guy in the end. [Laughter]', '[Crowd chanting: ""Four More Years.""]', 'You are right. It is going to be four more years.', 'It is a great pleasure to welcome you here, and now I think you would rather present these other people that are here. Bless you. Thank you.', 'THE PRESIDENT. And then, of course, somebody who--nobody here, of course, needs introduction. Everybody is a celebrity. You know, for somebody from Whittier to see all of these celebrities, it is really something, believe me. But I do want you to know we have Bob Wilson. We brought him back. I asked for a new majority in the country, and Bob is trying to get a new majority in the House of Representatives. Come on up.', 'REPRESENTATIVE BOB WILSON OF CALIFORNIA. Thank you, Mr. President. I can assure you we are going to give you the conventional Nixon landslide in the election this year in San Diego. Thank you very much.', 'THE PRESIDENT. And the Lieutenant Governor of our State, Ed Reinecke. Ed, come up here.', 'LT. Gov. ED REINECKE OF CALIFORNIA.', 'Thank you, Mr. President, and Mrs. Nixon.', 'I would like to introduce you to a whole lot of delegates that helped to win that vote you just won the other night, Mr. President. These are the delegates that have just come back from--San Diego was it,1 or was it that other city, or wherever we were? These are the people who helped put you across, and we are going to put you across in November, just like I am sure thousands, hundreds, millions of people are going to do. God bless you.', 'THE PRESIDENT. And the Mayor, Pete Wilson.', ""MAYOR PETE WILSON OF SAN DIEGO. Thank you, Mr. President, Mrs. Nixon. These folks came here to listen to you, so all I am going to say is that America's finest city welcomes America's finest citizens, and we are going to be happy to see you back in the White House."", 'THE PRESIDENT. Now, I understand you have been here a long time and you have had a wonderful show. I will not talk long, because what I have to say I think you will understand very clearly, and we would like the chance to shake bands with a few more of you before we go on to San Clemente.', ""First, I would like to express appreciation not only to all of you, but to this wonderful group of celebrities that I have referred to, and they are celebrities, believe me. We couldn't possibly afford them, but they are here as volunteers."", 'I said the other night--some of you may have heard--when I spoke to the youth rally in Miami Beach, I was talking about the fact that when people in show business come out into a political rally, this is really a risk for them, because we in politics, when we go to a rally, of course, we know that the game is winning over 50 percent. You always expect the other fellow to get perhaps a little less than 50.', ""But in show business you are trying to please everybody. So somebody in show business who tries to be nice to everybody, when he gets into politics, he has got to be convinced that the country's needs come before even show business, and these people feel that way. Let's give them a hand."", ""We appreciate their sticking their necks out for us, and we just hope that as a result of what happens that their business will be better, and that the country's business will be better. We know that we are most grateful for what they have done."", 'I should also like to say a word, too, about Governor Reagan. I saw him in Camp David when he reported to me on his trip to Europe where he represented the United States so successfully in talking to our friends after a period, of course, when we had necessarily been having conversations with some of those who had been our adversaries.2', ""Then in Miami Beach, he, of course, presided the first day. He made one of the finest speeches of the convention, and at that time he said that when he didn't expect to be in the position of making the speech of the temporary chairman, that he expected to be making the welcoming speech."", 'Well, he has made it here in San Diego. This is the welcoming speech as we all know.', 'Now, I want to turn, if I can, for a moment, to San Diego, what this city means, what this county means. It is a very special place in my heart for a number of reasons.', ""A moment ago Mayor Wilson said that he had proclaimed that San Diego for this week would be America's finest city. Now, I have just been today in Miami--that is Florida. [Laughter] And I have been in Chicago, and that means Illinois. I have been in Detroit and that means Michigan. Now, as I come to San Diego, which, of course, is enormously important in California, I might lose Illinois, I might lose Michigan, and we might lose Florida. You wouldn't want us to do that."", ""So I am going to say this: I think the Mayor has made a declaration that is a fine one. This is certainly a wonderful city. I won't say it is the finest city. I can't say that. I can't pick and choose right now. But I will say this: This is the finest reception we are ever going to have in this whole campaign, and we thank you for that."", ""And I will also say, it is, as far as I am concerned, my luckiest city. You know, I have run for office--I hadn't realized it until I jotted it down coming out on the plane, how many times I had been on the ballot in this city and county of San Diego. Nineteen hundred fifty was the first time. Some of you are old enough here to have been around for that one. Nineteen hundred fifty, 1952, 1956, 1960, 1962, 1968-six times I have been on the ballot in the State of California, and in the city of San Diego. I haven't lost it once. I have lost some elections, but I have never lost San Diego, and I am not going to start now."", 'Now, if I could turn to one other thing that San Diego means to me. It has a special place in my heart, because after I served overseas in World War II, I came home to San Diego, and there is where I met Pat after having been overseas. So I will always have that memory of when we met after that period of time.', 'San Diego is a very special place to us. It is special for another reason. In 1968 after having been nominated in Miami, we came to San Diego first off, and so it was lucky then, because after coming to San Diego right after Miami, we won in November.', 'Now there is one difference. This crowd is twice as large as we had in 1968. We are going to win twice as big in 1972.', ""I don't mean by that that we are going to be complacent about it. We are going to work hard and we are going to work hard for reasons that I will describe very briefly, reasons that are terribly important to all of you, and terribly important to the future of America."", ""Let me describe my day very briefly to you. As I left Miami, I was at Homestead Air Force Base and there were 500 GI's out there. They had come down from Fort Bragg. They were fine young Americans. They had come down there to handle some of the problems that might arise. They weren't all that difficult. We really didn't even need them."", ""But I went over and shook hands with some of them and I could see that they were proud to wear the uniform of the United States. Oh, they were like all GI's; they were counting their days to when they are going to get out--some of them. Some of them are going to stay in, in the volunteer army."", 'But it made me feel that whoever is President of this country has got to be proud of the young men who instead of deserting their country, serve their country. And let us remember that.', 'Then, after that, I flew to Chicago and I talked to a crowd of 5,000, a packed house in Chicago, of Legionnaires, the American Legion. There were a few from World War I, a number from World War II, some from Korea, and the Legion now has 500,000 members from Vietnam. And the thought that ran through my mind as I talked to the American Legion was this: That is four wars in this century. Every generation has had a war. We have never had a generation of young Americans who have grown up without a war. That is why I have been talking about a generation of peace.', 'We want not only to end the war in which we are involved, and end it in a way that will discourage other wars, in an honorable way, but we want to build a lasting peace. And we have got to build that not simply by being for peace, but doing something about it, doing something not simply by negotiating, but negotiating in a way that we are respected. And that comes down to the very significant point that I wish to make with regard to the other stop that I made.', 'It was in Detroit, Michigan. Not really in Detroit, in one of the suburbs, a little town called Utica. Well, it is not so small. It is a little bigger than Whittier, I think, as a matter of fact. I dedicated the Dwight Eisenhower High School.', 'There were 2,500 inside and about 8,000 or so outside. Most of them were young people. Oh, there were junior high school students and high school students and their parents and, of course, many of their teachers, as well.', 'It was a wonderfully exciting crowd, and as I looked at their faces, I thought of their future, all of those young people, just as I thought of the future of America when I saw those young volunteers down in Miami Beach, and just as I think of the future of America when I see all of the younger people here.', ""I don't mean that we don't think of our future, too, but I simply want you to know that as I put all of those things together, as I remember returning from war in the Pacific to San Diego, as I remember seeing those wonderful GI's in Miami Beach this morning, as I remember speaking to the American Legion--a fine group of Americans--as I recall those young people, those boys and girls so idealistic, so enthusiastic, with so much to give to their country, so much to live for, I became even more dedicated than ever before to the proposition that it is the job of whoever is President of this country to do everything that he can to bring peace, but to do everything that he can m be worthy of the people of this country and particularly of that new generation, who for the first time, are going to have a chance to vote."", 'Oh, worthy of the older generation, too, but let\'s now talk about the new generation for just a moment--18 to 21. Here they are all voting. You know a lot of people said, ""Oh, we don\'t know whether we ought to give them the vote. Are they responsible enough? Are they going to vote in a way that is going to consider the issues? Are they really old enough?""', 'The answer is: They are bright enough and they are patriotic enough. And we can count on young America. I believe in young America--and we are going to do very well among them.', ""Now, as I crossed the country, and as I came back to San Diego, one final thought went through my mind: How much times have changed in the last 4 years--and they have changed for the better. Everything isn't all right. It never will be in any country in this imperfect world. Ours is still, of course, the best country. We know that and we are so lucky to be here. But as we look at it we see that our cities are safer. We see that what was happening on some of our campuses isn't happening as much today. People are there for an education."", 'We see, too, that we have been able to cut the rate of inflation in this country which was nagging so many. We have made progress in dealing with the problems of the environment. We have moved forward on many programs in health and education for the interest of the American people.', 'This country is really a better place than it was 4 years ago. But looking also abroad, I was thinking this morning-I looked out on the Atlantic and today I am going to look out on the Pacific--how different it is in both of those areas. In the Pacific we find that the war that we are in has had the effect in these past 4 years-we have been able to move it down in terms of the American involvement. We have been bringing men home and we have reached the point where we can certainly say that we in the United States of America are seeing to a conclusion a war that has been terribly difficult, but we are seeing it to a conclusion in the right way rather than in the wrong way.', ""We have not heeded in the past and we will not heed in the future those who say that the United States, which has an honorable history throughout its history in terms of those wars in which it has been involved--that we will end this war as we have ended the others, without, of course, abandoning our POW's, without turning over the country that we are allied with to Communists, and also without staining the honor of the United States. It is a goal that we can achieve."", ""But beyond that, we have had the opening to the People's Republic of China. This doesn't mean that the Communist government of that country and the free government of the United States don't have enormous differences. We do, and we always will as long as they are Communist and as long as we are free. But it means that 800 million of potentially the most able people in the world are no longer shut off from the United States. It means that we have laid the groundwork for Americans and Chinese who live in the People's Republic of China, as well as Chinese in other parts of the world who have contributed so much to this world to work together rather than to be driven apart. That is a great thing for the world. It means that our young people, looking ahead, as they look at this wonderful world we live in, and it is a good world with all of its problems, that they will be able to go there and see the wonders that we saw, the Great Wall, and see those people, despite the differences in government. We did that. That is a good thing."", 'We want to try to continue that kind of thing for the United States and for the world.', ""Looking out across the Atlantic, we saw the Soviet Union, and here again we had very great differences between the United States and the Soviet Union as far as philosophy is concerned. But now we have started the limitation of arms. We are starting cooperation in so many fields. We are finding that the Russian people, as we have always known, are a great people. And we have started that communication between the Russian people and the American people that is needed, while recognizing still that there is no time for complacency, while recognizing that the United States, as the guardian of freedom in the world and as the guardian of peace in the world, must always negotiate any reduction of arms--and please don't ever send a President to the negotiating table as the head of the second strongest nation in the world. Don't do that."", 'That brings me to a point that I would like to particularly make in San Diego. I covered this in part at the Legion. I emphasize it here.', 'The Soviet Union is a great land power. They have an armed force, as far as the numbers in their Army is concerned, much larger than ours, because they need it as a land power. We are a great sea power. We have the largest Navy in the world, and we need it as a great nation. The United States cannot have a viable foreign policy--Dave Packard, I think, will agree with this as a former Under Secretary of Defense--we cannot have a viable foreign policy unless the United States, without question, not only now but in the future, continues to have the strongest Navy in the world, because we have two great coasts. We have the Atlantic. We have the Pacific. We have the Mediterranean. We need that Navy.', ""Now we do have, I can assure you, my fellow Californians, my fellow Americans, the strongest Navy in the world. We must keep it that way, and that is why even though we would like to cut our expenses in any area so that we could put more into other problems--education, health, the rest--let me say the most important thing to remember is that you can have the best health program and the best school system and the best welfare system in the world, and it isn't going to mean anything unless you are around to enjoy it. So let's be sure we have enough to strengthen the United States and to maintain it."", 'And that is why--and this is the only political note I will make in these remarks--we will have to do everything we can to see to it that those who would cut the strength of the United States Navy by reducing our carriers, for example, from 16 to 6, those who would do that would inevitably make the United States Navy the second strongest Navy because the Soviet Union is on a navy-building program, which we are all aware of, which will make it first.', ""So, therefore, looking to the years ahead, if we really want peace, let me say, here are the ingredients: First, we must negotiate with those who might be our adversaries--the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union--so that we can negotiate differences rather than fight about them."", ""But second, in order to be able to negotiate, the United States must be strong, we must be respected in the world, we must never reduce our strength unless they do, too, and that means let's don't go to the negotiating table unless, in the areas where we are supposed to be strong, we are strong enough, and the Navy is indispensable."", ""San Diego. Whenever we hear that, it is the Navy's town. It is a great city, and as San Diegans, let me say, I pledge to you, we are going to keep our naval strength and we are going to stop those, however well intentioned they may be, who would cut the strength of the Navy and make it the second strongest in the world. We are going to be number one in our Navy so that America can continue to be a peaceful nation."", 'I have delayed you too long. I know you have been here a long time. I just close with this final note: I have traveled a great deal, of course, since going to Washington as a Congressman 25 years ago. I have been to 80 countries, and it has been a wonderful experience. But the best part of going away is coming home. To come home, to see you, all of you who have worked with us over the years, and to see all of you younger people who will be working with us and with other candidates of your choice in the future, gives us certainly a very great feeling of pride in being Californians and adopted San Diegans.', ""We thank you very much for this welcome. We are going on now to a campaign over the next 2 months which will be long, which will be hard. It will be very vigorous. We go into it with no complacency, but we go into it with confidence. We go into it with confidence because we are going after all the American people. We are not going to concede anybody to the other side, and particularly we are not going to concede America's young people to the other side because they are part of our new majority."", ""You know, I have a real treat here. I didn't realize when I saw Art Linkletter here that he hadn't just arrived when we did, because he had been there in Miami Beach doing a wonderful job of emceeing, and to have Art Linkletter here and not to have him on this program— Art, won't you say something?"", ""Incidentally, don't you ever believe, when you look at him, that you look at this young fellow. He is as old as I am."", 'ART LINKLETTER. You know, I always get these lovely spots right after the President talks. When I was in Washington a few weeks ago, they introduced me right after Billy Graham prayed, and I had to do that. But actually, I was in Miami to do the opening gala there, and I was so excited about being there that my opening remarks were: ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to San Diego."" Then I realized we had moved. But it was a wonderful evening and it was a great breakfast the next morning.', ""You know, I had dinner with your wife Sunday night, and breakfast with your wife Monday morning, and I hope that both you and Lois [Mrs. Linkletter] will be understanding. It was a marvelous convention. I flew down to introduce Ronnie Reagan, who was going to introduce the President, and all of a sudden here you were. You didn't need any introduction. They knew who you were. Isn't this remarkable? But we have been friends for 30 years. This is no new alliance for me. Breakfast Club and programs back when the President was running for Congress, and I have seen his family grow up, and the finest, not just the First Family, the best American family, and they will be there another 4 years."", ""THE PRESIDENT. Incidentally, when Art talks about all that business of break fast and dinner with Pat, I just want to keep the record straight. He has also slept in the White House. He slept in the Queen's Room. When Pat's room is being painted or anything, she sleeps there, so we can say that Art Linkletter has slept in Pat's bed. [Laughter]"", 'ART LINKLETTER. Well, you have my vote.']"
46,Richard Nixon ,"October 12, 1972","['Ladies and gentlemen:', 'As I am sure all of you know who are here from the various States represented, this is a meeting which covers the entire South, and, consequently, the remarks I will make at the outset, before having the opportunity, with Mrs. Nixon, to meet each of you, will be directed not just to this State but to the whole South and, as a matter of fact, to the whole Nation, as you will soon see.', 'Before, however, referring to the South in general, I would like to say a word about the reception we have had in Atlanta today.', ""It is a very great privilege, of course, to represent this country as Mrs. Nixon and I have in various capacities, as Vice President for 8 years and then as President. We have seen many very big crowds. We have seen some that are bigger. However, I have never seen a bigger crowd in Atlanta. I understand it is the biggest crowd in Atlanta's history."", 'While there are some cities that are larger than Atlanta, and that would only account for a larger crowd in some places, I have never seen a crowd that had what I call a higher ""E.Q."" We all hear about ""I.Q."" That is very important. But ""E.Q."" sometimes is even more important. That means ""Enthusiasm Quotient,"" and there was enthusiasm in that crowd.', 'Now, to all of you ladies and gentlemen, and to the ladies and gentlemen of the press who are here from the Washington press corps and from all over the South, let me direct my remarks to this campaign-what it means to the South, what it means to the Nation.', 'This election marks the beginning of a new era in the political alignment of the South and of the Nation. For 100 years, one party took the South for granted, and the other party, as a matter of fact, wrote it off. Now that is entirely changed. Neither party is going to take the South for granted, and neither party can afford to write it off.', 'This is going to be good for the South. It is going to be good for the Nation. I have seen this develop. This is not the first time that we have had a motorcade in Atlanta; the first was in 1960. It was one of the most exciting motorcades of the entire campaign. It was a huge crowd, an enthusiastic crowd, not as big as today, but big.', 'Afterwards, some members of the press said, ""Why did you go; you know you are not going to carry Georgia?"" I said, ""I am quite aware of that."" But I went to all 50 States in 1960, and then in 1968 I visited almost all of the States, and many, many States in the South. As President of the United States, I have visited every one of the 50 States. And in the next 4 years I am planning, to the extent that my schedule will permit, to visit every one of the 50 States.', 'There is a reason for that. I do not believe in dividing this Nation--region against region, young versus old, black versus white, race versus race, religion versus religion. I believe this is one country. I believe this is one Nation. And I believe that while we are all proud of our backgrounds--some are westerners, some are southerners, some are northerners, some are black, some are white, some are of Italian background, some are of American stock, as they call it--but whatever we may be and whatever our backgrounds may be, we are Americans first, and that is what we must always remember.', 'Now, it has been suggested that my campaigning the South in 1960, and then again in 1968, and now again in 1972, means that we have, I have, a so-called Southern strategy. It is not a Southern strategy; it is an American strategy. That is what it is, and that is what the South believes in and that is what America believes in.', ""I must admit, more than many recent American Presidents I perhaps have a closer affinity to the South because of my education. I took my law at Duke University. It was a fine law school. I learned a lot of law. I also met a lot of fine young men and women who came from the South. I learned a lot about law and I learned also a lot about this Nation's background, and the differences, and I learned some of the things I had thought were right when I got there might not be right."", ""I remember, since I was somewhat of a student of history, that when I went to Duke University in 1934, after a very good college education at Whittier in California, I was utterly convinced that Ulysses S. Grant was the best general produced on either side in the Civil War. After rooming for 2 years with Bill Perdue of Macon, Georgia, I found, and was almost convinced by Bill Perdue's constant hammering on it, that Ulysses S. Grant would be lucky to be about fourth behind Robert E. Lee, Joseph Johnston, and Stonewall Jackson."", 'Who was the better general or the best general in the Civil War, fortunately, is something that is not important now. What is more important now is that we find a way to make this one Nation, that we find a way to work together, that we find the way in this campaign and in this election to be guided by our hopes and by our ideals, and not by our fears and our hates.', ""That is why I am campaigning in all regions, among all races, among all religions, among all age groups. People don't have to be for me for me to talk to them. What I am trying to do is to appeal to all."", 'That is why we seek what I call a new American majority. Let me talk about that majority, if I can, in terms of the South. Many southerners will be part of that majority. They will be part of it for reasons that their fathers and grandfathers could never have accepted.', 'There was a time in the South--and this is still true among some, as it is in some Northern States with regard to Republicans but there was a time in the South when any southerner would vote for any Democrat and never vote for a Republican.', 'What this new political development is that we see in this election, and I think will be reflected in this election in Georgia and throughout the Southern States, is that that is no longer going to be true. Candidates of either party are going to have to seek support not on the basis of the party label, but on the basis of what they believe, and people of the South are going to vote for the man or the woman, rather than the party.', 'Now let me come fight down to the issues. What are the so-called Southern issues? This answer is going to surprise you. They are the same here as they are in America. Let me take the one that everybody assumes is a Southern issue--I say everybody, everybody who takes a superficial view of politics and thinks of the old politics and the old South, rather than the new politics and the new South---it is said that the major issue in the South is race.', 'Let me tell you something. I was looking at some polls recently. I know, too, that the issue of busing is one that is a very hot one fight here in this State. But as I was looking at some polls of various issues in the State of Michigan and the State of Alabama, did you know that busing is a much hotter issue in Michigan today than it is in Alabama?', 'Now, what does that mean? It does not mean that the majority of the people in Michigan are racist, any more than the majority of the people of Alabama, because they happen to be opposed to busing. It simply means this: It means parents in Michigan, like parents in Alabama and parents in Georgia and parents all over this country, want better education for their children, and that better education is going to come in the schools that are closer to home and not those clear across town.', 'That is why our approach is better education, better education for all and equal opportunity for all, but not inviting into this particular matter the kind of an approach that might, in the name of so-called racial balance, produce inferior education and racial strife.', 'We need better education for white children, for black children, for all children. And the way we can get it, I think, is through the approach that I have suggested.', 'Now, getting that issue out of the way, let me tell you what the number one issues, based on the polls that we have seen, national polls Gallup, Harris, all the rest, they all come out the same--the number one issues in the South are, and the number one issues in the Nation. These are the issues that make most southerners potential members of what we call the new American majority.', 'First, they want this country to be strong, not because they want the United States to be strong for jingoistic reasons, although southerners have a great deal of national pride, but because they know that a strong United States is the guardian of peace in the world and the guardian of freedom.', 'Southerners know, as do other Americans, that the day the United States becomes the second strongest nation in the world, freedom and peace will be in deadly danger around the world, and we are not going to let that happen.', 'The second issue, and this is true of the South and it is true of the Nation, is that you want peace, you want it now, you want it in the future, but you want peace with honor. Not simply because honor is something that you have to be for because this Nation got committed, but because you realize that if we do not have peace with honor we really are planting the seeds for war in the future. We are really inviting the aggression that none of us want in the future.', ""And that is why the peace with honor we seek in Vietnam and that peace that we have made so much progress in obtaining over these past 4 years, that peace with honor is supported by most southerners and that is why the peace with honor that we seek is one that rejects betraying our allies, abandoning our POW's, or providing amnesty for draft dodgers and deserters who leave this country."", 'The third issue: It is a Southern issue, it is a national issue--the people of the South want an opportunity for good jobs, high wages, and cost of living kept under control so that you are not on a treadmill.', ""High prices are an issue in the South. Taxes are an issue in the South. Jobs are an issue in the South. That is why most southerners I have found approve of this Administration's policies that have cut the rate of inflation in half and that will cut it even more if we are given the chance. And second, they approve this Administration's policies that have made it possible for us to have the highest rate of growth of any major industrial nation in the world and why they approve of an Administration's policies that will go forward until we achieve a goal we haven't had in this country since President Eisenhower was President in 1955 and '56, and that means full employment without inflation, without war. That is what we are for, and that is what southerners are for."", 'Issue number four: Most southerners and most Americans, East, West, North, and South, want respect for law, respect for order, and they want justice, justice to all people. And in wanting respect for law and order and justice, they realize that in 1968 we were on an escalating trend toward massive crime in this country, drugs, narcotics, going up and up and up. They realize that we have launched an all-out offensive in this Administration against the forces of crime, against the forces of drugs, and we are beginning to win.', 'The rate of crime increase in 1968, in the last 6 months, was 28 percent. We brought that almost to a standstill. In the first 6 months of this year it was only one percent. If we get the chance, we can turn it around, and one way we can turn it around that I want to mention right here today is this: I have made some appointments to the Supreme Court. I have made appointments to other courts. I have selected men and women that I consider to be good lawyers.', 'But one thing that I insist upon for all appointees is this: They must recognize that the first civil right of every American, whatever he may be, what he wants is to be free from domestic violence, and that it is necessary in our decisions in this country that we strengthen the peace forces against the criminal forces. We have appointed judges like that, and I want to say that if we have the opportunity in the next 4 years, I am going to appoint more judges like that so that we can strengthen the peace forces in this country.', ""Issue number five: The people of the South are just like the rest of the country in wanting progress. They don't want to stand still. It is a myth. It was a myth in 1934 to '37 when I was in law school, when I talked to these young law students and they spoke with such idealism of the future of the South and how they wanted to get up with the rest of the country. They were proud of it, but they wanted to come up."", 'You look at this great skyline of the city of Atlanta. Look at New Orleans, look at Texas, look across this whole area, Florida, for example, North Carolina, Tennessee, and you can see that the progress in this part of the country, along with the West, is probably the greatest of all in the Nation.', ""They want more of that progress, and, in order to have that progress, they know that we need the kind of a government that will avoid confiscatory taxes. That is one of the reasons why they support the proposals I have made to put a spending ceiling on spending in Washington, so that we don't raise taxes for the American people."", 'That is why also they support the historic movement--and of course we sometimes perhaps overuse that word, but in this instance it is historic, because it is a great change in the approach to our constitutional responsibilities in this country--which provides for revenue sharing.', 'Let me tell you what it means. Sure-as I told the mayor of Atlanta today--it is going to mean money for the city of Atlanta. It is going to be money for the counties and cities of this State and all the States of the Nation. It is going to be money for the State governments that they can use to deal with local problems. But what is involved that is far more significant is this:', 'It means that after 180 years of power flowing from the people and the States and the cities to Washington, we have finally turned it around, and the money and the power is going to go back to the States and back to the cities so that the people can decide what they want for themselves rather than having it done in Washington, D.C.', 'Think what this means: This means better education. It means an opportunity in the future to lower the burden of property taxes. It means better opportunity. It means the kind of progress that the people of this part of the country want just like the people in all parts of the country.', 'One other point that I would make before concluding is that sometimes there is a tendency to speak of the South as being sort of the Bible belt, and that is said by some in a complimentary way and some in, shall we say, a rather derogatory way.', 'I would only suggest I would put it in a broader sense. There is, in this part of the country, a deep religious faith. There is a great respect for moral values. There is a great devotion to what we call character. But let me say that in that religious faith and in that devotion to moral values and in that respect for character, while it exists in the South, it exists throughout this Nation.', 'My Indiana mother and my Ohio father--they put it in me just as your mothers and fathers put it in you. And I see it, for example, when I visit an Italian picnic and I see new people, first generation Americans, who are proud of their national backgrounds, with deep religious ties, who have faith in this country, faith in their God, and who believe in moral virtues.', 'Oh, you can call them old-fashioned, but the day America loses its moral values, its dedication to idealism and religion, this will cease to be a great country. We are not going to let that happen.', 'Ladies and gentlemen, related to that point is the final one, and this is something that is somewhat at times derided as patriotism, as if patriotism were a bad thing. Let me quote two southerners, one known to the people of Georgia and the people of the South as a southerner, and one, of course, who was born in Virginia and, therefore, was the last President of the United States really to have a Southern background, Woodrow Wilson.', 'I remember when I first became President, Dick Russell 1 and I had a talk about the Vietnam war. He hated war as much as I did. He wanted to find a way to end this war honorably as much as I did. But when there were demonstrators by the hundreds of thousands marching around the White House, he came down to see me and he said, ""When my flag is committed, I am committed."" That was his attitude.', 'And Woodrow Wilson put it all in context and at a different level when he spoke at Constitution Hall in Philadelphia in 1912, on the Fourth of July, and he said: A patriotic American is never so proud of the flag under which he lives as when it comes to mean to others, as well as to himself, a symbol of hope and liberty and freedom.', 'That is the message I would leave with you finally today. I would only say we are proud of our record. We are proud not only of what we have done in moving toward a more peaceful world, in moving toward a new prosperity without inflation, without war, in moving toward progress and toward opportunity for all, but there is much left to be done.', 'I want you to know that as I saw the thousands of young people on the street today--high school, grade school, some college students, some were white, some were black, all were American--I thought my obligation and yours is to them and to future generations.', ""As I see it, what I want is a world in which the United States leads the way toward peace and, remember, if we don't, no other nation has the power to do so. That is why I went to Peking. That is why I went to Moscow. That is why I ask the chance to continue on those great initiatives, so that we can build a world in which young men will not have to fight in another Vietnam or another Korea or something like that."", 'And at home it means that we need to continue, to continue to build a nation in which the hatreds that divide us are put aside, in which we have our differences but we discuss them in an intelligent, rational way, and in which we can be lifted by our dreams and by our hopes rather than divided by our fears and our hatreds. That is the legacy we want to leave.', 'I want to say to all of you, from all over the South, some of you are Democrats, some of you are Republicans, all of you are Americans, all that I ask, as you go back to your States, is take this message: Join the new American majority. Join it not as region against region or party against party or class against class, but join it in order to build a better, freer America for every person in this country.', 'Thank you.']"
47,Richard Nixon ,"October 15, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'Four years ago, at the close of a turbulent decade which had seen our Nation engulfed by a rising tide of disorder and permissiveness, I campaigned for President with a pledge to restore respect for law, order, and justice in America. I am pleased to be able to report to you today that we have made significant progress in that effort.', 'During the 8 years from the end of the Eisenhower Administration until we took office in 1969, serious crime in the United States had skyrocketed by 122 percent, and there were predictions that it would double once again during the following 4 years.', ""Those predictions have not come true. Instead, we have fought the frightening trend of crime and anarchy to a standstill. The campuses which erupted in riots so often in the late 1960's have become serious centers of learning once again. The cities which we saw in flames summer after summer a few years ago are now pursuing constructive change."", 'The FBI crime index showed an increase of only one percent during the first half of this year. That is the closest we have come to registering an actual decrease since these quarterly statistics began 12 years ago. And in 72 of our largest cities, we have already begun to see a decrease in crime this year as compared to last.', 'We have moved off the defensive and onto the offensive in our all-out battle against the criminal forces in America. We are going to stay on the offensive until we put every category of crime on a downward trend in every American community.', 'To reach this goal we must continue to fight the battle on all fronts.', 'In our courts, we need judges who will help to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. I have applied this principle in making appointments to the Supreme Court and to other Federal courts. As a result, our Constitution today is more secure; our freedoms are better protected.', ""The two men who have served me as Attorney General, John Mitchell and Richard Kleindienst, have brought real backbone to our national law enforcement effort. Each has demonstrated his determination to see justice done to the overwhelming majority of law-abiding citizens, as well as to those who break the law. Neither has fallen for the naive theory that society is to blame for an individual's wrongdoing."", 'Tomorrow, Attorney General Kleindienst will make public the first comprehensive report ever compiled on Federal law enforcement and criminal justice assistance activities.1 I commend this report to the attention of every American who is concerned with the rule of law. It documents the truly massive Federal commitment to crime reduction.', 'The Federal role, however, is only a supportive one. As J. Edgar Hoover often used to tell me, it is our local police forces who are the real frontline soldiers in the war against crime. As President over the past 4 years, I have given all-out backing to our peace officers in their dedicated efforts to make all of us safer on the streets and more secure in our homes, and I shall continue to do so.', 'In 3 years we have provided States and localities with law enforcement assistance grants totaling $1.5 billion. That compares with only $22 million in grants during the final 3 years of the previous Administration.', ""In a single year, 1970, the Congress passed four landmark anticrime bills which this Administration had recommended and fought for--an omnibus crime bill, a bill providing new tools to fight organized crime, a comprehensive reform of the drug abuse statutes, and a new charter for courts and criminal procedures in the Nation's Capital."", ""The city of Washington had become the crime capital of the United States during the 1960's, but during our term of office we have cut the D.C. crime rate in half."", ""Let me turn now to the subject of drug abuse--America's public enemy number one."", ""The period 1965 to 1969, when drugs were widely glamorized and when government was responding only feebly to this menace, brought America's narcotics problem to the epidemic stage. In that 4-year period alone, the number of drug addicts doubled nationwide."", 'To turn this situation around, I declared total war against heroin and other illicit drugs. I personally shook up the bureaucracy and took steps to create two new Federal agencies to deal with narcotics-related crime and with addict treatment. The antidrug funding which I have requested in the current budget is 11 times as great as the 1969 level.', ""We are winning this war. The raging heroin epidemic of the late 1960's has been stemmed."", 'Our domestic law enforcement operation has arrested twice as many pushers and has seized illicit drugs at four times the rate of the previous Administration. Our rehabilitation and treatment programs have created more federally funded drug treatment capacity in the last 12 months than in the 50 years before that.', 'Our international narcotics control work in 59 countries has achieved a doubling of global heroin and morphine base seizures in 1972 alone.', 'But the job is far from finished. A short time before Christmas last year, I received a heart-rending letter from a teenage boy in the Midwest. He told me in his letter how his brother, a college student of exceptional promise, after slipping deeper and deeper into drug experimentation, had gone off into the woods with a gun one day, completely without warning, and taken his own life.', 'Listen to the boy\'s letter: ""If we can stop just one boy from doing what my brother did, his whole life will have been worthwhile....You can beat that drug, Mr. Nixon; you can destroy it before it destroys any more lives.""', 'This is my answer to this letter: I cannot beat this problem by myself, but if all of us work together, we can and we will beat it.', 'To do so, we will need more clinics to treat addicts who need help. That is why I asked the Congress for speedy approval of funds to support additional drug treatment facilities.', 'We will need better cooperation abroad in apprehending the criminals who produce and smuggle heroin. That is why I shall insist on the strictest compliance with the statute which requires a suspension of United States military and economic aid to countries which protect or participate in the movement of illegal drugs to this country.', 'We will need absolute assurance that convicted drug peddlers will go to jail and not back to the streets. The dangerous trend of light or suspended sentences meted out to convicted pushers by permissive judges must be halted. That is why I shall ask the next Congress to require stiff mandatory sentences for heroin traffickers, and to amend other Federal statutes so as to keep these peddlers of death off our streets after their arrest.', 'Wherever more money, more manpower, or more teeth in the law are needed to maintain our momentum in the war against drugs and crime, I will do everything in my power to provide them.', 'My intention for 1973 and beyond is to continue and to expand our massive Federal funding for helping to improve our local law enforcement.', 'I will propose to the new Congress a thorough-going revision of the entire Federal criminal code, aimed at better protection of life and property, human fights, and the domestic peace.', 'I will move ahead with my comprehensive 10-year reform program for the Federal prison system, which we launched in 1969.', 'I will continue to apply the criteria of strict constructionism and regard for the public safety in making appointments to the Supreme Court and other Federal courts.', 'I will ask the new Congress to move swiftly in enacting my proposals for law enforcement special revenue sharing, to give States and cities greater decisionmaking power in meeting their own needs.', 'And I will work unceasingly to halt the erosion of moral fiber in American life, and the denial of individual accountability for individual actions.', 'The increasingly urbanized, technological, crowded, pluralistic, affluent, leisure oriented society which America has become in these final decades of the 20th century poses complex new dangers to our traditional concepts of personal safety, human dignity, moral values.', 'Questions which were once the sole concern of novelists now intrude upon public policy. The endlessly drugged ""Brave New World"" which Huxley described could conceivably become our world a few years in the future.', 'Remote as such possibilities may seem, we cannot ignore them. We must shape our own vision for the seventies and the years ahead, a vision bright and clear and sharp, or one of the darker visions may begin to impose itself by default.', ""Government alone cannot determine the legal and moral tone of America's third century. Much depends on the character we build in our homes, our schools, and our churches. Much depends on the values we exalt in our art, our literature, our culture."", ""Yet government has an essential role, a role it must never abdicate. Government must never become so preoccupied with catering to the way-out wants of those who reject all respect for moral and legal values that it forgets the citizen's first civil right: the right to be free from domestic violence."", 'Government must never mistake license for liberty, amorality for tolerance, indulgence for charity, or weakness for compassion.', 'Above all, government must maintain that structure of ordered freedom within which alone the human spirit can thrive and flourish.', 'The work of keeping the structure of freedom strong in the years ahead will not be easy, and the price may sometimes be terribly high. It was terribly high for a young Federal narcotics agent in New York named Frank Tummillo.', 'I met Frank Tummillo last February when he and other agents came to the White House along with a group of professional athletes who have joined the fight against drugs. He was a fine young man--alert, dedicated, selfless. Just 3 nights ago--last Thursday--he was murdered by two hoodlums in the line of his duty, trying to break up a huge cocaine transaction.', 'He was only 25. He lived at home with his parents. The invitations recently went out for his wedding next month. Instead of that wedding, his funeral will be held tomorrow.', 'We cannot bring Frank Tummillo back again, any more than we can bring back the American soldiers who have given their lives in Vietnam. But in our war against crime and drugs, as in our war against aggression in Southeast Asia, we can resolve to redeem with honor the ultimate sacrifice which these brave men have made.', 'Together, and in their name, let us work to end the violence and the lawlessness against which they fought. Let us make the next 4 years a period of new respect for law, order, and justice in America, a time of new hope in a land free of fear and a world at peace.', 'Thank you and good afternoon.']"
48,Richard Nixon ,"October 21, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'In election campaigns, it is customary to talk only about programs and differences of opinion on current issues. But even more important than what a man advocates is what he believes, because what he believes will determine how he will act when issues arise in the future which are not currently before the Nation.', 'That is why I want to talk today about my philosophy of government, so that the American people will know the principles which will guide me in making decisions over the next 4 years.', 'The central question, which goes to the heart of American government and is sure to affect every person in this land, is this: Do we want to turn more power over to bureaucrats in Washington in the hope that they will do what is best for all the people? Or do we want to return more power to the people and to their State and local governments, so that people can decide what is best for themselves?', 'Now, people of good conscience differ on this issue. Certainly in the past generation there were cases in which power concentrated in Washington did much to help our people live in greater fairness and security and to enable our Nation to speak and act strongly in world affairs.', 'When the will of the people is best expressed by the Nation acting as one people, I strongly support the use of effective Federal action. But the concentration of power can get to be a dangerous habit. Government officials who get power over others tend to want to keep it. And the more power they get, the more they want.', 'We all remember the waste and the resentment of the sixties, the growing alienation of people who felt that they no longer counted, the feeling of frustration in dealing with a faceless machine called the Federal bureaucracy.', ""In a family, when a father tells the rest of the family what to do, that's called paternalism. In a business, when an employer tells workers he knows what is best for their future, that is called paternalism. And in government, when a central authority in Washington tells people across the country how they should conduct their lives, that, too, is paternalism."", ""In each of those cases, the motive of the man in charge may be to do what he sincerely thinks is best for the people under his control. But the trouble is this: Most Americans don't like to be under anybody's control, no matter how benevolent that control may be. It is one thing to be well taken care of, but for those able to take care of themselves, it is far more important to be free."", 'At the root of all of our rights is an idea of justice and genius, the idea that government derives its power from ""the consent of the governed.""', 'Of course, every politician since Jefferson\'s time pays lip service to the consent of the governed, along with ""majority rule"" and ""the will of the people.""', ""But the truth is that a great many people in politics and elsewhere believe that the people just do not know what's good for them. Putting it bluntly, they have more faith in government than they have in people. They believe that the only way to achieve what they consider social justice is to place power in the hands of a strong central government which will do what they think has to be done, no matter what the majority thinks."", 'To them, the will of the people is the ""prejudice of the masses."" They deride anyone who wants to respond to that will of the people as ""pandering to the crowd."" A decent respect for the practice of majority rule is automatically denounced as ""political expediency."" I totally reject this philosophy.', ""When a man sees more and more of the money he earns taken away by government taxation, and objects to that, I don't think it is right to charge him with selfishness, with not caring about the poor and the dependent."", ""When a mother sees her child taken away from a neighborhood school and transported miles away, and she objects to that, I don't think it is right to charge her with bigotry."", ""When young people apply for jobs--in politics or in industry--and find the door closed because they don't fit into some numerical quota, despite their ability, and they object, I do not think it is right to condemn those young people as insensitive or racist."", 'Of course, some people oppose income redistribution and busing for the wrong reasons. But they are by no means the majority of Americans, who oppose them for the right reasons.', 'It is time that good, decent people stopped letting themselves be bulldozed by anybody who presumes to be the self-righteous moral judge of our society.', 'There is no reason to feel guilty about wanting to enjoy what you get and get what you earn, about wanting your children in good schools close to home, or about wanting to be judged fairly on your ability. Those are not values to be ashamed of; those are values to be proud of. Those are values that I shall always stand up for when they come under attack.', 'We will change America for the better by attacking our real problems, and not by attacking our basic values. We will improve the quality of our public dialogue by respecting, not impugning, the motives of the people that the winning candidate will ultimately represent.', 'The rights of each minority must be vigorously defended--and each minority must be protected in the opportunity to have its opinion become accepted as the majority view.', 'But on these basic concerns, the majority view must prevail, and leadership in a democracy is required to respond to that view. That is what ""majority rule"" and ""the consent of the governed"" really means--and we would all do well to take these ideas seriously.', 'We have achieved a high level of leadership throughout our history because we have put aside the notion of a ""leadership class."" The advantage of a superior education should result in a deep respect for--and never contempt for--the value judgments of the average person.', 'Does this mean that a President should read all the public opinion polls before he acts, and then follow the opinion of the majority down the line? Of course not.', 'A leader must be willing to take unpopular stands when they are necessary. But a leader who insists on imposing on the people his own ideas of how they should live their lives--when those ideas go directly contrary to the values of the people themselves--does not understand the role of a leader in a democracy. And when he does find it necessary to take an unpopular stand, he has an obligation to explain it to the people, solicit their support, and win their approval.', 'Let me cite an example: In every Presidency there are moments when success or failure seems to hang in the balance, when an expression of confidence by the American people is vitally important.', 'One of those moments came toward the end of my first year in office. I had declared that we were going to end our involvement in the war in Vietnam with honor. I had made it plain that we fully understood the difference between settlement and surrender. As you may recall, the organized wrath of thousands of vocal demonstrators who opposed that policy descended on Washington. Commentators and columnists wondered whether we would witness what they referred to as ""the breaking of the President.""', 'On November 3, 1969, I came before my fellow Americans on radio and television to review our responsibilities and to summon up the strength of our national character.', 'The great silent majority of Americans-good people with good judgment who stand ready to do what they believe to be right--immediately responded. The response was powerful, nonpartisan, and unmistakable. The majority gave its consent, and the expressed will of the people made it possible for the Government to govern successfully.', 'I have seen the will of the majority in action, responding to a call to responsibility, to honor, and to sacrifice. That is why I cannot ally myself with those who habitually scorn the will of the majority, who treat a mature people as children to be ordered about, who treat the popular will as something only to be courted at election time and forgotten between elections.', 'That is also why I speak with pride of the ""new majority"" that is forming not around a man or a party, but around a set of principles that is deep in the American spirit.', 'The new American majority believes that each person should have more of a say in how he lives his own life, how he spends his paycheck, how he brings up his children.', 'The new American majority believes in taking better care of those who truly cannot care for themselves, so that they can lead lives of dignity and self-respect.', ""The new American majority believes in taking whatever action is needed to hold down the cost of living so that everyone's standard of living can go up."", 'And the new American majority believes in a national defense second to none, so that America can help bring about a generation of peace.', 'These are not the beliefs of selfish people. On the contrary, they are the beliefs of a generous and self-reliant people, a people of intellect and character, whose values deserve respect in every segment of our population.', ""A few weeks ago, one of the Nation's most perceptive journalists asked me what I thought it would be like to be a second-term President free to govern with no thought of another election. Actually, he was asking one of the deepest questions of all: Would I do what I thought was best for the people, or would I do what the people thought was best for themselves?"", 'Fortunately, what the new majority wants for America and what I want for this Nation basically are the same.', 'But a profound question deserves a thoughtful answer.', ""In the years to come, if I am returned to office, I shall not hesitate to take the action I think necessary to protect and defend this Nation's best interests, whether or not those actions meet with wide popular approval. I will not begin at this stage of my life to shy away from making hard decisions which I believe are right."", 'At the same time, you can be certain of this: On matters affecting basic human values--on the way Americans live their lives and bring up their children--I am going to respect and reflect the opinion of the people themselves. That is what democracy is all about.', ""In the next 4 years, as in the past 4, I will continue to direct the flow of power away from Washington and back to the people. In meeting our material needs, we must never overlook every American's spiritual need for personal freedom. When freedom is taken away from the individual, in the name of the people, the people lose their freedom."", 'This is the land of opportunity, not the land of quotas and restrictions.', 'This is the land that holds all men to be created equal, not the land that demands that all citizens become the same.', 'Above all, this is the land where an alien paternalism has no place at all-because we deeply believe in a system that derives its power from the consent of the governed.', 'All of my life I have had faith in the ultimate wisdom of the people and in the values of fairness and respect and compassion that spring from within the American spirit. As President, I shall never break that faith.', 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
49,Richard Nixon ,"October 22, 1972","['Good morning, my fellow Americans:', 'Veterans Day this year takes on an added meaning as American troops return from another distant conflict, because of the progress we have made this past year toward our goal of a full generation of peace.', 'No group has sacrificed more for this goal than the men and women who have proudly worn the American uniform. In serving their country, they have sought not glory for themselves, but peace, honor, and freedom for us all. Today, I ask all of my fellow citizens to join with me in honoring them.', 'The American veteran has expressed in his service much of what is finest in our Nation. Courage, selflessness, discipline, and devotion--these are qualities we will need as much to build a future at peace as we have needed in the past in time of War.', 'At a time when a small minority has tried to glorify the few who have refused to serve, it is more important than ever that we honor the millions who have loyally stood by their country when the challenge to freedom called for service.', ""Speaking for the American people, I say today that the vast majority of us have never been prouder of our country's nearly 29 million living veterans, whatever their service, whether they are the survivors of World War I or the young Americans who have served in Vietnam. To all of them I say that our respect has never been stronger, nor our gratitude greater, than on this Veterans Day, 1972."", ""As President I have done everything I can to see to it that this gratitude and respect is reflected by the Government's treatment of American veterans. Dollars, health care, educational opportunities can never fully repay the sacrifices our veterans have made, but they can at least serve as a beginning."", 'I am happy to be able to report that America is doing more for its veterans today than ever before. Since January 1969:', '--We have raised veterans average compensation benefits by over 20 percent and pensions by 16 percent.', ""--We have increased the individual veteran's education and training benefits by 34 percent. And when I sign into law the new GI bill benefits just enacted by the Congress, they will have risen by nearly 70 percent, and our total outlays for veterans education and training benefits will have quadrupled."", '--We have brought hospital and extended care treatment to over 80,000 more veterans than ever before; VA clinic-outpatient treatments have increased by 4 million.', '--We have doubled the number of GI bill trainees, from 90,000 in 1969 to over 2 million expected by 1973.', '--We have increased the number of guaranteed housing loans to veterans by 64 percent over the 1969 level.', 'Each of these achievements is important; each has brought a better life and a more promising future for millions of American veterans and their families.', 'But as we approach the end of our long and difficult military involvement in Vietnam, we have also had to recognize the need for special measures to meet special problems, and one of these is the problem of drug abuse. It is a social problem not a military problem, but it has made itself felt in our Armed Forces just as it has in our civilian society.', 'To meet it, we have mounted an unprecedented new effort to treat those veterans who have drug problems. In 1971, we increased the number of specialized Veterans Administration treatment centers for drug abuse sixfold. This year another 12 centers have been opened, and many existing facilities have been expanded.', 'More importantly, we have launched a massive educational and training effort to prevent drug abuse before the damage is done. It is helping the Armed Forces combat successfully a problem not of their own making. Just as we are determined to stamp out drug abuse in civilian society, we are also pledged to provide whatever is needed to stamp it out in our Armed Forces.', 'But in facing the drug problem, we must do so with perspective. We must never lose sight of the fact that the vast majority of Vietnam veterans have come out of this war with a clean slate and a record of honor.', 'As a private citizen and as President, I have been to Vietnam seven times.', 'I have been to Danang with the Marines; I have been up in the highlands with the Army; I have seen the Navy and the Air Force playing their part in the war effort.', 'And I can tell you from personal observation that we can all be proud of those Americans who have served in Vietnam.', 'I have seen young officers and enlisted men who have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets to build schools and community centers, roads, orphanages for the people of South Vietnam.', 'I have seen them spend hours of their free time teaching and helping the people of Vietnam, and particularly the children of Vietnam.', 'It is fitting that at this time we honor the 6 million young men and women who stood by the flag and served their country during the period of the Vietnam war.', 'They deserve the opportunities which we are providing, but, even more, they deserve the respect which only you can give.', 'They deserve it because they have earned it.', 'And they stand today just as tall as their fathers who fought at Normandy, Iwo Jima, and Inchon.', 'To them, and to their parents, wives, and loved ones, I promise that as long as I am President, America will not turn her back on those who served. We are not going to make a mockery of their sacrifice by surrendering to the enemy or by offering amnesty to draft dodgers and deserters. The 2 1/2 million who chose to serve America in Vietnam have paid a price for their choice. The few hundred who chose to desert America must pay a price for their choice.', ""There is something else that we owe to the veterans of Vietnam. With America's combat role ending, with the reductions we have been able to make in our Armed Forces elsewhere, thousands of young veterans are coming home to begin civilian life again."", 'These young men deserve not only a welcome, they deserve a job. I am glad to be able to report that as the economy continues to expand, the job picture for American veterans is also improving. And part of the reason is the concentrated special effort being made by the Federal Government.', 'On June 11, 1971, I announced the Jobs for Veterans program with a target of providing one million Vietnam-era veterans with jobs and training placements by June 30, 1972.1 We have not only met that goal; we have surpassed it. We were able to place 1.3 million veterans by the June 30 target date, and we are now working to provide jobs and training placements for another 1 .3 million by next June for a 2-year total of 2.6 million.', ""In this connection, I would like to point out that hiring veterans is one of the best investments an employer can make. Veterans have proved their ability to work and to work hard. They know the importance of discipline. Their experience in the service has taught them the meaning of responsibility. Hiring veterans isn't just patriotic it makes plain good business sense."", 'So I am confident that, with the wholehearted support of the private sector and of individual citizens, we can achieve our goal of jobs for veterans.', 'Most of the challenges that we face as a nation are bigger than party politics.', 'No challenge is greater than that of keeping the peace in a dangerous world in which nations have conflicting interests.', 'During the past 4 years, we have begun moving out of an era of great peril and entering an era of great promise. But if we are to continue to make progress for peace, we must keep America strong.', ""We must keep America strong, not out of some misguided pride or national vanity, but because, in the whole free world today, no other nation can take America's place."", 'That is why one of the things I have worked hardest for as President has been to keep America strong.', 'There is no such thing as a retreat to peace. There is no such thing as peace without order. And if America were suddenly to slash away her defensive strength and abdicate her responsibilities as the major power of the flee world, we would be retreating.', 'We would be leaving behind us a global vacuum that could only be filled with chaos and turmoil--a vacuum in which peace and order could not survive.', 'Some of the voices we hear today calling for a weak America, for an isolationist America, are little more than echoes of past blunders. The same misguided thinking they espouse today led an unprepared America into two World Wars in this century because it encouraged others to believe that their aggressions would go unpunished.', ""Today America is strong. Today America is prepared. And because we are strong and prepared, we have been able to make dramatic progress toward arms reductions, toward better relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, toward the first full generation of peace our country will have known in this century."", 'That is something we all should think about on this Veterans Day, as we honor the Americans who have given so much in past wars. We can all be encouraged-both those who have already served to keep America free, and their children and younger brothers and sisters who, for the first time, have a realistic hope for a future in which all of our people can enjoy both peace and freedom.', 'Peace is not built by the weak of heart or by the weak of spirit. It is built by nations that have character, courage, and the strength to make their good intentions credible to others.', 'That is the kind of country America must remain. I promise that I will work to keep America that kind of country.', 'I can think of no better occasion than Veterans Day to renew this pledge to the American people.', 'Thank you, and good morning.']"
50,Richard Nixon ,"October 23, 1972","['Governor Rockefeller, all of the distinguished guests here on the platform, and all of you here in this great audience here in Nassau:', 'Four years ago I had the privilege of attending the windup rally in the State of New York in the new Madison Square Garden. I thought then that I would never see a bigger or a better crowd. I want to say tonight that here in Nassau, in this new stadium, this is the biggest and best rally, Joe Margiotta,1 that I have ever seen,', ""And there is something else that is new here. There is this great, enormous number of people in front of me. I see you and I know that you are young people. Four years ago, at your age, you could not vote. But predictions were made that the young voters will be on the other side. Let me say a majority of America's young voters are going to be on our side this year."", 'Governor Rockefeller, you have introduced me very generously. I want to say this to the great audience here in the State of New York that we had a ceremony on Friday in Philadelphia where an historic bill providing for revenue sharing was signed. Credit was given on that occasion to mayors and Governors and Congressmen and Senators. I want you to know that Governor Rockefeller deserves the major credit. Without him, we would not have revenue sharing today, and my hat is off to him for it.', 'Now, tonight, as we are just 2 weeks away from the election, I want to talk to you about something that perhaps at this stage in a campaign you seldom hear. You know that there are great differences between those who are seeking the office for the Presidency today. You know that those differences are honestly held by both men. You know, too, that the choice that is to be made is one that is bigger than party. It is one that is as big as America itself.', 'That is the reason why this year not only Republicans but millions of Democrats and independents are joining us, because they are voting for what is best for America.', 'Tonight I want to talk to you about what those Four More Years can mean to America. I do not want to talk about those fears and hates that divide America. I want you, all of us in this country and this great rally, to address ourselves to the hopes and to the dreams that unite America, that unite us, whatever our party, whatever our background. Let us, as Americans, look at the future of this country, and let us work for and vote for what we think is best for this country.', 'Let me begin, if I may, with, I know, a subject that is much in the minds, as it should be, of particularly the young people here. That is the situation with regard to the chance to have something we have not had in this country in this whole century--a full generation of peace.', ""In speaking to that subject, you will remember the situation when we came into office. You will recall that we had had no negotiation whatever of significance with the country or the government that had the biggest number of people in the world, the People's Republic of China. You will recall that we were in constant confrontation, rather than negotiation, with the Soviet Union, the other great super power."", 'I do not contend tonight that in these past 4 years we have accomplished the millennium, but I do say this, and I think history will record that this is the case: Because of the progress we have made, progress in ending the war in Vietnam with honor and not surrender, because of the trips that I was able to take early in the year to Peking and later in the spring to Moscow, the year 1972 will go down as the year in which more progress was made toward real peace in the world than any year since World War II.', 'I do not stand on that record, because it is something to build on. Let us see what kind of a world we can build looking to the future.', 'Let me tell you why, for example, the arms control agreement that we have reached with the Soviet Union, important as it was, is only a beginning. It was a limited agreement. We announced just a few days ago that we are going to have more negotiations in November with the Soviet Union for the limitation on all offensive nuclear weapons, as well as defensive weapons. These will be difficult negotiations, but you can be sure that we have laid the foundation for pursuing them, and we believe that we have some experience for knowing how to bring them about in a successful way.', 'You also know from having followed your papers and your television and your radio that an historic trade agreement has been reached between the Soviet Union and the United States. That does not mean instantly that there is going to be an enormous increase in trade between two countries with entirely different economic systems, but it does mean that these two great peoples, the Russian people and the American people, can turn more to the works of peace and less to the works of war, and that is what we want.', ""It means, above everything else, that as we have trade with the Soviet Union now, trade in the years ahead with the People's Republic of China, as well as trade with other nations in the world, the chance for you, all of you wonderful young people today throughout America to have a better life, and the chance for other people in the world to have a better life, is greatly increased."", ""Let me put it in another context. You may have seen in the papers pictures in the Oval Office at the White House that no one even a year ago would have dreamed would have been possible. Fifteen doctors from the People's Republic of China were there. Two were women, 12 were men. Another was a specialist in a certain area of science related to medicine. We discussed what they had come to America for. I do not suggest that because 15 Chinese doctors from the Communist People's Republic of China have visited the United States that this means we are going to have instant peace and no disagreement between two countries with entirely different philosophies and with many differences in interests. But let me tell you what I think it does mean."", 'I remember talking on a long car ride one day with one of the three top leaders of the People\'s Republic of China. He told me about one of his closest friends who had just died with cancer. He said he had read in the papers of the new initiative we had in this country for finding a cure for cancer. We know it is not easy, but I have determined that whatever money is required will be spent for this, and we are working on it. And he said, ""Wouldn\'t it be a very fine thing for both countries if our doctors could work together, not separately, to try to find the cure for this disease?""', 'Then I pointed out to him something that may be even surprising to you, unless you have suffered from this dread disease in your own family. More people died of cancer in the United States last year than the United States lost in killed in action in all of World War II. Now what I am saying is this: I say that an initiative that will have Russian doctors and Chinese doctors and American doctors working together is good, because the genius that will find the answer to that dread disease and other diseases, it may not be in America, it may be in Russia, it may be in China, it may be in Latin America. But you can be sure we now have started on the road to get the doctors of the world, regardless of philosophy, working together on this dread disease, rather than against each other.', ""Now, in order to continue to make progress in making this a safer world, a safer world when the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, will negotiate rather than confront each other, will limit their arms rather than engage in an arms race, in order also to make this a safer world so that the people, one-fourth of all the people of the world who live in the People's Republic of China can cooperate in some areas with the United States, let me just tell you my philosophy."", 'I know what the great danger is that hangs over the world: the danger of nuclear war. I know the great differences in philosophies between the Communist systems and ours, and I say that it is time that we develop, between governments, the United States and other governments, some understandings. Because this is my desire for you, all of the people of this country, but particularly this new, young generation: Let us build a world in which, despite differences of philosophy between governments, despite differences between governments, the people of the world can be friends wherever they may be.', 'Now, to accomplish this goal, if we want to play the role that we want to, to lead to this generation of peace, the United States must continue to maintain the kind of defense that will command respect throughout the world. That is why I oppose such programs as would make the United States have the second strongest Navy, the second strongest Air Force, because let me tell you something: There is no other nation in the free world that can deter aggression around the world.', 'Let me tell you something else: The small nations in the world, like those in the Mideast and in other parts of the world, that depend on the United States for their survival, those small nations, if the United States is ever the second strongest power in the world, would be living in deadly danger. I pledge to you, we shall keep the United States in a position second to none in its national defense, because we know we will use it for peace.', 'If, also, the United States is to be able to play this role, a role in which we are building peace for all the world, which I know all Americans want us to do, it is also essential that we develop within our Armed Forces the kind of spirit, the kind of volunteerism which we will need, because, as you know, one of the great accomplishments of this Administration which has been little noticed, except among those who might be of draft age, is that in June of next year we move away from the draft to the all-volunteer army.', 'I also want to tell you here in this heart of America because this is the heart of America, as has already been indicated by Joe Margiotta and Governor Rockefeller--I want to tell you that if we are to have an all-volunteer army, it is not going to be enough to do what we are going to do, pay them equally what they can get in civilian life, because anybody who serves in our Armed Forces in peacetime or in wartime, but particularly even in peacetime, above everything else, deserves respect. I believe in respecting the uniform of those who defend the United States.', ""This is Veterans Day. I have just motorcaded all through Westchester. I have seen the great bands that are here. I have heard the patriotic songs. At Eastchester I laid the first wreath at the new War Memorial that had been erected there. As I laid the wreath and stood back for the moment of silence, this thought crossed my mind as I thought of that volunteer army: The thought was that instead of having all of this talk about providing amnesty for those that desert America, let's honor those who served America, the millions."", 'So I can say to you, looking to the future, the road will not be easy, but I see the best chance that we have had in this century for young Americans to have a generation of peace, and I dedicate myself to do everything we can to bring that about.', ""There is a second great goal. That means that with peace you want jobs. What we want is something we have not had since President Eisenhower was President in '55 and '56. That means full prosperity, full employment without war and without inflation, and we are going to have that."", 'At the present time, you can have confidence in the fact that the United States today has the fastest rate of growth, the lowest rate of inflation, of any major industrial power in the world.', ""But that isn't good enough. We must continue to hold the line on prices. If we are going to continue to have growth in our economy, we must stop that kind of spending that would lead to a tax increase in this country, because taxes are already too high and we are going to keep those taxes from going up."", 'If we are going to continue to have progress, progress that will mean more jobs for more Americans than ever before in history, we must provide, of course, every kind of assistance that we possibly can to those that cannot help themselves, but there must be no ceiling on opportunity in America, no ceiling by quota or any other way. Let a man or woman, regardless of his background, go as high as he can. That is the way to build a great economy in America.', ""And while I am talking on that subject, if we are going to continue to have this economy grow and expand, to provide the new jobs that we want, let's understand that there is no real conflict when we talk about welfare versus work. Let us understand: Every American wants to provide welfare to the greatest extent possible to those who cannot help themselves. But let us also understand: Except for the taxes paid by 82 million Americans who work, there would be no welfare in the United States, so we must not penalize those who work."", 'I would suggest tonight an Eleventh Commandment: No one who is able to work shall find it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work. That is the kind that we should have.', 'Looking to that future too, we are going to continue to make progress in the field that I discussed on national radio last week, and that means in restoring respect for law and order and justice. That means in continuing a massive drive on dangerous drugs and narcotics we need your help, and in that respect may I suggest something tonight? As I have gone through Westchester and now tonight, I have seen many men in blue, the uniforms of the police. Give them the backing and the respect they deserve for the job that they do.', 'On my part, I will say to you that any appointments that I have the opportunity to make to the courts of this land or to the law enforcement officials of this land, as has been the case in the last 4 years, you can be sure that the age of permissiveness is gone. We are not going to have room for more permissive judges.', 'In addition, and I particularly address this to those of you who have all of your future ahead, how fortunate you are to live in this country, in this place, to be here. It is not just enough to have peace. It is not just enough to have a job. You must have a goal. That means you want this country to be better. You want it to progress. Let me tell you that in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, in the field of environment, we laid before the Congress in 1970, again in 1971, and early this year, 1972, as Governor Rockefeller will agree, historic new programs of reform. They are needed. The Congress has not acted. But I can assure you, give us your vote on November 7, and we will get the Congress to act next year.', 'When the next 4 years end, as all of you know, America will celebrate its 200th birthday. It will be the oldest democracy in the world. It will have lived longer than any other one. The question is: What will we be then? What will we have done and what will we mean to the world? I believe that we can be and should be certainly the strongest nation in the world. I believe that without question we will be the richest nation in the world. But we would still possibly not be a great people unless we had something else.', 'Let me take you back 196 years. There in Independence Hall the thought ran through my mind, what a wonderful country it was so many years ago, and yet it was weak and it was poor, only 3 million people and 13 States. But America had something then. Its people loved this country. It had an ideal and because its people so loved this country, that ideal caught the imagination of the world, and America, from the time of its beginning, has been the hope of the world.', 'I just want to say to you, I have been to 80 countries. I have been to all of the 50 States. You hear what is wrong with America. Let me say, you and all the world can be thankful that it is America that has the power that we have because we do not threaten the peace of any other nation and we will never do so.', 'Let me say to you, too, I see here a sign, ""Croatia."" I was in Zagreb. I saw on a rainy day 500,000 people cheering-what?--not me as an individual, because there in Yugoslavia, in Croatia, they did not know me as an individual. But to them the United States meant something more than military power and economic strength. It meant a great ideal.', 'I want to say to all of this great audience, and particularly to the young ones who are here: Be proud of your country. If you ever go abroad and travel as I have and as Mrs. Nixon and I have together, when you come back you will say, we are the most fortunate people in the world to live in the United States of America.', 'I do not contend that the United States is perfect. The American revolution will never end. It is a continuing revolution, and the glory of it is that peacefully we can change the things we do not like, but stay to the good values. Remember that it was not just military and material might that built America. It was our spiritual and moral strength, and never let this Nation lose that spiritual and moral strength that has made us what we are.', 'To all of this great audience---and as I look at this audience, let me say, I have never had so many people behind me-my friends, here in the State of New York, in the county of Nassau, may I leave this final thought with you? I know what you want for the next 4 years. I will tell you what I want. I want the next 4 years to be the best 4 years of your lives.', 'Thank you.']"
51,Richard Nixon ,"October 23, 1972","['Thank you very much:', 'Governor Rockefeller, Congressman [James R.] Grover, my wife and I want to express our very grateful appreciation to our wonderful friends here from Suffolk County, who are completing one of the finest campaign days we have had in 25 years. We thank you very much.', 'As I went along the fence greeting a few of you, I was thinking back to an appearance in Suffolk in the year 1960. Some of you may remember. But I recall there was a heavy rain that day, and it was a marvelous rally nevertheless.', 'There was something about this county that struck me then. It had a special spirit. The people would come out, rain or snow for that matter, and, even more important, they voted.I am aware of the fact that in the year 1968 the county with the biggest majority for our ticket, 90,000, was Suffolk County, New York. Now, at the present time I live in Orange County, California. Orange County is trying to have a majority of 100,000, and I have been promised by the county chairman here that you are going to beat them, beat Orange County, and I wish you well.', 'May I say, too, that I am proud to be here with the two Congressmen--I mean one present Congressman and one to be, my friend Jim Grover and Joe Boyd,1 who belongs in the United States Congress. Come up here and take a bow so they can see you. Come on. Here he is. Jim, you are a cinch, but take a bow too. We need you. Can I say that to do the job that we need to do in Washington we need their help. I also have a special reason about Joe Boyd, particularly. I would like to say that I lived in this county and I have some special connections with it. I wrote my 1968 acceptance speech at Montauk Point, so I have a special feeling for it. Also, my daughter, my daughter Tricia, now Tricia Cox, and her husband, have as their voting residence Suffolk County, and they would like to have this fine young man, Joe Boyd, as their Congressman. So, how about voting--giving him one in this respect?', 'Let me say one final thing: At the great rally we had in Nassau and along the streets of Westchester County we heard many people shouting ""Four More Years."" I want to tell you in a word what I want for those next 4 years. We have made great progress, great progress particularly in this last year toward a goal that all Americans want, and that is peace in the whole world.', ""Our trips to Peking and Moscow, the winding down of the war in Vietnam, mean that we can look forward in the next 4 years to, it seems to me, achieving a goal that we have not had in this whole century, the basis for that goal at least--a full generation of peace for all Americans. It will not be easy, but we are dedicated to that goal. We realize that this is a dangerous world because there are differences between governments. The Communist Government of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Government of the Soviet Union, and the Government of the United States have very great differences in interests and differences in philosophies. But with the nuclear danger that hangs over the world, I am determined that we must build a world order in which differences between governments do not make it impossible for people to be friends."", 'We must continue to have a strong United States to do that. That is why I will oppose any rash cuts in our budget which would make the United States the second strongest nation in the world. I am for that not out of any sense of simply false pride or national ego, because I know that the United States and its people are dedicated to peace and not to conquest, and power in our hands means power for peace.', 'We also want prosperity, something we have not had since 1955 when President Eisenhower was President, without war and without inflation, and we can have it with your help. We want an era of progress, progress for all Americans, opportunity unlimited by quotas or any other device of that sort, and opportunity for everybody, regardless of his background. Above all, let me tell you something else. This is a year which is an exciting one. For the first time young people between 18 and 21 will have the chance to vote. It will be their first vote. I want them to be able to look back and think that it was one of their best.', 'In that connection, let me say, when I hear ""Four More Years"" this is my goal and I hope it is yours: Let\'s make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America\'s history.']"
52,Richard Nixon ,"October 23, 1972","['Governor and Mrs. Rockefeller--Nelson and Happy, as most of us, I think, are privileged to know them--and all of our very distinguished guests:', 'I was thinking, as the Governor was introducing me so generously, of the many meetings that I have attended, going back over 25 years. I ran for the House, and believe me, when I saw Peter Peyser introduced, and thought of his race, and Carl Vergari and his race,1 just let me say one thing at this point: There is nothing more lonely in a Presidential campaign than to be running for any other office.', 'Believe me, support our candidates for the House, for the State legislature, up and down the line, because they really deserve it in a Presidential year.', 'I was thinking, too, of all of the 50 States we had visited, of all the places that I have had the opportunity of speaking in, and I must say that coming here today to this magnificent residence to be received so generously and so warmly by Nelson and Happy Rockefeller, is certainly one of the highlights of all of our political traveling. I think they deserve a hand.', 'I am going to be speaking a little later over in Nassau--is this Nassau? I am going to speak at Nassau and Suffolk, in Nassau. So we are now in Westchester. I, too, was impressed by that splendid motorcade today, by the reception that we had. I must say, we had an awfully good advance man, though, because riding in the car ahead was Nelson and Happy Rockefeller, so they cleared the way for us all the way.', 'As you ride in a motorcade, you can get rather a feeling of how an election is going. Naturally, you see some of the opposition out, that is always the case. And you also see some of your own supporters out, usually quite a few more than they have, and that is the usual case. But the real thing that determines it is the enthusiasm of your supporters, our supporters.', 'What impressed me, incidentally, was the fact that there were not a lot of signs that were all made and distributed in advance. There were, on the other hand, it seemed to me--and I think, Nelson, you will agree--there was really a warm, friendly, holiday crowd, very proud to be Americans, receiving the President of the United States. They may not all vote for us, but let me say that as I drove through those towns in Westchester County, I thought what a really good country this is and what really good people we have in it and how privileged we are to be able to represent them in any form of government.', 'The campaigning that I can do this year is somewhat limited, due to the rather extraordinary requirements of the office of the Presidency at this time. I had, therefore, scheduled, as you know already, a regional meeting in Atlanta where all of the Southern States were gathered together, just as you are gathered here. And here in New York State, the leaders of the Eastern and Middle Atlantic States are gathered here.', 'This is a very important and vital group. Let me put it in terms that all of you will understand, comparing it with the past elections on which I have been a candidate at the top of the ticket.', 'In 1960, when we lost a very close election, in 1968 when we won an election not quite as close but still close, it was significant to note that in neither of those years did we carry the State of New York or the State of Pennsylvania or the State of Connecticut or the State of Rhode Island or the State of Maryland. Now, when you think of that, it makes you realize that what really is at stake in this room are the States that can make all the difference in this election.', 'I know that I don\'t need to tell a group of people who are what we call proudly ""political professionals""--and that means whether you are doing it full time or part time you consider it so important that you will give up anything in order to participate in the campaign, and that is correct--I don\'t need to tell you that you never take anything for granted. I do tell you today that the area where we can have the greatest turnover compared with \'68 and \'60 is in the area of the East, because this year w-e want to win those States. I will mention another one, incidentally, that was not on the ""win"" list--Massachusetts.', ""I don't mean that we are predicting that we will win them all, but we do have a chance to win in each one of them. We are not going to take any one of them for granted. We are not going to concede any one of them. But let me say that when election night comes, there is nothing that would mean more, certainly, to all of us than to see a State like New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, the ones I have mentioned, in our column this year, and you have it in your hands to do it."", 'Now, just a word of confiding in you with regard to the relationship that we have to each of these States. Anyone who has been a candidate for public Office, or anyone who has heard candidates, knows that the candidate always tries to find some way to relate himself to the State in which he happens to be campaigning. It is interesting to note that my wife Pat and I have something in common with each of these States. We have lived, for example, in the State of New York. We have lived there for 5 years. We have lived, also--and this was long before we were in political life--in the State of Maryland for 2 months, toward the end of the war when we were settling terminated war contracts at Middle River, Maryland, and in the State of Pennsylvania where we lived in Philadelphia for about 6 weeks. So much for States we have lived in.', ""In addition, we have these things to relate to this area: My wife's father was born in Connecticut. Now, while we have not lived in the States I am now going to mention, it happens that we have taken vacations in each one of the following States."", 'We have vacationed at Kennebunk and Ogunquit in Maine. We have taken vacations also in the State of New Jersey, at Mantoloking, all that marvelous beach area there.', 'We have also taken vacations in the State of Delaware, at Rehoboth.', 'When you come down the line, that only leaves two that I have not mentioned. One is Vermont. Now, we have never vacationed in Vermont, and we haven\'t lived there. But I was thinking, ""What do we have in common with Vermont, except that it has never done anything but vote Republican?"" And we have this: Our two girls went to camp in Vermont.', 'I have missed Rhode Island. I was in Rhode Island for 2 months taking a course so that I could get into the Navy as an officer in World War II. So there, we have covered them all.', 'What I am really trying to say here at this point is very simply that as we look at this great belt of States in the eastern seaboard, with so much history, with so much character, with so much to offer America, we feel very close to each of you, to each one of these States. We visited each one of them many, many times.', 'Oh, I have left one State out, and I have done it quite deliberately. We have never vacationed in New Hampshire. We have never lived in New Hampshire. But believe me, as one who has been in primary after primary, I have spent more time in New Hampshire than almost any State in this country. So, there it is.', 'Just a couple of final words: I mentioned the importance of your local candidates and of the candidates for the House and, in those States that are here who have candidates for the United States Senate, for the United States Senate. We have tried in every way possible where the national candidates were concerned to see them, to provide endorsements for them, and the like. You can be sure that as far as the whole ticket up and down the line is concerned, that we are very proud of our candidates for the State legislature and for local office throughout all of the States that are represented here.', ""The other point that I would make is one that I know all of you will totally understand. The election is only 2 weeks away. As far as what will happen on issues is concerned, no one can predict how many voters will change. Some theories are that voters change a great deal in the last 2 weeks, and others are that they really don't change that much, it is only that the pollsters don't poll late enough and find out that a change has already started. But that doesn't make any difference. What I am saying to you here now is: The vital importance is to get out the vote, to get it out up and down the line. The vital importance also is not to get out just the Republican vote, which of course, we must do, but get out the votes among independent voters and among Democrats and, here in the State of New York, among those who are conservatives, to get them out up and down the line."", 'Because what you are going to find, what we are finding all over the country this year, is that people are not just thinking in terms of voting party. We do find, as a matter of fact, less defection from the Republican line than in any election in recent history. But on the other hand, we find that more Democrats at the present time will cross over and vote at the top of the ticket for us than ever before. That can help everybody.', 'The point that I make is: Let us keep as our goal, of course, getting out our own vote. Let us also recognize the vital importance of having a big vote, because we must remember that when there are indications that one candidate is ahead of another, the candidate who is behind tends to have his vote come out in greater numbers than the one who is ahead.', 'I will just say finally this last thing. We are going to meet all of you personally, the Governor and Happy and Pat and myself. But in the brief time that you go through the receiving line, while we have met many of you before, I cannot say adequately what I want to say now.', ""I have done, as you all know, a lot of campaigning. If I haven't been in your town it is because probably only that it was not there in 1952 or '56 or '60, not only in those years but in '54, '58, '66. We covered a lot of them, too. I can tell you that I know as a candidate, sure the speeches are important, and the television we do is important, and how we handle the issues is important. But what is really important is you, the party workers, the people who come from the ranks of labor, the people who come, who participate in politics, from any other group, but who get behind the candidate."", 'You are the ones who are going to make the difference. You are the ones who are going to steam up the workers. You are the ones who are going to get out the vote. On election eve, when the vote comes in, if we do have this enormous turnaround which we can have in this great eastern seaboard--understand, it can be the biggest turnaround of any section of the country--if we do have it, while I will not be able to call each of you individually, I am just telling you right now, I know who did it. You did it, and thank you very much.']"
53,Richard Nixon ,"October 25, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'I want to talk to you today about an issue that has tremendous impact on present-day America and that will play a decisive role in shaping the America of the future--education.', 'Americans today are the freest, best educated people in the world. We must keep it that way, and one of the surest means is to keep our educational system strong and free.', 'Money, of course, is part of the answer. Under this Administration the Federal Government has increased its contribution to education by over 70 percent, from $9 billion in fiscal year 1969 to $15.7 billion in the budget for fiscal year 1973.', 'But money is only part of the answer. Too often over the years, the American taxpayer has seen millions of tax dollars poured into education programs that did not work because not enough thought and planning went into them. Much of the resistance to the imposition of more taxes today is the result of rightful dissatisfaction at the way present tax revenues are being spent.', 'The roots of the taxpayer revolt lie not in selfishness, but in a sensible refusal to pay more for Government programs that have failed to meet the needs and wishes of the people in an effective way.', 'It is very easy for politicians to call for new millions of dollars to be allocated for every new education spending proposal that spins out of an ivory tower. The myth that all problems can be solved by throwing money at them is not easily dispelled. But the President of the United States must carefully weigh the cost of new proposals against their merits.', 'And there are times when he must have the strength to say ""no"" for the sake of the American taxpayer. Three times I have said ""no"" to excessive education spending legislation. In each case I did so because I believe the added tax burden would have far outweighed the benefits to be derived by the program.', 'In each case, the question was not whether to increase worthwhile spending on education, but how much to increase it. I believe that in those three cases the amounts proposed by the Congress were more than the public could afford to pay, and the amounts I proposed were in balance with both our educational needs and the economic well-being of the American taxpayer.', 'Now, here are some of the important achievements which have resulted during this Administration, following the philosophy I have just outlined: For younger children:', '--We have increased funding for early childhood education projects to over a half billion dollars.', '--We have more than doubled aid to elementary and secondary schools.', '--We have improved the education of disadvantaged preschool children in their first 5 years of life through the efforts of the new Office of Child Development and a twenty-fold increase in food assistance program funding.', '--And we have given greater support and encouragement to successful educational innovation, including television programs like ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Electric Company.""', 'For high school students:', '--In addition to increasing Federal aid, we have given top priority to the development of career education, vocational education, so that students leaving school have a choice of entering the job market with a salable skill or continuing their education, if they prefer, at a higher level.', 'For college students:', '--We have more than doubled loan and grant amounts, so that today $4 billion in Federal student assistance is available.', 'And for all Americans:', '--We have launched a Right to Read program that should soon make illiteracy a thing of the past in the United States. Thanks to this effort, we can reasonably hope that by the end of this decade nearly every American reaching young adulthood will have basic reading skills.', ""Under this Administration the Federal Government is also attempting to fulfill its responsibility to the Nation's black colleges. I have requested over $200 million in assistance to these institutions for fiscal year 1973. That is more than double the funding level of fiscal year 1969 when I came into office."", 'As a result of our initiatives, a good education is no longer a remote dream for millions of young Americans who would not have had this chance a few short years ago. The ceiling on opportunity and achievement in America today is almost unlimited.', 'One part of the educational community that has contributed to America from the very beginnings of our history faces special needs today, and they are urgent. I refer to our nonpublic schools.', 'Were these nonpublic schools to fail, the loss of diversity, the elimination of freedom of choice for millions of parents, and the new burden on the already crowded public school system would be but part of the cost.', 'Lost, as well, would be an irreplaceable and precious national asset--schools that have provided millions of American children with a moral code and religious principles by which to live. Nonpublic schools have served this Nation and people faithfully and well by maintaining and continuing the religious traditions and beliefs that are so integral a part of our American heritage. I believe that parents of school-age children should be provided the freedom to choose a religious-centered education for their children, if they desire--and I am determined to help guarantee that freedom of choice.', 'Therefore, just as in the last Congress this Administration supported a tax credit for parents of children attending nonpublic schools, so I am irrevocably committed to seeking tax credit legislation in the next Congress, since the last Congress did not act.', 'In my judgment, the Constitution does not prohibit tax inducements to encourage and maintain diversity in American education--and I am prepared to fight to guarantee that that diversity remains in America.', 'Another fundamental element of American education which goes back to our beginnings is the neighborhood school. The neighborhood school is the focal point of community involvement. It binds together students, parents, and school administrators. It brings out the best in all of them.', 'No one profits by the confusion and resentment that is generated when whole school systems are disrupted by the forced busing of schoolchildren away from their neighborhoods. The answer to inequities in our educational system is to spend more money on learning and less money on forced busing.', 'Quality education for all and an end to racial discrimination are goals that we seek, and we seek them both. The way to achieve them is to eliminate unlawful discrimination, and to make a special effort to improve the quality of education in the disadvantaged areas.', ""That is the policy that I am committed to as President. The emergency school aid act, recently enacted, authorizes $2 billion of new money to help meet the special problems of desegregating the Nation's schools."", ""This Administration's equal educational opportunities act of 1972, had the Congress approved it, would have concentrated funds for the improvement of education for underprivileged children, and would have legislated an end to arbitrary, court-ordered busing of children out of their neighborhoods. However, as you know, after passing the House of Representatives, this measure was filibustered to death in the Senate by pro-busing Senators. I will once again press the next Congress for the passage of this legislation."", 'The question of neighborhood schools is part of a greater issue--that of where the real decisionmaking power in the field of education should lie; whether it should lie in the hands of appointed judges or officials in Washington or in the hands of people themselves. I believe that the people themselves deserve the greatest voice in our educational system.', 'That is one reason why I have proposed an education special revenue sharing program to be spent on education in the way the local people and their locally elected leaders deem best, without Federal controls or Federal domination.', 'This is the best way I know to get American education back on the track, to relate it to the needs of our people instead of the whims of Federal bureaucrats. I will keep on working for this program until it is enacted.', 'Looking further ahead, the whole education process needs to be reexamined. We need to put American know-how to work analyzing the learning process itself.', 'The Government should never dictate to the people what kind of education is best, but it has an obligation to provide the people with the research and the information they need to decide these matters for themselves. In a changing age, education must keep pace. It must not fall behind.', 'To meet this challenge, we have created a National Institute of Education-not to turn out Federal regulations and quotas, but to put some of the best minds in this country to work learning more about the learning process itself. Their findings will help parents and local educators to provide our children with more effective, more useful teaching in the years ahead.', 'Each of these achievements and goals that I have outlined this afternoon is important. Each can help to make our education system even better than it is, and can extend the American dream to more of our people. But there is another crucial ingredient which no President, no administration, no Congress can supply. That is respect for education and for teaching, respect that must lie in the hearts of the people.', ""Most of us can probably think back to a teacher who opened up our minds to learning and helped plant the seeds of hope and enthusiasm in our hearts. I think, for example, of a wonderful teacher I had in the fifth grade. In those days you had only one teacher for the whole class-she had to handle all subjects. Miss Burum did that, and she did it very well, but her favorite subject was geography. I can still remember how she communicated her enthusiasm, her love of learning, her fascination with geography and with the different countries of the world to her pupils. And although she will probably never appear in the history books, you might say that in a way Miss Burum was one of the people responsible for my trips to Russia and to the People's Republic of China and for the new beginnings for peace that those trips have helped to usher in."", 'I mention this because I think it illustrates an important point about education today. We can spend all of the money we want. We can buy all the books, build all the classrooms, fancy new schools. We can do all that, but at the heart of any good school system, we must have talented, dedicated teachers. They are the indispensable ingredient that brings the whole combination to life. To have teachers like that, parents and students must give teachers the respect that is their due, and the standing in the community they deserve.', 'It was Henry Adams who wrote, ""A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.""', 'The same thing is true of our education system in general. The kind of schooling we provide for our young people today will play a major role in determining the kind of country we will have well into the next century.', ""And so I pledge to you this afternoon that I will continue to work to make the Federal Government's role in education a positive, productive one, and to give to the people and their locally elected representatives the means with which they can play a larger role in improving education."", 'By seeking this basic goal together, we can build a system that brings a quality education and full opportunity to all Americans.', 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
54,Richard Nixon ,"October 26, 1972","[""Thank you very much. Mrs. Nixon and I want to tell you how very much we appreciate your wonderful welcome. I was just talking to Governor Moore and he was telling me that you only learned at 12 o'clock that we were going to be able to stop here before going over to Ashland, and what a marvelous crowd you have--I understand from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. Right. Three States."", ""There isn't room on these steps, incidentally, for everybody, but I am going to have a word to say in a moment about that. But I want you to be sure to see everybody who is here. First, Mrs. Nixon. Pat, will you step up here so they can see you?"", 'And now Mrs. Moore, the First Lady of West Virginia.', 'And next, Arch Moore, the Governor of West Virginia. Just stay right here, Arch, because I am going to have something to say about you.', ""One thing I said to Arch Moore when we were moving down the line here was that I thought this airstrip was a little bit short. That is why we had to bring this Convair in. He said you were taking care of that. I just want you to know that as soon as you get a long enough strip, I hope to bring the Spirit of '76, that big plane, right into this airport."", 'Also, I think you should know that we are very proud that this is the second visit we have been able to make to West Virginia since assuming office as President. We remember the wonderful day at the Elkins Forest Festival in 1971, in the fall. I remember, too, that on that occasion I paid my respects to a great West Virginian who since that time has traveled a great number of miles, and we have traveled with him.', ""Since that time in '71, as you may know, and, of course, you all do from having followed the papers and the television, we have traveled to Peking, to Moscow, to Warsaw--in fact, the first President of the United States ever to visit these three capitals of Communist countries."", 'Let me say the man who flew us--and I would say this is no overstatement-probably one of the greatest pilots of all time, is, of course, a West Virginian, Colonel [Ralph] Albertazzie. Wherever we went, whether it was to Peking, halfway around the world, or Moscow, a third of the way around the world, or Warsaw, about a fourth of the way around the world, he was always on time, just as he was here tonight in West Virginia, his own State.', 'Come over here. Come on, so they can see you. Here he is--Colonel Albertazzie.', 'Now, if I could just say a few words to you about the campaign which now is drawing to a close, I would like to speak to you not as a partisan, but as all of you are and all of us try to be, as an American, speaking about your State and our country.', 'First about your State. I have known Arch Moore for a great number of years. I knew him when he was in the House of Representatives, and in the last 4 years I have had the privilege of working very closely with him when he has been the Governor of the State and I have been in the White House. I am here to ask the people of West Virginia, whatever your politics may be, whether you are Democrats or Republicans or independents--I am asking you to give us the chance-Arch Moore and me the chance--to work for 4 more years for the good of West Virginia and the good of this country.', ""Now, I was going to go down the list of things that Arch Moore has talked to me in these past 4 years about West Virginia, but it is too long and I wouldn't get over to Ashland for the speech I am supposed to make there in a few minutes. Let me tell you one thing, however: I had a decision to make about the black lung bill. I know that doesn't affect many of the people in this audience. However, it affects many of the people in West Virginia, Kentucky, all over this part of the country. It was a difficult decision because of some technical factors about the bill. I will never forget, however, the day that Arch Moore came to the White House. He sat there in the Oval Office. You know, he doesn't pound the table. He doesn't shout. But, boy, does he come across. So I signed the bill, and, Arch Moore, we thank you for coming in for that."", 'Could I now say a word--and this is something I could say in West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, California, Maine, New Hampshire, anyplace in this country--a word about this election and what it means in terms of the younger generation particularly, and all of us, whatever our age may be. I know that in our hearts tonight, above everything else we want a world of peace. As all of you have read or heard on your television tonight, there has been a significant breakthrough in the negotiations with regard to Vietnam.1', 'Tonight I can say to you with confidence that because of the progress that has been made, I am confident that we shall succeed in achieving our objective, which is peace with honor, and not peace with surrender, in Vietnam.', 'There are still differences to be worked out. I believe that they can and will be worked out. But let me go on beyond that.', 'America has been in wars and has ended wars before in this century, but the great tragedy is that we end one war and then, before a generation is over, we are in another one. And the goal that I have sought, the goal that all of you want, that all Americans want, is not just a peace that is simply a period of rest between wars but real peace that will last.', 'Did you know that in this whole century we have never had a full generation, young people growing up for a full generation without war? We had World War I, and then World War II, and then Korea, and then Vietnam. I think that is enough. What I want is a generation of peace, and beyond that, another generation of peace. And that is why not only are we ending the war in Vietnam in a way that will promote the interest of lasting peace, but that is why we went to Peking, that is why we went to Moscow.', ""The differences between the Government of the United States and the philosophy that we hold to, and the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Soviet Union are very great. The Communist and our systems will always be different. But in the world in which we live it is essential that we build a system in which we can have differences between governments, but in which the people of those nations can be friends."", 'It is important that the Russian people and the American people not be enemies. It is important that the Chinese people--and that is one-fourth of all the people in this world--not be enemies of the United States. I am not suggesting tonight that in this past year in which these historic journeys have taken place that we have achieved the millennium. There is much more to be done. What I am telling you is that if you give me the chance in the next 4 years, we are going to make more progress building that generation of peace that everybody wants for all Americans and all the world.', ""And beyond that, we want to do something else. We want something that we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President in 1955 and '56, and that means prosperity, full employment without war and without inflation. We are working toward that goal; we are moving toward it. We are not there yet, but we are going to continue to fight inflation. We are going to continue to work for policies that will have growth for our economy, because we want every boy and girl, young man, young woman in this country, to have an opportunity for a job if he is willing to work and able to work. We think we can achieve that goal. We ask for the opportunity to continue the policies that have come so far in achieving it already."", 'The third point I wish to make is this: As we move into a period of peace in the years ahead, I want it to be, and all of you want it to be, a period of progress. I think of West Virginia. You, of course, live here. I have visited here quite often. This is a beautiful State. It has so much to see, and you, the people of West Virginia, are a good people. You are a strong people. You are a patriotic people. You are builders of America. You love this country. I want the people of West Virginia to go forward with all of the American people toward an era of progress and opportunity and prosperity without war, such as we have never seen.', ""What I am simply saying to you at the last of my remarks tonight is this: I do not speak to you as a partisan. I speak to you with no bitterness about this campaign, but I speak with you, as we should as we begin the closing days of the campaign, about our hopes and about our ideals. And I will say to you simply, what I want for the next 4 years is that the next 4 years will be the best 4 years in this Nation's history. Give us the chance; let us do the job.""]"
55,Richard Nixon ,"October 26, 1972","['Thank you very much. I want all of you to know what a very great experience it is for my wife Pat and for me to return to Kentucky. I want you to know that when I think of those six visits, and others, too, in which I have come to this State, I never fail to marvel at the wonderfully warm reception that we have received. And having noticed many of the new buildings as we came along the road, and having noticed that there are 10 times as many outside this hall as there are inside, I think we need a bigger armory right here.', ""To those outside--I understand they may be able to hear on the public address system--we are sorry that you couldn't get in. We are sorry we didn't have the chance to stop and greet many of you, although we did make a couple of stops on the way in, and we can only say that your devotion and your dedication to be there with your welcomes, your smiles, your flags, your signs, really touched our hearts."", 'Let me say, too, that the signs here are very interesting. I see one down here. It says ""Sandy Says Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue. If You Kiss Me, I\'ll Vote For You."" [Laughter] She must mean Louie Nunn. [Laughter] Are you 18? [Laughter]', 'Could I begin first with some personal remarks. One, we owe a great deal to this State, the support we have had through the years, the friendships that we have in this State. We owe also the fact that over the last 4 years we have had a very gracious and lovely lady from Kentucky as the Social Secretary at the White House, Lucy Winchester. We are very proud of Lucy, and we are very glad that she could be there.', 'While this is, of course, a very happy occasion for us, this magnificent rally and all this enthusiasm with just a few days before the election, it is also for us a rather sad day in a way, as I am sure it is for you, because we realize that John Sherman Cooper is not going to be a candidate this year, and we realize, as we think of that, his service to the Nation and to his State over the years, how splendid it has been and how much we will miss him.', 'I simply want to say that I have known him, of course, through all the years. I have campaigned this State up through these mountains with him on many occasions, almost 20 years ago. Sometimes he has won; sometimes he has lost. Sometimes I have won; sometimes I have lost, although, let me say, I have never lost Kentucky and I am not going to start now.', 'John Cooper, not only as a Senator but as a distinguished Ambassador to India, has served his Nation in a magnificent way. I know that he will serve it in the future, I trust, in some capacity, because men of this quality, of this dedication, of this character are rare, and we are fortunate to have had him in government and to have him in the future.', 'Let me say, too, that as I think of him, I think of the tradition of Kentucky and Senators. You stop to think, of course, of Henry Clay. We all read about him and you read about him. Four times a candidate for President. He never made it. But he was one of the great, great Senators, and to follow in his footsteps there have been other great Senators of both parties down through the years. We think, for example, of Alben Barkley, a Senator from Kentucky. We think, too, in more recent years, of John Sherman Cooper and Thruston Morton.', ""We think of that tradition. I could mention others. Just let me say this: With that kind of tradition in times past, what we need now is to continue that tradition. I don't know of a better team that could represent Kentucky or any State in the United States Senate than Marlow Cook and Louie Nunn. We need them both."", 'I, of course, have known Louie Nunn when he managed my campaign not only in Kentucky but throughout these States in the year 1968 in this Mideastern region. I have known him as Governor of this State when he has worked so hard with us in Washington, and he has always found that door of the Oval Office open then, and he will in the future, just as any from Kentucky will.', 'Also, in mentioning him may I say, too, that I would not want to overlook the splendid representation in the House of Representatives--Tim Lee Garter, your Congressman, who is here.', ""Having spoken of that tradition, it seems to me tonight that before this splendid audience here in the heartland of Kentucky, in the heartland of America, you would appreciate my talking about the future of America. I could talk about our record. I am proud of it. We haven't accomplished everything that we would have wanted. I don't suppose any President ever can or will. All we do is to try to do the best we can, but we have made great progress in many fields."", 'I could talk about the past. I could talk also simply of the differences that I have with those of the opposition. But as we enter the closing days of the campaign, I think what the American people really want to hear from anyone who aspires to the office of the Presidency is what his vision is of the future.', 'What about those next 4 years? What do we plan? What will it mean to all of us--to the older people, to the younger people? And speaking of the younger people, let me just say an interesting thing. I noted that in Kentucky 18-year-olds have had the vote since the year 1954. In 1956, 1960, 1968, as you know, I have been on the ticket, on the ballot in Kentucky. I have always come in, or at least carried it. And I remember when the 18-year-old vote was passed in the Congress of the United States there were those that said that was going to be a very great blow to us in the year 1972.', 'Well, one thing this election demonstrates, when the 18-year-olds had the vote in Kentucky, we won it. When the 18-year-olds have the vote in the Nation, we are going to win the Nation.', 'Now, let me turn, if I may, quickly, to that future, their future, our future, the future of this Nation, what the next 4 years can mean on the great issues that cut across State lines and regional lines and racial lines and religious lines, on the great issues that are American, not partisan.', 'Let us think for a few moments not about our partisan affiliation, our backgrounds, but simply that we are all very proud to be Americans tonight, and as we think of being Americans, what are the hopes of America in these next 4 years?', 'Let me first address myself to the subject that Louie Nunn so eloquently has touched upon, the subject of peace. When we speak of peace, I know the immediate thought that comes through our minds, and it is one that has been coming through our minds for many years, through the years that America has been engaged in the longest war in its history. It is a war that began long before I came into office in 1969. It is one that we have wound down. It is one which, as you know from reading your newspapers this afternoon and listening to the television and radio, in which there has been a significant breakthrough in the peace negotiations.', ""Let me say to you tonight that on May 8, when I made the difficult decision of mining the harbors of North Vietnam and bombing military targets, I laid out three goals for peace. I thought they were reasonable goals, and they were these: First, there should be a cease-fire, stop the killing. Second, all of America's POW's should be returned and all of our missing in action should be accounted for. And third, the people of South Vietnam, the 17 million people who live in South Vietnam, should have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government imposed upon them against their will by force. Those were the three goals."", 'Now, based on the progress that has been made in the negotiations to date, I can say with confidence tonight that I believe that we can succeed in achieving those goals. I believe that we will succeed in achieving the goal that I have heard from those young people sitting behind us, peace with honor, and not surrender, for America. The day has not yet come. There are still some differences that must be resolved. I believe that they will be resolved.', 'However, let us look back for a moment about other times in this century. If you are old enough to have lived through them, as I was, or if you are old enough, certainly as all of you are, to have read about them, you remember the relief-1918, Armistice Day. I remember at that time I was only 5 years old, but I can recall the celebration in our little town at Yorba Linda, California. What a relief. The war was over.', 'But it was only an interlude; it was not peace that lasted. Because before the next generation grew up, the sons of those who had fought in World War I were fighting in World War II.', 'You remember V-J Day and V-E Day. I recall that on V-J Day I was in New York City, in Times Square, with my wife, and the wonderful elation that we all felt about the war--it was over. And then came the United Nations and all the hope for a new world order, and we thought, now we are going to have real peace.', 'And then the sons and the younger brothers of those who had fought, and many had died--350,000 in World War II--were fighting again in Korea.', ""Then during President Eisenhower's first year in office, you remember the headline--the war was over. And all of us had a sigh of relief because the young men that had died there, certainly their sacrifice had not been in vain, because South Korea retained its independence and its freedom from the North Korean invading forces."", 'And yet within a few years the younger brothers of those who had fought in Korea and the sons of the older ones who had fought in Korea were fighting in Vietnam. And now a day will come, one day, when the war will be over.', ""Let me tell you, that, of course, is a great accomplishment. I can assure you that anyone who sits in that Oval Office, as I do, and writes the letters to the mothers, to the wives, to the next of kin of those who have died, anyone who sees the wounded, the others, the ones who have served so magnificently, anyone who has talked, as I have, to the brave wives of POW's--what you want more than anything else is to get the war over."", 'But also, what you want is to get it over with honor, not simply because of some national ego. You want to get it over with honor because by ending it in an honorable way, by ending it in the right way, you may lay the foundation for not having another war in that same generation.', 'That is why we have insisted on these conditions that I have laid down, and that is why, as this war does come to a conclusion, it will be concluded in a way, we believe, that will discourage aggression in the future rather than encourage it.', 'That is just the beginning. Let me take you a little further, however, on this whole prospect for peace in the world.', 'It would have been somewhat easy, as a matter of fact somewhat tempting, during these past 4 years to work as we did only on trying to bring the war in Vietnam to an end. And it would have been some satisfaction to have brought home 500,000, as we did, to reduce the casualties 98 percent, as we did, to get into peace negotiations that now have a good chance for success, but we did not stop there. And the reason we did not stop there is that, as I looked at the world, I saw that once the war was over in this small part of the world, there still hung over the world a greater danger potentially in the future.', ""There was another super power, the Soviet Union. At the beginning of our term in office, we were in confrontation with that super power. And then there was the huge People's Republic of China, where one-fourth of all the people in the world were living, and with which the people of the United States and their Government had had no communication for a period of over 20 years."", 'As I studied that situation at the beginning of my term in office, long before it began, I determined that it was essential that we build a world order in which governments could have their differences, in which governments could be built on different philosophies, but in which the peoples of nations with different philosophies and different governments need not necessarily be enemies.', ""I felt this was essential, essential particularly when what was involved was not a conventional but a nuclear war which no one would win, where there would be only losers. And so we began in January 1969 not only to bring an end to the war in Vietnam but to establish a new relationship with the Soviet Union and a beginning of a relationship with the People's Republic of China. The year 1972, this year, has perhaps seen, historians will record, more progress toward true peace in the world than any year since the end of World War II."", ""I don't mean it is here. I don't mean simply because we went to Peking and established a dialogue that we are not going to have differences with the People's Republic of China. We will have. And I don't mean that because we have had an arms control agreement and trade agreements and exchange agreements and health agreements and environmental agreements with the Soviet Union that we are not going to continue to have differences with the Soviet Union. We will."", ""Theirs are Communist governments; ours is a free government. And sometimes our interests will come in contradiction to each other. But what we have done, you see, what we have done is now to have replaced what was a hopeless situation, hopeless, with the great powers moving down the road to an inevitable collision at some time in the future, with now a hopeful situation in which the United States and the Soviet Union are negotiating their differences at the conference table--we negotiate hard, but we negotiate, and we settle them--in which the United States and the People's Republic of China talk about their differences--we negotiate hard, but we have now developed at least a dialogue."", 'Let me say in that connection then, I would not hold out to this audience, and particularly to these younger people behind me, the certainty that there will not be conflict in the world, the certainty that there will not be small wars in the world. But I do say this: The chance for this new generation of Americans to grow up in a world without war for a whole generation is better than it has been, in my opinion, any time in this century, and we want to keep it that way.', 'When we speak of these next 4 years, what we ask for is the opportunity to continue, to continue to develop these initiatives. We think we have learned somehow, some of the methods with which to deal with these problems, and in dealing with these problems, we think that over the next 4 years we can make more progress in reducing the tensions in the world, in cooling the trouble spots like the Middle East and others that might explode into war.', 'This is the challenge we face, and this is what we ask from the American people: the opportunity to continue the progress that we have made in that direction.', 'Let me relate it now to what we need if w-e are going to be able to accomplish that.', ""Louie Nunn very properly mentioned national defense. I know Kentucky's interest in national defense, and it isn't simply the interest that you have in jobs. It is more the interest you have in this country and the fact that it must maintain its strength.I noticed, for example, that the football team--I think they are the Tom Cats, aren't they? I knew I had the name right when Happy Chandler1 smiled right there."", 'I noticed that they were number two, with the possibility of being number one. Now football is a great game, and everybody wants to be number one. But there is certainly nothing wrong about being number two.', ""But let me tell you, in the kind of world in which we live, let the United States of America never be number two. Let's always be sure of that."", 'Now why? It is different from the football game. Here you like your town or your team, whatever the case might be, to be number one, and you are kind of proud, and I like to be for my school or for my town or my team, whoever they happen to be, and my country, as all of you.', ""But it isn't just that. The reason that the United States cannot have the second strongest navy or the second strongest air force and be the second strongest power in the world is that if we are in that position, or allow ourselves because of misguided people recommending programs that would put us in that position, it means that the danger of war in the world would be tremendously increased, and let me tell you why."", 'The day we become number two, there is no other nation in the world, in the free world, that can deter aggression. You see, before World War I, before World War II, there were the British and there were the French, there were other great nations with the power, but now only the United States is left. We need it for that reason.', ""And there is another reason, because I say today we can be proud of what U.S. foreign policy has tried to do in this century. We have fought four wars. For what? World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam--we didn't go for conquest, we didn't go for glory, not an acre of territory or anything else. We went to help others defend their freedom. We went to fight against aggression. The United States, in other words--when the United States has power, the people of the United States are a peaceful people. We are not going to use that power to destroy freedom or break the peace, and that is why I say that I am committed to--I know that Louie Nunn is and Marlow Cook will be and Tim Lee Garter will be--let's keep the United States in the position where our power is second to none so that we can help keep the peace in the world. That is why I am so strong on national defense."", 'Let me relate now this whole area of peace to what it means in other fields. We not only want peace. Obviously we want a good living. We need jobs, employment, homes, security, all of these that mean the good life in this country with which the people of our country enjoy the best life of any nation in the world.', ""Did you realize that you have to go clear back to President Eisenhower's Administration in the years 1955 and 1956 to find any years in which the United States has had full employment--that means prosperity with full employment-without war and without inflation?"", 'Now I think that we can do it again. That is our goal over these next 4 years. What we want is full employment for the people of this country without war and without inflation.', 'Now let me tell you what we can do and what we have done. First, in 4 years we have cut the rate of inflation in half. Also, we have moved the growth of this economy up until we have the highest rate of growth, of any industrial nation in the world. We must continue to move it up so that we can produce more peacetime jobs, so that Americans can have full employment without war and without inflation. I think we can achieve that goal.', ""Let's see also what this new world of peace can mean to a State like Kentucky, to this entire region. Mention has been made of the farm programs. I am going to make a major farm speech on radio at 12 :05 tomorrow on all the major networks, if you would like to listen, in the middle of the day."", ""I won't go into the details now, but let me say that when you see the sales that we have made, a billion dollar sale to Japan this year, a 3-year sale to the Soviet Union, unprecedented, in feed grains, and the beginnings of sales to the People's Republic of China, where, note again, one-fourth of all the people in the world live, you can see the future for American agriculture."", 'Our exports are the highest in history. They are going to be higher because the markets of the world are opening up. That is what our peace initiatives mean to the farmers, and I think the farmers of Kentucky like that kind of an initiative, too.', 'There is another area that hits the bread-and-butter issue. As our economy grows, we are going to have an enormous energy crisis in this country, and that means we have to produce coal, we have to produce oil. We have to have the means of meeting that crisis, and that is why a State like this has so much to offer.', 'What I am simply saying is that as we move from this period of war to a period of peace, it means enormous opportunities, it means prosperity without war and without inflation, it means developing the new markets in a period of peace that could not develop in a period of war, and it means also the opportunity to turn the enormous energies of this country and the people of this country to the progress that we all want, with opportunity for every American to go as high as his talents will take him---better schools, better housing, all of those things that we want and that we have laid forth in such great detail before the Congress over these past 4 years.', 'What I am saying to you very simply is this: I could talk tonight--and it usually is customary in the closing days of a campaign--about ""we have a great record over the past 4 years"" and ""send us back."" But let us not look back, and let us not be angry at those who oppose us.', 'Let us look to the future. The future is a good future. The future can be a future of peace. The future can be one in which the United States can play the role this Nation was destined to play in building a world of peace and continuing to raise the standard of living of all of our people and increasing the opportunity for all of our people.', 'One final note: I have mentioned what Kentucky has meant to me personally, and to my wife—your hospitality, your friendship, your energy, your coal, your agriculture, your industry. But most important, what has impressed me as I went along that street, I must say, I saw those young people and older people in the dark. They could only see the light of the car as we went by. They had their flags out.', 'What impressed me was not simply patriotism. It went further than that. It was something I call character. I looked back to the beginning of this country. I remember then, and Louie Nunn referred to the fact that the bicentennial of Kentucky is in 2 years, and the Bicentennial of the United States is in 4 years, as you know—look at that young country 196 years ago, 13 States, weak, poor, but the hope of the world. Why? Because we stood for something other than power, some thing other than wealth. We stood for an ideal, for a moral and spiritual strength that caught the imagination of the world, and here in this State of Kentucky I sense it. I sense it across our country, but I sense it in this audience tonight. I sensed it as I went around.', 'Let me say, as much as your hard work—and I know you work hard—and as much as what you produce in your mines and as much as what you produce on your farm, what we are most grateful for is the character and the moral and spiritual strength of the people of this State. You have it, and that means a great deal.', 'And so I have heard them say ""Four More Years."" Let me tell you what m hope is for these next 4 years. It is a very simple statement. I want the next 4 years to be the best 4 years of your lives and the best 4 years America has ever had.', 'Thank you.']"
56,Richard Nixon ,"October 27, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'In every American home, there is special respect and gratitude for the breadwinner--the one who provides the rest of the family with food to eat and clothes to wear.', ""The breadwinners of our national family are this country's nearly 3 million farmers."", 'American agriculture leads our own economy and the world in productivity. Because of the remarkable productivity of our farms and ranches, the people of the United States have more and better food to eat, at lower cost, than any other people anywhere. A smaller percentage of the family budget goes for food in America than in any other country in the world.', 'Because of that productivity, we are able to export vast quantities of our farm products to help feed the world.', 'Because of that productivity, we have been able in the last 4 years to more than triple the Federal effort to eliminate hunger in America, as well as maintaining generous food assistance programs abroad.', 'All of us owe a great debt of gratitude to those Americans for whom agriculture is a proud way of life.', 'Sometimes there is a tendency to think of farmers as an isolated special interest group. For example, it was suggested that I should address this talk today exclusively to farm people, and that it should be broadcast very early in the morning when most of the radio audience would be farmers.', 'But I wanted instead to talk with all Americans on this subject and to make the point that in this election campaign the farm issues and the national issues are one and the same, because farm people want what is best for America.', ""They want to keep our country strong, for they know that America's power is the guardian of peace in the world."", 'They want to end our involvement in Vietnam through peace with honor, not through surrender.', 'They want responsible government spending that can lead to tax relief and prevent renewed inflation--because inflation hits farmers doubly hard. It raises their costs on the one hand, and it erodes their buying power on the other.', ""Farm people want to preserve the moral and spiritual values, the religious faith, the patriotism which have always been so unshakably strong on the farms and in the rural communities of America's heartland."", ""I am committed to achieving all these things. But I want to dwell now on one additional commitment--something which farmers, like the rest of us, want and deserve, but which for too many years they have not been receiving--and that is a full, fair share in our Nation's prosperity."", 'When city people shop at the supermarket or sit down to a good meal, it is easy for them to take their food for granted and to forget the men and women whose hard work and sacrifice produced it.', ""But when you realize that the farmer's workweek runs almost double what most Americans are used to, when you realize that high risks and heavy production costs keep his profit margins paper thin, when you realize that he must often go deep into debt to maintain the $100,000 worth of capital assets required for family farming, then it is clear that farm people deserve a better reward than an average income which today is only 80 percent of the average for nonfarm people."", 'Helping farmers to do better has been one of the major commitments of my Administration.', 'When we took office, farm prices were stagnating, farm exports were down, inflation was eating heavily into farm income, family farms were disappearing at a rapid rate, and, worst of all, it seemed that Federal farm policy under the previous Administration had been part of the problem rather than part of the solution.', 'We set out immediately to turn that situation around. Four harvests have come in since then, and with each harvest has come evidence of solid progress for the American farmer.', 'Net farm income--what is left after the bills are paid--will average 24 percent higher for the 4 years of this Administration than the average for the last Administration. Net farm income this year will finally break the all-time record set 25 years ago.', ""During the period 1961 to 1968, farm people's per capita income after taxes averaged about one-third lower than what nonfarm people were making. But now that gap has narrowed to one-fifth, and we are going to keep working until there is no gap at all."", 'We have also made progress in checking the rapid decline in numbers of American farms. Farm units were disappearing at the rate of 106,000 every year during the 8 years before we took office. Since then we have cut this annual loss by more than half. This means more hope for the future in rural America, with more people able to keep on working their land as they have a right to do.', 'A big share of the reason for this progress is the character of farm people themselves. These are people of courage, self-reliance, and independent spirit. They just don\'t know the word ""quit."" Today, as in years past, they are the backbone of America.', ""But another reason things are better is that farm policies of this Administration have responded to farmers' own desires for change."", 'Four years ago, everyone was fed up with rigid government farm programs that kept farmers in a straitjacket. So we looked for a way to give farmers more freedom. We sought an expanding agriculture rather than a shrinking agriculture, a voluntary farm program rather than compulsory controls, a market oriented agriculture rather than a government-dominated agriculture.', 'The Agriculture Act of 1970, which passed with broad bipartisan support in the Congress, has moved strongly in this direction. The new program allows a farmer to set aside a certain number of acres to keep from creating price depressing surpluses, and then the farmer is free to plant what he wants on his remaining acres for his own best market advantage. More farmers are in these programs today than ever before.', 'An expanding agriculture requires expanded international markets for our farm products. When we took office, agricultural exports were stagnating. And now they are setting new records year after year.', 'From the annual level of $5.7 billion under the last Administration, farm exports in 1972 will pass $8 billion for the first time. And we are going to keep them growing toward our goal of $10 billion of exports every year.', 'We have gained our first billion dollar annual customer of farm products--Japan.', ""We have opened new markets in Communist countries by lifting the restrictive ocean shipping regulations of the last Administration. It was this action that led to last winter's $150 million sale of feed grains to the Soviet Union, and then to the 3-year grain sales agreement which we signed with the Soviets in July--the biggest peacetime transaction of its kind in history."", ""This sale holds enormous benefits for all Americans. It will raise crop value for American farmers by a billion dollars in 1972 alone. It will improve our Nation's balance of payments by a billion dollars. It will create at least 30,000 new American jobs. And it will save the taxpayers some $200 million."", 'Equally important, it is a striking example of the way our farm policy and our foreign policy are working hand in hand to strengthen the peaceful ties between great powers which were adversaries only a few years ago.', ""The new relationship between the United States and the People's Republic of China, which began when I visited Peking earlier this year, is another situation in which our farmers are both contributing to peace and profiting from peace. The grain sales which we have made to the People's Republic of China only scratch the surface of an immense trade potential between our two countries."", ""And today I am happy to announce that an additional contract for the sale of 300,000 tons of American corn to the People's Republic of China was signed within the last few days."", ""Leading the way in our efforts to bring U.S. farm products to the world, and to bring a better day for America's farmers and rural people, have been the two able and energetic men who have served in my Cabinet as Secretary of Agriculture--Cliff Hardin and Earl Butz."", 'It has been said of the present Secretary of Agriculture that ""Nobody bullies Earl Butz."" The people in Washington have learned how true that is, so have the Nation\'s farmers, and we can be proud to have Secretary Butz on our team.', ""This autumn of 1972 is a season of harvest not only for the farmers across America's countryside but for our Nation as a whole."", 'At home, we are beginning to reap the results of a long battle to launch a new prosperity in America, a time of full employment without inflation and without war. We are moving toward greater domestic peace, stability, and national unity. Around the world, the chances seem better and better that our children will be able to grow up in a full generation of peace.', 'Now the great question is: How shall we use that peace once it is achieved? We must use it as an opportunity to better the human condition, to lift up the hearts and the hopes of all mankind. Here the American farmer has a great role to play.', 'It is significant, I think, that the last American to win the Nobel Peace Prize was not a statesman, not a social activist, but a man of the soil--Dr. Norman Borlaug, the man whose research with high-yield wheat has launched the ""Green Revolution"" which is helping to feed hungry millions around the globe today.', 'I wish it were possible to present a peace prize to every farmer and every farm family in America in recognition of what they have done in years past to help keep our country strong and free, and in recognition also of what they can do in years ahead to help unite all peoples in a new alliance against the common enemies of mankind--hunger and poverty and misery in the world.', 'But farm people do not ask for prizes. What they do ask is a fair chance to succeed, a fair share in America. That is what I am determined to help them achieve.', 'I will not be satisfied until farmers have the rewards, the satisfaction, and the income they so richly have earned.', 'I will not be satisfied until we are assured that rural America will continue to be a place of promise--a good place to live.', ""I pledge that during the next 4 years we will do everything in our power to justify the confidence which the strong people of America's rural heartland place in the future of agriculture, the future of America, and the future of peace in the world."", 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
57,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1972","['Good morning:', 'A national election campaign can unify the people, or it can divide them.', 'One of the most encouraging things about this election is the way in which the voters are reacting as a united people, as One America.', 'Too often in past years, politicians of both parties have made their appeal not to what was good for America, but to the divided and sometimes conflicting interest of various groups and blocs within America.', 'At times, too, politicians have tried to run campaigns on style and charisma, instead of on the facts and the issues.', 'This year, the election is being decided on the fundamental issues. Because it is, we are seeing the birth of a new American majority.', 'It is not a new partisan majority. It is not a realignment of the old political coalitions of different interest groups and blocs.', ""The new majority is a majority of Americans from all parts of the country who agree on certain fundamental values and principles that are basic to America's ideals and its experience."", 'I remember reading once about a sign outside a church in Greenville, South Carolina. Its message was simple. It said: ""If God were permissive, he would have given us Ten Suggestions.""', 'The point, of course, was that at the base of every great faith or idea, there are certain fundamental, abiding truths that must not be destroyed or distorted.', 'I realize that in this sophisticated age we hear a lot of scoffing at old-fashioned faith, morality, and character. But I also know that the day America loses its moral character, or the day we forget our religious heritage, we will cease to be a great Nation.', 'For America is more than just a plot of land--it is an ideal. And that ideal is what built 13 tiny, struggling colonies into the freest, mightiest Nation on earth today.', 'What is the ideal? George Washington once called it ""the sacred fire of liberty""-a devotion to freedom and opportunity, a respect for the rights and dignity of the individual.', 'Almost two centuries later, another great soldier and statesman, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, gave us a remarkably similar definition. ""America,"" he said, ""is best described by one word, freedom.""Let us never forget that we won that freedom, and we have kept and expanded it over the years, because we have remained a single, united people--One America.', 'Last month I had the privilege of dedicating a new museum. It was a very special occasion for me, because this was no ordinary museum--it was the American Museum of Immigration on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.', 'There, at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, a museum had been created to commemorate the trials, the tribulations, and the magnificent accomplishments of millions of men and women who came to these shores to build a new life and to become part of a united American people.', 'Perhaps more than anywhere else, you can feel the meaning of America there on Liberty Island, in the shadow of that great national monument. During the peak years of immigration, as many as 5,000 immigrants entered New York Harbor each day, and the first thing they saw, their first glimpse of America, was that magnificent statue with its torch held high.', ""The world's hopes poured into America, along with its people. The people were from every nation on earth. But the hope was always the same--the burning desire for freedom and opportunity, the same hope that motivated the Founding Fathers in 1776, the same hope that has motivated generation after generation of new Americans ever since."", 'Today there are some who say that that spirit is dead--that we no longer have the strength of character, idealism, and faith we once had.', ""They say that we have become a sick society, a corrupt society. Some have even gone so far as to compare us with Hitler's Germany."", 'Well, those who say these things are wrong.', 'Those who say these things do not know the real America.', 'In my 4 years as President, I have visited every State in the Union.', 'Increasingly, everywhere I have gone I have found new evidence, not of disunity, but of unity. I have found the people of the North, the South, the East, the West, united in their basic concerns and beliefs. I have found hard evidence of something I always believed--that, despite our vast diversity of races, of ethnic origins, and of faiths, when you get down to the basics, we are still One America.', 'And the basics are the same in every part of the country. They are the same for the Polish-American, the Italian-American, the Mexican-American, the steelworker, the farmer.', 'I find that most Americans still want a strong country, not out of national vanity or jingoism, but because they know that a strong United States is the guardian of peace and freedom in the world. They reject the philosophy that we should unilaterally weaken America.', 'I have found that the vast majority of Americans want peace, but are convinced that it must be a lasting peace with honor. They know that only a peace built on honor and integrity can long survive. They know that retreat and surrender lead not to security, but to new provocations and confrontations and to greater risk of war.', 'That is why, in the difficult job of seeking an honorable negotiated settlement in Vietnam, I have been able to count on the support of a majority of Americans. That is why America has been able to preserve its pledge that we shall not betray our allies, or abandon our men held prisoner or missing in action, as we work for a full generation of peace.', ""I have found that most Americans everywhere agree that we should hold the line on taxes and spending. The days of the Congressional blank check for spending are gone. The people are tightly demanding an end to the government extravagance that has driven up taxes and prices. They are determined to put the brakes on the cost-of-living treadmill. I am equally determined to hold those brakes and hold them in place. They have supported this Administration's policies that have now given us the lowest rate of inflation and one of the highest rates of growth of any major industrial nation in the world, policies that are moving us toward our goal of full employment without war and without inflation--and that is a goal that we have not met since President Eisenhower was in the White House."", ""Most Americans are united in demanding respect for the law. They know that without law there can be no justice, without order there can be no progress. They support this Administration's all-out offensive against organized crime, against violence, against dangerous drugs and narcotics, and we are beginning to win the war against crime because of the united support of Americans."", 'We will not be satisfied until all our city streets are safe, until we have a system of courts that is once more capable of dispensing swift, fair justice to criminal and victim alike. That is my philosophy in appointing judges to the bench, from the Supreme Court on down. They must be qualified jurists, but they must be jurists who recognize that the first civil right of all Americans is the right to be free from domestic violence.', 'The new American majority knows that government ought to spring from the people. It should not be a distant alien force that dictates their everyday lives from afar. For far too long power has flowed from the people into the hands of Federal bureaucrats in Washington. And the new American majority has agreed that the time has come to reverse that flow away from Washington, back to the States, the counties, the cities, and to the people.', 'And together we have begun to succeed. The historic passage of revenue sharing, which this Administration has fought for for so long, means that more power and more tax dollars are now heading back where they belong, to local people and their locally elected leaders. The decisionmaking power, the means to carry out those decisions, are flowing back to the grass roots. This means better education, better setting of local priorities, more hope for our troubled State, city, and county governments, and an opportunity in the future for lower property taxes for the overburdened American homeowner.', 'Finally, I find that the American people today are united in their continued belief in honest hard work, love of country, spiritual faith.', 'What has made America the economic wonder of the world is not what government has done for people, but what people have done for themselves. That is why, while some politicians are calling for redistribution of income--seeking to reward those who do not work more than those who do--this Administration has stood with the new American majority. We know that it was the sacrifice and efforts of hard-working people that built America. We oppose those who would discourage work and reward idleness.', ""America is a land of opportunity, not a land of handouts. Each of us deserves a fair chance to get ahead. But none of us has the right to expect a free ride--to remain idle, to take advantage of other men's labor."", 'Each of these basic points I have mentioned has played a part in creating the new American majority. Each of them reminds us that there is more that binds us together as a people than there is separating us.', 'My greatest hope for the coming elections is that we emerge from them a stronger, not a weaker, people--that when we look back at the 1972 elections we can point to them as a mandate for peace, for progress, and, above all, unity for Americans.', '""This flag which we honor and under which we serve,"" said Woodrow Wilson, ""is the emblem of the unity of our power, our thought and purpose as a nation. It has no other character than that which we give it from generation to generation. The choices are ours.""', 'Once again this November, the choice is ours. And I urge each of you whether you are a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent--to become a part of the new American majority, to help us keep on building a strong America, a just America--One America embodying the hopes and faith of all Americans.', 'Thank you, and good morning.']"
58,Richard Nixon ,"October 28, 1972","['Thank you. Could I have your attention for just a moment.', ""First I want to tell you that we are very sorry we were over an hour late, but there is a good reason. We were in Ohio. The crowds were so big that we couldn't get here until just now, and all that means is that we are going to have a big win in Ohio and a big win in Michigan."", 'Now I would like to say a word about all of those that are here today with us, to pay my respects, of course, to Governor Milliken, to pay my respects and express my appreciation to the Members of the Congress who are represented here, to Garry Brown, Al Cederberg, Mrs. Jim Harvey, who is here although her husband could not be here because he is a little under the weather, but boy, he is really there when it counts on the votes in the United States Congress.', ""But particularly I am here in Michigan to ask for your support not only of our ticket, but also for your support of these Members of the House of Representatives to whom I have referred, and particularly for a Member of the United States Senate. I want to say a word about the United States Senate because I know it well. I was a Member of the Senate before the people in that band, that marvelous band over there, were born. I remember the years 1950, '51. The Senate is a great body. I presided over it for 8 years as Vice President. In the past 4 years, of course, I have worked with the Senate and with the House of Representatives for what I have thought and what they have thought were the interests of the Nation."", ""Let me tell you a thing about the Senate. It is considered to be the most exclusive club in the world. Now Members of the House won't agree with that, but at least the Senate is smaller. There are 100 Members of the Senate, two from each State, as you know. I can tell you that of those 100 Members there are five Members of the Senate who are the big men. They are the ones that will determine the future of this country, and one of those five is Michigan's Bob Griffin. I need him in the Senate, Michigan needs him in the Senate, America needs him in the Senate."", 'Let me tell you just a word about what Bob Griffin has worked for, what these Members of the Congress have worked for, and what we are going to work for in these next 4 years. First, I have noted the interest that everybody here and interest that I have seen all over Ohio today in what every American wants, and that means peace, just not now, but for a generation to come. As you know, we have made a very significant breakthrough in the negotiations. As you know, we now can look forward with confidence to winning the kind of peace in Vietnam that all Americans want, and that is the kind of a peace Bob Griffin has worked for and supported-peace with honor and not peace with surrender.', 'But beyond that, Vietnam being over, we are proud of the fact that our trips to Peking and to Moscow have paved the way not just for ending this war, but for a generation of peace so that those young people that we see over here can have something that we have not had in this century in America: a full generation without war. We have a beginning, but we need to continue, and we ask for your help to continue to work for a generation of peace over these next 4 years. I pledge you, that is what we are going to work for.', ""If we are going to have it, we need a strong America. Don't listen to the voices of those that would have America have the second strongest army, the second strongest navy, the second strongest air force in the world."", ""Let me tell you, that when it comes to football we, of course, can take a little pride in whether we are number one or number two, but let's make sure that the United States is never number two in the world so that the United States can continue to lead the world to peace."", ""Then here at home, could I say a word about Bob Griffin and his leadership in the Senate? Everybody in this great tri-city area, in this State of Michigan, that contributes so much to the economy of this country, is interested in jobs. But you want peacetime jobs. Our goal is full employment without war and without inflation, something we have not had in America since Dwight Eisenhower was President. We can have it again, but we need your help. We need Bob Griffin's help in the United States Senate and these men that I have mentioned for the Congress of the United States."", ""But jobs, as good as they are--and I know they are very good in this State-let me tell you they don't mean anything if your income is eaten up by higher prices or higher taxes."", 'I think that government in Washington has grown too big. Bob Griffin agrees. I believe that the Government in Washington is taking too much money out of your pocket. He agrees. He has been a strong man in voting against more spending in Washington so that you can spend more here in Michigan. We are for that, and I hope that you will send him back so he can continue to work for that cause.', ""Finally, let me say a word on another subject that is of great interest to everybody here in this State--I know that it is not one of particular concern in this area--and it is that of education, to which I addressed myself just a few days ago on radio. The best education is the education you get in the school that is closest to your home. The Senate needs Bob Griffin standing against any kind of program that would bus children away from their homes across town. We need him in the United States Senate for that kind of leadership. We also need him because we can have peace abroad, we can have good jobs, and it isn't going to mean anything if our cities are ridden over with crime and drugs and all the other things which are part of modern life."", 'Let me tell you, there is no man in this country today who, with his legal background, gives us better leadership, as he does in the United States Senate, than Bob Griffin, in developing that kind of support we need for strong judges that will strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. We need him in the Senate for that.', ""If he would step up here for one moment-let me just close with one word. In speaking of him, I speak of all of those who support these principles that I have spoken of. These are not partisan principles. Democrats as well as Republicans want peace in the world. Democrats as well as Republicans want jobs and prosperity, without war and without inflation. Democrats as well as Republicans want good education, education close to home and not clear across town. Democrats as well as Republicans want progress, progress for their children and their children's children in the years to come."", ""One of the things that impresses anyone who runs for any office, and particularly for President, is to see the wonderful young people that we have seen by the hundreds of thousands today, and the thousands here today, let me tell you what I feel at a moment like this. I know many of you have been here for almost 4 hours. I know that you didn't even know that we were going to have a meeting here until yesterday. Thank you for coming. Thank you for coming."", ""Let me tell you, I realize that for many who are here, who are 18, 19, and 20, this is the first time you will have had an opportunity to vote. I want your first vote to be remembered as one of your best votes. I want the next 4 years and Bob Griffin wants the next 4 years to be the best 4 years in this country's history."", 'Thank you.']"

In all of those years we won. We are here in '72, and we think Warren is our lucky city in Ohio."", 'Also, I just gave the mayor a pen, one of the White House pens, and the revenue sharing bill that Bill Stanton, your Congressman, worked so hard for in the House, that we just signed, will soon be here in Warren, and he is going to use it to hire back some police and firemen they had to lay off. So Warren is going to be a greater city because of revenue sharing.', 'Most important of all, we want you to know that as we go through this campaign that we are glad we are here at a time that we have made a very significant breakthrough in bringing peace in Vietnam and building peace in the world.', 'And so, to all of you, we wish you the best next week.

When I saw those flags at half-mast I asked one of our Secret Service men, a man who has given 30 years of his life to Government service and has risked his life many times, why the flags were at half-mast.', 'He told me that what had happened is that just 2 days ago a policeman, in the line of duty, trying to apprehend a criminal--who proved to be a criminal, certainly, by his actions in killing the policeman--was murdered. As a result, the town, of course, was paying its respects to that man of the law.', 'I just want to say this as I stand here in the presence of the United States Secret Service, people from the Sheriff\'s Department, and people in the Police Department: I just talked to a couple of the men in your Police Department, the Sheriff\'s Department. I said, ""How do you like your job?"" They said, ""We like it fine.""', ""Let me tell you, you can't pay these men what it is really worth. You can't pay a man enough who risks his life to help you keep your life. One thing you can do is this: Respect them, honor them. I have seen on occasion over these years sometimes some scroungy-looking people that are spitting on policemen and calling them pigs and the rest. It makes my blood boil."", 'When I think of that fine young man that was killed in Parma, Ohio, I say I am proud that in our Administration we have stood up for the men of law and order, and we are going to for the next 4 years.']"
61,Richard Nixon ,"October 29, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'I want to talk to you this afternoon about national defense. Defense policy is the most important single issue in this election. It represents a choice which must be made not on the basis of name-calling or appeals to emotion, but on the basis of thoughtful analysis of the alternatives. That is the purpose of my talk this afternoon.', 'When a President thinks of his responsibilities to the American people, he must think first of all about the need to keep this country strong, about the need to maintain a national defense second to none in the world.', ""A President also has an obligation to spend no more of the Nation's limited resources on defense than is absolutely required, because he knows there are other urgent human needs to be met."", 'Today, no nation on earth is more powerful than the United States. Not only are our nuclear deterrent forces fully sufficient for their role in keeping the peace, our conventional forces also are modern, strong, prepared, and credible to any adversary.', 'During the past 4 years, however, because of the progress we have made in bringing the Vietnam war to an honorable conclusion and in reducing tensions among the great powers, we have also been able to reduce substantially the size of our military establishment.', 'We have reduced our total military, manpower by nearly one-third from the 1968 level. We have closed large numbers of unheeded military bases and installations. Under the Nixon Doctrine, we have successfully persuaded our allies to take up a greater share of the free world defense burden than they have in the past.', 'Before we took office, less than a third of every dollar the Federal Government spent was devoted to human resources, while close to half of every budget dollar was spent for defense. Today those proportions are reversed, with the military down to a third and human resources getting nearly a half.', 'Most important, all of this has been achieved without jeopardizing our security and without betraying our allies.', 'But now in this campaign our opponents have proposed massive new cuts in military spending--cuts which would drastically slash away not just the fat but the very muscle of our defense.', ""These are the specific proposals they have made: America's strategic bomber force would be cut by 60 percent, our tactical air wings by 30 percent, development of the new B-1 bomber would be canceled."", 'The number of Navy warships would be cut almost in half. Our aircraft carrier fleet would be cut from 16 to 6. They would cut the Marine Corps by almost one-third. The 7th Fleet in the Far East and the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean would be sharply reduced and weakened.', 'Missile modernization programs like the Minuteman III and the Poseidon would be halted.', 'The result would be to leave America with the second strongest army, the second strongest navy, the second strongest air force in the world.', ""Now some might ask, what is wrong with being second? Isn't it jingoistic and nationalistic for the United States always to have to be number one?"", 'The answer to that question is that the day the United States becomes the second strongest nation in the world, peace and freedom will be in deadly jeopardy everywhere in the world.', 'We do not seek power for its own sake. What we seek is the assurance that our survival and that of other free nations will never be threatened by some other nation whose intentions are less peaceful than ours, and whose military forces are more powerful than those of the United States.', 'History has taught us again and again that war is caused not by the strength of one nation alone, but by the weakness of one nation in relation to another.', 'Last spring in Moscow I signed an agreement for the limitation of offensive and defensive nuclear weapons on the part of the United States and the Soviet Union. We would never have reached that agreement if the United States had unilaterally given up the ABM as some had recommended, or if we had begun stripping away our offensive missile forces.', 'If we were to take such action now, we would destroy any chance for further arms limitations in the second round of strategic nuclear arms limitation talks which are to begin with the Soviet Union next month. If we unilaterally reduced the forces now supporting our NATO allies in Western Europe, as has also been proposed by our opponents, we would throw away the prospect of mutual and balanced reductions of Soviet forces in Eastern Europe.', 'Strength and resolution command respect. They are an incentive for negotiation leading to peace. But weakness and naive sentimentality breed contempt. They are an open invitation to pressure tactics and aggression leading to war.', 'That is why I say let us never send the President of the United States to the conference table as the head of the second strongest nation in the world.', ""It may be argued that as long as we have our nuclear weapons we have nothing to worry about. Because the United States relied heavily on a deterrent policy of massive nuclear retaliation during the 1950's, this theory says, we can safely gut our conventional forces today and go back to the policy of massive nuclear retaliation in the 1970's."", ""The flaw in that argument is that during the Eisenhower years the United States held a 15 to 1 or even a 20 to 1 ratio of nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union. Massive retaliation was credible then, in the 1950's, and it was credible during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when our nuclear advantage was about 8 to 1. No enemy would dare to test such overwhelming odds."", 'However, when I came into office in January 1969, I found that this massive nuclear superiority no longer existed. For 6 years the Soviet Union had moved forward with a massive buildup of their nuclear forces, while the United States was standing still. As a result, today the United States and the Soviet Union are equal in nuclear capability.', 'It has, therefore, become totally unrealistic to believe that we could any longer deter aggression against a small nation, particularly one whose survival did not directly affect our own survival, if our only option were a nuclear retaliation which would lead to nuclear suicide for the United States.', ""The mutual destruction would be too great, and both sides would know it. No potential aggressor would respect America's security commitments to our friends and allies under those conditions."", 'The Middle East is an example. In the fall of 1970, when Syrian tanks poured into Jordan, what might have become a grave world crisis was quietly defused by the movement of the United States 6th Fleet into the eastern Mediterranean. The possibility of a war which could have threatened the existence of Israel and dragged in the great powers was averted.', 'American naval superiority kept the peace in that situation, where nuclear threats would have been powerless to do so. That is why, for the sake of Israel and other small nations we are committed to defend, as well as for our own sake, we must never give up our superiority on the sea and in the air in the name of false economy.', 'The time has come to stand up and answer those of our own countrymen who complain that American power is an evil force in the world, those who say that our foreign policy is selfish and bad.', 'We can be proud of the fact that in four wars in this century the United States has fought only to defend freedom, never to destroy it; only to keep the peace, never to break it.', 'The men and women who have fought in those wars deserve the highest respect this Nation can pay them, as do those who serve in our peace forces today and those who will serve in years to come as we end the draft next summer and move to a volunteer armed force. They are the real heroes of our time.', 'Rather than talking about amnesty for a few hundred who chose to desert America, let us honor the millions who chose to serve America in Vietnam. As this long and difficult war draws to an end, it is time to draw the line on this issue once and for all. There will be no amnesty for draft dodgers and deserters after the war.', 'Millions of Americans chose to serve their country in Vietnam. Many gave their lives for their choice. The few hundred who refused to serve, or who deserted their country, must pay a penalty for their choice.', 'A few days before I left for Peking last February, I had as a guest at the White House the brilliant French thinker and statesman Andre Malraux. Let me share with you a comment which he made to me that night.', '""The United States,"" he said, ""is the only nation ever to become the most powerful in the world without seeking to.""', 'Think for a moment of how true this statement is and what it means. This country did not push its way to the position of world leadership which we have occupied for a generation. That position came to us unsought, but we have borne it nobly and well, guided not by ambition or greed or ideology, but only by the high ideals of human liberty and lasting peace.', 'Uniquely among the great powers of the world in our own time or in any previous time, the United States is trusted with power by all the peoples of the earth. No nation which refrains from aggression against its neighbors has anything to fear from America, and all nations know that is true.', 'For the United States to abdicate its leadership role in the world, or to attempt to meet its responsibilities through good intentions alone, without the backing of a strong defense, would be one of the greatest tragedies of history.', 'Let us never go down that road. That is the road which led an unprepared America into two world wars earlier in this century.', 'Let us remain instead on the high road of peace through strength, the road mapped out by five successive Presidents in our time, Democrats and Republicans alike--by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson.', 'As long as I am your President, I shall keep America on that road. I shall keep this country strong militarily, strong economically, and strong in the moral values and the trust in God which is our ultimate defense.', ""Only in this way can we make certain that the 1970's will not be the twilight of America's greatness, but the dawn of a new age; not a time of tension and turmoil, but the beginning of a full generation of peace for us and for all mankind."", 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
62,Richard Nixon ,"October 30, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'A President signs many bills, but one that I signed today gave me special satisfaction because of the enormous impact it can have on the lives of millions of individual Americans.', 'I refer to the legislation known as H.R. 1--and especially to its provisions for helping older Americans.1 Many of these provisions grew out of recommendations which I have been urging the Congress to act on for several years.', ""Let's look at some of the things H.R. 1 will do:"", ""First, nearly 4 million widows and widowers will get larger social security benefits--the full 100 percent of what was payable to the individual's late husband or wife. This will mean more than $1 billion in additional income for these deserving people in the next fiscal year."", 'Second, over a million and a half older Americans who are now working can earn more income without having their benefits reduced.', 'Until today, if you were receiving social security, every dollar you earned above $1,680 cost you 50 cents in benefits--and every dollar you earned above $2,880 cost you a full dollar. But under the new provision--which I have advocated for years--you can earn up to $2,100 without losing a cent of social security, and every dollar you earn above that $2,100--no matter how many--will cost you only 50 cents in benefits. This will encourage more older Americans to work--helping them and helping the country.', 'Third, millions of older Americans who live in poverty, along with the blind and the disabled, will be helped by a new Federal floor under their income--a monthly minimum of $130 for an individual and $195 for a couple. Free of the inequities and red tape which plague the present system, this program will channel an estimated $ 1 billion in the next fiscal year to those whose needs are greatest. For millions of older people, it can mean a big step out of poverty and toward a life of dignity and independence.', ""In addition, H.R. 1 will pay a special minimum benefit of $170 per month to 150,000 older persons who worked for long years at low wages. Men who retire at 62 will also be helped. Medicare coverage will be extended to cover 100 percent and not just 80 percent of home health services, and to cover more of the cost of nursing home care, to pay for kidney transplants, chiropractors, and other services formerly not covered at all, and to cover disabled Americans of all ages. The patient's fees for Part B of Medicare will be limited. And steps will be taken to increase the quality and the appropriateness of services which are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid."", 'Altogether, H.R. 1 will improve the income position of millions of older Americans. That, in my judgment, is the best way to help older people--by providing them with more money so they can do more things for themselves.', 'H.R. 1 is only the latest in a series of steps we have taken to improve the incomes of older people. In the last 4 years, for example, social security benefits have gone up 51 percent. That is the largest and most rapid increase in history. But the important thing is not just that benefits have been brought up to date. The important thing is that they now can be kept up to date. That is a result of the automatic increase provisions which I have been pushing for many years and which finally became law this summer.', 'Social security, in short, is now ""inflation proof."" Payments that keep pace with the cost of living are no longer something the elderly have to battle for in the Congress year after year. They have at last become a guaranteed right for older Americans.', 'There have been other forward steps as well--proposals to make private pension programs more comprehensive and more reliable, for example, and to let older people receive more tax-free income.', 'Inflation is a special menace to the income of older Americans. Since 1969, we have cut the rate of inflation almost in half. In the area of medical care prices, we have cut inflation by nearly two-thirds--an achievement which is particularly important to older people because they spend more than three times as much per capita on health care as do younger people.', 'And we are also moving to relieve the property tax burden which falls so heavily on older citizens. Two-thirds of older Americans own their own homes. Yet, even when their income has gone down because of retirement, their property taxes have kept going up--by more than too percent in the last 10 years. The result: The home which was once a symbol of financial independence too often becomes a cause of financial hardship.', 'There are over 6 million American homeowners who are more than 65 years old. More than one million of these retired Americans live in their own homes on an income of less than $2,000 a year. In the Northeast, to take one example, these elderly citizens are paying an average of 30 percent of their income in property taxes.', 'This is wrong. We must stop it. One of my highest priority proposals to the new Congress will be property tax relief for older Americans.', 'Another problem which is of critical concern for older Americans--and for this Administration--is the quality of our nursing homes. Many of them are doing a good job, but too many have been below recent and decent standards. In 1971, I launched a new eight-point action plan to change this.2 Under that plan, we have already cut off Federal funding to hundreds of hopelessly inferior homes. H.R. 1 will permit the hiring and training of 2,000 inspectors to enforce strict regulations. And we have substantially expanded Federal efforts to make all nursing homes brighter and better places.', 'On July 19, 1972, the White House released a fact sheet on progress on the eight-point improvement program for nursing homes and the transcript of a news briefing on a meeting with the President to report on the program. Participants in the news briefing were John G. Veneman, Under Secretary, Dr. Merlin K. DuVal, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, and Dr. Marie Ca!lender, Special Assistant for Nursing Home Affairs, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; and Arthur S. Flemming, Special Consultant to the President on Aging.', 'We also want to help more older Americans live decent, dignified lives in the familiar settings of their own homes. This is why we have increased budgeting under the Older Americans Act eightfold in the last 4 years, expanding a wide range of services in fields such as health, education, homemaking, counseling, and nutrition.', 'While the Older Americans bill is being perfected in the months ahead, these programs will all move forward under a continuing resolution. We have also taken special steps to fight crime in areas where older people are living, to provide more housing and transportation for older people, to fight job discrimination based on age, and to expand opportunities for older people to find self-fulfillment in useful voluntary action. We have doubled the budget for the Foster Grandparent Program. We have tripled the budget for the Retired Senior Volunteer Program.', 'This summer I launched a new program called Project FIND.3 Its purposes were expressed in its name--to ""find"" older people who are so isolated that they are not receiving the help which should be theirs.', 'The results have been remarkable. One and a half million names have already come in to us. And now, with the help of the American Red Cross, we are mobilizing an army of 20,000 volunteers to make personal contact with each one of these elderly persons.', ""Already over 300,000 contacts have been made. In Des Moines, for example, a group of high school students has been giving many hours a week to visiting older people. One girl, Carol Clayton, discovered a 79-year-old man a few weeks ago who spoke only Spanish. He lived on very little income, and he had never heard about food stamps. And now, as a result of Project FIND, Trinidad Medina has made contact with the Polk County Department of Social Services. Just as importantly, he has made a friend, Carol Clayton. He can't communicate with her in English, but with the help of his Spanish guitar, he has no trouble communicating friendship."", 'This, in the final analysis, is what our programs to help older people are all about: not lines on an organization chart, or numbers in a budget, but helping individual men and women live fuller, richer lives.', 'In less than 4 weeks, we will celebrate another Thanksgiving. Our family will think back to our first Thanksgiving in the White House 3 years ago. Our guests that day were over 200 older Americans. When I talked with them, I found that many were particularly excited about the Moon walks that they had recently watched on television. And it occurred to me on that day that most of our guests could also remember the first airplane flight by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, over a half century ago.', 'Our older generation has lived through the greatest period of change in human history. They have brought our Nation through all that change with colors flying. We owe them more than we can ever repay.', 'But when we think of older Americans, we must not think only about what they have already given. We must also think about what they still can give. They are our seasoned veterans, and America can never be at its best if we keep them on the bench.', 'We hear a lot about generation gaps these days. We cannot afford a generation gap which shuts out the young in this country. But neither can we afford a generation gap that shuts out the old.', 'And so we must develop a new attitude toward aging in America, one that stops regarding older Americans as a burden and starts regarding them as a resource.', 'Senior power can be a tremendous source of energy for our country. Churchill was a great leader at 81. Holmes was a great jurist at 91. Clara Barton led the Red Cross at 83, and Connie Mack led the Athletics at 88. Michelangelo was painting at 89; Toscanini was conducting at 87. And for every celebrated name like these, there are millions of ordinary citizens in their seventies and eighties who are making extraordinary contributions to their communities.', 'Senator Green of Rhode Island used to contend: ""Most people say that as you get old you have to give up things. I think you get old because you give up things.""', ""I believe that millions of older Americans can make great contributions to our Nation's progress if only they have the chance. This really is the point of our Government programs and policies--to help older Americans play a full, continuing role in the great adventures of America."", 'Thank you and good afternoon.']"
63,Richard Nixon ,"November 01, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'Today I would like to talk with you about a challenge which many describe as the ""urban crisis."" I prefer to think of it, however, as the ""urban opportunity.""', 'When we talk about ""the city,"" we are not talking about an impersonal abstraction, but about the needs of real people-who happen to live more closely together and in larger concentrations than elsewhere. Our goal must be to improve the quality of urban life for individual human beings--to make each city a vibrant and vital place for people to live in.', ""In the 1960's, Federal programs for the cities grew bigger and bigger, but the problems of the cities only grew worse. Government spending increased at a record pace, but so did crime and pollution and inflation and unrest."", 'That is why, in addressing our urban needs, I have insisted that we concentrate not merely on how much we spend, but on how we spend it; that we measure our progress not merely by the money we put into urban programs, but by the results we get out of them; that we improve not only the quality of our resources but the quality of our thinking.', 'That is why we have developed an entirely new strategy. for urban America in this Administration. This strategy is designed to do two things:', '--First, to end the fragmented ""bits and pieces"" approach to urban problems, to recognize their interrelationships, to tackle them in a comprehensive, coordinated manner. This means focusing responsibility, so that public servants can do effective, long-range planning and pull together sufficient resources.', '--Second, I was determined to end the logjam of power in an ever centralizing Washington bureaucracy and to strengthen government at the grass roots.', 'As a result of our new strategy, our programs for the cities have not only grown in size in the last 4 years---they have also improved in effectiveness.', 'Let me cite a few examples.', 'Our average expenditures for community development and housing have been $1 billion a year higher in this Administration than in the previous 4 years. But in addition, we have worked to cut red tape and decentralize administration. We have worked to curb runaway housing costs, to find more efficient methods of finance and construction.', ""Now let's look at the result: Housing starts last year reached an all-time record high of 2.1 million units--and are now more than 65 percent above the 1960 to 1968 level. Federally assisted housing for low and moderate income families has increased more than fourfold since 1969."", ""Let's take another example--crime. We have spent more than 2 1/2 times as much on fighting crimes this year as 4 years ago, and 11 times as much on fighting drug abuse. But what makes life better for people is not larger numbers in the crime budget, but smaller numbers in the crime rates."", ""At last, those numbers have begun to get smaller. Nearly half of our major cities had fewer crimes in the first 6 months of this year than a year ago. Nationwide, the rate of increase in crime was only one percent in the first half of 1972, compared to 122 percent from 1960 through 1968. Riots no longer ravage our cities as they did in the 1960's. And we made this progress by arming our crime lighters not just with more money but, even more importantly, with better, stronger laws, by backing them up and by helping to restore respect for the law and for those who enforce it."", 'A third example is the environment. For every $1 spent to fight pollution 4 years ago, we have budgeted $3.50 this year. But in addition, we have completely overhauled the Federal machinery and the Federal strategy for making our peace with nature.', 'As a result, today, for the first time, the air in our cities is getting cleaner and not dirtier. We are beginning to win the battle to clean up our lakes and rivers. We have turned 34,000 acres of unused Federal property into local parklands under our Legacy of Parks program--most of them near large population centers. That is why we describe our program as parks for the people.In each of these areas I have mentioned, as in others, our primary goal and concern has been how well we spend--and not just how much we are spending. Our goal has been better government--not just bigger government.', 'One important way of getting better government is to place more emphasis on local control.', 'Just last month I signed into law the first phase of revenue sharing, allocating 30 billion Federal dollars over the next 5 years for the State and local governments to use as they see fit.1', 'I signed this bill at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. That was a most appropriate site. For general revenue sharing is the first step in a comprehensive program which I have described as ""a new American revolution."" It represents a new Declaration of Independence for State and local government. Now, instead of power moving from the people to Washington, power will flow back from Washington to the people again.', 'Revenue sharing can be used for a number of purposes. It can help, for example, to hold down property taxes. It can pay for more policemen to keep city streets safe. It can build new schools, new hospitals.', 'But whatever it does, it will be local officials responding to local conditions and to their own local citizens, who will decide what should be done, what should have priority, rather than having those decisions made by some impersonal Federal bureaucrat.', 'Let me use another example to illustrate the advantages of local control.', 'Nothing could do more to lift the face of our cities--and the spirit of our city dwellers--than truly adequate systems of modern transportation. The quality of urban life suffers incalculably when it takes longer to cross a city by horseless carriage today than to cross it by horse-drawn carriage a century ago. A nation that can move three persons across 240, 000 miles of space to the Moon should be able to move 240,000 persons across 3 miles of a city to get to work.', 'To improve transportation we needed, first, more money--and we provided it. Before we came into office, the most the Federal Government made available for mass transit in any one year was $175 million. We raised this figure to $400 million in 1971 and to a full $1 billion this year. We proposed, and the Congress enacted, the Urban Mass Transportation Assistance Act of 1970, which is a 12-year, $10 billion program. We have also launched new programs for air and rail and water transportation.', 'But our goal has not merely been more expensive programs. We have worked to design more effective programs. And that means more local decisionmaking.', 'Each city, after all, has its own unique transportation needs. The highest priority for one city might be a better subway, as it was in Washington, D.C.; for another, it may be buslines; for a third, a new airport; for a fourth, a new bridge or a better highway. Good transportation must be balanced transportation--and the balance must be struck differently in each local setting.', 'Now, who can strike this balance best? Not some Federal bureaucrat hundreds or thousands of miles away. How can he know what each city needs? He has many cities to worry about. Often he is hopelessly bogged down in red tape. And there is really no way for local residents to keep in touch with him or hold him accountable for his decisions.', 'More than that, the Federal bureaucrat is likely to specialize in a single program. His main worry may be highways, for example; his main job may be to get more highways built. And thus, he simply is often not in the best position to plan a balanced approach.', ""But the local official is different. He is right there--at the scene of the action. He has only one community to worry about. It is his job to understand that community inside out. If he doesn't, the local citizens can complain to him directly, or they can vote him out of office. Best of all, local officials can plan an overall transportation strategy which takes into account a wide range of transportation needs--and fits in with other urban programs."", 'The key point about our urban strategy, then, is not only that it gives our communities the dollars they need, but also that it gives them the freedom and the responsibility they need to use those dollars effectively.', 'It tells local officials to spend less time trying to please grant reviewers in Washington-so that the money will keep coming in--and spend more time pleasing the people who live in their communities-so the money will do more good.', 'General revenue sharing is only the first step in this new strategy. I have already charted a number of additional steps: Among those proposals that I have made that were left unenacted by the Congress were six special revenue sharing bills, including one in the transportation field, a major program of welfare reform, and sweeping plans for streamlining and decentralizing the Federal bureaucracy.', 'The goal of all these proposals is to make government responsive again to the voice of the average citizen.', 'Under this approach, people can feel that they are in control again, that they can shape events, that they can make things happen in their own lives and in their own communities.', 'Under this approach, more decisions will be made at the scene of the action-and this means that more people can have a piece of the action.', 'Thomas Jefferson said he believed in local government not only because it was a more effective government but also because it could give the individual that feeling without which life is incomplete-a sense of participation in events that really count.', ""If this was true in Jefferson's time-when the average Congressman represented only about 30,000 people--how much more true it is in our time, when the average Congressman represents nearly half a million people."", 'Several years ago a poll of the American public revealed that only 27 percent of those who lived in our cities said they did so by choice. One lesson of that poll was that the urban crisis---so often regarded merely as a crisis of money--has also been a crisis of morale.', 'This Administration has addressed both of these crises. We have doubled Federal assistance to States and localities--to meet the crisis of money. But we have also increased the sense of freedom and control in our communities--to meet the crisis of the spirit.', ""The result, as we approach our Nation's 200th anniversary, is a growing sense that the graph of urban history is climbing again and the pendulum is swinging in a new, more hopeful direction."", 'This renewal of the spirit in the cities of our Nation means that they have a chance again to become in reality what they have always been in our dreams: shining centers of commerce and culture, providing a fuller, richer life for all who share in them.', 'This is the urban challenge--and this is our urban opportunity.', 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
64,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Good afternoon:', 'Whenever people start talking about how exciting life would have been a century or two ago, a friend of mine likes to respond, ""But what if you had broken your leg?""', 'He has a good point. Nothing has done more to improve the quality of life in recent years than the progress of medical science.', 'I believe the best way to continue this progress in the future is to build on the system that produced our progress in the past.', 'We have done a lot of building in the last 4 years.', 'We have increased Federal spending on health more than 50 percent, from $16 billion to $25 billion.', 'I proposed--and the Congress enacted-the most comprehensive program in history to train more doctors and nurses and dentists, to train them faster and more effectively, to attract them to small towns and inner cities and other places where they are now in short supply.', 'In the last 2 years we have more than doubled Federal support for cancer research. We have stripped away the red tape from our cancer programs. We have made them directly accountable to the President.', 'We have taken new steps to fight heart disease. We have launched a new campaign against sickle cell anemia, a cruel threat to black Americans. Our program to prevent occupational accidents and illnesses has been enacted.', 'We have taken major steps to expand Medicare and Medicaid, to improve veterans hospitals, nursing homes, and emergency medical services, to protect consumers against unsafe food and drugs and dangerous household products.', 'Our campaign against drug abuse is 11 times bigger than it was 4 years ago. We are spending more than three times as much to fight hunger and malnutrition. We have established a national goal to cut the incidence of mental retardation in half by the year 2000.', ""One of the greatest problems we faced in the 1960's was the skyrocketing cost of health care. In that 10 years, medical prices went up twice as fast as the cost of living."", 'Just last week [October 27] I met with the Committee on the Health Services Industry of our Cost of Living Council. They reported that under our new economic policy we have cut the rise in medical care prices by more than two-thirds, from 6.4 percent a year ago to only 2.1 percent in the last year. The health care industry, once one of the most inflationary sectors of our economy, has become one of the least inflationary. Now to keep it that way we must balance the growing demand for health care with a growing supply of health services.', 'As I look back at the record of the past 4 years, I think of the comment which Dr. Jonas Salk made when he received a gold medal from President Eisenhower for developing the vaccine against polio. ""I feel,"" he said, ""that the greatest reward for doing is the opportunity to do more."" Well, I feel the same way today.', 'As we look to the future, one of our great goals is to make our health system more efficient--so that each doctor, each hospital, and each health dollar can do more good. The Federal Government is already taking the lead in demonstrating the effectiveness of medical assistants who help doctors with routine tasks. We also want to encourage programs which will help doctors organize their services more conveniently and more efficiently, with greater emphasis on keeping people healthy rather than treating them only after they get sick.', 'No American family should be denied access to adequate medical care because of inability to pay. The most important health proposal not acted on by the 92d Congress was my program for helping people pay for care.', 'This program would fill the gaps in many current health insurance programs.', 'For example, most working poor families-who do not qualify for welfare-cannot afford adequate health insurance coverage. Our plan would make adequate insurance available at no cost--or at a very low cost--for these families, families who work rather than who go on welfare.', 'Second, present plans often fail to protect families in all income levels against the catastrophic cost of major illnesses and accidents. They often have very restrictive upper limits, which means that the insurance often runs out while the expenses are still running up. Our program would provide broad catastrophic coverage.', ""Third, present plans often fail to cover services in doctors' offices. As a result, many hospitals are crowded with people who are there because that's the only way their insurance will pay their expenses. Our plan would change that, too."", ""Under our programs, every employer would have to provide all of his workers with a health insurance policy, just as he helps pay for workmen's compensation and social security today. The employer would pay at least 65 percent of the premium cost for the first few years and 75 percent thereafter. And our proposal would see that every policy provided good, sound, adequate protection."", ""One of the clearest choices in the 1972 Presidential election is the choice between the comprehensive health insurance plan, which is a private health insurance plan that I have just described, and our opponents' plan for a medical system which is paid for by the taxpayers and controlled by the Federal Government."", ""Let's take a look at the opposition program. According to a report prepared for the House Ways and Means Committee, its total cost to the taxpayers each year would be a staggering $91 billion. This means that health alone would take up more than one-third of the entire Federal budget. Look at this figure. The average family's Federal tax bill for health would go from $457 a year today to $1,305 a year, nearly triple, under their program."", 'There is another point worth noting: our opponents\' claim that all their new spending programs can be financed by sweeping cuts in defense and only a few new taxes. But somehow they managed to omit this $91 billion item from that painless version of their budget. A New York Times editorial was right 9 weeks ago when it described this as a ""major omission."" When that $91 billion is added in, their budget is nowhere near so painless. It would require a Federal tax increase of 50 percent.', ""Our opponents' federalized, tax-supported system would be very costly in terms of dollars and cents. But it would also be very costly in terms of the quality of American medicine. Not only would our pocketbooks be much poorer, our health care would be much poorer, too."", 'If the Government pays all the medical bills, then only the Government has a stake in holding down medical costs. This means that Government officials would have to approve hospital budgets and set fee schedules and take other steps that would eventually lead to the complete Federal domination of American medicine. I think this is the wrong road for America. It is the road that has been taken by so many countries abroad to their regret.', ""Rather than freeing the doctor so that he can do more for his patients, our opponents' plan would burden him with the dead weight of more bureaucracy, more forms, more red tape."", 'Rather than expanding the range of choice for doctors and patients, it would severely narrow their range of choice. It would concentrate more responsibility in Washington. It would dull the incentive to experiment and innovate.', 'Some people automatically assume that the plan that costs the most will help the most. But we cannot simply buy our way to better medicine. In this case the plan that costs the most is the plan that would actually do the most to hurt the quality of our health care.', ""Our plan would build on the strengths of our present health insurance industry. Our opponents' plan would eliminate that industry entirely."", ""Our plan would reform and improve our present health care system. Our opponents' plan would tear that system apart. This is one of the clearest choices in this campaign."", 'Building on the strengths of our present system, we can make tremendous progress in the years ahead. One development which will speed our progress is a new spirit of international cooperation.', 'When I was in Moscow last May, I signed several historic agreements. Perhaps the one that most people think of first is the agreement to limit strategic weapons. But it may well be, 20 or 40 or 100 years from now, that another achievement in Moscow will be remembered with it--our agreement to cooperate in the field of medicine. Let me give one example.', 'Take cancer. More people died of cancer in the United States last year than were killed in action in all of World War II as far as the United States was concerned.', 'Disease is an international menace. We must fight it with an international alliance.', 'Who knows who will discover the cure for cancer? It may be a woman now studying at a university in Europe or a boy who now sits in a South American school. It could be an American or a Russian or a Chinese. Or there may be many partial cures from many sources. But this we know: The cure for cancer-or any other disease--will come faster if we all work together to find it.', 'The barriers between nations may be great. But when it comes to improving health, our common interests are even greater.', 'Several weeks after the Moscow summit, the Russian Minister of Health came to the United States. One of the places he visited was Fort Detrick, Maryland. For years, Fort Detrick was one of the most secret places in our country, dedicated to research on biological warfare-perfecting the instruments of death. But last year we decided to convert it into a laboratory for research on cancer--dedicated to the preservation of life.', 'I visited Fort Detrick last year, on the day I announced its conversion. I directed that it now should be thrown open to scientists from all over the world. It was in that spirit that Fort Detrick welcomed the Russian Minister of Health almost one year later.', 'There he stood, in a place which once had been the symbol of a closed world, a world of suspicion and confrontation, a place where some of the best minds of our nation had prepared for a possible war against this nation.', 'Now this same place had become the symbol of an open world, a world of cooperation and trust. It had become a meeting ground where the best minds from every nation could work together to save life everywhere on earth.', 'We still have a long way to go--but our goal is clear. And for me its symbol is Fort Detrick, Maryland, welcoming the Soviet Minister of Health.', 'This is the kind of world we must leave for our children, a world in which the genius that split the atom and took us to the Moon is turned not to conquering one another but to conquering pain and disease, making our world a healthier, happier place for our people and for all people.', 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
65,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Governor Ogilvie, Senator Percy, Congressman Arends, all of the distinguished candidates and other guests here on the platform, and all of you who have been so kind to, on such very short notice, come here to the airport to welcome Mrs. Nixon and me here:', 'I want to say to you that, first, to come to Illinois is always a very great pleasure for me. I want you to know, too, that to come here at a time that I know the city of Chicago is grieving for those who were the victims of the terrible accident 1 last Tuesday, is one that is a very sad time. But in a way it, too, is a time for hope for all of us.', 'I want to thank and express my appreciation to all of those who, during that tragedy, handled themselves so magnificently-the people in the hospitals, the firemen, the policemen. Lees give them the hand they deserve.', 'I want to express also my admiration for the people of Chicago, for the way they have reacted with great compassion and great sincerity and great heart. You know, this part of the country is known as the heartland of America. Chicago is known as the capital of the heartland of America, and the way the people of Chicago responded to this tragedy proves that Chicago truly has a big heart. We thank you for that big heart.', 'I am very proud, too, today to be here on the platform with others who are candidates for office, as I am. I would like to mention them all by name, but time will not permit it. May I say, first, that on the national scene all of them have my support: Chuck Percy, who is one of the top men in the United States Senate, one of the leaders of the United States Senate; the entire delegation from the State of Illinois. There is only one thing wrong with it. We would like to have a few more just like them back there in Washington. And we support the candidates, as well.', 'But when, out of this one State, you have two men in the leadership--Les Arends, of course, the Whip of the House; John Anderson, who is the chairman of the [House Republican] Conference--it is truly a great delegation, and I express my appreciation in their home State for what they have done for Illinois, what they have done for their districts, and what they are doing for the Nation.', 'Now, at the State level I have so many old friends--Bill Scott, for example; Bernie Carey,2 all the rest. They have my support. But could I say a very personal word about the man that I stood by 4 years ago and by whom I am proud to stand again, your Governor, Governor Dick Ogilvie.', 'As you know, at Independence Hall just a few days ago I signed an historic act, one which changes the flow of money and power to Washington back to the people, to the States and the cities of this country. Thirty billion dollars is going to go back into State government, into city government, and local government over the next 5 years.', ""Now, it isn't just enough to have that money go back. What is needed is to have leaders in the States, leaders in local governments, who will spend that money well for the people of this country, who will use it, for example, to reduce the burden of taxes rather than to increase it, which they could not have done until they received this revenue sharing."", 'I can tell you, I know every one of the 50 Governors in this Nation, Democrat and Republican. Without regard to partisanship, there are many who are very able men, but in the very top ranks of those that I would want to entrust my money to, to spend it well, to use it well for the people of a State, Dick Ogilvie ranks high. He deserves your support.', ""Now, having mentioned the other candidates, I would like to say a word for myself, if you don't mind, too."", 'I have been before the voters of Illinois now on five occasions: in 1952 and 1956, as a candidate for Vice President, and then in 1960 and 1968, and now in 1972, as a candidate for President.', 'I want to speak to you today about why I need your support. I am not going to ask for it in terms of Republicans versus Democrats, because this year we have an election, and what is important is not our party label, but what is important is what is going to happen to America.', 'I ask you as Democrats, as independents, and as Republicans to consider what you want for America. That is why we need a new American majority, to give us an overwhelming vote on November 7, and we would like to have it here in Illinois as well as in other States.', 'I could discuss at length many of the issues, the fact that we have moved toward prosperity without war and without inflation, a goal that we have not had in this country since President Eisenhower occupied the White House. I could speak to you of the progress that we have made in the fields like revenue sharing, in which power is returning from Washington to the people and to the States.', 'I could speak to you of what we have done in the field of the environment and health and education and all the many other areas in which we have worked. And I am very proud that during these past 4 years instead of running down the peace officers of this country, the President of the United States has stood back of them, and I stand back of them today, against those who would run them down.', 'That is why we have begun to turn the tide against crime and against dangerous drugs, because we need to respect those who are peace officers and those who have to carry out the law. Laws, of course, if they are to be respected, must deserve it. And we are going to have continually that kind of law, to have the increasing justice and opportunity that every American has as his due.', 'Today I would like particularly to discuss with you the issue that I know is uppermost in the minds of many of you because of recent developments. As you know, the major goal that I have had over these past 4 years is to build a structure of peace in the world, a peace not just for the next election, but peace for the next generation.', ""We have made very significant progress in that direction. I refer to the journey we took to Peking, where, after a quarter of a century of hardly any contact, finally the world's most prosperous nation and the world's most populous nation, with over one-fourth of the people of the world living there, now are communicating with each other."", 'Think what that means, not to this generation--ours---but to all of these wonderful young people here, because 20 years from now instead of being engaged in ugly and dangerous confrontation with a billion Chinese, they will be communicating with them. They have a chance for peace that we did not have.', 'We have made progress, too, in attempting to bring peace to the Mideast, in standing by our commitments to Israel, and we will continue to stand by those commitments, because that is the way to peace in that troubled area.', 'We have made progress, too, in many other areas in the world, particularly in dealing with the Soviet Union, where, as you know, we have had an historic arms control agreement, agreements in the field of trade and the environment and health and science and in many other areas.', 'I could stop here and talk about those agreements and also the progress that we have made in bringing the war in Vietnam to an honorable conclusion.', 'But my purpose in coming to Chicago is to ask your votes, not because of what we have done over the past 4 years, but to give me the chance that I need to complete the job and to build a structure of peace in the next 4 years.', 'Before coming to Chicago today I met for an hour in the Oval Office with Ambassador Dobrynin of the Soviet Union and the science minister from the Soviet Union [Dr. Mistislav V. Keldysh]. We spoke about the recent summit in Moscow, but we spoke about the future, how we could cooperate more in the future, and we also spoke about the new agreements with regard to the limitation of nuclear weapons, in which the negotiations will start at the end of November.', ""We spoke of the other negotiations which we have already begun, but which we must continue in the next Administration. I realized, as I talked to him, that it was important to go to the country and get the people of this country to give to the President of the United States the backing that he needs, to give to the President of the United States and to give a message to all the leaders of the world that when the President of the United States goes abroad, he speaks not from weakness, but from strength. Let's not have the President ever represent the second strongest nation in this world."", 'Let us also be sure that when the President of the United States goes abroad over these next 4 years, he speaks on the basis of pragmatism and reality and not on naive sentimentality that has always led us into war, or worse, in times past.', ""And let us also remember this thing: When we speak of peace, we want it; when we speak of ending a war, we want it; but let us remember we have ended wars before. The important thing is to end a war in a way that will build a lasting peace, and that is why I say, rather than peace with surrender, let's have peace with honor for the United States of America."", 'As I reported last night on television, we have made a very significant breakthrough in achieving that goal in our negotiations with the North Vietnamese. We have already reached basic agreement on the three major conditions that I laid down in the speech that I made to the Nation on May 8 when I ordered the bombing and the mining of Haiphong and North Vietnam, and those three agreements that we have already reached basic agreement on are these:', ""One, a return of all of our prisoners of war and an accounting for the MIA's; two, a cease-fire throughout not just Vietnam, but throughout all of Indochina, Cambodia, and Laos; and three, the right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will."", 'There are some details of the agreement that are still to be negotiated. I am confident they will be negotiated. I am confident that we will make an agreement. Let me address myself, however, to a question that one member of my staff raised this morning, to the effect that, ""Why are details important? Why not just make an agreement and sign it, because that would be really great just before the election?""', 'Let me tell you something. Rather than having simply an agreement before an election, we want to have a peace for the next generation, and that is what we are working for. I can assure you that as far as an election is concerned, it will not delay an agreement. I can assure you, however, it will not hasten it. The main thing is, we are going to have one, and it is going to be the right kind. I think the American people want the right kind of an agreement--peace with honor and not surrender. That is what we are standing for and that is what we will achieve.', 'Looking far to the future, we think of the younger people here and the older people, people who are black and who are white, people who are rich and poor, people who are employers and employees. We think of those that are respectful when they come to a meeting and all those that are disrespectful. All of them have their right to be heard, and so have I. But in that respect, I would simply say this word to all of you who are here: These next 4 years are years in which America has an opportunity such as I have not seen in my lifetime or that America has not witnessed in this century.', 'We can build a world of peace, real peace; something we have not had in a generation, and for a generation in this whole century. We can have prosperity without war and without inflation. We can have increased opportunities for all Americans to go as high as their abilities will take them without being limited in any respect.', 'We can have also a new period in this country of respect for the rights of others, of civility in our dealings with others, of decency, of carrying on our campaigns in a way in which we present the issues, in which we listen to what somebody else has to say, and then speak what we have to say.', 'Let me say finally to this great crowd in Chicago, it has been very proud, in terms of an experience for me, my wife, my family, to live in that great house that you saw on television last night. It has been a very proud experience to travel to all the 50 States over these last 4 years.', 'It has been a very proud experience to travel to 22 countries abroad, including four capitals that no President has ever been to before--to Peking, to Moscow, to Bucharest, to Warsaw. But I want you to know, in terms of that pride, what is even greater is the pride that I would feel if we can move forward on the beginning that we have made.', 'We are proud of our record. But we have so much more to do. We want to build a real peace. We want to build that real prosperity, and we need your support.', 'Let me say finally in that respect, I have noted that some have said--well, they look at the polls and they wonder really if their vote really matters.', 'You bet it does. First, the only poll that counts is the one that they do on November 7. Second, this is a great decision for the American people. It is the clearest choice this country has had in this century.', ""I say to the people of Illinois, Democrats, independents, Republicans alike, don't sit on the sidelines, don't have this great choice made by simply a minority that manage or bother to go out to vote."", 'Everybody vote, and as far as I am concerned, let me tell you this--and this has always been my attitude in politics--I have won some elections, I have lost some. When I have won them, I have tried to do the best I could. When I have lost them, I have pledged my support to this country and I will continue to do so in all the years ahead.', 'The important thing for you: Let us make this vote on November 7 a vote of a majority of the American people, and let the new majority in America speak out-speak out for peace with honor, speak out for a strong United States, speak out for prosperity without war, speak out for progress that means not bigger government in Washington, but better government, and government that belongs to you.', ""Let's make these next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you.']"
66,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Ladies and gentlemen:', ""Thank you very much, first, to those marvelous bands, let's give them a hand for entertaining while we were here."", 'Second, I want you to know that when I come to Rhode Island, I feel somewhat like coming home, because it was 30 years ago that I spent 2 months in Quonset Point, and from here went into the service and then overseas into the Pacific. I always remember when I, at Quonset Point, used to come in to Providence, how very warm and generous and hospitable were the people of Rhode Island and of Providence to those of us in the Navy at that time. Thank you very much for what you did 30 years ago.', ""Now, on this visit, I would like to mention all of the fine candidates who are running on our ticket. Time will not permit it, but there are two here that I want to mention in particular. I mention them because they have been such splendid members of our Administration during these past 4 years. I am going to start with a man who was the Assistant Secretary of Transportation. I know that in that position that he was a dedicated public servant, but what was more, he was dynamic, he was strong, he was intelligent. He was a good organizer. We didn't want to give him up, but I think the State of Rhode Island needs him as Governor of this State, Herb DeSimone."", 'Herb, with you standing here by me, just let me say that in these next 4 years I look forward to working with you as Governor of Rhode Island, and that door will always be open for Governor DeSimone of the State of Rhode Island.', '[At this point, Herbert F. DeSimone spoke briefly. The President then resumed speaking.]', 'Now, turning to the national scene, I speak about a man that I know, and that you have known for many years. I remember when he was the Governor of this State and rated by all of the objective journalists as one of the top Governors in the Nation. I remember him, too, as the Secretary of the Navy in our Administration for 3 years. John Chafee, without question, is a man who was born to be in public service. He is a man that the Nation needs in public service. Let me just put it quite directly to you: Rhode Island needs him in the Senate, America needs him in the Senate, I need him in the Senate, and you are going to put him in the Senate. John Chafee.', '[At this point, John H. Chafee spoke briefly. The President then resumed speaking.]', 'Now, I would like to say a word for another candidate, for myself. I would like to say in that respect that I have had the great honor of being a candidate for the highest office in this land on three occasions, in 1960, in 1968, and again this year, in 1972. I lost the first time in a narrow election. I won the second time, and now comes the third.', ""As I stand here in Rhode Island, it just occurred to me that while in those elections to which I referred, in '60 and '68, I have at one time or the other carried most of the States, Rhode Island is a State that I have never carried. Let me say, the third time will be the charm. This is the year when we take Rhode Island."", 'I want to tell you why I believe this is a year when the people of Rhode Island are going to vote for the national ticket, for John Chafee, for your next Governor, Governor DeSimone. I want to tell you why.', 'This is not going to be a contest in which the people of Rhode Island are going to divide on partisan terms, Republican versus Democrat. It is going to be a contest in which the people of Rhode Island, like the people of this Nation, realize that this is one of those elections when what is best for America must come first, and the new American majority, Democrats and independents and Republicans together, are going to give America the leadership that we need in these next 4 years.', 'John Chafee has mentioned the subject which is closest to my heart and closest to the heart of all the people here. From the time that I was at Quonset and came out of Quonset as a naval officer, from the time that I finished my service in World War II, I have felt, as everyone in this audience feels, a deep dedication to the cause of peace.', 'I have realized that in this century this great Nation has been involved in war in every generation, and every time the war ends, we think, now we can have peace. But it has not been that way. The generation that fought in World War I saw their sons fighting in World War II. The generations that fought in World War II saw their younger brothers and some of their sons fighting in Korea. The ones who fought in Korea found their younger brothers and some of their sons fighting in Vietnam.', 'Let me say that is why we seek peace in the world, but we seek peace with honor, the kind of a peace that will lead to a lasting peace and not peace with surrender.', 'We have made a breakthrough in the negotiations which will lead to peace. I have referred to that breakthrough. I want to summarize briefly where it stands and to tell you why I am confident we are going to reach the agreement which will end this war and end it with honor and without surrender.', 'First, we have reached agreement on the three major principles that I laid down in my speech of May 8. First, that we are going to have a cease-fire throughout Indochina, not just in Vietnam but in Cambodia and Laos. We have agreed on that.', ""Second, we have an agreement that all of the American POW's will be returned and our MIA's will be accounted for wherever they are in Indochina."", 'Third, we have reached agreement on the principle that the people of South Vietnam shall determine their future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'What is left to be done is to work out some details on which there are still differences. Details, however, are important. They must be worked out in the fight way, because we are not going to have a repetition of what we had in 1968, when, with the best of intentions, the United States agreed to a bombing halt and when there was misunderstanding because the details were not worked out.', 'We are working out those details; we will work them out. We will succeed. But the most important thing is we are going to end this war and end it in a way that will lay the foundation for real peace in the years to come. That is what all Americans want.', 'Now, may I say a word about the role that you can play and the role that John Chafee can especially play in the United States Senate.', 'I met this morning, before I took off on a trip that took me to Chicago and then Oklahoma and finally here in Rhode Island, with a very distinguished scientist, the Russian minister of science. We discussed some of the negotiations we had had in Moscow in May when we made, as you recall, an historic and very important agreement limiting nuclear arms between these great powers.', 'We discussed also the fact that other negotiations are going to take place, very important ones, late in November, in which we will continue to try to limit nuclear arms between our two nations and thereby reduce the burden of arms and also increase the chances for peace.', 'As I talked to him I thought of this visit. As I talked to him I realized, and I want you to realize, that if we are going to be successful in negotiating with the Soviet Union and if we are going to have the kind of success that will have that limitation of arms that we all want, and progress toward peace, it is vitally important that the President of the United States not be sent to the conference table as the head of the second strongest nation in this world.', 'Let me tell you why that is important. Not for any jingoistic reason--because when the United States has the second strongest navy, as our opponents advocate, when the United States has the second strongest air force, as they advocate, and the second strongest army, it means that any incentive that the Soviets or any other nation would have to negotiate with us would not be there.', ""What we must do is to reduce our arms only when it is mutual. That is the way to build a real peace and not a temporary peace. John Chafee knows how to keep America strong. He knows that the most important element of America's peacetime strength is to have the strongest navy in the world. He built that kind of navy when he was Secretary of the Navy,. We need his votes in the United States Senate and his leadership to continue to have that strong navy that John Chafee has contributed so much to as Secretary of the Navy and will, also, in the years ahead."", 'I want to tell you, my friends, too, that as I look at this crowd, and particularly as I had the opportunity to meet so many of the young people as we walked along the fence here, I realized that all of your hopes lie in what happens in these next 4 years and thereafter. As far as those years are concerned, let me simply summarize by saying my hopes, I think, are yours. They are these:', 'I want a world of peace. I want a peace that will last; not one just for an election but one that will last for a generation or more. I want something, too, that we have not had since President Eisenhower was President--that is real prosperity, full employment without inflation and without war. We can have it and we will have it, with your help.', 'I want progress for America, for all Americans; opportunity for Americans; opportunity in which any American, regardless of his background, can go to the very top, where there will be ceiling unlimited.', ""And I want respect for America. I want the people of this country, and particularly our young people, to realize that we are very fortunate at this period in our history that we, the United States of America, have it within our power, that we have it within our leadership capability, to lead the way, the whole world, to a peaceful world. That is why the trip to Peking took place. That is why one-fourth of the world's people now, who had had no communication with the United States for 20 years, now have communication."", 'That is why we have negotiated with the Soviet Union. That is why we are working for peace in the Mideast. That is why in all of these areas I say, keep America strong, be sure that we see that the United States remains respected in the world. And we can do that by electing to the Congress, to the Senate of the United States, men like John Chafee, who understand peace through strength, and that is the message I leave with you today.', 'One final thought: On this last appearance that I will be able to make in this New England area, as somebody was saying as I went along the fence there, I asked a 13-year-old what he was going to do. He said, ""I am going to go into politics."" I said, ""What are you going to run for?"" He said, ""President."" I said, ""Fine. You should shoot high."" But then I gave him another bit of advice. ""The main thing,"" I said, ""to remember is, you don\'t win them all. I know. You win some; you lose some. But the important thing to remember is that particularly where the Presidency is concerned, America is bigger than any man and it is bigger than any party.""', 'I want to tell you, if I receive your votes and the votes of this Nation, I will serve as well as I can. If on the other hand, my friends, if on the other hand, the verdict of the people of this Nation should go to our opponents, then I will support what is best for America and not take the position that only if I win are we going to support whoever is President of the United States of America. The President comes first in the policies that he will be advocating.', 'This does not mean we will not have differences, but it does mean that in our system we debate those differences intelligently. We listen when others speak. We try to do everything that we possibly can to do the best job that we can in campaigning, and then in serving in office.', ""But once the campaign is over, let us have the statesmanship, let us have the ability to pull this country together and to work together for a cause that is bigger than any party and bigger than any man, and that is to make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you.']"
67,Richard Nixon ,"November 03, 1972","['Thank you very much. To all of you who are gathered here inside the hangar, and to the thousands more outside the hangar, thank you very much for a wonderful welcome to the Sooner State.', 'When I scheduled this stop in Oklahoma, there were those who said ""Why?"" I am going to give you the reasons why. I remember saying at the time of the nomination in Miami that we weren\'t going to take any State for granted, and that we were not going to concede any States to the opposition. Oklahoma is one State that I have always carried, and we are not going to start losing it now.', ""Every time I come here to Oklahoma, believe me--I remember in '52 as a candidate for Vice President, '56, '60, '68--you just give me a wonderful lift. Thank you for that wonderful lift that you give me."", 'Now, there is another reason that I am here, and that is to express appreciation not only for your support in the past, but also to ask for your help in the future. Naturally, I am going to talk about what I hope for the future for those 4 years you are talking about, but I also want to tell you that one man, the President of the United States, cannot do that job alone. He needs help. He needs it in the Senate and he needs it in the House of Representatives. I want you to know that in Henry Bellmon you have one of the strongest, best, most loyal Senators in the whole United States of America.', ""I know, too, that Oklahoma is a team State. You produce great teams. You believe in teamwork. You don't like to have one man cancel out another man's vote. Let me say that during the years that I have been President, I have had the opportunity to work with many Governors. Of all the 50 Governors, in this State one of my closest friends, but more important, one of the ablest men that I have met in terms of knowing the problems of his State, of knowing the problems of this Nation, is Dewey Bartlett, and I think that Bartlett and Bellmon would just make a great team in the United States Senate."", 'You know, another thought occurs to me. When they call that roll in the Senate, they do it alphabetically, and when you have those two ""B\'s"" high up on the roll it might affect a few more votes right down that way, so we want them both.', 'Over in the House of Representatives, you, of course, have had fine representation from this State. I would not want to come here, even though he is not a candidate this year, without paying the appreciation of the Nation to Page Belcher for the great service he has rendered as a Congressman, and to tell you that I, of course, support all of our splendid candidates for Congress. I will not have the time to mention them all individually, but particularly here in Tulsa the man who was your former mayor, the man who has all of the qualifications to step into those big shoes of Page Belcher, Jim Hewgley for the United States Congress.', 'Now, with that, if you would permit me, I would like to say a few words for myself, not really in that sense, and not just for a party. What I want to say to you now is that next Tuesday we have an election which is very different from most elections in this country. Usually an election is just a contest between two men, each of whom aspires to a high office, with somewhat different views, but some of the same views. Usually a contest for an election involves a contest between two parties; one party nominates one man and the other party nominates another man.', 'Let me tell you, this year what counts is not the man, and not the personality and not the party; what we need is what is best for America; Democrats, Republicans all joining together for what is best for America.', 'I think, for example, of those next 4 years, and naturally I think of the last 4 years and what I want and what you want for those 4 years. I was so delighted to see all these wonderful young people, most of them will not remember what I said here. They will only remember, perhaps, that they were here. But what we say here and what we do in these next 4 years will determine their futures and your future. That is what this is all about.', ""In that connection, for example, as I said on television last night, I want them to have the opportunity and to have something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President, and that means prosperity without war and without inflation. I want them to have opportunity-opportunity to go as high as their abilities will take them, and we have moved in that direction in fields of education and health and environment over these past 4 years."", ""I want them also, all of our younger generation and the older generation, to really have a deep feeling of love and respect for this country. Let me say, I have noted that some of those who are campaigning across this country are constantly running America down. Let's speak up for America and speak up for her on November 7."", 'But above all, everybody here in Oklahoma, like everybody in Illinois where I was a few hours ago, and everybody in Rhode Island, where I will be about 3 hours from now, wants the same thing for their children, and that is a world of peace. Let me speak to that subject for just a moment so that you can see what is really at stake in this campaign, so that you can see the great difference between the candidates and what your votes will do for that great goal of peace in the United States.', 'In the first place, we have made great progress toward our goal of peace with honor over the last 4 years, I refer, for example, to the trips that I took to Peking and to Moscow which mean that those great nations, instead of being in confrontation with the United States, while we will still have differences, we will have the opportunities to have a peaceful relationship with them.', 'I speak also of the progress we have made toward peace in Vietnam. I speak of the fact that we have brought over 500,000 home. I also speak of what you have all read about, of the fact that we have finally made a breakthrough in the negotiations to bring about a peace with honor. We have already agreed on major provisions. Listen to these provisions because they are the ones that I laid down in my speech of May 8 when, as you remember, I ordered the mining of Haiphong and the bombing of North Vietnam: First, we have agreed, have an agreement, that all of our prisoners of war will be returned and all of our missing in action will be accounted for. Second, we have an agreement that we will have a cease-fire throughout Indochina, in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Third, and this is a very important part of what we have agreed to, we have agreed that the 17 million people of South Vietnam shall have the right to choose their own government without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'We have not yet signed the final agreement and the reason that we have not is that some of the details, some of the issues, are still to be finally worked out. I am confident that they will soon be worked out. Let me tell you what the election has to do with this. As far as the election is concerned, it will not have any effect in hastening us to sign an agreement that would be wrong and it will have no effect in delaying us from signing an agreement that is right.', 'Let me tell you, what is far more important than this next election is peace for the next generation, and we are going to have the right kind of an agreement.', ""You remember in 1968 when a bombing halt agreement was made just before an election. It was made with the best of intentions, I am sure, by the previous Administration. But because it wasn't nailed down in its details the war went on."", 'We are not going to make that mistake. We are nailing down the details. We are getting an agreement which will not simply be an interlude between wars, but which will lay the foundation for peace in the years ahead. I know that peace with honor rather than peace with surrender is what all of the people of this State want.', ""Now, may I come to a fundamental proposition that the people of Oklahoma have always understood in great numbers and that we in this Nation must understand if we are going to be able to build that era of peace that we want to build in the years ahead. There are those who believe that as we now negotiate with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and as we bring the war in Vietnam to an end, that the United States should drastically cut its national defense and then hope that the others do, too. Let me say this: I want all of you to know, I have sat for long days, day on day, in negotiations at the highest level in Peking and Moscow. They have been important negotiations. They have been successful negotiations. But they could not have been successful unless I was able to negotiate recognizing that I represented a nation that was strong and that was respected."", 'Let us now resolve that we shall never send the President of the United States to the negotiating table as the head of the second strongest nation--the United States of America. And so the issue is clear. The issue that you, the voters of this country--Democrats, Republicans, and independents--will all answer is this: Shall it be peace with surrender or peace with honor? I say peace with honor for America. That is what we stand for.', 'Shall it be a weak America or shall it be a strong America? I say a strong America.', 'Shall it be an America that withdraws from its responsibilities in the world, or an America that leads the way to peace in the world so that we can have peace at home? I say let us meet our responsibilities in the world. And also, as we look to the future of this country, let us remember that not only do we want peace for our younger generation and for ourselves, prosperity without war and without inflation, progress, but let us have in these next 4 years, as we come to the 200th birthday of this country, a restoration of something that Americans had in their youth and which we need now.', 'Do you remember when America was only 3 million people and 13 States, weak militarily and also poor economically? And yet that young America, 195 years ago, was respected all over the world. It was the hope of the world. Why? Because America then stood for spiritual and moral strength that could not be represented by military strength and that was stronger than any economic wealth and power.', ""Today America's military strength is unquestioned. America's economic strength is unquestioned. We are the richest nation in the world. Let us also remember that this is the time to strengthen that moral and religious heritage and principle in America that has made us the great nation that we are."", 'My friends in Oklahoma, as I said at the beginning, it is always a very great privilege to come here, to be received so warmly. It is also very heartening to know that out here in the middle of this country there are a people--a people who are strong, a people who have backbone, a people who will stand up for America, a people who believe in the religious and moral values that made this country great. Every time that I make a great decision, I know that I can count on the people of Oklahoma.', 'Thank you very much.']"
68,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Good afternoon:', ""Through the long years of America's involvement in Vietnam, our people's yearning for peace has largely been focused on winning an end to that difficult war. As a result, there has often been a tendency to lose sight of the larger prospects for peace in the rest of the world. As peace in Vietnam comes closer, we can look to the larger world and the long-term future with hope and satisfaction."", 'Four years ago I promised that we would move from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation. I also said that we would maintain our own strength and work to restore that of our alliances, because the way to make real progress toward peace is to negotiate from strength and not from weakness. Because we have done so, the world today is more peaceful by far than it was 4 years ago. The prospects for a full generation of peace are brighter than at any time since the end of World War II.', ""In the past 4 years, we have concluded more--and more significant--agreements with the Soviets than in all the previous years since World War II. We have ended nearly a quarter century of mutual isolation between the United States and the People's Republic of China. All over the world, the tide toward negotiation is moving. North and South Korea are negotiating with one another. East and West Germany are negotiating with one another. A cease-fire has been in effect for more than 2 years in the Middle East. The leaders of India and Pakistan are talking with one another. The nations of Europe, of NATO, and of the Warsaw Pact are preparing to meet next year in a European Security Conference, and preparations are underway for negotiations on mutual and balanced reduction of armed forces in Central Europe."", 'All this is evidence of solid progress toward a world in which we can talk about our differences rather than fight about them.', 'Nineteen hundred seventy-two has been a year of more achievement for peace than any year since the end of World War II. This progress did not just happen by itself.', 'In my Inaugural Address nearly 4 years ago, I said that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker, but I also pointed out that peace does not come through wishing for it, that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.', 'For the past 4 years this Nation has engaged in patient and prolonged diplomacy in every corner of the world, and we have also maintained the strength that has made our diplomacy credible and peace possible. As a result, we are well on the way toward erecting what I have often referred to as a structure of peace, a structure that rests on the hard concrete of common interests and mutual agreements, and not on the shifting sands of naive sentimentality.', 'That term, ""a structure of peace,"" speaks an important truth about the nature of peace in today\'s world. Peace cannot be wished into being. It has to be carefully and painstakingly built in many ways and on many fronts, through networks of alliances, through respect for commitments, through patient negotiations, through balancing military forces and expanding economic interdependence, through reaching one agreement that opens the way to others, through developing patterns of international behavior that will be accepted by other powers. Most important of all, the structure of peace has to be built in such a way that all those who might be tempted to destroy it will instead have a stake in preserving it.', ""In the past 4 years, my efforts to build that structure of peace have taken me to 22 countries, including four world capitals never visited by an American President before--Peking, Moscow, Warsaw, and Bucharest. Everywhere I have traveled I have seen evidence that the times are on the side of peace, if America maintains its strength and continues on course. For example, ever since World War II, the world's people and its statesmen have dreamed of putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle, of controlling the dreaded nuclear arms race, but always that race remained unchecked until this year."", 'In Moscow last May, we and the Soviet Union reached the first agreement ever for limiting strategic nuclear arms. We signed that agreement last month in Washington. This was an historic beginning. It moved back the frontiers of fear. It helped check the dangerous spiral of nuclear weapons. It opened the way to further negotiations on further limitations on nuclear arsenals which will soon begin.', 'As we pursue these negotiations, however, let us remember that no country will pay a price for something that another country will give up for nothing. If we had scrapped the ABM missile system, as many advocated, we would never have achieved the first arms agreement with the Soviets. If we unilaterally slashed our defenses now as our opponents in this election advocate, the Soviets would have no incentive to negotiate further arms limitations.', 'Or take another example. After 10 years of recurring international monetary crises, we took bold actions a year ago to strengthen the dollar and to bring about a reformed international monetary system that would be fair to the United States and fair to the world. The result of these actions has been a solid and substantial beginning on just such a system, and the stage is now set for an international effort to achieve some of the most important monetary and trade reforms in history. As we complete these reforms in the years ahead, we can usher in a new age of world prosperity, a prosperity made even greater by the rapid expansion of peaceful trade that is now taking place, not only with our traditional trading partners but also with nations that have been our adversaries.', 'I cite these simply as examples of the broad, unfinished agenda of peace that now lies before us, the agenda of new starts made, of negotiations begun, of new relationships established, which now we must build on with the same initiative and imagination that achieved the initial breakthroughs. As we move forward on this agenda, we can see vast areas of peaceful cooperation to be explored.', ""We agreed in Peking to pursue cultural, journalistic, educational, and other exchanges, so that the world's most prosperous nation and its most populous nation can get to know one another again."", 'We agreed in Moscow to cooperate in protecting the environment, explore in space, fight disease. This means the day is fast approaching when a Russian cosmonaut and an American astronaut will shake hands in space, when a Russian chemist and an American biologist will work side by side to find a cure for cancer. And each time our nations join hands in the works of peace, we advance the day when nations will no longer raise their hands in warfare.', ""Throughout the world today America is respected. This is partly because we have entered a new era of initiative in American foreign policy, and the world's leaders and its people have seen the results. But it is also because the world has come to know America. It knows we are a nation of peaceful intentions, of honorable purposes, true to our commitments. We are respected because for a third of a century under six Presidents we have met the responsibilities of a great and free nation. We have not retreated from the world. We have not betrayed our allies. We have not fallen into the foolish illusion that we could somehow build a wall around America, here to enjoy our comforts, oblivious to the cries or the threats of others. We have maintained our strength."", 'There are those today who condemn as a relic of a cold war mentality the idea that peace requires strength. There are those who ridicule military expenditures as wasteful and immoral. Our opponents in this campaign have even described the great bipartisan tradition of negotiating from strength as one of the most damaging and costly cliches in the American vocabulary. If the day ever comes when the President of the United States has to negotiate from weakness, that will be a dangerous day, not only for America but for the whole world.', 'Those who scoff at balance of power diplomacy should recognize that the only alternative to a balance of power is an imbalance of power, and history shows that nothing so drastically escalates the danger of war as such an imbalance. It is precisely the fact that the elements of balance now exist that gives us a rare opportunity to create a system of stability that can maintain the peace, not just for a decade but for a generation and more.', 'The years ahead will not be easy. The choices will not be simple. They will require an extra measure of care in distinguishing between rhetoric and reality, between the easy temptation and the hard necessity. We will be told that all the things we want to do at home could be painlessly financed if we slashed our military spending. We will be told that we can have peace merely by asking for it, that if we simply demonstrate good will and good faith, our adversaries will do likewise, and that we need do no more. This is dangerous nonsense.', ""A heavy responsibility lies on the shoulders of those who hold or seek power in today's world, a responsibility not to court the public favor by fostering illusions that peace can be either achieved or kept without maintaining our strength and meeting our responsibilities."", 'As we approach the end of the war in Vietnam, the great question is whether the end of that war will be only an interlude between wars or the beginning of a generation of peace for the world.', 'Five months ago, I delivered the first television address to the Soviet people ever made by an American President. I tried to tell them something about America, about the people of America, about our hopes, our desire for peace and progress, not only for ourselves but for all the people of the world. In that talk, I repeated an old story told in Russia about a traveler who was walking to another village, who stopped and asked a woodsman how long it would take him to get there. The woodsman replied he did not know. The traveler was angry, because he was sure the woodsman lived in the village and knew how far it was. But then as soon as he had gone a few steps further down the road, the woodsman called out to him to stop. ""It will take you 15 minutes,"" the woodsman said. ""Why didn\'t you tell me that in the first place?"" the traveler demanded. And the woodsman answered, ""Because then I didn\'t know the length of your stride.""', 'In these past 4 years, we and the other nations of the world have had a chance to measure the length of our strides. At last we are traveling in the same direction toward a world of peace, toward an era of negotiation, and of expanding cooperation. In the next 4 years, the President of the United States, whoever he is, will negotiate with the leaders of many nations on a broad range of issues vital to America, vital to the world. As we cast our ballots next Tuesday, the world will see whether we have changed the length of our stride.', ""If you approve the beginnings we have made, then your vote on election day to support those policies will be a message to the leaders of all other nations that the American people are not going to retreat, are not going to surrender. It will strengthen the President's hand immensely as we continue to move from confrontation to negotiation to cooperation all around the world as we build toward a generation of peace."", 'Thank you, and good afternoon.']"
69,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['On behalf of Mrs. Nixon and myself, I want to express to all of you our really grateful appreciation for what is without question the greatest welcome we have ever received in North Carolina, and we have had some great ones.', ""We have appreciated the support we have had in the past. We remember how critical North Carolina was to our success in 1968. Based upon what I see today, we are going to repeat in North Carolina in '72, and even more."", 'May I say, too, that I am particularly interested to note what a beautiful day this is. Two or three days ago I was talking to Billy Graham on the phone, and he said, ""If the weather is good, give me the credit."" So, in any event, this is a magnificent day, and you have helped, of course, to make it even a better day because of your presence here.', 'On this occasion, I want to pay my respects, if I could, first to a man who is retiring from the Congress of the United States, a great servant of this State and of this Nation and a very close, personal friend of mine, Charlie Jonas. In paying my respects to him, I also want to indicate my complete support for all of those running for the Congress of the United States who have already been introduced. It is a great team. We would like them there in the Congress of the United States, and we will appreciate your support for them.', 'I also want to thank Roy Acuff 1 for entertaining you before we got here. He said to me as I came on the stage, he said, ""I think you are going to do all right in North Carolina,"" and he says, ""I can promise you Tennessee."" So there are two States we have, in any event.', 'Now to your candidate, our candidate for Governor, Jim Holshouser. He is a man I have known personally, have worked with over many, many years. He is one of those very well organized, dedicated men who has all of the attributes which would make him a fine chief executive of this State. I look forward to the opportunity of working with him in those next 4 years, when he is the Governor, and when, I trust, I am still in Washington, D.C.', 'On this occasion, too, I want to speak of another old friend. As a matter of fact, the friendship goes back even further than the one with Jim Holshouser, because at the time that we met, Jim Holshouser was perhaps too young to be in politics. I remember 21 years ago when I was a junior Senator from the State of California, and some way or other, when they allocated the office space, they put my office between two Senators from North Carolina. Clyde Hoey was on the one side and Willis Smith was on the other. They were fine men. They were great Democrats. But I found that I voted as they did because we were putting America above party, those two Senators from North Carolina.', 'A very young man--he was young to me at that time--Jesse Helms, came in one day to see me. He was the administrative assistant for Willis Smith. He brought with him a young man in a wheelchair, a very promising athlete who had been struck down by the polio epidemic of that year, as you remember, 1951.', 'I met him. We had our picture taken. I understand that Bucky Branham is still in that wheelchair, but he still is one who, with Jesse Helms, has that zest for life and has not given up because of adversity.', 'Ever since that time I have watched Jesse Helms. I have known his intelligence, his compassion, his dedication. I will simply state my position in a word: I know your interest, of course, always in the top of the ticket, but remember, to do the job we need Members of the Senate, Members of the House, who will support what we are trying to do at the top of the ticket.', 'In that connection, North Carolina needs Jesse Helms in the United States Senate. The United States--the Nation needs Jesse Helms in the United States Senate. I need him and I will deeply appreciate your support for this fine man in the United States Senate.', 'I have been quite interested, too, in some of the signs around here. I see one over there, ""Spiro Is Our Hero."" As we enter the closing days of this campaign, I would like to say a word about my running mate. I have often indicated my admiration for him and my respect, but I have noted that in recent days that the organized attempts to make him blow his cool, perhaps attempts to disrupt meetings on a scale unprecedented in American politics, have even gotten more, but let me say the test of a man is not when things go easy, but when they are trying to make it hard for you.', 'I simply want to say that I think all Americans are very proud that in spite of the disruption, in spite of the organized heckling, the Vice President of the United States has kept his cool, his dignity, and has come through it as the splendid man that he is.', 'Now I am going to suggest, so that we can give equal time here at this meeting, that our friends in the three television networks over here, ABC, CBS, NBC, who will have this on the program tonight, that they now turn their cameras to the few hundred that are over here. Let them see the kind of people that are supporting our opponents over here.', ""Now in the name of equal time and in the objectivity which I know all fair newsmen in North Carolina stand for, turn to the thousands over here and let's hear and see the kind of people that are supporting us."", 'As you know, I was very proud to have lived 3 years among you here in the Tar Heel State. It seems hard to realize that it was 35 years ago. Many of my friends, the best friends that I have, are from North Carolina. I learned to know them when I was at Duke University at law school.', 'Incidentally, when I was at Duke, I learned to respect all the fine schools in this country, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Wake Forest, Davidson--all of them.', 'But when I was in law school, having come from California and never been in the South before, I saw the South as it was then. I saw that the South was divided from the North. I saw, too, that the State of North Carolina was a heavily Democratic State where Republicans had no chance, usually, to win. It was a one party State.', 'I was thinking as the airplane came up today and I saw this enormous crowd, how things have changed. They have changed for the better. They have changed not in a partisan sense, but now we find--and this is the significant thing that I wish to emphasize to this great audience--that this country is no longer, on the great issues, divided in a regional sense.', 'On the great issues, it is not divided in a partisan sense. When it comes to keeping America strong, when it comes to peace with honor, we are not Democrats or Republicans or Southerners or Northerners-we are Americans. That is the way the people of North Carolina feel.', ""That is why in this State which, according to registration, is far more Democratic than Republican, we have support that crosses the party line. Because whether it is here in North Carolina or whether it was in Rhode Island where we were last night or whether it was in Oklahoma City where we were at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon or whether it was in Illinois where we were at noon yesterday, you can go to the East, to the North, to the South, or the Far West where we will be this afternoon in California, and you will find that Americans are joining together in a new American majority standing for issues that are above party and above regional differences."", 'One of the issues that joins us together is the desire, a desire that is heartfelt throughout all of this country, for peace with honor for America and the world.', 'As you know, we have made a major breakthrough in the negotiations which can lead to that peace with honor. In making that breakthrough I want to point out that we have reached agreement on the three fundamental principles that I laid down on May 8 when, as you recall, I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong.', 'Those three conditions on which we have reached agreement are these: one, all of our prisoners of war and those who are missing in action, all of our prisoners of war will be returned, those missing in action will be accounted for; two, we have reached agreement that there should be a cease-fire, not only in South Vietnam but in Cambodia and Laos, all over Southeast Asia; and third, we have reached agreement on the fundamental point that the people of South Vietnam should have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'There are some details that are still to be negotiated. We are going to negotiate them. I want to tell you why. Because in reaching an agreement like this we want to be sure that it is not just a case of peace now but peace in the years ahead. We want peace that will last and we want to be sure that as far as the details are concerned, all of the misunderstandings are removed now.', 'Let me take you back 4 years. You remember the bombing halt in 1968. You remember it was entered into with the very best of intentions by those who made it. But you remember also that it did not lead to peace; it simply led to a continuation of the war. There was a misunderstanding. What we are doing is insisting on continuing the negotiation on which we have basic agreement on the major principles that I have mentioned, but continue it until the details are worked out.', 'We are confident we can achieve that goal, but it will be a goal that we then can be proud to say is peace with honor, not peace with surrender, a peace that will last for the United States and for the world.', ""In that connection, the day before yesterday the mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania, a Democrat, came in to see me. He indicated his support of our ticket in his State. His wife was with him. His wife's brother had been killed in Vietnam 4 days after the bombing halt. She showed me his picture, a fine young man, a major in the United States Army. She told me about him. She said that she had received a letter from him just before his death. That letter indicated at that point support for what I was trying to advocate at that time in the campaign."", 'Then she said to me, ""Mr. President, we all want peace, but above everything else, we want a real peace. We want a peace that will last. We want peace with honor. We want to be sure that he died, and others died, for a cause that will serve this country and serve it well.""', 'Let me tell you: We are keeping that pledge to those who gave their lives so that America could survive as a country of peace. There is one other thought that occurred to me as she was talking to me. I think of the fact that during this very long and difficult war, a war which began 5 years before I ever came to office, but during the whole course of this long and difficult war, over 2½ million young Americans, when they had to make a decision, chose to serve their country in Vietnam, and they deserve our respect and our honor for having made that choice.', 'Some of those 2½ million, many of them, gave their lives for their choice, as did the brother of the wife of the mayor of Erie, Pennsylvania. A few hundred chose to desert America. I say they must pay the penalty for their choice. When this war is over, there will be no amnesty for draft dodgers or deserters. So I say to you, I gave you three of the major issues in this campaign: We stand for peace with honor versus peace with surrender. We stand for a strong America versus a weak America. We stand for no amnesty for draft dodgers and deserters. This is what we believe Americans stand for across this Nation.', 'But beyond this, we must also realize that what we are trying to build is not simply the end of a war, but a new kind of life here in the United States. I see all of the wonderful young people that are here, the Grimsley High School Band and the others. I think of your future. We want you to grow up in a world of peace, but we also want it to be a world in which we can have what we have not had since President Eisenhower was President, and that means progress with full employment but without war and without inflation. We are moving toward that, and we ask for your help to give us the chance to continue to find that kind of prosperity for America.', 'We also want progress. That means better schools, better housing, opportunity, opportunity for every young American, whatever his background, to go to the top with the ceiling unlimited. All of these things we stand for. All of these things we have made great progress in. And we believe in justice, and when we speak of justice, I say that I am proud of the men I have appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and we are going to appoint other men who will stand for the forces of law and order and justice, because it is time that we strengthened the peace forces as against the criminal forces in the United States of America.', 'Now, if I could take you a bit further beyond simply these material things I have been talking about, beyond ending a war and bringing the peace that we all want, beyond the prosperity without war and without inflation, the progress in all these other areas which we, as Americans want, let me tell you that the future is bright for America. It is bright because the world is different. We, you, all of us, have helped to change it in these last 4 years, and particularly in this last year.', ""The People's Republic of China, where one-fourth of all the people in the world live, is now no longer isolated from us. That means that 20 years from now, when a billion people will be living there, they will not have to be our enemies. They can be our friends. That means a good and better life for young people in America."", 'We have negotiated with the Soviet Union to limit arms in the nuclear field and in many other fields. That means that despite the differences we have and will continue to have in philosophy, that we will talk about differences rather than fight about them.', 'Finally, it means that having opened up this great world, that the young people here--young as I was, and younger, when I was here in North Carolina as a student 35 years ago--can look forward to an open world where there can be communications between people even though there are differences between governments, where there can be peace in the world and progress such as we have never had in the whole history of mankind.', 'But it all depends, my friends, on you, because we must continue. We have started the negotiations with the Soviet Union. They must continue. We have started the opening to the PRC. We must continue. We are moving toward the prosperity that we all want, but we need to continue.', 'What we need from you and what we ask from you is your consideration of what we have presented here today. It is the clearest choice that we have had in this century. On that choice, I believe that the people of North Carolina, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, will say that America wants peace with honor, not surrender; America wants a strong defense, not a second-rate defense; and America will continue on a course, a course which will lead us into a new situation in the world, in which the people of the world, and particularly the younger generations, can grow up without the fear of war hanging over them.', ""I say to you finally, as I speak here, I feel very close to you, to the people in this State, for the reasons that I have mentioned. I feel, for that reason, a particular responsibility to you. I just want to say that in these next 4 years, I will dedicate myself to doing the things that I have talked about, but above all, I will never forget the faces that I have seen here, the wonderful people of North Carolina. We won't let you down.""]"
70,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Thank you very much for being here and introducing us as you have to this wonderful crowd in Albuquerque. As you know, we started this morning from Washington, D.C. We were first in North Carolina for one of the record crowds of the campaign, and then arriving here this day in Albuquerque. I saw in advance that it was the opening day of hunting season and the homecoming game for the university, and I wondered if anybody would be here. Thank you for coming.', 'And although the Lobos1 lost today, speaking as one who knows how it is to lose and win, they will come back. They will win next time.', 'Also, may I say to you that it is a very great privilege to be here on this platform with the other candidates who stood here a moment ago, because this is truly a team effort. We often think of the President of the United States sitting in the Oval Office making the great decisions that affect the Nation and the world. But as you all know, he can only do the job that needs to be done with your help, the help of millions of Americans and also with the help of Members of the House and Senate.', 'For that reason, I am stopping here, because we are interested in what you, of course, will do, and how you will vote on election day, at the top of the ticket, but also, in asking for your support for the men we need in the House and in the Senate, so that we can do what America wants done over these next 4 years that you have been talking about.', ""If I could say a word, now, about Manny Lujan; Manny was one who seconded my nomination. I was not there, because, you know, the tradition is that the candidate is not supposed to go to a convention until after he is nominated, and I had to wait to make sure, but I remember seeing it on television. As I think of all the seconding speeches, the one that gave me the biggest charge was Manny's. I think it is the first time that a seconding speech has been given in both English and Spanish, and I understood the Spanish as well as the English."", 'As we went down the line and shook hands with the wonderful young people in the band and the other people, and received the welcome that we did, I must say that you made us feel very much at home. But I would like to put it in another way. We, I know in this State just like in my home State of California, have a great tradition, a background of Spanish speaking Americans, as well as people of all other backgrounds, and so, consequently, we pick up a little language here and there, even though we may not be of that particular background ourselves.', 'I remember, however, that when we, in English, say we want to welcome somebody someplace, we say, ""Make yourself at home."" But those who speak Spanish have a much warmer way of saying it. They say, ""Estan ustedes en su casa""-you are in your own home--and that\'s the way we feel today.', 'That allows me to say something that in all the years I have been in the Oval Office has meant more to me than almost anything else in terms of telling me what America really is. I remember one day Manny was in and we were talking about people of various backgrounds. Manny, of course, is, as he should be, very proud of his Spanish-speaking background. But he said, ""You know, Mr. President, we shouldn\'t talk about hyphenated Americans,"" and he is absolutely right.', 'So often, I know, we go around, you hear people say ""He is Italian,"" or ""He is a Pole,"" or ""He is a Mexican,"" or ""He is black,"" or whatever the case might be. Let me say every one of us is proud of our background, whatever it is, but most of all, we are proud to be Americans. That is what we are, and I speak to you in that vein today.', 'There were many reasons for coming to New Mexico today--the sentiment, the feeling, the fact that we have always had such a wonderful welcome here. But I wanted the opportunity as President of the United States to pay a bipartisan tribute to one of the great Americans of our time.', 'My daughter was here just a few weeks ago to participate in that tribute. I was unable to come. He is unable to be with us today, but Senator Clinton Anderson was our neighbor when we were in Washington and when I served in the Senate and later as Vice President. He was a Democrat. I was a Republican. But Clinton Anderson, during the years that I knew him in the Senate, was an American first and a partisan second--and a great American he was.', 'He was also like so many from this great State of New Mexico, these great Western States independent. That is a tradition of Senators from this part of the country--independent. A team player, but whenever he felt the interests of his State or the interests of his Nation required him to take a different position than the other people in the party did, he would take it. And he was known for that.', 'As I think of Clinton Anderson, he was a very big man, and it is going to take a very big man to fill his shoes. I have been thinking of whether there is a man who can fill those shoes--and there is one. It is Pete Domenici. He is the big man who can fill those shoes. I have known him, of course, when he has campaigned before. One time he lost. But again, having lost then, this time he is going to win, I know. I know that is what is going to happen.', ""But let's look at Pete for a moment. He is a Republican. But he is an American first. Second, speaking of that independent tradition, I have talked to him quite often about the problems of this State, the problems that he is interested in and he is a man who makes up his own mind. When he comes to Washington he is going to speak up for the people of New Mexico. He is going to speak up as he thinks the interests of the people of this State require, and that is the kind of a man you want, one who is independent, but one who above all, when the chips are down, when the great issues are involved, is going to speak up for America, and that is what Pete Domenici will do."", 'That brings me to the theme of what I would like to touch upon today, the fact that this is not one of those campaigns where it is party against party or one individual against another on a personality basis. This is one of those campaigns where there are great overriding issues that affect the future of this country and the future of the world, in which there is a great gulf between the two candidates for the highest position in this land, in which there is complete disagreement between the two as to what America ought to do, as to where we ought to go.', ""I want to state my position today. I want to say it not in terms of being against--let's understand what we are for. I want to start right out with the issue that I know is closest to your hearts as it is to that of every American, the issue of bringing peace to the world and for the United States to lead the way to peace in the world."", 'I begin, of course, with the progress that we have made in bringing to an end the war in Vietnam. It has been very significant. Most important, as you know, we have made a major breakthrough in the negotiations. We have already agreed, in the settlement, to the principles that I laid down in my speech of May 8, which you may recall was made at the time that I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong, at the time that the Communists were invading from the North. I said then that these were the three principles that we would have to have to have a negotiated settlement: First, that there should be a cease-fire. Second, that there should be a return of all of our prisoners of war and accounting for our missing in action. Third, that the people of South Vietnam should determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'Those three principles are agreed upon, and that is a major breakthrough in these negotiations. There are some details, as I pointed out on television 2 nights ago, in terms of the agreement, that are still in the process of negotiation. Those details, in my belief, I am confident will be worked out. We will have a negotiated settlement and a negotiated end to this war.', ""But let me tell you why details are important. They are important because what we want is not just peace now. Peace now is important. What we want is peace now and for the generations ahead, and we must have the right kind of peace. You may recall back in 1968 when, with the very best of intentions, the previous Administration entered into a bombing halt of North Vietnam and everybody thought we were going to have peace now. But we didn't have it down. We didn't have it understood. We are not going to make that mistake again."", 'We are going to have the kind of agreement which will end this war and build the foundation for a lasting peace that we can enjoy in that part of the world and all over the world. And that kind of peace, my friends--and let us understand what the issue is, and this is the basic difference between the two candidates--I say it shall be peace with honor and not peace with surrender for the United States of America.', 'Beyond that, when we speak of peace, let us remember that is one small part of the world. Our eyes have been upon it because of the long and difficult war that we have been engaged in, a war that started 5 years before I became President of the United States, and that we are now bringing to an end. But there is much more of the world, and you have seen that world, all of you, on television, more than you have ever seen it before, in this year 1972.', 'Why the trip to Peking? Why the trip to Moscow? The first time that a President of the United States has ever been in those two capitals. I will tell you why. It has to do certainly with my generation and all of you who can say you are in my generation. But it has even more to do with their generation and their generation over there.', ""Let me tell you what the world would be like if I had not taken the trip to Peking. One-fourth of all the people of the world live in the People's Republic of China, one-fourth of all the people. They are among the ablest people in the world. Their government is a Communist government. I do not agree with their philosophy. We will continue to have differences with their government. We will have disagreements with their philosophy. But if a billion people in the world, 10, 15, 20 years from now, were lined up in confrontation against the United States of America it would be a dangerous world."", 'I had to take the steps now to reduce that danger. We have done it so we have a better chance for a generation of peace for our young Americans.', ""The trip to Moscow was taken for similar reasons. The Soviet Union is also a nation that has a government that is different from ours. Their interests are different. Their philosophy is different. But they are a fact of life and a very important fact of life. They are, in nuclear terms, as strong as the United States of America. They are basically one of the super powers in the world. We were going down a track, a track in which we would inevitably confront each other at some time in the future and war might be the result. We couldn't let that happen."", ""So, on both sides--and it was on both sides--the leaders of the Soviet Union and the leaders of the United States met in Moscow. We didn't settle all of our differences, but we made agreements with regard to trade, we made agreements with regard to the environment, we made agreements with regard to cooperation in space, we made agreements--this one will not seem important perhaps when we think of the last one I am going to mention, the one with regard to the control of nuclear weapons--we made agreements, for example, with regard to exchange and cooperation in the field of health."", ""Let me tell you just what that means to this younger generation. We consider, for example, the dread diseases that afflict mankind. They don't just afflict Americans. They afflict all people, wherever they are. One of them is cancer. Did you know that last year more people died of cancer in the United States than were killed in action from America in all of World War II? So we are out to find an answer to that. There may be many answers, but my point is where it is going to come from. It may come from an American. It may come from a man or a woman. But it might come from a Russian or it might come from a Chinese. It may come from somebody in Africa or Latin America. What we must do, whatever our differences may be between governments, is to work together with other people in working against common diseases that afflict mankind, and that is why we have taken this giant step in both the Soviet Union and the United States to work together on that particular problem."", 'But perhaps most important, and most remembered by all of you, is the agreement that we entered with regard to the control and particularly the limitation of nuclear weapons. It was a first step and a very important one.', 'But now comes the second step. It is to get your approval and get your support for that second step that I come here today, for that second step and the second step we will take in so many other directions.', 'For example, we are now going to have negotiations beginning in late November with the Soviet Union to further limit nuclear weapons and reduce the danger of war. They will make this first agreement seem important, but they will not make it look nearly as important as it was, because it will cover more weapons than previously had been the case. It will be another great step forward toward reducing the burden of arms on America and on the Soviet Union, but, more important, in reducing the threat of war that hangs over us all.', ""I want you to know that in these next 4 years, whether it is in dealing with the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China, or in bringing peace to the Mideast, a real peace, or in building better relations with our friends in Latin America or in Africa or wherever the case might be, we have made a good beginning. The chances for real and lasting peace in the world are better today than they have ever been at any time since the end of World War II. We ask for a chance to continue that job and to build that lasting peace, a generation of peace for all Americans."", ""Now, to build that, there are some things we are going to need. We are going to need a strong America, and here, again, we have a basic difference between the two men who seek the Presidency. I will tell you where I stand. I have sat across the conference table from the men in Moscow and Peking. I simply want to say to you, never send the President of the United States to negotiate with any power in the world as the head of the second strongest nation in the world. Let's keep America, in that respect, with the power that it has."", 'That is why I have to oppose, I have to oppose those who would make us have the second strongest navy, the second strongest air force, the second strongest army in the world, because when that day comes, it means that the threat of war in the world would be infinitely greater because the United States is the only nation in the free world that can deter aggression in the world.', 'It also means that any chance for reduction of arms or limitation of arms in the future is gone, because if you have already given it away unilaterally, they have no reason to give anything to you in return.', 'So let us be strong, let us be for peace, but let us be for peace through strength and not peace through weakness. That is what we stand for, and what Pete Domenici and Manny Lujan and all the rest stand for.', ""One other point that is related to this: We are moving, fortunately, to something that has been an ideal of mine, and I know of Manny Lujan's and Pete Domenici's and all of us here for many years, and that is, we are going to have a volunteer armed force starting in the middle of next year. In order to make that volunteer armed force work, however, it is necessary not only that they be paid enough, and they will be; it is necessary that those men and women in uniform in peacetime have the respect of their fellow countrymen."", 'In that respect, I simply want to say that as the long war in Vietnam comes to a conclusion, I, of course, think of those 2½ million Americans who served there. It was a hard choice for them, as it is for any who have to go to war. But they chose to serve their country when they had to make that choice. Many gave their lives for that choice. A few hundred, when they were faced with that choice, chose to desert their country, and they have to pay a penalty for their choice.', 'And so that there will be no misunderstanding on the differences between the two candidates in this respect, when the war in Vietnam is over, there will be no amnesty for draft dodgers or deserters, because it would not be fair to those who have served, and it is not the basis on which we could develop the new volunteer armed force, with the respect that we want, for developing the strength that America needs.', 'I have talked about this problem particularly because I know it is so close to all of your minds. Let me say, having reached the era of peace that we want, we want to have also with it what we have not had since President Eisenhower was President, and that is prosperity without war, without inflation. We are moving toward it. We need your help to continue in that direction. We want progress, but we want the kind of progress--programs for progress--that can be undertaken without increasing the tax burden on the American people. Your taxes are already too high, and that is why you are not hearing promises that are going to raise your taxes from me on this occasion.', 'And above everything else, we want opportunity for Americans, opportunity for every American--those first Americans that I had the opportunity to meet over here a few minutes ago, those who have come from other countries, those who are proud Americans who are more recently citizens--we want every American, whatever his background, every child, to have a chance to go to the top, ceiling unlimited. That is our ideal. We are working toward it. We can and will achieve it.', 'These are some of the goals we have in mind and today I come here to our friends in New Mexico and ask your support of those goals. It is on that basis, then, that I present the case. Not Republican versus Democrat, not one individual against another, but I say to you that when we talk about peace with honor, when we talk about strength for America, when we talk about opportunity for all, when we talk about prosperity without war, without inflation, when we talk about holding the line on taxes, those are issues that transcend partisan politics.', 'That is what America needs and that is what you are going to help us give America by your support in this campaign.', 'This morning I made a call to a distinguished Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith. I wished her well in her campaign for reelection. As I spoke to her, I thought of the fact that it used to be said in politics that as Maine goes, so goes the Nation. However in 1936 that proved to be untrue. As you remember, in that year Mr. Roosevelt carried all the States except Maine and Vermont. So Maine did not go the way the Nation went.', 'I did a little studying before getting off the plane today. I found that since the time New Mexico became a State of the Union in 1912 that New Mexico has never voted for a loser. Let me say, you are not going to vote for one this time.', 'Thank you.']"
71,Richard Nixon ,"November 04, 1972","['Governor Reagan, all of these very distinguished celebrities on the platform, and all of you very distinguished people in our home State of California:', 'Earlier today we visited the State of North Carolina and, of course, in California there is probably somebody from every State in the Union, but in North Carolina, as we were there, where we had a very great airport rally, I thought of a book that had been written by one of the great American novelists, Thomas Wolfe. Many of you have read it. You remember the title, certainly, ""You Can\'t Go Home Again.""', 'When we landed here today, knowing that it has been a little misty earlier in the day, knowing that the traffic has been backed up for miles, and when we look back on all of the appearances in this campaign, and when we see this magnificent crowd, we know you can go home again--to California.', 'Tonight I want to express appreciation first to Governor Reagan for not only his very gracious introduction but for the remarks that he made before we arrived, and for the work he has done in this campaign in California` and across the Nation.', ""I want to express, of course, my support for all of our candidates for the House, for the Assembly, many of whom I know have been introduced. I think you should know when the mayor, Mayor Snider, presented me with a plaque, that was because it was 12 years ago we finished the campaign here in Ontario at one o'clock in the morning, and we wish him well in his contest particularly here in this area."", 'I want to express appreciation, too, on this occasion, and I have waited now to do it because they have traveled all over this land, to this group of--well, we call them celebrities, but they are from California. They are some of the greatest names in show business; that is one thing. But they have also the greatest hearts and the greatest courage in show business, and we are glad to have them on our side. I think we should give them a hand.', ""Could I also express the appreciation that we all must feel for what, to me, is the greatest, and I have seen all kinds, of course, at rallies, bands and massed bands. Isn't that a marvelous sight, those massed bands behind us? How about a hand for them?"", 'And now could I take you back 12 years and relate what happened then to what can happen now? Twelve years ago, we finished a very long day of campaigning here in California. It was the last appearance of the campaign, as is this one.', ""I recall there was an enormous crowd here, not as big as this one, but it was late at night, at one o'clock, and it was quite cold. We were very heartened by it."", 'That year, in what was the closest election in this country, we lost the Nation but we won California. This year, based on the crowd I see here, we are going to win California and the Nation.', 'Could I tell you just a word about that Nation as I have seen it in just 2 days? As President, of course, I have had the opportunity, with Mrs. Nixon, to travel to 50 States, all the 50 States, the first President to have had such a privilege. But in the last 2 days we have really seen all parts of the Nation.', 'Yesterday we were in Chicago, Illinois, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Providence, Rhode Island. And today we were at Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and we were in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and now here in Ontario, California.', 'As you will note, we have covered the Northeast of the Nation in Rhode Island. We have been to the center of the Nation in Chicago. We have been down to the Southwest in Oklahoma. We have been in the South in North Carolina, and now we are in the capital of the West, California.', 'I want to tell you something about this country, and I particularly want all of you, the many wonderful young people here who--some are not old enough to vote, but you all will be---let me tell you something about this country: There was a time, and it was not too long ago, when if you traveled through the country you would see it deeply divided--the West against the East, the North against the South, and so on and so on, the cities against the farms, and so forth. But let me tell you, wherever you go, across America, this Nation is getting together.', 'I can tell you that whether it is in Illinois, or whether it is in Oklahoma, or whether it is in North Carolina or Rhode Island or in California, that across this Nation we find a phenomenon happening which is going to change the situation insofar as this country is concerned, and which is going to make this a better world for us as well, and it is this: An unprecedented number of people in this country are not thinking in regional terms, they are not thinking in partisan terms, but they are thinking in one term only: This year they are voting for what they think is best for America. That is what they are doing all across this Nation.', 'Everywhere I go, I find that people are united in what they believe is best for America. I want to speak about why they are united, and I want to ask you, my fellow citizens of California, to join people throughout this Nation--Democrats, Republicans, and independents in giving us the support that we need to continue the work that we have begun. We have begun, but we have much more to do.', 'I want to begin with that subject which, of course, is on the minds of everybody everyplace in this Nation. Governor Reagan has referred to the work that we have done to try to bring peace to this world.', 'We have approached this subject on a world scale in our trips to Peking and Moscow, and we have also worked on this subject in that area that has been nagging this country for so many years. When I came into office, we had been in a war in Vietnam for 5 years. There was no end in sight. There were 550,000 Americans there; 300 were being killed every week.', 'You know what has happened, the number that we have brought home, the casualties are down. But most important, finally we have had a breakthrough in the negotiations, and I can tell you today that the significant point of that breakthrough is that the three principles that I laid down when, on May 8, I ordered the bombing of North Vietnam and the mining of Haiphong for the purpose of stopping the Communist invasion of the South, those three principles have now been agreed to, and they are these:', ""First, all of our POW's will be returned and our missing in action will be accounted for; second, it has been agreed that there will be a cease-fire; and third, it has been agreed that the people of South Vietnam shall determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will."", 'Now we have a situation in which, having made this progress, we now must negotiate the final details. Those details must however be completed and be completed in a proper way. I want to tell you why. While the general principles have been agreed upon, we have often found in the history of settlements that unless you nail down the understandings and clear away the ambiguities you may get peace now, but not peace for the years ahead. We want peace that will last, not peace that will be simply for a little while.', 'You remember, for example, just before the election in 1968, when, with the very best of intentions, our Government agreed to a bombing halt in North Vietnam and we thought we were going to have peace or negotiations for peace. We thought so, but the understandings were not nailed down and as a result the war continued.', 'We are not making that mistake this time. I can simply say this: We have agreement on the general principles and I am confident we will negotiate the settlement which will end the war and bring us what we all want--peace with honor and not peace with surrender for the United States of America.', 'Now moving from that part of the world, which, although it is terribly important to the people that live there and to us because we have been involved there for so long, is only one small part of the world, let me tell you now what we have at stake in this election in terms of the other parts of the world.', ""I mentioned the trip to Peking and the trip to Moscow. I am going to tell you what they mean and to whom they mean so much. The trip to Peking, for example, has great meaning in one sense because it saw the President of the United States for the first time visiting that capital of the People's Republic of China. But it has meaning primarily, not so much to our generation, or mine I should say, but to this younger generation that we see here in such great numbers. Because, let me tell you, imagine how dangerous the world would be if one-fourth of all the people of the world who live in the People's Republic of China, 10, 15 years from now had gathered enormous nuclear capability and had no communication with the United States of America. We could not allow that danger to continue to exist."", 'I am not suggesting, and no one should believe, that there are not differences in philosophy, and deed ones, that will remain between our Government and theirs as long as theirs is Communist and ours is free. I am not suggesting that we do not have differences in terms of interests, but I do say this: I say that when we look at the future of the world we have to learn to live in this world in a way in which nations with different philosophies and different interests can settle those differences at the conference table and will not be involved in a nuclear war, and we have made a great step in that direction by that trip to Peking.', ""The trip to Moscow had a similar purpose. There we had a communication with the Soviet Union. We had had some progress. But look at what has happened this year. Here again, let us understand what the situation is. The Soviet Union's government is a Communist government. Our philosophies are totally different. They have different interests than we have in many parts of the world. That will continue. But again, imagine what we would leave to the younger generation had we not moved this year on that front. We would have gone down the road to an inevitable confrontation and a nuclear explosion, possibly, that would have destroyed civilization as we know it. I could not let that happen. You could not let it happen. That is why we went to Moscow. There we negotiated an historic number of agreements, agreements, for example, in the field of trade, agreements in the field of science, agreements in the field of space, and particularly those that you will remember, agreements to begin the limitation of nuclear arms."", 'But I again emphasize, it was only a beginning, just as the trip to Peking was a beginning. What we must do now is to go on from there and in going on from there what we must recognize is that just next month, for example, we are planning to meet with the leaders of the Soviet Union--our representatives--to negotiate the second round of arms limitation.', 'I am not suggesting that as a result of that meeting, any more than the first meeting, that all differences will disappear. But I do say this, and I say this as a message of hope to all of the wonderful young people here and your parents and your friends: that never since the end of World War II have the chances for peace for a whole generation been better than they are right today in the United States and in the world.', 'What we ask for is a chance to continue. What we ask for from the American people is a message to the leaders abroad, a message that the President of the United States, when he negotiates, has the support of the American people. We ask for that support in this election.', 'We also must recognize that in order to have these negotiations succeed to limit arms, in order for the United States to be able to play the role which we are destined to play, of building a peaceful world, it is vitally important that the President of the United States never be sent to the bargaining table with another country as the head of the second strongest nation in the world. We must remember that strength for the United States is vitally important to world peace.', ""I know there are those who say that we can cut our defenses so that we have the second strongest navy and the second strongest air force and the second strongest army and it doesn't really make any difference. But let me tell you, the day that happens peace and freedom will be in deadly jeopardy throughout the world. Let me say, keep America strong so that the President of the United States will represent a strong America and not a weak America."", ""Our thoughts, of course, turn also to our problems at home. We have moved forward to something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President, and that is full prosperity without war and without inflation."", 'We have some way to go, but we now have the highest rate of growth of any industrial nation; we have the lowest rate of inflation of any of the great industrial nations. And we are going to continue on that road until Americans can have that opportunity that they have not had since 15 years ago when President Eisenhower was in the White House, and that is prosperity without war, without inflation.', 'We also ask you today for approval from my fellow Californians and for support in what we are doing in the field of fighting the rise in crime in this country and fighting dangerous drugs. It has to be done on all fronts, but one that is particularly important is in the appointment of judges to all the courts, and particularly to the Supreme Court.', 'Four years ago when I campaigned, I said that I would appoint judges who would recognize the necessity to strengthen the peace forces as against the criminal forces in this country. I have done so, but I have only had a beginning. We need 4 more years to strengthen the courts so we can have the peace forces strong, backed by the judges of this country, and if I could respectfully suggest you can help in this field, too.', 'I know that sometimes in recent years, in the late sixties, it became rather fashionable always to run down those who wore the uniform, whether it was a uniform serving their country abroad or the uniform of someone who was keeping our streets safe at home. Let me say: Back up the men on our peace forces in the United States, whether they are abroad or whether they are home. Give them the respect that they deserve.', 'There is one other great goal that I refer to today, and that is the goal of opportunity for all Americans. We in California feel so strongly about that because while we are the biggest State and the most populous State, we come from all the States and all the nations of the world. We believe in equal opportunity for everybody--an equal chance for the best education, an equal chance for good health, a chance for everybody to have a job, to go just as high as his talents will take him.', 'We want that. We can help in Washington in working toward that. We need your support to continue to develop that equal chance for every American, with ceiling unlimited as high as he or she wants to go.', 'And finally, may I say that as I look at this great crowd, I think of something else that we would like to leave during this next 4 years, something else in addition to peace which could last for a generation or longer, something in addition to prosperity without war and without inflation, to progress and opportunity for all Americans, and that is this:', 'I mentioned the fact that we have been to 50 States. Mrs. Nixon and I have traveled to 80 countries as Vice President and then as President. And in those travels as President of the United States I have visited four capitals that no President has ever been to before--Peking, Moscow, Bucharest, and Warsaw.', 'These were journeys for peace, but as those journeys took place, and as we saw those 80 countries, each time we came back to the United States and we saw this country, and we realized when we returned how very fortunate anyone is to live in the United States of America.', 'My fellow Californians, this is a great State, and this is a beautiful country. Oh, we have our problems, and we have those faults that we are trying to correct, but the wonder of it is, and the glory of it is that we have a system in which we can correct them in a peaceful way without resorting to violence, and that is the way we are going to do it.', ""I want you to know that as I look at America over these next 4 years and I think of your future, I believe that we have the chance--and this is our goal--to make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history. That is what I ask for tonight."", 'Now, if I could close with one personal note, I mentioned a moment ago that the last rally of the 1960 campaign was here at Ontario. Tonight, as I drove through this crowd, I was thinking back to the first rally I ever attended or spoke to. It was in 1945, November. That is quite a few years ago, before most of this audience was born. But as I was thinking back to that, I thought of how good the people of California have been to us: First to the House of Representatives for two terms, then the United States Senate, and then 8 years as Vice President, out of office for a period of 8 years, then back in office again.', 'But I want you to know that looking back over those years, in victory, the people of California have enjoyed the victory with us. In defeat, they have stood by us, and we are most grateful for that. This year we look forward to a victory, but as we look forward to it, we know that we owe it to thousands, yes, millions of people in this State and across this Nation that we will never get a chance to thank personally.', 'Tonight, as I speak to you here in Ontario, I think you should know that this, of course, not only is the last rally of this campaign that I will speak to, it is the last time I will speak to a rally as a candidate in my whole life, and I want to say to all of you here who worked on this, to all of you who took the time to come, thank you very much for making it probably the best rally that we have ever had.']"
72,Richard Nixon ,"November 05, 1972","['Good afternoon:', ""Next Tuesday, for the 47th time in our Nation's history, Americans will cast their ballots to choose a President for the next 4 years."", 'Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former member of my Cabinet and a gifted observer of the American scene, has made the comment that ""Elections are rarely our finest hours. This,"" he said, ""is when we tend to be most hysterical, most abusive, least thoughtful about problems, and least respectful of complexity.""', 'I think Americans want our democracy to meet a higher standard than that. We all want to make the election of 1972 one of our finest hours, and we have the opportunity to do so.', 'We need to recognize, first, that politics is not merely some kind of game to be played hard and played for keeps, with everyone defending his own interests as best he can. It is not just a competition in which one man or one party seeks to defeat another. It is not an auction in which the prize of office is awarded to the highest bidder for the favor of the voters.', 'Instead, in the highest sense, our democracy is a sacred trust which all of us who participate exercise together on behalf of those who cannot yet participate. One American in three--over 69 million boys and girls, young men and women--will not be old enough to vote on Tuesday, but they will live for the rest of their lives with the consequences of the decision we, the voters, make. Additionally, during the 4 years of the next presidential term, nearly 15 million newborn children will begin their lives in America--in a nation and in a world not of their making, but of our making.', 'I would like to spend a few minutes thinking with you this afternoon about the birthright we ought to guarantee for them. I would like to look beyond the election and focus on the things which I believe all Americans, no matter how they vote on Tuesday, will want their Nation to achieve in the 4 years between now and 1976.', 'The 10 goals in this birthright are not intended to be my campaign promises to you, for they are not something which any one man, by himself, could hope to deliver. To achieve them, all Americans must join hands and work together.', 'So we might think of these goals as campaign promises which America should make to itself, promises to be honored in the next 4 years, no matter who wins in the next 2 days.', ""First, let us give tomorrow's children the birthright of an America at peace in a world at peace--not peace with surrender, but peace with honor--not just an interlude between wars, but a time of lasting friendship and cooperation among all peoples, a time when mankind can unite in a new alliance against our common enemies--poverty, misery, and disease."", ""The recent breakthrough toward a negotiated settlement in Vietnam points to that kind of peace. So does the new relationship which the United States has begun to develop with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. But there is much more to do-the further limitation of nuclear arms, the easing of tensions in Europe, the healing of tragic divisions in the Middle East, the continued strengthening of our alliances, the forging of new trade patterns and the continued development of our volunteer armed forces, which will be the indispensable linchpin of America's peace forces in the years ahead."", 'Peace, more than anything else, can enrich the lives of the children of the seventies. It is for their sake that we have worked so hard to give peace a chance and for their sake we must continue to do so.', 'Some of these new children will be girls, some will be boys. Some will be white, some black, some brown. Will discrimination and quotas limit their horizons? Let us resolve that they will not. As our second goal for the next 4 years, let us seek a more just America--an America in which every human being, regardless of race or religion, age or sex, wealth or national origin, enjoys equal rights before the law and unlimited opportunities for realizing his or her fullest potential.', 'Will the new children enjoy sound health, adequate nourishment, good medical care? Or will they have to contend with the hazards of a society where infant mortality is still higher than in numerous other countries of the world, and where cancer still strikes one American in four sometime during his lifetime?', 'Let us make our third goal a healthy America, where all our people enjoy steadily better health and increasing longevity, where hunger is unknown, and where deadly diseases and drug abuse are rapidly diminishing.', 'Through our plan for a comprehensive health program, our accelerated food assistance programs, our conquest-of-cancer efforts, and our total war against dangerous drugs, your Government today is committed to that kind of America for 1976.', ""Soon tomorrow's children will be ready to start school. Will their parents select the schools they attend? Will tax pressures force them, all of them, into public classrooms regardless of their preferences?"", 'Let us assure each child, as the fourth part of his birthright, the chance to go to school in a well-educated America-in an educational system that calls each of us to excellence in all that we do, that brings the light of learning and the pride of useful skills to all who desire them, that preserves neighborhood schools and educational diversity, and that nurtures a new world renaissance in science, the arts, the humanities.', 'What about the homes in which these children grow up? Will their living standard be high? What about the careers which await them? What about the retirement years at the end of those careers?', ""Point five of the American birthright must be a secure and a prosperous America, where there are jobs for all who can work, a decent income with dignity for those who cannot work; where every dollar earned will buy a dollar's worth; where prudent government spending works for the people, with a fair tax system which does not force the people to work more for the government than they work for themselves."", 'We owe our children something better than steadily rising prices and ever-higher taxes to support welfare handouts. We owe them the kind of solid prosperity America has not had since the Eisenhower years of 1955 and 1956--when we had full employment without inflation and without war. We owe them a reform of the welfare system so that it will not be more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work. We must continue the progress of the last several years and reach those goals.', ""What about the quality of life in the cities and towns where tomorrow's children will live? What about the green earth around them?"", 'Let us make the sixth article of their birthright a livable America--a nation whose urban and rural communities are growing in quality, order, and grace, a nation whose natural environment is restored and protected, with cleaner air and water, more parks and open spaces, wiser use of limited natural resources.', ""The 1970's have been called America's environmental decade. Through the mobilization of citizen concern and the massive support of government at every level, we are meeting that challenge. We are fighting the degradation of man's surroundings everywhere, from the inner city slum to the mountain wilderness, and we are in this fight to win."", ""Our seventh goal for the birthright of tomorrow's children must be an America free from fear, a country where the rule of law is supreme and the rate of crime is declining, where violence is replaced by peaceful change, where civility quiets the angry voices and where decency drives out moral decay. Here, too, we are making good progress, but we must do even better."", ""The last three articles of this birthright as we enter America's third century must deal with the conditions necessary for achieving all the other goals."", ""Our eighth goal must be a free and self-governed America, an America whose unique system of representative government-Federal, State, and local--is a better instrument of the people's will, a better servant of the people's needs, a better protector of the people's liberties in 1976 than at any time since the birth of our country in 1776."", 'To reach this high standard, sweeping reform will be needed, on the scale of a new peaceful American revolution. The sharing of the Federal revenue with our cities and States, which will begin less than 4 weeks from today, marks the first great step in starting the flow of power from Washington back to the people, where it belongs. We must keep the power flowing that way during the years ahead.', 'It was the genius of the people, not the mechanisms of government, that built America. That is why our ninth goal for 1976 must be a pluralist, open America, where government does not dominate, but liberates the individual, opening the way for a new surge of vitality, creative service, and civic responsibility on the part of private enterprise, voluntary institutions, and individual people across this land.', ""The tenth and last part of this American birthright, the most important aspect of all, is our children's right to be born into a great and a good America--a land where people's daily lives are guided by deep moral and spiritual principles, where families are close and strong, where patriotism flourishes without apology, where shared ideals forge unity out of diversity, and where the character of each individual and of the Nation as a whole measures up to the high hopes and the dreams which all mankind invests in America."", 'As your President during these past 4 years, I have visited every one of the 50 States, every region of the country, hundreds of American cities and towns, large and small. I know firsthand that the character of the American people measures up to the hopes of the world.', 'We can be proud that this land of ours is a great and a good country.', 'We can be proud of a democratic system in which the motive is not to grab for the spoils of victory, but to pass along a precious birthright to the generations who will come after us.', 'The choice of policies, of principles, and of candidates in this election is clear-cut and momentous. I think the people understand what is at stake. I have confidence in their ability to make a wise decision. And whatever that decision is on Tuesday, I intend to support our elected leaders as I always have done, I intend to stand up for national unity as I have always done, because America is bigger than any one man or any one party.', 'In the midst of all the commotion of the final weekend before an election, I think it is vitally important to remind ourselves of the great American consensus which will continue to unite us next Wednesday morning, far more powerfully than any vote tallies might seem to divide us.', 'Carl Schurz, a German immigrant, who became a great American statesman, said 100 years ago: ""Ideals are like stars; you will not succeed in touching them with your hands. But like the seafaring man on the desert of waters, you choose them as your guides, and following them you will reach your destiny.""', ""The 10 birthright goals which I have outlined today embrace our Nation's timeless ideals. Let all Americans, of every party and political persuasion, take them as our guides on election day and every day throughout the next 4 years."", ""If we do this, then I believe that this election of 1972 will be remembered as one of America's finest hours, and that the next 4 years will be the 4 best years in America's first two centuries."", 'Thank you and good afternoon.']"

You know that this is a choice which is probably the clearest choice between the candidates for President ever presented to the American people in this century.', 'I would, however, urge you to have in mind tomorrow one overriding issue, and that is the issue of peace--peace in Vietnam and peace in the world at large for a generation to come.', 'As you know, we have made a breakthrough in the negotiations which will lead to peace in Vietnam. We have agreed on the major principles that I laid down in my speech to the Nation of May 8. We have agreed that there will be a cease-fire, we have agreed that our prisoners of war will be returned and that the missing in action will be accounted for, and we have agreed that the people of South Vietnam shall have the right to determine their own future without having a Communist government or a coalition government imposed upon them against their will.', 'There are still some details that I am insisting be worked out and nailed down because I want this not to be a temporary peace. I want, and I know you want, it to be a lasting peace. But I can say to you with complete confidence tonight that we will soon reach agreement on all the issues and bring this long and difficult war to an end.', 'You can help achieve that goal. By your votes, you can send a message to those with whom we are negotiating, and to the leaders of the world, that you back the President of the United States in his insistence that we in the United States seek peace with honor and never peace with surrender.', ""I will not go into the other issues tonight, except to say that as we move to peace, we will open doors to progress on many fronts here at home. It means that we can have something we haven't had since President Eisenhower was President 15 years ago--prosperity without war and without inflation."", 'It means we can have progress toward better education, better health--in all the areas that I have presented to the American people over these past 4 years.', 'It means that we can move toward a goal that every American wants: that is, opportunity for each person in this great and good land to go to the top in whatever particular activity he chooses regardless of his background.', 'Those, then, are the issues you will have in mind.', ""Let me say, finally, I want to thank you for the honor of serving as President for the past 4 years, and, regardless of your decision tomorrow, I can assure you that I shall continue to work for a goal that every American has: Let's make the next 4 years the best 4 years in America's history."", 'Thank you.

74,Richard Nixon ,"November 07, 1972","['Good evening my fellow Americans:', 'Before going over to the Shoreham Hotel to address the victory celebration which is in process there, I wanted to take a moment to say a word to all of you in this very personal way, speaking from the Oval Office.', 'I first want to express my deep appreciation to every one of you, the millions of you who gave me your support in the election today, and I want to express my respect for millions of others who gave their support to Senator McGovern. I know that after a campaign, when one loses, he can feel very, very low, and his supporters as well may feel that way. And when he wins, as you will note when I get over to the Shoreham, people are feeling very much better.', 'The important thing in our process, however, is to play the game, and in the great game of life, and particularly the game of politics, what is important is that on either side more Americans voted this year than ever before, and the fact that you won or you lost must not keep you from keeping in the great game of politics in the years ahead, because the better competition we have between the two parties, between the two men running for office, whatever office that may be, means that we get the better people and the better programs for our country.', ""Now that the election is over, it is time to get on with the great tasks that lie before us. I have tried to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that would not divide our country, not divide it regionally or by parties or in any other way, because I very firmly believe that what unites America today is infinitely more important than those things which divide us. We are united Americans--North, East, West, and South, both parties--in our desire for peace, peace with honor, the kind of a peace that will last, and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal, not just in Vietnam, but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and between the world's most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, and the United States, are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace, true peace for the whole world, that man has ever known."", 'This is a great goal, bigger than whether we are Democrats or Republicans, and it is one that I think you will want to work with me, with all of us, in helping to achieve.', 'There are other goals that go with that--the prosperity without war and without inflation that we have all wanted and that we now can have, and the progress for all Americans, the kind of progress so that we can say to any young American, whatever his background, that he or she in this great country has an equal chance to go to the top in whatever field he or she may choose.', 'I have noted, in listening to the returns a few minutes ago, that several commentators have reflected on the fact that this may be one of the great political victories of all time. In terms of votes that may be true, but in terms of what a victory really is, a huge landslide margin means nothing at all unless it is a victory for America. It will be a victory for America only if, in these next 4 years, we, all of us, can work together to achieve our common great goals of peace at home and peace for all nations in the world, and for that new progress and prosperity which all Americans deserve.', 'I would only hope that in these next 4 years we can so conduct ourselves in this country, and so meet our responsibilities in the world in building peace in the world, that years from now people will look back to the generation of the 1970\'s, at how we have conducted ourselves, and they will say, ""God bless America.""', 'Thank you very much.']"
75,Richard Nixon ,"November 08, 1972","['Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Agnew, all of our very distinguished guests here at the Shoreham Hotel, and the very distinguished audience listening on television and radio:', 'At Ontario, California, on Saturday night, at the conclusion of a speech to what was estimated as a crowd of 50,000, I said, ""This is the last time I will ever be addressing a campaign rally as a candidate."" It may be that that was the last campaign rally as a candidate, but this means tonight we still have a rally right here.', 'Now, let me briefly touch upon several significant things about this election. First--and this for me is rather unusual-I have never known a national election when I would be able to go to bed earlier than tonight.', 'Second, I want to say here to this great audience and to all of those who will be listening on television and radio, that I know from having been a candidate for Vice President, and a Vice President for 8 years, that this is always a team campaigning for office.', 'I want you to know that during the period of the last several weeks since the convention when I have had to be in Washington, for reasons that all of you could well understand, that I watched the Vice President as he carried the major burden of campaigning.', 'I watched with no concern, and considerable amusement, the attempts that were being made by some rather vicious heckling to get under his skin and get him to blow his cool. Let me say, the real test of a campaigner is to go through the fire of a campaign when he is taking all the heat. The Vice President has proved he is a great campaigner. I was going to say he can take it and be can dish it out, too.', 'I also would like to pay tribute to all of the other members of the team. I refer of course to our campaign chairman, Clark MacGregor, to John Mitchell, his predecessor, to Maurice Stans, our finance chairman, to all of the members of the Cabinet team who did such a magnificent job traveling through this country, to Representatives from the Congress, the House, the Senate, and the national Administration, who carried the story that we wanted to tell throughout the land. They were a great team.', 'I think they have been a great team over the past 4 years, and in this campaign, when you add up those States to what has been called a rather significant victory, they get a great deal of the credit, I can assure you.', 'I also want to pay tribute to another group that too often is overlooked. I wrote a book after the election defeat of 1960, and one of the chapters of that book dealt with the campaign of 1960. When you write a book, you are supposed to dedicate it to somebody, and, not being an expert at this sort of thing, I just put on the flyleaf of the dedication page in this book about the campaign of 1960--I dedicated it, ""To Pat. She also ran.""', 'I want all of you to know tonight how very grateful we should be to the wives of our Cabinet members, to the distaff members, as sometimes--I guess, we can still call them that in these days when you have to be very careful about how you describe people--but in any event, at least shall we say to our First Ladies, and they are always our First Ladies in our own families. I am simply very, very proud of all of them.', 'I can summarize how I feel about all of our campaign in this way: Our speakers throughout campaigned hard. Our speakers throughout campaigned clean. They campaigned on the issues. I am proud of the campaign they have put on, and it showed in the results.', 'Something else was new in this campaign. All of us know, of course, about those young voters. I recall at the convention that we were told by some of the enthusiasts there at our convention that the predictions were wrong that because of the overwhelming youth vote that was going to go against us that we had a very, very hard row to hoe if we were to win this election.', 'Let me say, based on the results I have seen today, we have accomplished what was thought to be the impossible. We not only won a majority of the votes of America, but we won a majority of the votes of young Americans.', 'All of you should know that one who stands in this position with 4 years ahead must think of what he wants for those 4 years. We want, of course, many things. We want to do the very best job we can for all the country, for all people in our society. We want to have in mind, too, the fact that in this election it was very unusual in another respect. It was not region against region. It was not one age group against another age group. It was not party against party. I think we can be proud of the fact that as we look at our majority, which is a very large majority, it comes from all of America.', 'Let us remember that in these next 4 years we are not going to work for one group against another. We are dedicated to work for all Americans to make this a greater country.', 'To those millions of Democrats and independents who supported us as well as, of course, to the Republicans who supported us in overwhelming numbers, they have, you have, our deep appreciation. To all those who worked so hard-our appreciation. I will never be able to thank all of you personally, not even get all the letters out that I would like. But I know what you did and I know how much you contributed.', 'I would simply like to leave one final thought with you, perhaps in a personal sense. No one knows before the votes are counted how it is going to come out. No one really would have predicted after our convention that we were going to win this kind of a victory. Now, at the present time I noticed some of the commentators are referring to the fact that it may be the greatest victory in American political history. Let me tell you, I have two reactions to that. Of course, it is great on election night to think that we have won a victory, but this will be a great victory depending upon what we do with it. In other words, we win elections not simply for the purpose of beating the other party or the other person, but to get the opportunity to do good things for our country. The next 4 years will be the time that we will try to make ourselves worthy of this victory.', 'I will simply say in that connection, it was a great victory but the greater the victory, the greater the responsibility, the greater the opportunity. We are going to try to meet it, dedicating ourselves to those great goals that I have discussed at such great length throughout this campaign and will in the next 4 years--building that world of peace, of real peace with honor throughout the world, and building at home, not only peace at home but the new prosperity and the progress for all Americans that is so close to our hearts.', 'Finally, on that personal note, about 30 days ago, when I was sitting in the Lincoln Sitting Room late at night trying to get some materials ready for a National Security Council meeting the next morning, Tricia dropped into the room around 10:30 or 11:00. She was going out to dedicate a dam or something at a nonpolitical affair. She was trying to get some suggestions about remarks. I find that whenever I make suggestions of remarks to Tricia or Julie or Eddie Cox they always can do better without any suggestions, but I made a couple. Then, before she left the room, she turned and said, ""You know, Daddy, did you ever stop to think that this is your last campaign?"" I said, ""Yes, I have.""', 'As I think of what she said that night, I simply want to say from the bottom of my heart, thanks for making our last campaign the very best one of all.Thank you.']"
