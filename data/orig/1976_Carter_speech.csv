0,Jimmy Carter ,"February 09, 1973","['I will talk to you today strictly from the viewpoint of a governor who has seen state governments become stronger and more effective, but at the same time become hamstrung by recent developments in Washington.', 'We all serve the same people. In my Inaugural Address, I said that the public can best be served by a strong and independent executive working with a strong and independent legislature.', 'In Georgia and most other states, this is proving to be true. In Washington, this basic premise is being abandoned.', 'Since 1970, when new governors were being elected in Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, a constant stream of newsmen have been through Atlanta to ask about the New South.', 'I don\'t think there is any such thing as a New South, but there is definitely a ""new freedom.""', 'Let me tell you what I mean. I ran for governor for years. I made 1,800 speeches which I wrote myself, and contacted in person more than 600,000 Georgians.', ""I stood in factory shift lines at 5 o'clock in the morning and at midnight, and shook hands with customers in shopping centers and country stores."", 'Just a few years ago, this would not have been necessary.', ""A quiet and satisfactory backroom conversation with a judge or sheriff or banker or perhaps an editor could insure the delivery of the county's votes."", 'Then came the civil rights demonstrators and the students who showed the other citizens that a small voice could be heard and an injustice could be corrected by people who cared enough to express their concern.', 'The farmer, the filling station owner, and the taxicab driver may not have agreed with the goals or the tactics of these early movements, but he learned that they could produce results and he began to ask himself, ""If they can do it, why can\'t I?""', 'Many Americans began to realize that powerful intermediaries between themselves and their public officials were neither necessary nor desirable. The voters attained an influence and a freedom which they had never had before.', 'This new freedom to speak out and to participate among average citizens has brought about a realization that few of the business or government leaders who make the decisions have ever felt personally the direct impact of government programs involving such things as prisons, welfare lines, employment agencies, manpower training, venereal disease control, school busing, or public housing.', ""It is well known that during the 1950's, many state governments deliberately abrogated their power rather than face up to the difficult decisions involving civil rights and other social problems."", 'Many governors then were handpicked and controlled by powerful special interests. Dynamic leadership had to come from Washington.', 'But I tell you that this is no longer the case. In state after state, there has been a demonstrated willingness, even an eagerness, to deal with tough problems.', 'We realize that to the states are reserved those constitutional powers not expressly granted to the federal authority in interpreting this principle.', 'However, the principle becomes significant with development of new problems or issues at the local level of government.', 'For instance, a question about environment, insurance, education, or land use planning first arises within a state and for a time may be of interest only in that particular community.', 'A dynamic and creative state government will move to solve the problem, will enact laws to deal with it, and then, through its experience, begin to establish a pattern of solution for possible nationwide emulation.', 'State government, properly used, can be a powerful force for solving problems and for strengthening our systems of federalism.', 'Like many other states, we have taken advantage of these changing attitudes in Georgia.', 'For instance, more than 50,000 citizens participated in evolving a definite set of goals for Georgia which prescribed optimum purposes of our state government for the next few years.', 'These goals are now being put into effect by me and the general assembly, in an orderly and almost inexorable manner.', ""Both the state government and the courts have liberalized eligibility for welfare payments, but with a strong emphasis on training and employment opportunity, we have leveled off the number of Georgians on our welfare rolls. Our last month's data show the first actual numerical reduction in many years."", 'After a full year of study, conferences, debates, and public forums, we eliminated 300 agencies in our government and substituted for them 22 well-coordinated departments. We were able to overcome inevitable and substantial opposition with massive public involvement.', 'We have also completely implemented for 2 years, what I believe to be the best budgeting system in the nation. Known as zero-base budgeting, the process divides state government into more than 11,000 individual functions. Each one is analyzed on a one sheet form by the person directly responsible for that function. He must analyze his responsibility, list the tangible achievements which measure his effectiveness and then describe how he would perform this job next fiscal year, at several levels of funding, beginning with 85 percent of his present budget. Old programs and new proposals are considered on the same basis.', 'Each department head then arranges these functions in order of priority. I approve the arrangement after consultation with the department head and then budget funds, as available, to each department.', 'This budget, with associated data, is presented to the general assembly for final approval.', 'It is perhaps the only practical means of controlling a bureaucracy.', 'Although I am sure all governors are making similar efforts, we are still dependent for successful public service on a viable state-federal relationship.', 'Programs and responsibilities are interrelated and supportive. We need to understand and seek a common national purpose.', 'Our state budgets are dependent on federal appropriations.', 'Even the balance of trade deficit has a direct adverse effect on the economy of individual states. The average or nationwide effect is bad enough, but the localized impact, when a particular kind of product is involved, can be even more serious. We governors have begun to protect ourselves and our business communities by direct action in the field of foreign trade. This past year, I visited five foreign nations and had trade representatives of more than twice that number as my guests in Georgia. In May, I shall be in five countries of Europe and the Middle East.', 'It is imperative that state and federal governments work together on other critical matters such as health care, land use planning, law enforcement, and energy supplies. We have little cooperation in these fields now. Our system of federalism was conceived to make such cooperation possible, and we have a responsibility to make the system work.', 'In summary, many state governments are now much more dynamic and competent than before, but our system of federalism is no stronger because there has been a steady deterioration in the effectiveness of government here in Washington, and also in the relationship between the state and federal governments.', 'When I became governor in 1971, I remembered the recent words of the President, and I quote: ""I would disperse power instead of taking all power to myself, I would select Cabinet members who could do their jobs and each of them would have the stature and the power to function effectively. Publicity would not center at the White House alone. Your most creative people cannot develop in a monolithic, centralized, power setup.""', 'Since we are particularly interested in such things as environment and social programs, I began to study the attitudes of those independent and creative officials who had the stature to insure a lasting influence—men like Walter Hickel and Pat Moynihan.', ""We then established a tracking system for federal legislation and provided a continuing analysis from the state's viewpoint to our senators and congressmen. After the vetoes were overriden, we planned our state programs and budgets accordingly. At that time, I had not heard of impoundment"", 'We applauded with anticipation the highly publicized concept of a new federalism—getting the decision making process closer to the people—and we are now beginning our fifth year of anticipatory applause.', 'Nowadays we seem to have federal government by crisis and surprise. Decisions are made in secrecy and consultations are few.', 'Our contacts as state officials are mostly with the Congress and sometimes with a Cabinet officer.', ""Final decisions, however, are made by the Ehrlichman's the Haldeman's and the Ash's. I don't know them and I have no access to them. Neither, unfortunately, do most of our congressmen."", ""In spite of a balanced budget and a dynamic economy, our state funds are limited. Revenue sharing has been a cruel hoax. Our state's $36 million in revenue sharing, per year, was offset by $57 million in lost funds when the Title IV-A and Title 16 sections of the Social Security law were first amended—and now they are even further drastically reduced."", ""The President's proposed new budget will cut Georgia payments on programs at least $174 million more. Impoundment of appropriated funds has already debilitated our efforts to plan and construct interstate highways, to provide compensatory education to the poor, and to finance municipal sewerage systems."", 'Many of these government efforts are inherently dependent on federal funding. You must remember that when the gross national product goes up 100 percent, local income, which is based primarily on property tax, only rises 70 percent. State revenues increase about 95 percent and the progressive federal taxes go up 130 percent. Consequently, abrupt changes in national program funding can be devastating to a state.', 'I consider myself a fiscal conservative. To me, the essence of that conservatism is an orderly, logical, and planned approach to problems and to the allocation of public funds.', 'The responsible, predictable, businesslike approach to federal legislation, appropriations, and budgeting simply does not exist. This is creating havoc in all states, but particularly in those whose legislatures meet briefly or sometimes every other year.', 'I prepare budget projections 5 years in the future. Of our $$2 1/2 billion 1974 budget, about three-quarters of a billion dollars are federal funds.', 'How do you encourage local and state officials as well as private citizens and groups to develop long-range plans and well researched priorities based on federal law when all their work may be shot to pieces by a sudden and apparently capricious decision in Washington?', 'What encouragement is there to try to make a program run right in Waycross, Georgia, when it may be wiped out because a similar effort was mismanaged somewhere in California?', 'I represent and speak for almost 5 million people who are harmed by these developments.', 'To the dairy farmer, expecting emergency farm loans to replace cows which were ruined by a lack of electricity for milking during a 5-day ice storm, it\'s not enough to say, ""Ask what you can do for yourself.""', 'To the mentally afflicted child who had just begun to enjoy his first chance for treatment and training in a community treatment center, which is now closed, it is not enough to say, ""Ask what you can do for yourself.""', 'To the mother of dependent children, holding her first job in 8 years through the emergency employment program, who will now return to the welfare rolls, it is not enough to say, ""Ask what you can do for yourself.""', 'To the homeowners, the contractors, the construction workers, and the merchants who would have benefitted in the next 18 months from almost $300 million worth of new housing in Georgia, which now will not be built, it is not enough to say, ""Ask what you can do for yourself.""', 'We, in Georgia, are willing to do our share, but the state-federal partnerships are being dissolved.', 'I cannot understand what are our common national goals. They should be defined with maximum input from the Congress, from private citizens, and local and state governments.', 'What will happen now that we have finally accepted the status quo in Vietnam?', 'I cannot understand how or why the Congress has lost control of the budgetary process and virtually legalized it with the debt ceiling bill.', 'In order to protect our people, unauthorized impoundment of funds should be stopped, and the Congress should demand the immediate return of its constitutional powers. Post-impoundment notification of Congress will not help.', 'It seems to me that a zero-base budgeting system should be implemented by the Executive Branch of government and that a maximum spending limit adopted by both Houses of Congress could provide clear and firm restraints on total congressional appropriations. Such action would insure a continuing and understandable determination of national financing priorities.', 'Intimidation of the press should cease, and the veil of secrecy should be removed from government so special interests will not maintain exclusive access behind the closed doors.', 'We have a sunshine law in Georgia. There is a Freedom of Information Act at the federal level. There is room for legislative action to improve the impact of both, but there is no legislative remedy for the attitude that the people are too ignorant or too unsophisticated to be told what is really happening.', 'Budget cuts can be reinstated, vetoes can be overridden, and policies can eventually be changed, but there is no way to rectify the damage that results from governmental contempt of the people. I hope that you, who are charged with letting the people know what is being done to them, will conduct a holy war to expose and eliminate that attitude of contempt wherever it exists.', 'The sunshine law is working in Georgia. The deliberations of our legislature and its committees are filmed each day by educational television and broadcast nightly throughout the state.', 'If other news media and the Public Broadcasting System could record the deliberations of the national Congress and make frequent and comprehensive reports to the nation, public confidence might be restored and an effective forum would be guaranteed to the Legislative Branch of government. Last year, the House Appropriations Committee, here in Washington, opened to the public only 33 of its 399 meetings. Do you think the lobbyists got a full report? As a governor, I would like to have the same information.', 'It would help us if congressional committee staffs could be enlarged and professional staff members could spend more time with appropriate state agencies as major legislation is being considered.', 'I have been gratified by the cooperation and communication that has been established between our state government and the members of the Georgia congressional delegation—of both parties.', 'But if the unhealthy shift of power toward the federal executive with its attendant problems is to be reversed, all governors and Members of Congress are going to have to realize that we are in the same leaky boat.', 'Both Congress and the governors have been partially responsible for allowing the shift to take place. Only by concerted, common effort can it be reversed.', 'Well, with all of these concerns, one might ask about election mandates which allegedly gave prior blanket approval to recent administration attitudes.', 'The mood of the people, in my opinion, is one of basic conservatism. But one has to be careful about the definition of the word.', 'Conservatism does not mean racism. It does not mean stubborn resistance to change. It does not mean callousness or unconcern about our fellow human beings.', 'I think it means a higher valuation of the human being, of individuality, self-reliance, dignity, personal freedom; but I also think it means increased personal responsibility through governmental action for alleviating affliction, discrimination, and injustice.', 'Reinhold Neibuhr said that the purpose of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.', 'As more of our citizens choose to exercise their existing new freedom and as the conglomerate and more unselfish will of the people is felt on government, I predict that we shall see an emergence of what might be called benevolent conservatism. There are many conservative people who care.', 'They want government to play a more dynamic role in insuring that each person can overcome affliction and realize his full potential and achieve maximum personal freedom.', 'They perhaps agree with the ancient Chinese philosopher Kuang Hsu, who said, ""You give a man a fish, he has one meal; if you teach him how to fish, he can feed himself for life.""', 'This is a time for benevolent conservatism.', 'I may be wrong, but I hope and believe that this is true.']"
1,Jimmy Carter ,"May 04, 1974","['Senator Kennedy, distinguished fellow Georgians, friends of the Law School of Georgia, and personal friends of mine:', ""Sometimes even a distinguished jurist on the Supreme Court doesn't know all of the background on acceptances of invitations. As a matter of fact, my wife was influential in this particular acceptance, but my son was even more influential. This was really an acceptance to repair my ego. There was established in 1969 the L.Q.C. Lamar Society. I was involved in the establishment of it, and I think a lot of it. As Governor of Georgia, I was invited this year, along with two distinguished Americans, to make a speech at the annual meeting which is going on now."", 'I found out when the program was prepared that Senator Kennedy was to speak last night They charged $10 to attend the occasion. Senator William Brock from Tennessee is speaking to the Lamar Society at noon today. I found out they charged $7.50 for this occasion. I spoke yesterday at noon, and I asked the Lamar Society officials, at the last moment, how much they were charging to come to the luncheon yesterday. They said they weren\'t charging anything. I said, ""You mean they don\'t even have to pay for the lunch?"" They said, ""No, we\'re providing the lunch free.""', 'So, when my son Jack came and said, ""Daddy, I think more of you than you thought I did; I\'m paying $7 for two tickets to the luncheon,"" I figured that a $3.50 lunch ticket would salvage part of my ego and that\'s really why I\'m here today.', ""I'm not qualified to talk to you about law, because in addition to being a peanut farmer, I'm an engineer and a nuclear physicist, not a lawyer. I was planning, really, to talk to you more today about politics and the interrelationship of political affairs and law, than about what I'm actually going to speak on. But after Senator Kennedy's delightful and very fine response to political questions during his speech, and after his analysis of the Watergate problems, I stopped at a room on the way, while he had his press conference, and I changed my speech notes."", 'My own interest in the criminal justice system is very deep and heartfelt. Not having studied law, I\'ve had to learn the hard way. I read a lot and listen a lot. One of the sources for my understanding about the proper application of criminal justice and the system of equity is from reading Reinhold Niebuhr, one of his books that Bill Gunter gave me quite a number of years ago. The other source of my understanding about what\'s right and wrong in this society is from a friend of mine, a poet named Bob Dylan. After listening to his records about ""The Ballad of Hattie Carol"" and ""Like a Rolling Stone"" and ""The Times, They Are a-Changing,"" I\'ve learned to appreciate the dynamism of change in a modem society.', 'I grew up as a landowner\'s son. But I don\'t think I ever realized the proper interrelationship between the landowner and those who worked on. a farm until I heard Dylan\'s record, ""I Ain\'t Gonna Work on Maggie\'s Farm No More."" So I come here speaking to you today about your subject with a base for my information founded on Reinhold Niebuhr and Bob Dylan.', ""One of the things that Niebuhr says is that the sad duty of the political system is to establish justice in a sinful world. He goes on to say that there's no way to establish or maintain justice without law; that the laws are constantly changing to stabilize the social equilibrium of the forces and counterforces of a dynamic society, and that the law in its totality is an expression of the structure of government."", ""Well, as a farmer who has now been in office for 3 years, I've seen firsthand the inadequacy of my own comprehension of what government ought to do for its people. I've had a constant learning process, sometimes from lawyers, sometimes from practical experience, sometimes from failures and mistakes that have been pointed out to me after they were made."", 'I had lunch this week with the members of the Judicial Selection committee, and they were talking about a consent search warrant. I said I didn\'t know what a consent search warrant was. They said, ""Well, that\'s when two policemen go to a house. One of them goes to the front door and knocks on it, and the other one runs around to the back door and yells \'come in\'."" I have to admit that as governor, quite often I search for ways to bring about my own hopes; not quite so stringently testing the law as that, but with a similar motivation.', ""I would like to talk to you for a few moments about some of the practical aspects of being a governor who is still deeply concerned about the inadequacies of a system of which it is obvious that you're so patently proud."", ""I have refrained completely from making any judicial appointments on the basis of political support or other factors, and have chosen, in every instance, Superior Court judges, quite often state judges, Appellate Court judges, on the basis of merit analysis by a highly competent, open, qualified group of distinguished Georgians. I'm proud of this."", ""We've now established in the Georgia Constitution a qualifications commission, which for the first time can hear complaints from average citizens about the performance in office of judges and can investigate those complaints and with the status and the force of die Georgia Constitution behind them can remove a judge from office or take other corrective steps."", ""We've now passed a constitutional amendment, which is waiting for the citizenry to approve that establishes a uniform Criminal Justice Court system in this state so that the affairs of the judiciary can be more orderly structured, so that workloads can be balanced and so that over a period of time there might be an additional factor of equity, which quite often does not exist now because of the wide disparity among the different courts of Georgia."", ""We passed this year a judge sentencing bill for non-capital cases with a review procedure. I've had presented to me, by members of the Pardons and Paroles Board, an analysis of some of the sentences given to people by the Superior Court judges of this state, which grieved me deeply and shocked me as a layman. I believe that over a period of time, the fact that a group of other judges can review and comment on the sentences meted out in the different portions of Georgia will bring some more equity to the system."", 'We have finally eliminated the unsworn statement law in Georgia—the last state to do it.', ""This year, we analyzed in depth the structure of the drug penalties in this state. I believe in the future there will be a clear understanding of the seriousness of different crimes relating to drugs. We've finally been able to get through the legislature a law that removes alcoholism or drunkenness as a criminal offense. When this law goes into effect next year, I think it will create a new sense of compassion and concern and justice for the roughly 150,000 alcoholics in Georgia, many of whom escape the consequences of what has been a crime because of some social or economic prominence, and will remove a very heavy load from the criminal justice system."", ""In our prisons, which in the past have been a disgrace to Georgia, we've tried to make substantive changes in the quality of those who administer them and to put a new realm of understanding and hope and compassion into the administration of that portion of the system of justice. Ninety-five percent of those who are presently incarcerated in prisons will be returned to be our neighbors. And now the thrust of the entire program, as initiated under Ellis MacDougall and now continued under Dr. Ault, is to try to discern in the soul of each convicted and sentenced person redeeming features that can be enhanced. We plan a career for that person to be pursued while he is in prison. I believe that the early data that we have on recidivism rates indicates the efficacy of what we've done."", 'The GBI, which was formerly a matter of great concern to all those who were interested in law enforcement, has now been substantially changed— for the better. I would put it up now in quality against the FBI, the Secret Service, or any other crime control organization in this nation.', 'Well, does that mean that everything is all right?', ""It doesn't to me."", ""I don't exactly know how to say this, but I was thinking just a few moments ago about some of the things that are of deep concern to me as governor. As a scientist, I was working constantly, along with almost everyone who professes that dedication of life, to probe, probe every day of my life for constant changes for the better. It's completely anachronistic in the makeup of a nuclear physicist or an engineer or scientist to be satisfied with what we've got, or to rest on the laurels of past accomplishments. It's the nature of the profession."", ""As a farmer, the same motivation persists. Every farmer that I know of, who is worth his salt or who's just average, is ahead of the experiment stations and the research agronomist in finding better ways, changing ways to plant, cultivate, utilize herbicides, gather, cure, sell farm products. The competition for innovation is tremendous, equivalent to the realm of nuclear physics even."", ""In my opinion, it's different in the case of lawyers. And maybe this is a circumstance that is so inherently true that it can't be changed."", ""I'm a Sunday school teacher, and I've always known that the structure of law is founded on the Christian ethic that you shall love the Lord your God and your neighbor as yourself—a very high and perfect standard. We all know the fallibility of man, and the contentions in society, as described by Reinhold Niebuhr and many others, don't permit us to achieve perfection. We do strive for equality, but not with a fervent and daily commitment. In general, the powerful and the influential in our society shape the laws and have a great influence on the legislature or the Congress. This creates a reluctance to change because the powerful and the influential have carved out for themselves or have inherited a privileged position in society, of wealth or social prominence or higher education or opportunity for the future. Quite often, those circumstances are circumvented at a very early age because college students, particularly undergraduates, don't have any commitment to the preservation of the way things are. But later, as their interrelationship with the present circumstances grows, they also become committed to approaching change very, very slowly and very, very cautiously, and there's a commitment to the status quo."", ""I remember when I was a child, I lived on a farm about 3 miles from Plains, and we didn't have electricity or running water. We lived on the railroad—Seaboard Coastline Railroad. Like all farm boys, I had a flip, a slingshot. They had stabilized the railroad bed with little white round rocks, which I used for ammunition. I would go out frequently to the railroad and gather the most perfectly shaped rocks of proper size. I always had a few in my pockets, and I had others cached away around the farm, so that they would be convenient if I ran out of my pocket supply."", 'One day I was leaving the railroad track with my pockets full of rocks and hands full of rocks, and my mother came out on the front porch—this is not a very interesting story but it illustrates a point—and she had in her hands a plate full of cookies that she had just baked for me. She called me—I am sure with love in her heart—and said, ""Jimmy, I\'ve baked some cookies for you."" I remember very distinctly walking up to her and standing there for 15 or 20 seconds, in honest doubt about whether I should drop those rocks which were worthless and take the cookies that my mother had prepared for me, which between her and me were very valuable.', ""Quite often, we have the same inclination in our everyday lives. We don't recognize that change can sometimes be very beneficial, although we fear it. Anyone who lives in the South looks back on the last 15 to 20 years with some degree of embarrassment, including myself. To think about going back to a county unit system, which deliberately cheated for generations certain white voters of this state, is almost inconceivable. To revert back or to forego the one man, one vote principle, we would now consider to be a horrible violation of the basic principles of justice and equality and fairness and equity."", 'The first speech I ever made in the Georgia Senate, representing the most conservative district in Georgia, was concerning the abolition of 30 questions that we had so proudly evolved as a subterfuge to keep black citizens from voting and which we used with a great deal of smirking and pride for decades or generations ever since the War Between the States—questions that nobody could answer in this room, but which were applied to every black citizen that came to the Sumter County Courthouse or Webster County Courthouse and said, ""I want to vote."" I spoke in that chamber, fearful of the news media reporting it back home, but overwhelmed with a commitment to the abolition of that artificial barrier to the rights of an American citizen. I remember the thing that I used in my speech, that a black pencil salesman on the outer door of the Sumter County Courthouse could make a better judgment about who ought to be sheriff than two highly educated professors at Georgia Southwestern College.', ""Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was perhaps despised by many in this room because he shook up our social structure that benefited us, and demanded simply that black citizens be treated the same as white citizens, wasn't greeted with approbation and accolades by the Georgia Bar Association or die Alabama Bar Association. He was greeted with horror. Still, once that change was made, a very simple but difficult change, no one in his right mind would want to go back to circumstances prior to that juncture in the development of our nation's society."", ""I don't want to go on and on; I'm part of it. But the point I want to make to you is that we still have a long way to go. In every age or every year, we have a tendency to believe that we've come so far now, that there's no way to improve the present system. I'm sure when the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk, they felt that was the ultimate in transportation. When the first atomic bomb was exploded, that was the ultimate development in nuclear physics, and so forth."", 'Well, we haven\'t reached the ultimate. But who\'s going to search the heart and soul of an organization like yours or a law school or state or nation and say, ""What can we still do to restore equity and justice or to preserve it or to enhance it in this society?""', ""You know, I'm not afraid to make the change. I don't have anything to lose. But, as a farmer, I'm not qualified to assess the characteristics of the 9,100 inmates in the Georgia prisons, 50 percent of whom ought not to be there. They ought to be on probation or under some other supervision and assess what the results of previous court rulings might bring to bear on their lives."", 'I was in the governor\'s mansion for 2 years, enjoying the services of a very fine cook, who was a prisoner—a woman. One day she came to me, after she got over her 2 years of timidity, and said, ""Governor, I would like to borrow $250 from you.""', 'I said, ""I\'m not sure that a lawyer would be worth that much.""', 'She said, ""I don\'t want to hire a lawyer, I want to pay the judge.""', ""I thought it was a ridiculous statement for her; I felt that she was ignorant. But I found out she wasn't. She had been sentenced by a superior court judge in the state, who still serves, to 7 years or $750. She had raised, early in her prison career, $500. I didn't lend her the money, but I had Bill Harper, my legal aide, look into it. He found the circumstances were true. She was quickly released under a recent court ruling that had come down in the last few years."", 'I was down on the coast this weekend. I was approached by a woman who asked me to come by her home. I went by, and she showed me documents that indicated that her illiterate mother, who had a son in jail, had gone to the County Surveyor in that region and had borrowed $225 to get her son out of jail. She had a letter from the Justice of the Peace that showed that her mother had made a mark on a blank sheet of paper. They paid off the $225, and she has the receipts to show it. Then they started a 5-year program trying to get back the paper she signed, without success. They went to court The lawyer that had originally advised her to sign the paper showed up as the attorney for the surveyor. She had put up 50 acres of land near the county seat as security. When she got to court she found instead of signing a security deed, that she had signed a warranty deed. That case has already been appealed to the Supreme Court, and she lost', ""Well, I know that the technicalities of the law that would permit that are probably justifiable. She didn't have a good lawyer. My heart feels and cries out that something ought to be analyzed, not just about the structure of government, judicial qualification councils and judicial appointment committees and eliminating the unsworn statement—those things are important But they don't reach the crux of the point—that now we assign punishment to fit the criminal and not the crime."", ""You can go in the prisons of Georgia, and I don't know, it may be that poor people are the only ones who commit crimes, but I do know they are the only ones who serve prison sentences. When Ellis MacDougall first went to Reidsville, he found people that had been in solitary confinement for 10 years. We now have 500 misdemeanants in the Georgia prison system."", ""Well, I don't know the theory of law, but there is one other point I want to make, just for your own consideration. I think we've made great progress in the Pardons and Paroles Board since I've been m office and since we've reorganized the government. We have five very enlightened people there now. And on occasion they go out to the prison system to interview the inmates, to decide whether or not they are worthy to be released after they serve one-third of their sentence. I think most jurors and most judges feel that, when they give the sentence, they know that after a third of the sentence has gone by, they will be eligible for careful consideration. Just think for a moment about your own son or your own father or your own daughter being in prison, having served 7 years of a lifetime term and being considered for a release. Don't you think that they ought to be examined and that the Pardons and Parole Board ought to look them in the eye and ask them a question and, if they are turned down, ought to give them some substantive reason why they are not released and what they can do to correct their defect?"", 'I do.', ""I think it's just as important at their time for consideration of early release as it is even when they are sentenced. But, I don't know how to bring about that change."", ""We had an ethics bill in the state legislature this year. Half of it passed— to require an accounting for contributions during a campaign—but the part that applied to people after the campaign failed. We couldn't get through a requirement for revelation of payments or gifts to officeholders after they are in office."", 'The largest force against that ethics bill was the lawyers.', 'Some of you here tried to help get a consumer protection package passed without success.', ""The regulatory agencies in Washington are made up, not of people to regulate industries, but of representatives of the industries that are regulated. Is that fair and right and equitable? I don't think so."", ""I'm only going to serve 4 years as governor, as you know. I think that's enough. I enjoy it, but I think I've done all I can in the governor's office. I see the lobbyists in the state capitol filling the halls on occasions. Good people, competent people, the most pleasant, personable, extroverted citizens of Georgia. Those are the characteristics that are required for a lobbyist. They represent good folks. But I tell you that when a lobbyist goes to represent the Peanut Warehousemen's Association of the Southeast, which I belong to, which I helped to organize, they go there to represent the peanut warehouseman.

She forced me pretty much to read, read, read, classical books. She would give me a gold star when I read 10 and a silver star when I read 5.', 'One day, she called me in and she said, ""Jimmy, I think it\'s time for you to read \'War and Peace.\' "" I was completely relieved because I thought it was a book about cowboys and Indians.', ""Well, I went to the library and checked it out, and it was 1,415 pages thick, I think, written by Tolstoy, as you know, about Napoleon's entry into Russia in the 1812-15 era. He had never been defeated, and he was sure he could win, but he underestimated the severity of the Russian winter and the peasants' love for their land."", 'To make a long story short, the next spring he retreated in defeat The course of history was changed; it probably affected our own lives.', ""The point of the book is, and what Tolstoy points out in the epilogue is, that he didn't write the book about Napoleon or the Czar of Russia or even the generals, except in a rare occasion. He wrote it about the students and the housewives and the barbers and the farmers and the privates in the army. And the point of the book is that the course of human events, even the greatest historical events, are not determined by the leaders of a nation or a state, like Presidents or governors or senators. They are controlled by the combined wisdom and courage and commitment and discernment and unselfishness and compassion and love and idealism of the common ordinary people. If that was true in the case of Russia where they had a czar or France where they had an emperor, how much more true is it in our own case where the Constitution charges us with a direct responsibility for determining what our government is and ought to be?"", 'Well, I\'ve read parts of the embarrassing transcripts, and I\'ve seen the proud statement of a former attorney general, who protected his boss, and now brags on the fact that he tiptoed through a mine field and came out ""clean.""

I believe that everyone in this room who is in a position of responsibility as a preserver of the law in its purest form ought to remember the oath that Thomas Jefferson and others took when they practically signed their own death warrant, writing the Declaration of Independence—to preserve justice and equity and freedom and fairness, they pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor.', 'Thank you very much.']"
2,Jimmy Carter ,"June 02, 1974","['[See footnote regarding the date of this speech.]', '""Planning a Budget From Zero""', ""On the campaign trail, a lot of promises are made by candidates for public office to improve economy and efficiency in government if they are elected. This pledge has a natural appeal to the financially overburdened taxpayer. But when the winning candidates take office, they too often find that it's easier to talk about economy and efficiency in government than to accomplish it. Entrenched bureaucracy is hard to move from its existing patterns."", 'Taxpayers, on the other hand, hear the promises but see few results. It seems to them that for every new program in government there must be a tax increase. Each government—whether federal, state or local—seems to have an insatiable financial need. No matter how much money is collected, it never seems to be enough.', 'When I campaigned for governor, I promised that if elected there would be no general statewide tax increase during my 4 year term in office. At the same time, I outlined a platform of 8 general goals and 97 specific objectives that I wanted to accomplish. The twin promises, in my estimation, were not incompatible. I felt that this administration could reverse the past pattern of ignoring campaign promises.', ""Immediately upon election, I began planning a program to keep my commitments. I knew that simple appeals for greater productivity in government were not the answer. Economy and efficiency must come from basic, subtle changes that slice across the complete spectrum of a government's activity. The two areas that seemed to offer greatest possibilities of success were budgeting and planning. Through tight budgeting, more services can be squeezed out of every tax dollar spent. Through planning, the groundwork can be laid for implementing new programs and expanding existing ones in ways that will avoid possible pitfalls and launch the programs directly toward their goals from the beginning."", 'As a citizen interested in government and as a former legislator, I had long believed that too many governmental programs are botched because they are started in haste without adequate planning or establishment of goals. Too often, they never really attack the targeted problems.', ""The services provided by Georgia's state government are now greatly improved, and every tax dollar is being stretched further than ever before. There has not been a general statewide tax increase during my term. In fact, there has been a substantial reduction in ad valorem tax. Neither will a tax increase be necessary when my successor takes office next year."", 'In budgeting, we initiated a new concept called zero-base budgeting to help us monitor state problems better and attain increased efficiency. In the area of planning, we merged the roles of planning and budgeting—which had previously operated completely independent of each other—so that they could work together in promoting more economy in government. At the same time, we clearly defined the various roles of planning and assigned the proper roles to the appropriate organizational unit.', ""The functions of planning and budgeting were merged in a broad reorganization program that completely streamlined the executive branch of Georgia's state government. Much of our success during the past 3 years in improving state programs is a direct result of reorganization."", 'We reduced the number of state agencies from about 300 to 22 major operating agencies and combined functions to eliminate duplication and overlapping of services. For instance, 33 agencies were combined to form the Department of Natural Resources. Reorganization is a separate story of government in action. My interest now is to stress how we changed our budgeting and planning procedures to help accomplish the previously stated goals.', 'Georgia was the first government to implement a program of zero-base budgeting. Under this novel concept, every dollar requested for expenditure during the next budget period must be justified, including current expenditures that are to continue. It also provides for examining the effectiveness of each activity at various funding levels. This is a dramatically different concept from that followed by most governments, which concentrate almost totally on proposed new expenditures when considering a new budget. Except for nonrecurring programs or expenditures, the continuing expenditures in a current budget get little attention.', ""Take as an example a government with a budget of $1 billion. Projections are that the new budget will grow by $50 million during the next budget cycle because of growth in the economy, a tax increase or other factors. Department heads submit their budget requests with proposed increases to get a slice of the $50 million in new funds, either to expand existing programs, launch new programs, or to cover increases in costs through inflation. The governing officials rarely look at the existing expenditures to judge whether they are meeting their objective. The officials are concerned only with carving up the $50 million in new funds. If graded, a new program actually might become a greater priority than an existing program, but it doesn't get funded unless it can get a slice of the $50 million in new money."", ""Zero-base budgeting changed this practice in Georgia. Every program, existing and proposed, must now vie for funding in the new budget on an equal level. Every single dollar spent by a department in the current year must be justified if it is to be recommended by the governor for funding in the following year's budget."", ""Until the concept was implemented in Georgia, only one Texas corporation had ever used zero-based budgeting. The new technique was developed by that corporation as a means of reducing the costs of its overall operation. This was done by ranking every single function within the company's operations and abolishing the lowest priority functions. Thus, the company was able to reduce expenses as required in a manner that retained the most-needed functions."", 'On a larger scale, zero-based budgeting in Georgia has peeled the veil of secrecy from around bureaucracy by opening up for inspection and scrutiny the activities of every single state employee. For the first time, a governor, legislator, department head, or anyone else can study in detail what is being accomplished at the lowest level of state activity.', 'The heart of zero-based budgeting is decision packages, which are prepared by managers at each level of government, from the top to the bottom. These packages—10,000 in Georgia—cover every existing or proposed function or activity of each agency. The packages include analysis of the cost, purpose, alternative courses of action, measures of performance, consequences of not performing the activity, and benefits.', 'Merely compiling these packages would not accomplish any purpose other than to provide information. Therefore, they are ranked in order of importance against other current and new activities. This ranking forms the basis of determining what functions are recommended for funding in the new budget, depending, of course, upon the amount of money available. If less funds are appropriated than requested, the lowest-ranking functions and activities are cut out.', 'Besides placing priority on spending programs and revealing more information about actual governmental operations, zero-based budgeting achieves one more important action: it forces planning into levels of government where planning may never have existed. It forces all levels of government to find better ways of accomplishing their missions. It also gives a voice in governmental direction to the rank and file state employee who is responsible for delivering services. Besides making him a more integral part of the planning process, it elevates his own sense of importance of his position and prompts him to work harder and deliver more efficient services.', 'There are three ingredients necessary for successful implementation of zero-based budgeting: (1) unqualified support from top executives, (2) effective design of the system, and (3) effective management of the system.', 'Zero-based budgeting has been well received in Georgia. It has become an important planning tool to insure that we are placing our priorities on the proper programs and are constantly seeking the maximum services for every state dollar.', ""I don't want to mislead you and leave the impression that implementation of zero-based budgeting has created miracles in Georgia's state government. Obviously it has not. But it has been subtly at work for 3 years making basic changes in the operations of our government and will continue to pioneer further improvements in the years ahead."", 'The merging of budgeting and planning services into one cohesive organization has worked so well that one wonders why they were ever located in separate, noncooperating agencies.', 'State planning was a function of the Bureau of State Planning and Community Affairs when I took office, while the Budget Bureau handled all budget matters. Although both agencies were under control of the governor since he appointed both agency heads, they operated separately with no cooperation between them—a fact that minimized the probability of the planning output being implemented.', ""One of the most critical problems was that the Bureau of State Planning and Community Affairs, which had been created in 1967, had never really established its mission in Georgia's state government after 4 years of operation. Legislators didn't understand its functions and were skeptical of its entire operation. They felt that the planning bureau and the individual state departments were overlapping in their responsibilities. In some instances this was true. More importantly, the planning bureau was doing most of the program planning in state government without adequately synchronizing its efforts with the state agencies. When it came time to implement the planning efforts, department heads were skeptical and too often were reluctant to push for implementation of the proposed improvements. This created an impasse that made the work of state planners generally ineffective."", 'As soon as reorganization brought the budgeting and planning functions together into the same agency, the Office of Planning and Budget, changes began to occur. For the first time, planners and budget analysts worked side by side and began to coordinate their efforts.', 'Over a period of another year, further changes took place that changed completely the role of state planning. Through reorganization, most state agencies began to do their own functional program planning. This was made possible by creation of planning divisions within these departments for the first time, and also by the fact that the reduction in number of departments made them large enough to justify their own program planning divisions.', 'Concurrently, planners in the planning division of the Office of Planning and Budget assumed a new role of policy planning rather than program planning. By restricting program planning to the agency level, there is now a greater chance that it will be implemented.', ""Georgia state law changes the OPB planning division with the responsibility for assessing accurately Georgia's physical, social, and economic needs. On a periodic and timely basis throughout the year, these needs are identified, documented, and analyzed."", ""One method that I have used to secure citizen participation in the state planning process was the Goals for Georgia program. This was a year-long program in 1971 in which Georgia citizens were given a chance to outline the types of programs they wanted their state government to emphasize in the years ahead. Since that time, state planning has been updating the results of this program continuously in the formulation of the state's goals and policies."", 'The role of OPB planners in preparation of the 1975 budget tells the story of how state planning is now done in Georgia.', ""Long before the state's budget analysts got deeply involved in preparation of the proposed fiscal year 1975 budget that would be submitted to the general assembly, OPB planners started meeting with department heads to determine their program priorities for the following year. Detailed analyses were prepared and submitted to me for review. At the same time, I was meeting with the planners to outline my priorities. Later, I met with the planners and each department head to discuss both of our priorities. We reached a mutual agreement on many programs to be pursued and disagreed on others. Even though we .didn't reach unanimity, we established a common ground of understanding about our conflicting goals. Later, when the budget analysts started putting together the actual budget proposals in dollars and cents, the spadework done by the planners proved to be an immense help."", ""OPB's planning division didn't stop at this point Its staff continued to attend every budget meeting and provide assistance in ironing out details of the actual budget proposal to be made. Although planners had been involved in preparation of the proposed fiscal year 1974 budget, this was the first time they had actually been involved with a clearcut role established for them. I can only say that I wish we had had this type of budget-planning relationship available when I became governor. I am more than pleased with the working rapport that has been established. The relationship between me and all department heads concerning budgeting preparation has been improved considerably."", 'The work of the planners is reflected in our printed budget documents as well. One of the three budget documents we prepare in Georgia is an outline of proposed spendings on a program basis with a 4-year projection of future needs for each program. This document is keyed by page number to the main financial display document for easy cross-reference.', 'One role of planners has been retained—program evaluation. This involves determining whether each program has attained its objective and making a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each program.', 'OPB planners were left with this function because an objective, outside- the-agency evaluation is needed, and because many programs cross agency lines. It would not be fair for one line agency to evaluate the effectiveness of a related program in another line agency.', ""Along with die new objectives of OPB's planning division, one major change has taken place in our recruiting efforts. Instead of recruiting trained planners, we hire experts in the various areas of governmental activity such as education, law enforcement, mental health, et cetera. We provide them the in-house training necessary to work within the framework of our planning organization. This policy has been successful. By virtue of being experts in their activity of assignment, OPB planners can discuss programs on a level with department heads. They have an expertise that is creating more trust in state planning and is helping to establish better rapport between the governor's office and the various state departments."", ""Georgia's state government still has a long way to go to achieve the quality of service that I would like to see. But we've come a long way since I took office in 1971."", ""The innovations involving zero-base budgeting and merging of the budgeting and planning staffs will be felt in Georgia for a long time. We are leaving a legacy to our next governor that will allow him the flexibility and mechanism to move quickly into the decision making process of a new administration that hasn't been available to Georgia's past governors.""]"

We can't afford it, and that's not the way we want it. My campaign will have to depend on people like you who have confidence in me, who have confidence in our country, and who want to participate in the evolution during the campaign and in subsequent months of the kind of government and the kind of purpose and the kind of nation of which we can all be proud. I need your personal help, actively, without my specifically asking you for it.

I think not.', 'Federal education laws must be simplified to substitute education for paper-shuffling grantsmanship. Local systems need federal funds to supplement their programs for students where wealth and tax base are inadequate.', 'Is a comprehensive education program beyond the capacity of the American people? I think not.', ""As a farmer, I have been appalled at the maladministration of our Nation's agricultural economy.

5,Jimmy Carter ,"March 15, 1975","['Thank you very much.\n', ""I might first say that I came in from New York this morning on TWA and for the last hour or so we had been stuck on the runway of the airport. Fortunately, however, the 4 feet of snow that had accumulated in front of our plane's wheels was finally shoveled out of the way, and I arrived here just in the nick of time to hear one of the finest congressmen in Washington give you his talk.\n"", 'You know, if every Member of Congress had the same understanding, sensitivity and capability and motivations as Congressman Heinz, you would not have to be concerned about the future of our nation.\n', 'Insofar as I am concerned, let me first say that I do appreciate the introduction given. You know, sometimes an introduction can separate a speaker from his audience. This happened on an occasion, not too long ago, with me.\n', ""Some 4 or 5 years ago I was visiting a college campus, the campus of the oldest women's college in the nation. Each summer we bring to that campus the 400 brightest high school students in the state, as determined by comparative examinations. They spend 8 weeks there studying various subjects, advanced subjects, such as new teaching techniques and the like.\n"", 'There is 1 day, out of that 8 week session, that we set aside for career training, and we spend that full day bringing onto the college campus professionals—doctors, dentists, nurses, businessmen, scientists, engineers, teachers, et cetera—so that students in small groups can study what they want to do in the future with their own brilliant young lives in order to plan their careers in an orderly fashion.\n', 'I was invited at that time to make the main banquet speech and the individual, in introducing me, said, ""Tonight we are happy to have at this time, Jimmy Carter to come and tell us how to plan our life careers?\' He then pointed out that I was born and raised in Georgia, had gone to college there and then he said, ""Senator Carter went to Georgia Tech where he studied engineering and then he went to the Naval Academy at Annapolis where he got a degree in naval science and then he went to Union College in New York, where he did his graduate work in nuclear physics and now he grows peanuts for a living and is now going to tell us how to plan our life\'s careers."" [laughter] Well, by the time I got my speech done, I had finally gotten that audience back.\n', 'I do want to talk to you today, however, about some concepts that are important to us all.\n', ""You know, God has given us a great heritage to take cafe of, which sometimes we don't appreciate adequately.\n"", 'I have tried to think of a story to illustrate this point, and the only one I could think of was about the old gentleman who lived in the mountains and he, his father, his grandfather, and his great grandfather before him had owned the same little tiny plot of land—50 acres—and they were very proud of that and every time, during those four generations, that they made a nickel or a dime, they had put it back in the beautification of this little plot of land. The trees were beautifully pruned; the stream was absolutely pure; the rose garden was beautiful; the fences were all straight; the little house setting on the southern part of the farm was whitewashed, and the old gentleman was very proud of what he had, the beauty of it and the like.\n', 'He had a new nephew who one day visited him coming from a far western area and that first night they were standing on the porch, and the old gentleman said, ""I want you to see the beautiful place we have. Just over there beyond the rose bushes you see the western boundary of our farm. Just beyond that little creek on the hill is the northern boundary and over there, just beyond those pine trees, is the eastern boundary of the farm and then my house here happens to be located in the southern comer. What do you think about our place?""\n', 'Well, the young man was very bright and replied, ""By golly, do you call this a farm? Where I come from they have really got farms. My house also happens to be on the southern comer, and I get into my pickup truck early in the morning, drive as hard as that truck will go until 10 o\'clock in the morning, and I have to stop and rest and put some oil in the truck, and it takes me until noon to get to the northern comer of my farm. I then stop and eat lunch and by midafternoon I am back at the eastern comer and then it is nightfall before I get back to my house in the southern comer. What do you think about that?""\n', 'Well, the old gentleman thought awhile and then replied, ""Well, son, I sympathize with you. I used to have a pickup truck like that myself.""\n', 'Well, sometimes we do have different perspectives of beauty and different perspectives of our responsibilities and that is important to us.\n', ""I am an engineer, I am a conservationist, and I am a scientist, an environmentalist, I am a nuclear engineer, I am an outdoors man, I am a Christian, and I don't see any conflict among these things, but when I was elected governor, I approached the office with a great deal of anticipation, not as a politician but as a businessman, an outdoors man, as a planner, as a farmer, and I found a terrible bureaucratic mess.\n"", 'For example, we had 300 agencies and departments in the Georgia government. We abolished 278 of them. We set up a simple structure, one that you could understand and that could deal with comprehensive problems of the people of the state in an effective, aggressive, comprehensive, and understandable way.\n', 'We established a new kind of budgeting technique called zero-based budgeting, where every year we stripped down the Georgia budget to zero, and we analyzed every single program that delivered services to the Georgia people. If it was doing a good job, we kept it. Sometimes we even enhanced it. If it was ineffective, then we eliminated it.\n', 'We carefully put together each year a proper priority of the delivery of services to the Georgia people and a proper allocation of funds paid in by taxes of the people served.\n', ""We have long-range plans in every parameter of Georgia's life—mental health, physical health, transportation, education, environmental quality, recreation, parks, game and fish management, coastal plains, preservation of marshlands, et cetera—so that the majority of people know ahead of time what is going to happen 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and sometimes even 25 years in the future.\n"", 'We have a very economical, efficient government and I am proud of it, and I would put it up against the efficiency and economy of many corporations, such as Delta Airlines, Sears Roebuck, Coca-Cola, General Motors, or IBM.\n', 'However, I would also like to remind you that nowhere in the Constitution of the United States or Declaration of Independence, nor the Bill of Rights, nor the Old Testament, nor the New Testament, do you find the words ""economy or efficiency."" However, you find other words that are much more important—words like self-reliance, words like beauty, and words like appreciation, and words like foresight, and words like stewardship, brotherhood, tenacity, commitment, compassion, and love, that describe what a human being ought to be and also describe what the government of those human beings ought to be.\n', 'The title of my speech, as I noted it when I got here this morning, comes from the Bible, ""For if the trumpet be given an uncertain sound, then who shall prepare themselves for the battle?""\n', ""I tell you that this is no time for those of us who love God's earth and the beauty of it, the purity of the air and water, to compromise or to retreat or to yield in any possible measure to the devastation or deterioration of the quality of our lives or our environment.\n"", ""If the members of the environmental and conservation group of this nation are willing to compromise ahead of time on tough decisions relating to the quality of the lives of the American people, then who in God's world is going to maintain a staunch position from which we can make proper decisions?\n"", 'Not long ago, I noted that one of the Cabinet members made a statement, ""Earth Day is over,"" and then another prominent official in Washington said, in referring to people like you and me, that we were green bigots.\n', 'Well, I think this is inevitable. I helped, for example, to organize the Georgia Conservancy, and I have grown up in the swamps, rivers, fields, and woods of southwest Georgia.\n', 'I started with my game and fish conservation programs when I was a 12-year-old child and I never had an electric light until I was 15 years old. I know how important it is to stand fast when problems get serious and when challenges get great and when public opinion swings back and forth in a time of crisis.\n', 'Environmentalists now are under attack for one basic reason and that is because we accurately predicted what would happen in our modem, fast-changing, technological world if we did not make long-range plans concerning the population explosion, food shortages, pollution control, depletion of commodities, natural resources, energy supplies, and now with those predictions having come true, in some strange ways those of us who made the accurate predictions several years ago are being blamed for the consequences of a lack of planning.\n', 'There is no incompatibility between careful planning and economic progress on the one hand and environmental quality on the other hand.\n', 'Our present economic distress, in a major degree, has come from waste and from the lack of planning to correlate the disparate elements that affect our modem world.\n', 'Now, I happen to be a scientist and I have seen the almost complete severance or separation in the last few years of the scientific community from the decision making center of our nation, which is in the White House.\n', 'You know, in times past, when the world was slowly changing, it was possible for political leaders to make predictions and judgments and then call on scientists and say, ""This is what we have decided, now you help us achieve the goal we have established.""\n', 'However, that time is gone. Now, the inexorable forces of nature which cannot be changed on a worldwide basis, concerning food, population, pollution, energy resources, are so complicated that a full-time President, a full-time congressman or a full-time governor or a full-time Mayor has not the time nor most often the competence to predict what is going to happen and to design what the alternatives are—to make careful correlated planning for the future and use the best alternatives.\n', 'Now is the time when professionals, like many of you, and scientists like me, need to be in the most enviable possible posture in our government.\n', ""Now, what is our nation's policy on energy?\n"", 'Well, there is none.\n', ""What is our nation's policy on comprehensive transportation programs? There is none.\n"", ""What is our nation's policy on mental health, physical health, education, welfare, and tax reform?\n"", 'There are none.\n', ""How can we hope to inspire the American people to reach for greatness and to make sacrifices when they don't know the purpose of their sacrifice and don't know the consequences of selfish actions and have no way to look toward a common goal so that we can work in harmony and with a mutual support for realizing the potential of our great society?\n"", 'The safety and good health of workers, for example, is not incompatible with the proper utilization of energy resources.\n', 'The destruction of the surface of our lands with uncontrolled strip mining is certainly not a logical approach to meeting energy requirements.\n', ""The unrestrained and profuse off-shore leasing of scarce and very lightly understood oil reserves is in no way protecting the public's interest and the public's oil deposits.\n"", 'The right of private businesses, in conjunction with the federal government, to condemn lands over the opposition of state and local governments, farmers and ranchers, is no proper procedure in a free and democratic society.\n', 'The right to establish, arbitrarily, sites which might be derogatory to the environment of a beautiful area is no proper procedure for our government to espouse.\n', 'One of the most frequent questions I get in my travels around this country is, ""What are we going to do about energy?""\n', 'Other nations have a comprehensive energy policy—we do not\n', 'We have, in the entire world, about 60 cubic miles of oil, total reserves, and the best estimates are then that we can expect from the ground about 75 percent of that oil. We use about 1.3 cubic miles per year and the rate of that use is increasing year by year, not particularly in this country now but in the areas of the world which are becoming more industrialized—which means, in turn, we have enough oil to last about 35 years; we have enough uranium to last 40 or 50 years; and we have enough coal to last 600 years.\n', 'Among the nuclear physicists of this country, there is a 50-50 judgment about whether or not we will have electricity from fusion in this century. We are now seeing a struggle going on, an economic struggle, about how to use what we do have.\n', 'There is a great pressure to make synthetic fuels out of coal, to take coal and change it into oil or gas.\n', 'This is probably counter-productive because it takes a lot of energy just to change the form of coal, but we do need research and development to make sure that when coal is used that the environment is less adversely affected.\n', 'Shale also has tremendous potential but enormous amounts of water and energy are required to extract oil from shale, and to get 4 or 5 percent of our total energy resources from shale would require us to dig a Panama Canal everyday.\n', 'The federal government has an integral role to play in every aspect of environmental life that I have mentioned to you this morning.\n', 'The total budget allocated to conservation and wildlife is about 1 percent of our total budget but that includes, in a major degree, two types of expenditures which quite often are counter-productive.\n', 'One involves the building of unnecessary dams by the Corps of Engineers and the other one is a channelization of our streams by the Soil Conservation Service.\n', ""Not too long ago, in Georgia, I vetoed a major dam project because it would have been destructive to the quality of Georgia's wildlife in the future and also a gross waste of money, and the computations used to economically justify that particular dam were false.\n"", 'A great reduction must be made in the construction of dams and channelization of streams in this country. We need to enhance recreation and park expenditures, utilization of our forests, both privately and publicly owned, and accentuate good wildlife habitat production for our wildlife. We have to become involved in the protection of natural areas, historic areas and sites that are important, and the property management of public lands, not for the oil companies, not for the coal companies, but for the people of the country.\n', 'In closing, I would briefly like to indicate to you two incidents that happened to me.\n', 'One of these occurred when I was campaigning for Governor of Georgia. Late one afternoon, I was tired and I was leaving one of our major cultural cities and as I was driving on the interstate highway, 1-16, I looked into my rearview mirror and was very, very saddened to see a haze of black smoke over that major city and remembered a conversation which I had with some fisherman on the banks of the Savannah River, who formerly could catch fish in the mouth of that river but who could no longer do so.\n', 'I could see the haze in my rearview mirror and at about that same time, overhead, over the interstate highway, which was used to transport hundreds of cars to and from the city, I saw a flash of bronze in the air and then about 20 yards in front of my car, as I drove westward, there was a turkey gobbler. Then, just in front of my car, he set his wings and he sailed into the Georgian swamp on the right.\n', 'I then thought to myself, would my 3-year-old child ever see a wild turkey gobbler in Georgia? Will the natural areas of our state be preserved? Will the quality of our air improve? Will our land and water be protected?\n', 'Well, as Governor of Georgia, I tried to keep all of those factors in mind and never yielded an inch on the quality of our lives.\n', 'The people of this country are very deeply concerned about two basic things. One is the integrity and the purpose of our federal government Does it represent accurately the character and quality of our people?\n', 'The second basic concern about the government is—is it accountable and able to deal with the complicated factors that will face our lives and which are going to get more complicated in the future?\n', 'As we approach the 200th birthday of our country, it is important for us to stop and see whether or not we as Americans in a leadership capacity, representing perhaps a minority view, can compromise our principles.\n', 'You know, during my last 2 years in the Navy, I worked for a remarkable man by the name of Rickover. He is probably the greatest engineer this nation ever produced. He is a great scientist and is completely dedicated. He works very, very hard. He will be 75 years old this year.\n', ""In years gone by he has been responsible for all the nuclear and power generation for the Navy atomic submarines and the Atomic Energy Commission. Further, he has absolutely no tact—doesn't care for anything. As a matter of fact, all the time I worked for him he never said a decent word to me. However, he did change my life because he had one characteristic, and still has it, which has always been unique. He would never accept mediocrity or low average achievement in relation to anything he did or anyone under him did.\n"", 'I helped him and a few others develop the first two atomic submarines and I worked at the General Electric Company at that time and whenever the admiral would come around to inspect my work, if I had done a perfect job, which wasn\'t too often, but every now and then I did, he never said a word—never once did he say, ""Good job, Jimmy"" or ""Well done, Carter."" If he found no fault, he simply looked, turned around, and walked away.\n', 'However, if I made the slightest mistake, in one of the loudest and most obnoxious voices I ever heard, he would turn around and tell the other people in the area what a horrible disgrace I was to the Navy, and that I ought to be back in the oldest and slowest and smallest submarine from which I had come.\n', 'Further, I remember the first time I met the admiral. We were in a room almost a quarter as large as this one. There was one table in the room and a chair on each side. I was being interviewed for a job and that interview lasted 3J4 hours. He looked right between my eyes the whole time. He never smiled. He let me choose any subject I wanted to talk about and, of course, I carefully chose a subject about which I knew the most at the time, navigation, seamanship, foreign affairs, music, art, drama, whatever it was, and then with questions of increasing difficulty, in each instance, he proved that I did not know anything about the subject I had chosen.\n', 'Toward the end of our interview I was sitting there in a cold sweat and he asked me a question in relation to which I could finally redeem myself.\n', 'He asked, ""How did you stand in your class at Annapolis?""\n', 'Well, I had done very well and so my chest swelled up with pride and I replied, ""Sir, I stood so and so in a class of 765.""\n', 'Well, I sat back to wait for a favorable reaction, and the congratulations never came. I found out later, for example, he had stood No. 1 in his class.\n', 'He then asked me another question. He said, ""Did you do your best?""\n', 'I started to say yes but then I remembered for a part of the time when I was there, there were times when I could have learned a little bit more about things, weapons, seamanship, navigation and so I gulped a couple of times and I said, ""No sir, I did not always do my best.""\n', 'Well, he sat there for a long time looking at me and then he turned his chair around to end the interview and asked me one final question, something which I have never been able to forget and to which I have never been able to think of a good answer to. He asked, ""Why not?"" Well, after awhile, I got up and walked out of the room.\n', ""Well, this room is filled with people who love God's world, who love the grass and the trees and the mountains and the wildlife; who are concerned about the future; who consider themselves stewards; who have natural leadership capabilities, who are trusted by their fellow Americans, neighbors; who have seen firsthand some of the problems that we personally face; who have been tempted to compromise our principles because of public pressure or political pressure. However, let's not do it.\n"", 'I think that it is incumbent upon us, on the cutting edge of the preservation of the quality of life, to ask ourselves the question that Admiral Rickover asked every single officer who goes into an atomic submarine—for the people of this country, for the future of it, for our nation and for ourselves individually—and a question we should ask ourselves, ""Why not the best?""\n', 'Thank you very much.']"
6,Jimmy Carter ,"April 02, 1975","['Thank you very much, Mr. President. Let me say how glad I am to be here at Johns Hopkins. I had a chance today to meet with some of the leaders in the Urban Studies Center and to meet downtown with some political leaders and then to meet with editors of the Baltimore Sun Newspapers and now to come here and be with you.', ""If it is suitable, I would like to speak for awhile, maybe 20 minutes at the most, about the matters that are important to me, and express, in general terms, the title of my talk, and then to answer your questions about the issues that I raise or others that might be of interest to you concerning political tactics or the nation's self—what it is or what it ought to be—or specific issues, domestic or foreign. I don't know the answers to all the questions, but I'll try to answer those that I do know clearly and without trepidation."", 'Sometimes it is hard for a speaker to overcome an introduction that is very good. When I was running for governor about 5 years ago, I visited the Wesleyan College campus. Wesleyan is the oldest women\'s college in the country. The campus is not used during the summertime, and we send to the campus the 400 brightest and most intelligent high school students that we can select each year by competitive examination for advanced study. The program consists of about 8 weeks. We call it die Governor\'s Honors Program, and it was a program that I devised as a Senator, and I\'ve been there every year. One day out of each 8 week course we set aside for career training. We bring onto the college campus engineers, nuclear physicists, and scientists of all kinds, doctors, lawyers, nurses, airplane stewardesses, businessmen from different elements of our society to meet with small groups of the students to tell them about the future that they can expect, and to try to plan for them in their own minds, an orderly progress in their educational lives, so they won\'t shift from one course of study to another and waste their own brilliant minds and their parents\' and the public\'s funds. I was invited to give the main address of the evening to encapsulate what they had learned that day about orderly planning of a life\'s career. I went to this banquet hall, and the young man who introduced me had done a great deal of research work on my background; and he got up and said how proud they were to have at that time Senator Jimmy Carter to come and tell them how to plan their life\'s career. He pointed out that I was born and raised in Plains, Georgia, that I had gone to Georgia Southwestern College where I had studied chemistry; then he pointed out that I had gone to Georgia Tech where I studied engineering, and then that I went to the U.S. Naval Academy where I was graduated with a degree in naval science, and then I did my graduate work in nuclear physics at Union College of Schenectady, New York; ""And now,"" he said, ""He grows peanuts for a living, and he is here to tell us how to plan our life\'s career."" Well, my speech was over before I got the audience back.', ""In the last 2 years, I have visited all the states of the country except five; and I have talked to people, and I have listened to people, and I've been impressed with the diversity of interests and abilities and backgrounds and experience and educational achievements of the American people. Our country has been wounded, and we at this time are quite vulnerable in the national consciousness. I don't think the diversity of interests is the reason for our vulnerable state. I think each one of us individually has within us a wide range of interests and background. I have spelled out mine, and you have the same. Our responsibilities vary from one aspect of our lives to another. I happen to be a Christian and a father and a husband and an engineer and a planner, a businessman, and so forth. I know all of you have similar widely ranging interests. The things that bother our country right now are a few basic concerns."", ""One is that our federal government has lost its basic integrity, that there is no cohesive purpose to our national existence and that the standards of ethics and morality and openness and commitment to principle within our government doesn't measure up to that that exists in the individual citizens of this nation. I see no inherent reason why that should be the case. Our hope and our dream, our purpose in establishing this country, almost 200 years ago, was to create a governmental entity that expressed in the most effective degree the highest common ideals of a free people. And I see no inherent reason why a government should be less honest or less decent or less open or less understanding or less competent or less compassionate or less filled with love than the people it represents. But at this time there is that feeling among our people, a feeling of consternation, a feeling of disappointment, a feeling of trepidation about the future, a feeling sometimes of Shame and embarrassment."", ""There is another concern that is generic in scope but almost all pervasive and that is that our federal government doesn't have the competence or the ability to deal with the complicated and ever-changing problems and opportunities that confront our people. Is government competent, or can our federal government be efficient or economical? I think the answer to those questions are yes, government can be. Let me give an example from Georgia about why I say yes."", 'When I was elected governor, I entered that office, not as a politician but as a businessman and a long-range planner, as a farmer, as a scientist. The Georgia people were ready for a change. We had a hopelessly disorganized government. We were flailing around with trying to stress the purpose of our state. We had traumatic experiences immediately behind us and around us in establishing proper interrelationships between our black and-white citizens, between the rural and the urban areas of Georgia, the same kind of traumatic confrontations and concerns that exist now in the nation—very parallel.', ""We had 300 departments and agencies in our Georgia government. We abolished 278 of them, and we did that over the opposition of entrenched selfish interest groups who thrived on confusion and who over a period of years had carved out for themselves special niches of favoritism or privilege which couldn't be detected or changed by a generally apathetic public. We initiated for the first time in the history of the world, as far as I know, a new budgeting technique called zero-base budgeting, where for the last 4 years we have stripped down the Georgia government to zero each year; and we analyze very carefully every service delivery program in our state. The persons who do the analysis are the ones responsible for the actual delivery of service to the Georgia people at the local level, deep within a department; and on a one sheet, one page fold, with a ball-point pen they describe how many people work on that project, how many they would like to see working on it the next 2 years, how much money might be spent over that period of time, what their job is supposed to accomplish. Quite often embarrassing questions. How to measure the effectiveness of that service. Just to make them think, I require that they let me know how they would perform that function with a 15 percent cut in their budget, and then we ask them to say how they could perform their function better with no change in the budget, and then we take those analyses and arrange them in an order of priority and budget accordingly. This puts every program on an equal basis, regardless of whether it is 50 years old or 5 year old or just proposed for the first time next year. And, in effect, it turns the Georgia government upside-down and let's us see everything within it. We have a performance auditing group, inspectors-general of Nader's Raiders types, who go into our departments without being announced ahead of time and an analyze not how money is spent—that's an auditor's job—but how the service is delivered; and they make their 30 day or 3 month analysis of the interworkings of those departments and then make their report available to me, to the department head, and to the public simultaneously. It is a great inspiration for the departments to keep their own structures in order."", ""The last thing that we did, among others, is to establish specific written programs or purposes or goals in every realm of Georgian's lives so that we might know 2 years, 5 years, sometimes 20 or 25 years in the future what we hope to accomplish in transportation, mental health, physical health, alcoholism, drug treatment programs, education, prison reform, tax reform. In many instances, we put those 8-year programs or 5-year programs in law so that they can be implemented by the allocation of funds in succeeding years; but at least the people in our state now, the legislators, the academic personnel, the business leaders, know what we hope to do in Georgia."", 'The economy and efficiency of our state has been transformed. We cut administrative cost more than 50 percent. We passed a sunshine law that requires that every public deliberation or decision making meeting be open to the public; even conference committees between our House and Senate are now open to the news media. So that the people themselves have a feeling—and it is an accurate feeling—that they know what is going cm in their own government', 'So far as competence is concerned, government can work. It can be economical. It can be efficient. But I would like to remind you that nowhere in the Constitution of the United States nor in the Bill of Rights nor in the Declaration of Independence nor in the Old Testament or the New Testament do you find the words ""economy"" or ""efficiency."" You find other words that are much more important, words that describe the characteristics of a human being. Words like integrity and commitment and self-reliance. Words like decency and patriotism. Words like idealism. Words like compassion and love. And those are exactly die kinds of words that ought to describe government of people, who exemplify those characteristics. There oughtn\'t to be a lowering of standards for our government compared to the standards that we set in our own lives. And we obviously ought not to be more honest in Sunday school class than we are when we are delivering services to a customer, as a businessman. We ought not to be more compassionate as a governor of a state than we are in our own homes, dealing with our wives and children who we love. So the mediocrity comes in as kind of a dormant acquiescence in the slow lowering of standards. I don\'t , believe that these kinds of standards are acceptable to the American people; and with the shame of Watergate upon us, with deep economic concern about unemployment and inflation, the confusion of government, and with the advent of the 2OOth birthday of our country, I think there is going to be a reassessment by us individual Americans of what our government is and what it ought to be.', 'All of the things I have described to you in Georgia can be implemented in Washington. We ought to strip away secrecy. There is no reason to have deliberation of regulatory agencies or the House Appropriations Committee conducted in secret. There is no reason for our foreign policy to be concealed from the American people. There is no reason for the law to be broken or circumvented as the President makes a secret decision that the CIA can overthrow a foreign government against the law or can investigate American citizens against the law.', 'There is no reason for us to bomb a country like Cambodia, a complete deviation from what the American people want, with a decision made by a Secretary of State or of a President and deliberately misleading statements made even to the Congress.', 'Every time our nation has been in serious trouble internationally, it has been because the leaders of our nation have departed in secret from the policies the American people would have preferred had they known what was going on. I would favor the passage of a sunshine law in Washington, similar to what we have in Georgia and what Florida has there, requiring that, within narrowly defined rules and exceptions, all deliberations be made public.', ""There is another aspect of our government that concerns me and which we cannot accept as a permanently mediocre or below average achievement, and that is an effectuation of understandable policies. What is our nation's policy on energy? Acquisition, storage, processing, distribution? There is no policy. What is our nation's policy on agriculture or transportation or welfare or tax reform or national health? There are no policies. And this makes it almost impossible for governors, legislators, mayors, city councilmen, educators, private citizens, business leaders to join in a mutual effort to overcome a difficulty, to meet a need, to be inspired to make a sacrifice because we don't know the purpose of our sacrifice and we don't know the consequences or benefits to be derived from national sacrifice. There are no policies or goals to establish, no long-range planning techniques as an integral part of our society."", ""I'll answer questions on specific issues in a few minutes, if you have them."", ""Another point that I want to make as a scientist—in years gone by trends, environmental concerns, population explosions, food shortages, environmental deterioration, international trade concepts, could be dealt with in a slow and methodical way. Now, they can't. Things move too fast. They are too tightly interrelated. And we are approaching a crisis state in almost every one of those aspects of life."", 'In the past, leaders in politics have made decisions; and quite often they have called in the scientists or the engineers and said, ""We have this problem, relating to war or space. Give me the answer to the problem."" That\'s not the circumstance anymore. The future is pressing on us in such an inexorable way, in such a complicated interrelated way, that we need for political leaders to have an understanding of what is going to occur, inexorably and inevitably, on the one hand, and what options we still have open to us. We need to have analyses made by complicated procedures using electronic data processing, computer models, so that we can see what is the interrelationship between foreign trade, the quality of the ocean, environmental deterioration, utilization of energy, the wasting of commodities, food shortages—how can these be understood and assessed at the very time when the scientific community needs to have its energy harnessed just in the comprehension of possibilities of the future. At that very moment, President Nixon severed any ongoing relationship with the scientific community within the environs of the White House where basic decisions are made. We can\'t afford to have the scientific and academic communities removed from the long-range studies and the delineations of policies on which political leaders make decisions.', ""A couple more points I'd like to make."", 'There is only one nation in this world that has the stature and the ability to be the leader, and that is this country. If we don\'t assume a posture of leadership within the community of nations, there is no alternative to us. And other diplomatic and national leaders look to us with anticipation rapidly waning for a demonstration of leadership. We\'ve lost the stature that we used to occupy in the community of nations. In some strange way that I don\'t understand we have modified our posture of antagonism and friendship. Formerly, we were struggling on the one hand, with Russia on the other, and the less developed countries were standing on the sidelines, benefiting from the advances of both us and Russia. Now we are on one side, the less developed countries on the other, struggling against us. Russia is standing on the sidelines, observing and benefiting from the advances of us both. How we got ourselves in this posture, I do not know; but it is true, and it grieves me to know that in a showdown in the United Nations we could possibly not get more than 10 percent of the votes. We can bypass the United Nations for awhile because we are strong enough to ignore it We have a veto in the Security Council. We can block any action against us, but still I don\'t like the proposition of knowing that the more weak and backward and defenseless and new a foreign nation is, the less likely their people are to say, ""I want my future to be tied with the destiny of the American people."" And that\'s the attitude we have. We have very few new countries to say, ""I want my future tied with the future of the people of the United States.""', ""There are some ways to restore this leadership, not based on military might, not based on economic force or political power, but based on one proposition; and that is that our country is right and fair and honest and decent and that we have a posture as a nation that warrants pride. I would like to see our nation take a position that the ultimate goal of the American people is a complete reduction of nuclear weapons for all nations to zero and work toward that ultimate goal in an open way, not secretly, but calling on Russia and other nuclear powers to join us in mutual, step-by-step, definitive reductions, not artificially lowering ultimate escalations. The Vladivostok agreement, for instance, is looked on as a kind of triumph for nuclear control. We now have 10,000 strategic nuclear weapons, not counting tactical nuclear weapons. The Vladivostok agreement lets us go to 18,000 so we are madly building four nuclear weapons a day, roughly, designed almost exclusively to kill civilian populations. We have 800 MIRV weapons. .Russia has zero. We can go to 1,320 something, so we are building toward that ultimate goal. I don't believe that accurately expresses what the American people are or want to be. We have, in addition to strategic weapons, tactical weapons, 7,000 in Europe alone, as a so-called nuclear deterrent, some of those very powerful, 500,000 tons of TNT in a tactical nuclear weapon. We have about 3,500 in other parts of the world and more than 200 military bases. Well, these things concern me; and the point is that in every one there has been a deviation, in my opinion, from the standards that American people would like to maintain. Who's responsible for it? The people in this country who have been blessed by God with superior capabilities or natural talent for opportunity to assume leadership roles, to shape opinion, to make decisions for other people, to establish a tone of ethics and morality—people like you and me in this room. The point is again that mediocrity is not an inherent part of American life, and a high standard can be restored to our government and to our own personal lives."", 'In order to illustrate the point, in closing, let me recount to you an episode that happened in my own life which I have adopted as a theme of my campaign. It involves a man I consider to be the most accomplished engineer of our nation, a man named Admiral Hyman Rickover. I worked for him for the last few years I was in the Navy. He is a man of great ability, great talent, great intelligence, great commitment—tactless, in some cases abusive. I worked for him for a long time, and he never said a decent word to me. He would come around to inspect my work at the Atomic Power Laboratory. If I had done a perfect job—not often, but every now and then—he never said a word. Never once in all the time I knew him did he say, ""That was a good job, Jimmy,"" or ""Congratulations, Lieutenant Carter."" He\'d just walk on. But if I had made the slightest mistake, which was most often the case, in one of the loudest and most obnoxious voices I have ever heard, he would announce what a terrible disgrace I was to the Navy, and I ought to be back on the oldest and slowest submarine, from which I had come. I remember the first time I met Rickover to be interviewed for the job. We met in a room about this size. There was a table in the middle and a chair on both sides, and it lasted 3% hours; and he never smiled, and he looked right between my eyes the whole time. And he let me choose any subject I wanted to talk about And I very carefully chose the subjects that at that time I knew the most about, music and literature and seamanship and navigation and so forth; and he would ask me questions of increasing difficulty until he proved in every instance that I didn\'t know anything about the subject I had chosen; and toward the end of the interview he asked me another question, and I finally felt I could redeem myself. He said, ""How did you stand in your class at Annapolis?"" And I swelled up my chest with pride—I had been to Georgia Tech 2 years before I went to Annapolis as a freshman, so I had done very well—and said, ""Sir, I stood so-and-so in a class of 765."" And I sat back to wait for the congratulations, which didn\'t come. I found out later he stood No. 1 in his class, and then he asked me another question He said ""Did you do your best?"" And I started to say, ""Yes sir."" But I remembered that part of the time I was at Annapolis was during the war, and I was just human. There were a lot of times when I could have learned a little more about our allies or our enemies or our weapons; and I finally gulped and told him the truth. I said, ""No, sir, I didn\'t always do my best."" And he looked at me for a long time, and he turned his chair around to end the interview. And he asked me one more question. I never have been able to forget it or think of a good answer. He said, ""Why not?"" I sat there for a few minutes, and then I got up and walked out of the room.', 'Well, mediocrity. As we reassess the problems we detect in our own life and in our own society and in our own government, as we approach the 200th birthday of our country, as we face another election on a national basis where issues can be discussed and where reaffirmations of principle and commitment might be possible, I think it is important for us to ask ourselves the question, that Rickover still asks every single officer who goes into an atomic submarine, and that question is for ourselves, for our nation, ""Why not the best?"" [applause]', 'I kind of skipped over some issues; but if you have any questions you want to ask me about politics or issues, I will be glad to try and answer them just briefly.', ""Q. At the club we went through, looking for various Presidential candidates to ask on campus and ran into different organizations and their efficiency or nonefficiency. You don't have, as far as I know right now, an office in Washington. Are you going to start one, are you going to start functioning in this area at all, are you getting organized in an effective way?"", ""Governor Carter. Can you all hear the questions? Can you hear the question? OK. I don't intend to open an office in Washington at any time soon, not this calendar year. We have a campaign office open in Atlanta that we established December 12, 1974, when I announced for President. I have asked my staff, the same staff basically who worked with me the last 2 years as a national campaign chairman for the Democratic Party itself. During that time, I worked directly or indirectly—mostly directly—with more than 1,000 candidates who ran for Congress and for governor and for the U.S. Senate. My staff is young. We have six men and five women, and they are very experienced in politics. We have got a lot to learn. We've grown very quickly. I began to campaign full time on January 20, and I have already been in, I think, 24 states. I consider the Presidency of this country—I'm sure you would agree—to be the most important political office in the world. I think it is important enough to deserve my full-time commitment, and I have gotten my business in such a condition—it's a very profitable business— that I can leave and work full-time around this country. We will be growing in our staff capabilities as time goes on. I put a great burden on my staff because of my own travels. We have an enormous mail load to carry and a very difficult scheduling problem. For instance, this year, in 1975, I have scheduled 250 days outside of Georgia. This is a load for a staff back home. So I think our staff is learning. I would put it up in political competence against almost anybody else's, but it is always inherent in a campaign which is growing for the staff to b? inadequate. If a campaign has peaked and is going downhill, you've got more staff members than you need; and so far ours has been overworked, which I think is encouraging."", ""I look forward to the campaign. My intention is to enter all the primaries. You may or may not realize it, but at this time next year four of the primaries will have already been completed; and the election will be more than half over, in my opinion. The first campaign primary will be in New Hampshire the first week in March, the next week Florida, the next week Illinois, then we skip a week, then Wisconsin, and so on. One, two, three primaries a week until we have about 25, 26, or 27 primaries. And I want— I like this, I like this kind of campaigning. I think it is important that any Presidential candidate—I'll refer to myself only—be tested in the most severe way to let the American people assess my character, my strength, my weaknesses, my abilities, my stand on issues, so that they might make a judgment about me; and if I can measure up to what the American people expect or what they would like their government to be, as exemplified by the President, I will be elected. If I can't measure up—and I hope the standards are very high and not mediocre—then I don't deserve to be President. But at the present time I feel very confident. The other candidates who have announced don't frighten me. I intend to seek delegate votes in all the states. I'm going to enter the primaries, for instance, in Texas, which is the home of Lloyd Bentson. I will enter the primary in Alabama, which is the home of George Wallace. All of us will be in the Florida primary because you can't get your name off the list unless you take an oath that you are not a candidate, or don't intend to run for President in 1976. So Florida, the second week in April as presently scheduled, will be a very severe testing. But I think this personal contact with the people and the personal testing of the Presidential character of candidates is very important. And our staff will grow, and it will get more and more competent, but it will probably always be behind.if I keep moving fast enough."", 'Yes, sir.', 'Q. Governor Carter, in your concern about nuclear weapons across the world and the Russians? concern about the growth of American seapower, as our first step in moral leadership across the world, if you become President, would you then, for example, cut down on------', ""Governor Carter. No. I wouldn't. I think that we have got to assess in every instance how the expenditure of our public funds contributes to the effectuation of our domestic and international politics. One of the crucial vulnerabilities that our nation presently has is in keeping the sealanes open. As you probably know, during the October War or the Yom Kippur War in Israel, we had almost an impossible task in reaching Israel; and we also have a very vulnerable sealane maintenance capability as confronted by Russia. Six years ago, we had about 1,000 ships, Russia had about 600. Now we have 514 ships, and Russia has over 1,000. I think we are beginning to get ourselves in a vulnerable condition as compared to Russia just in the maintenance of our option to use the seas. So I would not cut back on those. I think the building of atomic submarines in a very slow evolutionary way is the best approach. I think one submarine per year is adequate. But I think that ultimately our major route of protecting this nation's existence has got to be the nuclear submarine program where, with a submerged platform, we can remain invulnerable to attack, even detection almost. I can't see any technological breakthroughs if we let the Russians detect the presence of our submarines in deep water. And this would be an adequate deterrent, in my opinion. But the escalation of vast quantities of nuclear weapons, to me, is counterproductive to the will of the American people. So I would keep a strong Navy because of the peaceful effectuation of our purposes."", ""Q. You spoke of the role of America you'd like to see in developing leadership capabilities, but yet you also speak of the bombing of Cambodia and the situation in Vietnam—I was wondering how you propose that this leadership role come about without inflicting any kind of harm on the stability of Third World governments? How would you propose that this leadership of America come about under your administration, as President?"", ""Governor Carter. I'm not sure that I can give you adequate answers to any questions, but I'll do the best I can. I think it is counter to the American will and counter to a proper foreign policy of this nation to inject ourselves militarily into the internal affairs of other countries. I think it was a mistake for us to get involved in Vietnam at all. I think it was a mistake for us to get involved in Cambodia at all. In my judgment, Lon Nol does not have the support of the Cambodian people. If we put $1 billion into Cambodia, we would only continue to escalate the hardship and heartache and devastation of the country. I would provide, as President, if I were in office now, humanitarian allocation of funds for food and for drugs and for medicine and for some evacuation although I don't think evacuation would be a major role to be played in Cambodia. They are not a bloodthirsty or a murderous kind of people."", ""In South Vietnam—it was a mistake to get involved in Vietnam as was the case in Cambodia. We became involved so deeply there with the deliberate misleading of the American people about our prospects for victory and with the actual reports from Vietnam being modified or doctored substantially and deliberately. It was contrary to the American people's inclination, I think, to spend $150 billion in South Vietnam or to have 50,000 American young people lose their lives there. I would not at all increase the allocation of funds to South Vietnam. To my mind, that did not contribute to the leadership capability or the leadership status of our country around the world. It probably did more to damage the aspect of leadership for the United States than anything we have ever done in the history of our country."", '[At this point the tape was garbled, then resumed as follows:]', 'I think that there is a strong need then for us to be reluctant to almost an extreme point to become involved in a military action within the boundaries of another country. We have many things that we can work on in a positive way—the alleviation of hunger. Our country is able to produce and also to join with other productive nations in the effectuation of adequate food supplies around the world. We can tell the truth about it. There are so many misconceptions that have been foisted upon the American people that is almost pitiful. Many, for instance, think that the importers of food are the poor countries. That is not true at all. The major importers of food are the rich countries.', ""Japan, to give you one statistical illustration, imports more food than China and India combined and has historically imported more food. I'm not criticizing Japan, but that just shows how distorted a subject can be. So food, population problems, environmental problems, freedom of trade, mutual support of the developing countries—these kinds of contributions, plus those toward world peace, toward the implementation of the humanitarian purposes of the United Nations, the sharing of responsibility for energy sources—these kinds of things are all open to us for leadership roles; and I think that this is the kind of thing that would be acceptable to the American people. I have great confidence in the judgment of our own people in this country; and if our foreign policy is effectuated publicly and if it can be the subject of public debate and if it has the support of the American people, I would pretty well trust that it is the proper foreign policy. But in my judgment, those two examples that you gave, very wisely, are completely different from what the American people wanted to see accomplished and is completely contrary to the national character of American people."", ""Q. On the domestic scene, in regard to the urban crisis, several representatives of the Ford Administration said that the urban crisis was largely passé based on the fact that we don't have any more serious racial problems as characterized by the riots of the sixties. First, Do you share the view that the urban crisis is passé and, second, if not, what do you see as some of the policies [to follow] . . ."", ""Governor Carter. Good. I don't agree with that statement, of course. Sometimes it is forgotten that the public officials who are responsible for implementing and understanding the detailed mechanisms of federal programs are governors and mayors and city and county officials. The Members of Congress, once they pass a law 50 years ago or 45 years ago or whatever—they launch it on the sea of society like a ship without a rudder, and it bucks around and interferes with the normal effectuation of service delivery, and it is never monitored and it is never correlated with the new programs that are pushed out either for political expediency or to meet a legitimate current and transient need. We still have a very serious problem in urban affairs. The primary problem can be attributed to several things, but I'll give you just one economic problem. Whenever our nation's gross national product changes, a certain amount, let's just say 100 percent—it might take 10 years, it might take 50 years, it might taken or 3 or 4 years, a long time—100 percent—the federal government income with a stable tax base goes up 136 percent because of the progressive nature of our tax structure. The state income goes up about 100 percent, 96 to be exact Local government income, cities and counties, primarily cities, goes up only 72 percent; so there is a constantly growing chronic problem in local government's ability to finance their needed programs and service delivery systems. The federal government takes in twice as much new money as the local governments under any sort of economic growth circumstances. We don't need revenue sharing, in my opinion, from the federal government to states. What we need is revenue sharing from the federal government to the local government to deal with questions like crime control, recreation, health, welfare, environmental deterioration, and so forth, transportation."", 'These needs are not being met, and cities quite often, even well managed cities, and there are a few of them around the country, are getting in very serious financial circumstances. New York City is bankrupt. They are borrowing money now without any prospects for repayment, not just for capital construction projects but for operating expenses. Other cities are better managed, but there are some smaller cities that are in a very serious condition. One thing that is needed is a comprehensive policy on these various local responsibilities.', ""Let's just take transportation, for instance. There is no federal policy that any governor or mayor or urban studies group can comprehend or understand or help to effectuate because it doesn't exist."", ""What is the proper way to approach the shift from the use of coal, from the use of oil to the use of coal or the utilization of solar energy? We don't know in this country. A few scientists have studied it and analyzed it; but the only energy policy that our country has, for instance, is one that is being evolved in secret by the oil companies. They know . . . essence of a publicly expressed policy, the oil companies' policy ultimately becomes our nation's policy. For instance, they have leased, at a very low cost to them, massive areas of public lands, recreation lands, grazing lands, Indian lands, in the far West where the low quality coal deposits are. Now they want the federal government to orient all of our research and development funds into how to extract synthetic oil or gas from that low quality coal, lignite, and so forth. I think we ought to put it into thermal energy. But we don't have any policy that you can understand or toward which a local or state official can work."", ""Housing has been absolutely devastated, first of all by President Nixon's preemptory impoundment of all federal funds allocated for housing. Secondly, there is no comprehensive land use planning going on in this country; and a lot of it has been blocked by direct intervention of the White House itself."", 'So we do need to have comprehensive future policies and plans that local governments can utilize, allocations of federal funds in much more massive quantities to local governments to deal with urban crises; and we need to have some mechanism by which the business community, locating a future shopping center, the academic community with an input of brains and advice, can cooperate with local and state officials to plan for the future. None of those things do exist, and the urban problems do become more and more exaggerated.', ""There is one other point I want to make on that because it is a human problem, and that is that the best investment of federal money or state and local money, as far as returns on investment are concerned and also as far as stimulating the economy is concerned with new job opportunities, is when those investments are made in enhancing the quality of life of our people. In social programs, educational programs, health programs, environment improvement, recreation programs—that's when you get an immediate return and also enhance tremendously the number of people employed for $1 million expended. The interrelationships among our people are sometimes exacerbated by a lack of planning and a lack of intelligent federal action."", ""We have made great strides in the South, including Maryland, of course, in the proper interrelationships between our black and white citizens. Our schools where I live are absolutely and completely integrated, and we faced dire predictions of catastrophe, as you well know; and we've reaped great benefits. Our black citizens have been liberated, as they sing about it in their songs, but the people who have been liberated the most are the white leaden and the white citizens of those communities who were saddled for years with an albatross around our neck of preoccupation with the race issue. I live in a little town that only has 600 people in it, about 250 of us are white, about 350 of us are black. The name of it is Plains, Georgia, about 135 miles south of Atlanta. My daughter, Amy, who is 7 yeas old, who came to me and my wife after we had been married 21 yeas—she's our only daughter—goes to the second grade at Plains Grammar School. She has a black teacher and she has a white principal. She has 8 white classmates and 22 black classmates. She is getting an excellent education. She can read the New York Times [laughter], or die Baltimore Sun, excuse me; so, you know, we have made great strides socially, but there are some aspects of our service delivery program that are still devastating in their impact on the poor people and particularly those that are both poor and belong to a minority group. In health planning, in die welfare systems, we find disgraceful circumstances."", ""I'd like to make one more point I'm over answering your question. But one thing we ought to remember is that the people like you and me at the peer group level who make governmental decisions very rarely have a personal experience with government programs concerning public health, welfare, or mental retardation, unemployment compensation, prison reform, and others, even education. We can avoid the public school system if we want to because we probably are financially able to take our kids out of a public schools system, if we choose, and put them in a private school system. So we need to make sure that as we devise a comprehensive welfare system, which will be done, if I am elected, that we abolish the—we've got more than 100 different existing federal welfare programs. We've got a welfare worker for every five recipients of welfare payments. I think of all the people I know the welfare workers are my favorite. They are compassionate and idealistic and they devote their lives to social programs and the alleviation of affliction. But they don't deal with the alleviation of affliction. They are bogged down in an office shuffling papers, trying to determine the technical or legal eligibility of varying kinds of recipients to draw benefits from those 100 different programs. So there is a possibility of our country devising a fair welfare program, filled with love and respect and concern and also fair to the taxpayer. I think this country is strong enough, able enough to do it, and the same in health. I wish you could go where I live and see the problems there. The county where I am from doesn't have a doctor or a dentist, and there are some things that need to be done."", ""I'll answer the rest of the questions very briefly, I promise you. Yes."", 'Q. Any more Rickover stories?', ""Governor Carter. No. Yeah, I've got plenty of them. It would take me all day to tell stories about Rickover. Yes, sir."", 'Q. When you succeeded so spectacularly in reducing the [government] in the Georgia administration, what was the ratio of the personnel?', 'Governor Carter. Ratio of personnel. Well, in the first place, in order to overcome the inherent opposition that existed among the heads of those 278 agencies and among many of the legislators and among the special interest groups, I had to go directly to the people; and after we got our plan devised, I said, ""This is the horrible mess we have now,"" and it was very embarrassing—not as bad as it is in Washington, but bad. ""This is what we can have, a very simple, clear, workable organization. These are the steps to get there and the benefits to be derived."" And I marshalled the support of the Georgia people. One obstacle that I did not have to overcome was among our merit system employees. All the Georgia employees in our state government are under the merit system, with very, very minor exceptions. So I promised the merit system employees—and I would promise the federal career employees also—that I wouldn\'t fire anybody as a result of reorganization. We simply did not replace vacancies. If we had two vacancies in a department, we would rehire one person; or sometimes when a person retired or transferred, they didn\'t leave any vacancy. So what we did was try to assess where people were needed. In our Transportation Department, for instance—I happen to be an engineer—we could see some very clear ways to save personnel.', ""Two years ago, we had 9,600 people in our Transportation Department, 9,600. Now we have 7,500. So we have had a 25 percent reduction in that department over a 2 year period, and the department is working much better, much more efficiently; and the engineers are doing engineers' work, and so forth. In another department—I'll give you one more example—we had a slight increase in personnel in our Human Resources Department. When I was elected, it was the standard procedure to put all our mental health patients in institutions and lock them up there and to keep them there the rest of their lives at an enormous cost to our taxpayers. We had over 12,000 patients in our Central State Hospital in Milledgeville. Now we have less than 5,000, and we have taken those, retarded children and others out of Milledgeville's hospital and put them in 136 mental health centers around the state that my wife helped set up. We've employed there some registered nurses, LPN's, retired school teachers, vocational rehabilitation counselors, volunteers, and welfare mothers, who bring their kids to the retardation center; and if they show an interest, we teach them how to teach their children to go to the bathroom, put on their clothes, to feed themselves, to sweep the floor, make up beds, put gasoline in the car if their daddy runs a service station, and so forth. So in some areas, we have increased personnel. In others, we have decreased it. But the administrative cost of government has been cut more than 50 percent; and if I am elected, I'll do the same thing in Washington."", ""It'll be easier to do it in Washington than it was in the state for several reasons, which I won't go into now; but if you think about it, you'll see that the President has a much clearer voice, much more authority; and the people are hungrier for it now on a nationwide basis even than they were in Georgia 4 years ago, on a state basis."", 'Q. What role do you think the United States should play in the Mideast?', ""Governor Carter. In the Mideast, our nation should play a major role. I've been there. I have a personal and deep commitment to Israel. I'm familiar with the Israeli leaders. Mr. Rabin is a personal friend of mine and my wife. He has visited us in Atlanta. I've visited him in Israel. Mrs. Meir, and Mr. Eban and others know me very well, and I know them. I've traveled around Israel to learn about the circumstances there. I may be somewhat biased, but I try not to be. I've talked with others recently, and I think we have a good chance of eventually achieving peace in the Mideast. I think that we ought to have—and I expressed this on the day that I announced—a profession to the world that we have a bipartisan, national commitment to the preserving of the integrity of Israel as a nation, so that everybody understands this interrelationship and so there is no doubt about it There are many elements of the Middle Eastern circumstance that will be elements of an eventual solution, and I'll explain it in very broad brush terms."", ""First of all, Israel has got to withdraw from most of their occupied territories. If I were the head of Israel, I would not relinquish the Golan Heights, and I wouldn't give up old Jerusalem; but I'm not going to try to write the terms here now. We do have to have an access for the Moslem worshippers to their holy places in old Jerusalem without crossing Israeli territory, either with a route from the Jordan River from the east or because of partial retention of old Jerusalem by the Israelis. We have to have a recognition of the Palestinian people and their right to exist as an independent people, occupying territories that will be laid out later, mostly on the west bank of the Jordan. The Prime Minister himself proposed this before he was Foreign Minister, back in 1973, as you may remember. There has to be in return for all this a recognition of Israel's right to exist as a free and peaceful nation, by us, by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, hopefully Syria, the NATO countries, and hopefully Russia, so that Israel can start again to prepare their country and just to live as a free country. And I think those are roughly the boundaries that have to be spelled out in the future in the Middle East. I might say that at the ambassadorial level, some of the Arab countries that I have mentioned to you agree; and at the higher level, a good many of the officials of Israel agree that that is roughly the outline of what will occur in the Middle East in the future."", ""Let me say that I think we have a very good working relationship with the OPEC nations. I would certainly not go to war as a preemptive strike if they cut off our oil supply. I think we have now gotten to the point where they recognize that they must cast their lot jointly, at least, with us and Russia. They have fiddled around with Russia, and they have seen the insidious nature of Russia's coming into the OPEC nations individually as a major power."", 'So I think they are going to be very careful to retain their friendship with us. I think we ought to be very careful to keep our friendship with Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, all of them who will meet us halfway.', ""They tell me that our time is up. I don't have any objection to answering one more question, but that would be all I have. Is that all right? One question."", 'Q. Yes, Governor, On the word that you use, understanding, do you think the failure—regardless of whether the decision was correct or whatever you go into—do you think the decision to not honor whatever commitments we have made will create some kind of vacuum in world relationships and the understanding or the misunderstanding of American foreign policy in relationship to possibly increasing the tension or increasing the possibility of war?', ""Governor Carter. I don't think so. You know, that would depend upon whether or not we ever evoke for world understanding a clear delineation of what our foreign policy is. I know Secretary Kissinger very well personally. I think he is a brilliant man. I won't go into all the details of it, but he and his wife are both good friends of ours. I've had long discussions with him. I've seen his actions in a very effective way, for instance, among all the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States; and I've met with him at length to discuss things like the Vladivostok Agreement and the Middle East treaties and the OPEC nations' investment of funds in our country. He depends too much on secrecy. I think he sometimes goes to extremes and fails to tell even official inquisitors about the full aspects of our foreign policy commitments. I think he has certainly been a part of the concealing of the bombing of Cambodia. I think he is much too inclined to get involved in the internal affairs of foreign countries, and I think he spends too much time outside of this country. I think, with the exception of the Middle East, it would be better for us if Secretary Kissinger stayed here."", ""But I'd like to say this in his defense. He's had placed on his shoulders more responsibility than ought to be on the shoulders of any Secretary of State; because for all practical purposes the last 2 or perhaps 3 years he has had to act as both President and Secretary of State in foreign affairs. He's had to devise in his own mind what our foreign policy ought to be, either correctly or incorrectly. He's had to negotiate with foreign governments a mutual understanding about their foreign policy, and then he's had to effectuate it And that's too much to put on any person. And now he's reaping the harvest. He took on that responsibility very willingly, knowing his nature, as you can well imagine; but now everything that goes wrong in the Middle East is suddenly being blamed on Kissinger. And I just expressed my disaffection with some of the things he has done, but I think that, if, after we withdraw our participation from Cambodia and Vietnam, we could spell out to the world what our policies are, as has been done often in the past— it is not an incomprehensible thing to do—then I think it would not result in any blow to our country to its prestige or otherwise. I think if our country could restore its basic character, as a nation, to exemplify, as I said before, the character of the American people, then we could again retain a position as the leader in the community of nations with the respect and appreciation of other countries. But right now we are looked on as a warmonger. We are looked on as a liar. We are looked on as an intervener in the internal affairs of other countries. And those things are much more serious than any consequences of our withdrawal now from a fallen government in Cambodia...""]"

Recent events have proven that a stable world order for the future cannot be built on a preoccupation with the old strategic issues which have dominated East-West and North-South relations since the end of World War II.\n"", 'Recently, with the end of the Vietnam conflict, a tremendous burden has been lifted from our shoulders—both an economic burden and one of divisiveness and doubt. Our over-involvement in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries is resulting in a mandatory reassessment by the American people of our basic foreign policies. The lessons we have learned can be a basis for dramatic improvements in the prospects for world peace and the solutions for international problems. The people of the United States are inclined to look toward the future and not to dwell on the mistakes of the past.\n', 'What are the lessons we have learned? What are our likely decisions about the future?\n', 'There is no doubt that our people are wary of any new foreign involvements, but we realize that many such involvements will be necessary.\n', 'We have learned that never again should our country become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another nation unless there is a direct and obvious threat to the security of the United States or its people. We must not use the CIA or other covert means to effect violent change in any government or government policy. Such involvements are not in the best interests of world peace, and they are almost inherently doomed to failure.\n', 'When we embrace one of the contending leadership factions in a country, too often it is the power of the United States, not the support of the people, which keeps that leader in power. Our chosen leader may then resort to repressive force against his own people to keep himself in power.\n', 'We have learned the hard way how important it is during times of international stress and turmoil to keep close ties with our allies and friends and to strive for multilateral agreements and solutions to critical problems. I hope that our days of unilateral intervention such as occurred in Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Dominican Republic are over.\n', 'Another lesson to be learned is that we cannot impose democracy on another country by force. Also, we cannot buy friends; and it is obvious that other nations resent it if we try. Our interests lie in protecting our national security, in preventing war, in peacefully promoting the principles of human freedom and democracy, and in exemplifying in our foreign policy the true character and attitudes of the American people.\n', 'We understand the vital importance of our relationship with our allies. Our friends in Japan, Western Europe and Israel must know that we will keep our promises; yet, they will be reassured not by promises but by tangible actions and regular consultations. It is particularly important that we recement strained relationships with our allies; that will be far easier to accomplish now that our involvement in Vietnam is over. The United States will always honor those commitments which have been made openly by our leaden and with the full knowledge and involvement of the people of our country.\n', 'We must never again keep secret the evolution of our foreign policy from the Congress and the American people. They should never again be misled about our options, our commitments, our progress, or our failures. If the President sets the policy openly, reaching agreement among the officers of the government, if the President involves the Congress and the leaders of both parties rather than letting a handful of people plot the policy behind closed doors, then we will avoid costly mistakes and have the support of our citizens in our dealings with other nations. Our commitments will be stronger; abrupt changes will be fewer.\n', 'Secretaries of State and Defense and other Cabinet officers should regularly appear before Congress, hopefully in televised sessions, to answer hard questions and to give straight answers. No equivocation nor unwarranted secrecy should be permitted.\n', 'What are the other elements of our future foreign policy? This is no time for thoughts of isolationism. We can now turn our attention more effectively toward matters like the world economy, freedom of the seas, environmental quality, food, population, peace, conservation of irreplaceable commodities, and the reduction of world armaments. The intensity of our interrelated problems is rapidly increasing, and better mechanisms for consultation must be established and utilized before these problems become more dangerous.\n', 'Interdependence among nations is an unavoidable and increasing factor in our individual lives. We know that even a nation with an economy as strong as ours is affected by errors such as the excessive sale of wheat to Russia in 1973, by commodity boycotts, and by the ebb and tide of economic events in the rest of the world. Our own temporary embargo of soybeans and other oil seeds was a damaging mistake to ourselves and to our friends like Japan. Such mistakes can be avoided in the future only by a commitment to consultation, as exemplified by the Trilateral Commission relationship among North America, Western Europe, and Japan.\n', 'The machinery of consultation must be reexamined and some new mechanisms developed. Others need to be abandoned or revitalized. We must strengthen international organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations. Our new commitment to multinational consultation should be reflected in the quality of the representatives we appoint to international agencies.\n', 'It is likely in the near future that issues of war and peace will be more a function of economic and social problems than of the military security problems which have dominated international relations in the world since World War II.\n', 'The relationship between Japan and the United States is based on both firm pillars of interest—our mutual security and our great economic relationship.\n', ""The security of Japan is vital to the United States, and we will maintain our commitment to Japan's defense. The sensitive question of the level and deployment of military forces here will, of course, be shaped in a continuing dialogue with Japan.\n"", 'The enormous trade flow of $24 billion a year is the largest overseas commerce the world has ever known. We rely on one another. There is no place for abrupt unilateral decisions which shock the other trading partner. Major foreign policy actions affecting the other must be thoroughly discussed in advance with our friend.\n', 'Interdependence means mutual sacrifice. For example, we must cooperate with our allies in reducing our demands for fossil fuel, assist them in the alternative development of energy resources, build up common stockpiles, plan jointly for future crises, and share the oil investments of the OPEC countries.\n', 'Among our people there is broad support for continuing the policy of détente with the Soviet Union and China—but not at the expense of close cooperation and consultation with our friends and allies. We must again reorient our foreign policy attention toward our friends. Our recent emphases have all too often involved our adversaries and ignored the interests and needs of our allies. Détente should be pursued on a mutually beneficial basis through a serious of sustained, low key and open discussions among the participants—and not just dramatic or secret agreements among two or three national leaders.\n', 'Our concern with foreign policy, however, must go beyond avoiding the mistakes of the past, reaffirming our close relationship with our allies, and continuing the process of détente. We must end the continuing proliferation of atomic weapons throughout the world, which is as senseless as a waste of precious resources as it is a mortal danger to humanity. We should refuse to sell nuclear powerplants and fuels to nations who do not sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty or who will not agree to adhere to strict provisions regarding international control of atomic wastes. The establishment of additional nuclear-free zones in the world must also be encouraged.\n', 'In addition, however, the United States and the Soviet Union have an obligation to deal with the excessive nuclear armaments which we possess. Our ultimate goal should be the reduction of nuclear weapons in all nations to zero. In the meantime, simple, careful, and firm public proposals to implement these reductions should be pursued as a prime national purpose in all our negotiations with nuclear powers—both present and potential. The Vladivostok Agreement obviously permits the continued atomic arms race.\n', 'We must play a constructive role in the resolution of local conflicts which may lead to major power confrontations. Peace in the Middle East is of vital interest to us all. While peace is the basic responsibility of the nations in the area, the United States must help secure this peace by maintaining the trust of all sides. We must strive to maintain good relations with the Arab countries as well as Israel, and to recognize Arab needs and aspirations as long as they recognize that the major element of a settlement is the guaranteed right of Israel to exist as a viable and peaceful nation. The rights of the Palestinians must also be recognized as part of any final solution.\n', ""It is essential that the flow of oil to Japan and Western Europe never be shut off. The United States should not consider unilateral action in the Middle East to assure our own nation's access to Mideast oil. Open or veiled threats of armed intervention do not contribute toward a peaceful settlement of the problems of this tortured region.\n"", 'The peoples of the developing nations need the aid, technology, and knowledge of the developed nations. We need the developed nations as sources for raw materials and as markets for our exports. The world will not be a safe or decent place in which to live, however, if it continues to divide between countries which are increasingly rich and those which are increasingly impoverished.\n', 'The knowledge that food, oil, fertilizer and financial credit are vital must not be the cause of international extortion; rather, our interdependence should provide a basis on which continuing international trade agreements can be reached. There is a danger that the recent economic successes of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel will encourage other confrontation by countries possessing scarce raw materials. This could be a serious and self-damaging mistake, resulting in a series of pyramiding and perhaps uncontrollable confrontations, leading to serious damage to the poorer and weaker nations.\n', ""A stable world order cannot become a reality when people of many nations of the world suffer mass starvation; when the countries with capital and technology belligerently confront other nations for the control of raw materials and energy sources; when open and discriminatory trade has become the exception rather than the rule; when there are no established arrangements for supplying the world's food and energy nor for governing, control, and development of the seas; and when there are no effective efforts to deal with population explosions or environmental quality.\n"", 'We must remember that because of our tremendous and continuing economic, military and political strength, the United States has an inevitable role of leadership to play within the community of nations. But our influence and respect should go beyond our military might, our political power, and our economic wealth—and be based on the fact that we are right, and fair, and decent, and honest, and truthful.\n', 'Our U.S. foreign policy must once again reflect the basic ideals of our people and our nation. We must reassert our vital interest in human rights and humanitarian concerns, and we must provide enlightened leadership in the world community. The people of the United States want to be trusted and respected, and we are determined, therefore, to be trustworthy and respectful of others.']"
8,Jimmy Carter ,"July 11, 1975","['A year and a half after the humiliating Arab oil embargo, with its devastating and continuing consequences for our economy, we still have the same national energy policy, developed and maintained by the oil and electric power companies: ""Use more and more energy and pay higher and higher prices for it.""\n', 'Misleading Presidential statements about ""Project Independence"" merely lulled our people into a false sense of continued trust in inept and timid leaders—while our dependence on foreign oil lunged upward.

Lower energy consumption inherently reduces world pollution levels. The elimination of waste and technological advances into new energy fields can result in enhanced employment opportunities without any reduction in the quality of our economic lives.\n', 'Unless we conserve energy drastically, make a major shift to coal, and substantially increase our use of solar energy, we will have no alternative to greatly increased dependence on nuclear power.

9,Jimmy Carter ,"November 23, 1975","['Introduction by Chair, Senator Hart.\n', ""Governor Carter. First of all, let me say I'm very pleased to be here to participate in a discussion that's of great importance to our people. Ordinarily during a Presidential campaign, unless our nation is actually at war we have an inadequate amount of attention paid to foreign affairs. Night before last in Waterloo, Iowa, I made a speech to about 1,100 people. My subject was foreign affairs. And this occasion is a very fine opportunity for us to reassess some basic problems with our present status as we relate to the community of nations, and to let us explore some possible solutions to those problems. In looking back, almost every time we've made a serious mistake as we relate to other nations—and we've made a lot of them—it's been because the American people have basically been excluded from participation in the evolution or consummation of attitudes toward other countries around the world. In Vietnam, Chile, Cambodia, Pakistan, the CIA revelations, there's been very little actual involvement of the American people as the decisions were made. We've been excluded; we've been lied to; and we have lost the tremendous advantage of the idealism and the common sense and the basic honesty and character of American people which should accurately exemplify and be exemplified by our nation's own character as it relates to other countries. [applause]\n"", 'I hope we\'ve learned some lessons. One lesson is that we should cease trying to intervene militarily in the internal affairs of other countries unless our own nation is endangered. [applause] If it were possible for us to establish democracy all over the world by military force, you might arouse an argument for it. But the attempt to do that is counterproductive. We\'ve seen that vividly in South Korea and also in South Vietnam. The Soviet Union, with the exception of street skirmishes in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, hasn\'t lost a single soldier in combat since the Second World War. We lost 34,000 in South Korea and 50,000 in South Vietnam, basically trying to tell other people what kind of government they ought to have, what kind of leader they should have—and it doesn\'t work. Either you have a repressive government taking away liberty from their people, as is the case in South Korea, to stay in office, and kicking us in the shins to demonstrate some superficial independence of us or, as was the case in South Vietnam, a constant overthrow of governments as they became acknowledged to be American puppets. When we go into a country and put our arms around somebody, and say, ""This is the leader who we want to be your President or your Prime Minister,"" no matter how popular they might be at the time, we put the political kiss of death on them. And the proud people who live in that country automatically react against a puppet. Had we spent another 50,000 lives and had we spent another $150 billion in South Vietnam and had we dropped the atomic bomb on North Vietnam, we still could not have propped up the governments of Thieu or Ky.\n', ""In the last 2 or 3 years, I've traveled as an official visitor to 11 foreign countries, in the Far East, the Mideast, South America, Central America, and Europe, and met with leaders there, and talked to them at length. I've also been in our embassies. And I think in the recent administrations, there has been a vivid demonstration of our attitude toward other people and our lack of respect for them in the quality of diplomatic officials appointed. When I go into an embassy in South America or Central America or Europe and see sitting as our ambassador, our representative there, a fat, bloated, ignorant, rich, major contributor to a Presidential campaign who can't even speak the language of the country in which he serves, and who knows even less about our own country and our consciousness and our ideals and our motivation, it's an insult to me and to the people of America and to the people of that country. [applause] And it ought to be changed.\n"", ""And quite often this results in a devastating loss of respect for our nation. I doubt if you would find any diplomats in Washington who don't speak English. But you go into a small country that's embryonic or weak or dark skinned, and you very seldom find a diplomat who can even speak their language, and they know it. But you won't find a Japanese diplomat or a Russian diplomat or a German diplomat there who can't speak their language and who doesn't seem to care about them. And when you come to a recent disgraceful vote that took place at the United Nations, on Zionism, and think that we lacked seven votes; if we could have changed just seven votes we could have avoided that disgraceful act, and we lost such support as Brazil and Mexico and many others. Those ought to be our friends, but they feel we have neglected them and relegated them to a secondary position of importance in the minds and hearts of the American people.\n"", 'There\'s another very serious defect which I hope we will discuss thoroughly this morning and later. That is that we have no interrelationship between economic policy and political policy and military policy. They\'re so closely interrelated as a practical matter that it\'s almost a truism to say it. But when I go to Brazil or to Colombia or to Costa Rica or to Japan or to Belgium to try to deal with those people in an equitable way on trade or cultural affairs or political matters, it\'s almost impossible to know where to go in Washington to get the answer to a question on long-range trade policies, export policies, import policies, credit, student exchange, tourism, normal business. Do you go to the Agriculture Department, the Defense Department, the State Department, the Commerce Department? You don\'t know. But other countries know; there\'s a close melding of government, industry, labor, agriculture working as a unit representing large countries like Germany, Russia, Japan, France, small countries like Bulgaria. We don\'t have that. The biggest obstacle to the proper interrelationship between our state when I was governor and a foreign country was the federal government. You can\'t get Ian answer to a question. You don\'t know what to do. We have no policy that I can understand that deals with the weak countries. What is our policy as it relates to the individual African nations? Or even our longtime historical friends in South America or Central America? Or even Canada? When I meet with those Presidents or Prime Ministers to talk about matters, one of the first questions they ask me is, ""Governor, Mr. Kissinger\'s been to the People\'s Republic of China seven times, he\'s been to Russia six or eight times, why has he never been to our country?""\n', 'I think if we have a weakness in foreign affairs—and we do—it\'s because the other nations of the world who think we ought to be leaders have lost respect for us. They don\'t think we tell the truth. We\'re not predictable. We don\'t respect them. And we\'ve lost their respect for us. That hurts me personally, and it hurts our country—to know that the more weak, or embryonic, or dark skinned a nation is, the less likely it is to say, ""I want my destiny to be tied to, I want my future to be connected with, that of the people of the United States."" They don\'t say that. They say, ""As a last resort I put my eggs in the Soviet Union\'s basket, or I put my eggs in the basket of China."" It has to be a mutual thing.\n', ""The last thing I want to say is this: We have an inevitable role of leadership to play. Even if countries don't trust us and don't respect us at this moment, because we're considered to be warlike; we're considered to be disrespectful to them; they still recognize that because of our innate political strength, the size of our country, our economic strength, our military strength, that we are going to be a major voice in the world, and we ought to assume that position. We can't withdraw from participation in the United Nations or its ancillary organizations, because that's where decisions are made which affect the lives of everyone who lives in Georgia or Kentucky, or Iowa. In food, population, freedom of the seas, international trade, stable monetary systems, environmental quality, access to commodities and energy and so forth we've got to be part of it. But our foreign policy ought not to be based on military might nor political power nor economic pressure. It ought to be based on the fact that we are right and decent and honest and truthful and predictable and respectful; in other words, that our foreign policy itself accurately represents the character and the ideals of the American people. But it doesn't. We have set a different standard of ethics and morality as a nation than we have in our own private lives as individuals who comprise the nation. And that ought to be changed. The President ought to be the spokesman for this country, not the Secretary of State. [applause] And when the President speaks, he ought to try to represent as accurately as he can what our people are. And that's the basis, I believe, on which a successful foreign policy can be based, to correct some of the defects we know about and to restore us once again as a nation that is loved, respected, and which has friends around the world. Thank you very much. [applause]\n"", 'Hart. Governor, thank you. [Hart introduces panel. First, Frances Fitzgerald, author of ""Fire in the Lake.""]\n', ""Fitzgerald. President Ford has said that the lessons of Vietnam have already been learned. Only he doesn't seem to know what these lessons are, quite. I'd like to ask each of the candidates what the lessons are that they have learned for themselves and what they would take with them for use in the White House. This is the general framework of the question, and I'd like to address also certain specific questions to each of the candidates. ...Governor Carter, you've cautioned against direct military intervention in the affairs of other countries. How about the various forms of indirect military intervention through military aid in great quantities, arms sales and so on?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Frances, I would say, too, that I think that our country is best served by minimizing as much as possible our dependence on military exports for stabilizing our economy and balancing the trade relationships [applause]. And in every instance, as President, I would minimize those sales. There are some cases where we can't make a flat statement about that. We obviously have a commitment which I think has been maintained and shared by the American people throughout the last 30 years or so to insure, for instance, that Israel has the military strength to exist in peace, and whatever military aid would be required, in my own judgment, after assessing the circumstances at the time, to insure Israel's strength, I would provide it.\n"", ""There are some problems though that relate to that. We haven't had a President who actually tried to supervise closely and manage a defense budgetary process in a long time. I would say that the most wasteful bureaucracy in Washington is undoubtedly in the Pentagon. We've got too many military bases overseas, 222, I think. We've got too many troops overseas. We've got too much dependence on atomic weapons. We've got too much dependence on the shipment of weapons to countries that don't need them, and we ought to minimize that drastically. I'd like to add one other thing before I stop, about Vietnam. I spelled out in my statement a fairly definitive analysis of how I feel. First of all, that we should never again inject ourselves in the internal affairs of another country, except in a completely legitimate and open way. Secondly, that the American people should be active participants in shaping our foreign policy. Third, that our nation should not lie any more to the American people, that we should not try to continue propping up military dictatorships and those that are completely at odds with our concept of government. And this is another very subtle thing that concerns me: We've done a lot in this country in the last 20 years to end racial discrimination within our own borders, but we still have a gross, I think unconscionable, attitude of racial discrimination in international affairs. I don't believe, for instance, that we would have ever bombed or strafed villages in France or Germany as we did in Vietnam, and this kind of attitude, of concentrating our own emphasis in foreign policy on the white-skinned people, is felt throughout the world. And I think we ought to end that, that's something else that I hope we've learned in Vietnam. So I would minimize exports of arms. And that outlines very briefly some of the points that I made previously of the lessons that I hope we have learned from Vietnam.\n"", '[Hart introduces next panelist, Richard Holbrook, editor of Foreign Policy magazine.]\n', 'Holbrook. Governor Carter, you said, and I quote, ""I do not think that any Palestinian state can be recognized by the United States or Israel until the Palestinians are willing to recognize Israel, although the shape of an ultimate solution will probably involve the recognition of the Palestinian people as a nation."" Does this statement mean that you are, in effect, urging Israel to trade recognition of a Palestinian state in return for Palestinian and Pan-Arab recognition of Israel?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, the design of my question—you quoted me accurately— was not to put pressure on Israel. But I think the community of nations has got to recognize some basic principles of a settlement on a permanent basis in the Middle East, and I think one of the integral parts of an ultimate settlement has got to be the recognition of the Palestinians as a people, as a nation, with a place to live and a right to choose their own leaders. When I was in Israel the last time, Mr. Alton, who is now the Foreign Minister, had proposed that the Palestinian people be given a place to live on the west bank of the Jordan. I presume that opinion still prevails, at least privately within Mr. Alton. And I think that also Jordan might very well acquiesce in yielding some parts on the eastern bank of the Jordan. But I would not as a nation recognize the PLO or Arafat as the spokesman for the Palestinian people, even though that might be an actual fact, until after Arafat agrees that Israel has a right to live, to exist, and to exist in peace as an integral part of the Middle Eastern community.\n', 'Holbrook. What is each of your positions, very briefly, on the growing dispute over renegotiation of the Panama Canal Treaty?\n', 'Governor Carter. In April of 1974 we had the Organization of American States meet in Atlanta, and I had the chance to talk not only to the Foreign Minister and others of Panama, but many of the leaders of the other 22 nations of this hemisphere. It\'s a very sensitive question, as you know, with the Latin American neighbors and friends of ours. I would try to work out some arrangement within these two limitations: First of all, I would not be in favor of relinquishing actual control of the Panama Canal or its use to any other nation, including Panama. I think we\'ve got to retain that actual practical control. On the other hand, I think there are several things that can be done to assuage the feeling among the Panamanians that they\'ve been excluded or perhaps even out-traded back in the 1903 period. So I would be glad to yield part of the sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. I would certainly be willing to renegotiate the payment terms to Panama and I would also be willing to remove the word ""perpetuity"" from the present agreement....\n', ""Holbrook. My next question refers to a so-far undernoticed phenomenon, but very serious consideration for the State Department and other people in Washington. It appears very possible that within a certain amount of time the Italian Government may have Communist ministers. A NATO country with the Communist ministers, in addition to the fact that already exists in Portugal. Some people feel we should make major efforts to prevent this from happening, up to and including covert action to do so. Others feel we should have nothing to do with the situation. I'd like each of you, starting with Governor Carter, to address this problem in both specific terms, and, if you wish, also to add a brief comment on the general question of intervention, but very specifically address how serious a problem you feel this is, and what should be done about it?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I really believe that the situation in Italy is not as serious as it was a year ago when Italy was on the verge of absolute, total bankruptcy and when many people who were quite conservative and even leaders of some of the major corporations felt that the Communists would do a better job of managing the nation's affairs than the present leaders. I think the situation has improved. I would certainly hate to see Italy go Communist. I think we ought to do everything we can within reasonable and open bounds through NATO, through our strengthening of the position of the more democratic leaders, to prevent it. As an ultimate thing, though, if it becomes obvious that the present government is incapable of leadership and the Communists are the choice of the people of Italy, which I don't think will occur, by the way, then I don't think we ought to intervene militarily or by any sort of covert means. That would include assassinations, for instance. I don't think that would be right.\n"", ""Senator Henry Jackson. Well, first I'd have to disagree with Governor Carter, and say that the situation has deteriorated in Italy. I met with Mr. Lungol, who is the head of the Social Democratic Party, and the situation in Parliament is about as follows: that they're within 48 or 49 percent of control. I think those are undisputed facts. ...[he generally agrees—let European social democratic parties do it but not covertly. Then Jackson and Shriver get into argument about the Helsinki agreement, and whether Jackson's Senate committee should be more aggressive about Russian violations. Argument gets a little heated.]\n"", 'Hart. Governor Carter, would you like to get into this?\n', 'Governor Carter. No; I join the audience in------\n', 'Jackson. Tell us what a governor would do?\n', 'Governor Carter. A governor would join the audience in enjoying this absurd discussion.\n', '[Hart introduces third panelist, Penn Kimble, executive director of the Coalition for a Democratic Majority.]\n', ""Kimble. Governor Carter, 88 Members of the U.S. Senate signed an amendment proposed by Senator Jackson in the last year's trade bill which would have denied favored trade status to the Soviet Union unless the Soviets relax their restrictions on emigration. Now you've been quite critical of that amendment in past statements. Do you believe that our trade relations should be related to humanitarian considerations, and if so, how?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes; I believe that our trade relations should be related to humanitarian considerations, but I think that the so-called ""Jackson amendment"" was ill-advised, and I think in the long run proved to be exactly counterproductive compared to what Senator Jackson honestly wanted to do, and that is to let the Jewish citizens emigrate from Russia to Israel. My information then, as governor, and I know it was given to several other governors and to Senator Jackson, was that quietly, but I think in an effective way, the Soviet Union had agreed to liberalize its Jewish emigration policies. The trade bill was then used as a vehicle publicly to force the Soviet Union, through an act of Congress, to release Jewish emigrants. Russia is a proud nation, like we are, and if Russian Communist leaders had passed a resolution saying that they were not going to do this or that if we didn\'t do something domestically, we would have reacted adversely to it. That\'s exactly what happened. I want to say this, I think that Senator Jackson\'s motives were absolutely impeccable. I think that he had the same motives that I do, that we want to have freedom of Jews to emigrate from Russia, but in that instance I believe that his amendment, which was adopted by the Senate, tied to a very tiny trade advantage for Russia, speaking on economic terms in a great nation category, did prevent Jews from emigrating who would otherwise have been permitted to emigrate had the amendment not been introduced.\n', '[Holbrook questions Jackson re SALT accords.]\n', ""Governor Carter. I would like to make one statement about the nuclear arms problems. When I announced as a candidate December 12 last year, in a speech to the National Press Club, I spelled out that this nation's avowed policy clearly and unequivocally should be that we stand for, and we will work for, and we will fight for, in diplomatic terms, a reduction of nuclear weapons in all nations to zero. This may not occur in my lifetime, but everything that we do as it relates to food, to trade, to the Middle East, to shipping, to environmental quality, ought to be designed to get rid of our growing dependence on atomic weapons. We now build about three or four per day, strategic weapons. We're going from 11,000 now to 21,000. We've gone from 800 MIRV missiles when Russia did zero up to 1,320. President Ford thinks this is a commitment, that we've got to reach those upper limits. That's just strategic nuclear weapons. It doesn't count the 7,000 tactical weapons in Europe or [short gap on tape] this inclination. We have to reduce dependence on atomic weapons. We have been the atomic weapons warmonger more than they have, and I hate to say anything good for the Soviet Union. But there's no reason for us to continue with peaceful testing of so-called nuclear devices, and we are not complying with the control of nuclear waste. We expect other nations to hold down their dependence on atomic weapons to zero when we are madly building as many as we can. The Russians didn't want to build as many ABM's as we did. We wanted to build 12, I think it was, finally we agreed to build 2, finally we built 1, 6 billion dollars' worth; now we are disassembling it. So there are a lot of things our country can do to hold down on atomic weapons races which we are not presently doing in a very tangible, very effective way. [applause]\n"", ""[Questions from the floor. Jim Luckett, recording secretary of Local 761, IUE, asks for convention resolution against forced busing—it's not producing quality education—for freedom of choice.]\n"", ""Governor Carter. This question of busing has been an integral part of the lives of those who live in the South for the last 15 or 20 years. We have dealt with it as best we could. And I'd like to express as succinctly as I can a view that I think has been evolved after a long and torturous ordeal. And perhaps what we have accomplished there can be some guidance for the rest of the country, that is now going through the same phase of school integration. I'm not looking for applause and don't want any. I just want to say this. The best thing that ever happened to the South in my lifetime was the passage of the Civil Rights acts and the complete integration of our schools, our public facilities [applause] and the granting to black people of a chance to work, to live, to attend public facilities as they choose. It would be almost incomprehensible for those who live outside the South to know what has occurred there. And I will be very quick with this. I have one (laughter who is 8 years old, she came to me and Rosalynn when we had been married 21 years, we really love her; and we have three older sons. Last year she was in the second grade in the place where we live, a little town called Plains, total population 683. We have a majority of black citizens there. We live in harmony and peace. In Amy's second grade classroom of the public schools last year she had 13 white classmates, 16 black classmates, a black teacher, a white principal, and that is absolutely typical throughout the rural parts of Georgia. And that's the way we like it. She goes there because we want her to be in an integrated school. She likes it, her mother likes it, and I like it. And this is typical.\n"", 'We have tried in Atlanta mandatory busing. It did not work. The only kids I have ever seen bused are poor children. I have never seen a rich child bused. The rich parents either move or they put their kids in private schools. At first it is very important to the black citizens to have the busing order, and this is a phase that you have to go through, and I think maybe it\'s a mandatory phase. I don\'t argue with it. But eventually the poor parents, mostly blacks, say, ""We don\'t want our kids bused any more to a distant school,"" because these are the very parents who don\'t have a second car, and if their children get sick in the middle of the day or if they want to go to athletic events, they can\'t go. So the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, quite liberal, finally said to the NAACP, the SCLC, and to myself as governor and to Mayor Sam Massell, who happens to be Jewish, and the vice mayor, Maynard Jackson, who is black, to sit down and work out a plan that suited us. And this is the plan that we worked out. It is very simple and easily described, and it suits the NAACP and others. First of all, any child who wants to be bused can be bused at public expense. Second, the busing must contribute to increase integration. You can\'t be bused away from a school just because it\'s got black kids in it. Third, and this is missing completely in Boston and a lot of other cities, but it\'s integral for an ultimate solution—the black leaders have to be adequately represented in the decision making processes of a school system at all levels, so the black people will feel, ""That\'s my school system too, it\'s not just a white folks9 school system that my kids have to go to."" And last, and this is important in my opinion, no child is bused against the wishes of the child. That\'s what we\'ve evolved; it\'s been in effect for 2 or 3 years, and it\'s worked. I guess that at the end of 4 or 5 more years in Louisville and Boston and many other places, the Atlanta plan is going to be what is accepted by black and white citizens. I might add one other thing as a political candidate: that\'s my preference, but when I\'m President, I will be sworn to uphold the law, and if federal courts rule differently from what I believe I will support the federal court [applause]. But I believe this is not the subject to be reopened with a constitutional amendment. I would really hate to see that done [applause].\n', ""Brewster Rhodes. [Coalition for a New Foreign Policy]. I'd like to get the discussion back to the question of foreign policy, national priorities, and the institution that reflects our current foreign policy, the military budget. This spring the new congressional budget process will be fully implemented as Congress considers its 1977 budget. The new congressional budget process for the first time puts the military budget over $100 billion at this point, in direct competition for limited federal funds with social services, areas like health, education, public jobs programs. In order to pay for these much needed domestic needs that face our country today, with this limited budget that we're going to be dealing with next year, I would like to ask each of the three candidates before they leave the stage if they could tell me if they support a major across-the-board cut in the military budget this spring in order to pay for those much needed social services.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, it's hard for me to define what you mean by a major cut in the military expenditures.\n"", 'Rhodes. More than $7 billion.\n', ""Governor Carter. I would not agree that we need a cut in the major expenditures for our defense below a figure such as $7 or $8 billion. The cuts that are made ought to leave us with a tough, muscular, simply organized, effective fighting force able to defend our country instantly if we are attacked. I don't think we've got that now. What we have is kind of a bloated bureaucracy in the Pentagon, too many troops overseas, too many military bases overseas, too many support troops per combat troop, too many major military officers and generals, Selective Service System still intact, the Corps of Engineers building dams we don't need, excessive levels of bureaucracy, and no control from the White House. The President has got to be the one to stand with the American people against the unwarranted influence of the so-called military-industrial complex, which has gotten out of control, because an average Congressman, if he or she disagrees with the military budget, finds it very hard to prevail, even in his home district, against the joint commitment of the President and the Pentagon. So I think the President once again has to reassert authority over it. But I Would not favor cutting the substance out of our military budget. Hl give you one example to show you my concern. About 6 years ago, we had 1,100 ships in the Navy; now we have about 500.\n"", ""Six years ago the Russians had about 600 ships; now they've got almost twice as many. And in order to maintain peace, and to provide trade channels to go to Israel, to go through the Suez Canal, to go through the Mediterranean Sea, to go to Japan, to bring oil and bauxite to our country, we've got to have those sea lanes open. And I think this is a very fine investment to make, but it ought not be designed to encroach all over the world in an unwarranted fashion in the affairs of other people. But I would not agree that we need a substantial cut in the military budget more than a figure in the neighborhood of $7 or $8 billion. I might add one other thing: Brookings Institution has made a study that showed that if you cut $1 billion out of the 1976 fiscal year budget, it's the equivalent of about a $5 billion reduction in the 1980 budget. So I think careful, long-range planning and, for the first time, a coordination between military spending and the effectuation of a foreign policy that's viable in the defense of our country would help a great deal. We don't have that coordination now.\n"", ""Jean Cooper [Women's Caucus]. For too many years this country has supported right-wing dictatorship as an integral part of its foreign policy.

I think that I gave you the best answer I could in my 5-minute speech earlier. Do you want me to repeat what I said or just------\n', 'Cooper. Governor Carter, I realize that you have touched on this subject, but will you refuse, or direct Congress not to give any support to regimes such as this, or will you feel obliged if Congress does pass legislation giving foreign aid et cetera, to such countries to go along with It?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I couldn't promise you that never during an 8-year period in the White House [laughter and applause] will I ever trade with or give aid to a country that has a government contrary to what we want. But I would certainly never repeat what we have done in the areas that you described, that is, openly or covertly, legally and illegally, support nations who stand for principles on which their people violently disagree and which are completely antithetical to what we believe in. I think we have been guilty of this many times in the past, and as you well know, it's been counterproductive when we do support a regime, even if it's on a borderline, just our own military or CIA or pressure kind of support puts the stigma on that regime or person that they are an American puppet. And it tends to destroy the democratic principles that we are trying to espouse. Quite often, as you know, in our foreign aid program, we have used this benevolent concept, which is compatible with the American people's interest to help others who are deprived or who are suffering, in a complete opposite way. I think Prof. Richard Gardner expressed it in the best way that I know. He said that although we are a rich country, and we want to help other people, it's time to quit taxing the poor people in our rich country and giving the money to the rich people in the poor countries. I think that's a good solution to it, and it summarizes, I think, what you've said so well.\n"", ""Vernon Leopold. [From Oakland County, Michigan State Democratic Party Policy Committee]. During the last 2 years, the American people have been fleeced of billions of dollars by an international oil cartel. The cartel took advantage of an abundance of oil reserves in its part of the world and has been able to dictate a threefold increase in the price of oil, accelerating inflation domestically and abroad. Yet these very nations lack for the most part all natural resources, and their poor soil and arid climate make it almost impossible for them to grow grain and wheat and feed. The United States, on the other hand, has become the breadbasket of the world. The natural richness of our soil, combined with our agricultural technology and know-how, make us now the chief supplier of world grain and food supplies, to the point where we export badly needed food to the very countries who put the squeeze on us. Also the Soviet Union, under the guise of détente, has been purchasing and trading in this country, mostly through centralized Soviet Government trading agencies, which put the small American sellers of those products al a competitive disadvantage, they can't bargain. Now, therefore, let me put this question to the panel: Would you favor legislation which would create a foreign trade corporation which would become the sole exporter and importer of products which would be declared to be effected with the national interest? These could include grains, but other supplies. This agency would then be empowered to buy these products domestically at prevailing market prices and sell them abroad selectively at predetermined profits, and the profits would then be applied either toward the reduction of the cost of imported energy, and/or to finance crash programs for the development of ultimate sources of energy, such as, by way of examples, nuclear fusion.\n"", ""Governor Carter. The way I understand your proposal, there would be a government entity that would manage the foreign trade between our own nation and other countries, accumulating food supplies and other things that we have to export, and controlling imports as well to this government agency. That would be completely contrary to my own concept of trade. I think the federal government has got too many things already that it's supposed to be doing, that it's not doing well, to take over the complete free enterprise type foreign trade program that is so complicated. I would not want to see food products—I happen to be a full-time farmer—sold to other countries through a government agency.

10,Jimmy Carter ,"March 14, 1976","['George Herman. Governor Carter, a CBS and New York Times poll has found that liberal voters seem to think that you are a liberal candidate, conservative voters think you are a conservative candidate, and moderate voters think you are a moderate candidate. The numbers are pretty hard on that. Does that indicate to you that you have perhaps campaigned as a sort of a wishy-washy candidate, being all things to all people, and not taking any particular position yourself?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I take specific positions. I think what it indicates is that people don't like to be put in boxes. What used to be straight liberal attitude in a very ideological way, and what used to be conservative attitudes are very much clouded in the public's mind. For instance, I've had very strong support from blacks; I've had very strong support from tough businessmen who want to see the government run properly; and in between good support from a wide range of supporters, both in New Hampshire, Florida, and also in Maine and Vermont and Iowa, and I don't think that the voters are in doubt about what I say; they just feel that I'm the kind of person they can trust, and if they are liberal, I think I'm compatible with their views. If they are moderate, the same; and if the voter is conservative, I think they still feel that I'm a good President. So I think this is a kind of image that's a good one; it's based on compatibility with voters, not because they've put me in little boxes as a certain sort of ideologically committed person.\n"", ""Herman. Governor Carter, you say that you think liberals consider you a liberal, and moderates a moderate, and so forth, because of the blurring of the labels and the categories, and you jay you have taken issues, stands on the issues. Yet some of the stands you've taken on the issues seem to some critics to be a little bit blurry. For example, the right-to-work law, the repeal of the right-to-work law; it's certainly not the most important issue in the country, nevertheless you've said that you will sign such a repeal if it should be passed, and you are also on record as opposing such a repeal.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, when I was running for Governor of Georgia, I told the labor leaders and also the public that if the Georgia legislature repealed the right-to-work laws that I would be glad to sign it into law. Now that was when my responsibilities were in Georgia. At that time I did not favor a repeal of 14—B, which is a national law. Now that I approach the Presidency, as a potential President, I've taken the same position, which I think is fairly consistent, although there is some inconsistency there, I admit, but I want everybody to understand that if the Congress passes a repeal of 14—B, that I'll be glad to sign it into law.\n"", ""Novak. Governor, in line with this question of wishy-washiness and indeterminant positions, you have said constantly on your campaign that you're in favor of national, comprehensive, mandatory health insurance, but you don't tell how it would be financed, how much it would cost, and whether it would be under private or public auspices. Are you prepared to say that today, or do you think the public doesn't need to know your answers to that question?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't know the answer yet. There are two phases of a national, comprehensive, mandatory health insurance program that I'd like to reserve the right to decide later on, when I have more time to study it. I would presume that before the general election is over, if I am nominated, I'd spell it out specifically. But I would like to reserve the right to include the private sector, say, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, as a copartner with the federal government in the administration of a national health insurance program. And as far as the exact percentages that would be derived from general funds, employees' and employer contributions, that's another subject that I don't yet know about my exact stand, but I think that's not very important to the voters. What they want to know is, are we going to have a national, comprehensive, mandatory health insurance program. I'm committed to that, and will work hard as President to get it implemented.\n"", ""Rabel.

Well, there is no way for me to envision at this point as a fulltime candidate which particular agencies in the federal government would survive 3 years after I'm in the White House. It took me a full year just to study Georgia's government, when we had 300 agencies to start with; we abolished 278 of them, through consolidation or complete elimination. But we now have about 1,900, perhaps more, in the federal government, and I intend to cut those down to no more than 200.

We have 42 responsible for education; which ones of those should survive, I can't say, but I certainly know that we don't need 42 agencies responsible for education.\n"", ""Novak. Governor, I'll give you a question you don't have to take off from campaigning to answer, and that is that in your—no matter how many agencies you eliminated in Georgia, the payroll in your 4 years as governor increased about 24 percent in the state. Now in the federal government, would you reduce the federal payroll, and if so, by how much, forgetting about how many agencies you eliminate?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I can't say that I would. We reduced administrative costs tremendously in Georgia, and shifted the saved money into better services for our people. This resulted in a drastic reduction in the growth of the state payroll; the last year I was in office, the payroll increased about 2.4 percent, and I can certainly guarantee that administrative costs in the federal government would be reduced drastically, compared to total costs.\n"", 'Novak. But a lot of people have the idea that you would decrease the number of federal bureaucrats; actually, you would keep about the same number or more on, is that correct?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't say they would be exactly the same or more, but the portion of our federal budget that goes to administrative costs will be cut substantially. We did it in Georgia; there is no doubt in my mind that it can be done in the federal government.\n"", 'Novak. But you did increase the payroll?\n', 'Governor Carter. Total, yes; but this was in mental health centers, better prison reform, more teachers, better alcoholism treatment centers, and so forth, out of desk jobs, administrative jobs, into service jobs, yes, that did occur.\n', ""Herman. Let's talk about campaigning for a moment since you bring that up. What are your campaign plans? What is your strategy for the next period?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I'm immediately looking at the next four states, which are Chicago, Illinois areas, Tuesday, and then North Carolina a week from Tuesday, and then the following week Kansas, and Virginia. That's the next four states, encompassing about 325 delegates. And then the following two states, the fifth and sixth ones, will be New York and Wisconsin on the 6th of April, which have about the same number of delegates, about 340.\n"", ""Herman. How do you think you'll do in Illinois?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think I'll do well. I've got two tough opponents there—well, maybe three tough ones. George Wallace is making an all-out effort in Illinois, so is Sargent Shriver, who formerly lived and worked in Illinois, as you know, plus Fred Harris, who has some very fervent supporters. Then North Carolina will be another showdown vote------\n"", 'Herman. Let me stop at Illinois for a moment. I hate to get into this numbers game, but perhaps we should have some idea right now what you think you need to do in Illinois?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I would like to come in first in the preferential primary. That's what I would need to do to be pleased, and we are challenging 84 delegates in Illinois—I would like very much to get at least a fourth of those, and show to the other uncommitted delegates, or those who are committed to the so-called Stevenson slate, which is controlled to a substantial degree by Mayor Daley, or the Walker slate, which is for the governor, that I do have strong support in Illinois. I think it would help me later on when the time comes for those voters to make—delegates to make a final decision, if I can do well in their district, and say, look, I carried the votes of your own people back home, therefore you ought to support me in the convention—it would help a lot. So I'd say at least a fourth of the challenged delegates, plus to win the primary.\n"", 'Herman. Governor, you really need, sooner or later you are going to need the votes and the delegates of the big, industrial northern states, are you not? Or can you write those off?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I'm not writing off anything.\n"", 'Herman. No; but you do need them?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes------\n', 'Herman. Do you require them? Are they an important part of your strategy?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; it is, and of course Illinois is the first time that I'm really going all out to win delegates and votes. But I might point out that that's kind of an idle exercise because in the 13 southern states, which for instance are being written off completely by Senator Jackson, there are about the same number of votes as exist in Michigan, plus Pennsylvania, plus Ohio, phis New York.\n"", 'Herman. 678 delegates.\n', ""Governor Carter. I believe so, and that's about the same as the top four states in the East, so I think that's a good------\n"", 'Herman. How about those four states—New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Ohio, with their 737 delegates?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, we're going to do as well as we can in all four of those states. I've entered all of them, but the point is that my opponents are just writing off a total region of the country.\n"", 'Herman. Can you win and will you win a substantial portion of those 737 northern industrial state delegates?\n', ""Governor Carter. I believe so; yes, sir. We've got good strong support in Ohio, well-organized there, and in Pennsylvania. We'll do well in Michigan. In New York, this is a very difficult state because it's still fairly well controlled by the political bosses of New York. We just recently, this week, got the legislature—and others—attempting to—to put my name on the ballot at all, and now my opponents, particularly Senator Jackson, is challenging on technicalities my right to have delegates in the different districts, but we'll do the best we can under those adverse circumstances.\n"", ""Novak. Governor, when you were asked on the campaign trail about foreign policy, I noticed that you always make a criticism and get a great deal of applause for it, that one of the things wrong with our foreign policy u that whenever you walk into an embassy and see, quote, a fat, bloated, ignorant, rich, major contributor to Nixon, who can't even speak the language of the country in which he serves, you think that's part of what's wrong with our foreign policy. Governor, can you name one such fat, ignorant, bloated ambassador who can't speak the language?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No; I wouldn't want to name any.\n"", 'Novak. Well, can you name one, though? You make the accusation nil over. There are only four ambassadors, Governor, who gave contributions to Mr. Nixon. Are any of them that fit that category?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I wouldn't want to name names, but the point that I'm nuking is, and I don't do it every time I make a foreign policy speech------\n"", 'Novak. Pretty nearly.\n', ""Governor Carter. Every now and then I do, but not often. When I've been in foreign countries, and go into the embassies, it's obvious from talking to the people in the countries, and talking to the ambassadors, that they are not qualified to be diplomats for this country. They are all appointed as a political payoff. The point I make is that whether they are actually fat or thin, that they are appointed because there are political interrelationships and not because of quality. Now, the last time I was in Europe, for instance, out of 33 ambassadors who served in the whole European theatre, only three of them were professional diplomats. The others were appointed for political reasons.\n"", ""Novak. Governor, your credibility has been challenged by your critics and by some people in the press, and there are only 4 people who are now serving as ambassadors who gave money to Nixon. Three of them know the language of the country that they work in, and one of them is taking language training. Isn't that bordering on demagoguery when you make a flat statement about these kind of, quote, fat, bloated ignorant ambassadors?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't believe so. I think it illustrates a point very clearly, and when you say presently serving, I presume that you're not including those who have served in the last 3 or 4 years.\n"", ""Novak. Well, you're talking about the present foreign policy------\n"", ""Governor Carter. I was talking about the countries where I visited in the last 4 years, while I was governor and since then. I don't know exactly who the ambassadors are now, I haven't visited foreign countries in recent months, except Japan.\n"", 'Novak. Are you going to continue to use that formulation and get applause from it?\n', 'Governor Carter. I may or may not.\n', ""Rabel. Governor, there is something else you do on the campaign trail. In front of some audiences you tick off the names of great Americans like Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr. And I've noticed, though, in front of some all white audiences you omit the name of Martin Luther King. Now, do you do that intentionally, or have you just forgotten his name?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No. As a matter of fact, when you and some of the other newsmen asked me that on the plane the other day, it had not been a deliberate thing. What I ordinarily do, if the audience does have black people in it, I always do include Martin Luther King's name, even if there is only two or three black people in the whole audience. But since that was pointed out to me, I have very carefully included Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s name and I am going to continue to do it.\n"", 'Rabel. Did you do it intentionally before?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; it wasn't. Except that I always intentionally put Martin Luther King's name in if there were black people in the audience, because he was a great American.\n"", 'Rabel. Why did you leave it out when they were all white?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, it was not a deliberate thing, and it won't be done anymore, but it was just a reaction to the audience, and the leaders in which they would be interested.\n"", ""Herman. Governor, I gather that Senator Jackson irritated you a little bit during the course of the Massachusetts primary, and you said, I believe, that while you were in Florida, that Senator Jackson exploited an issue that has racist connotations, and you said, I don't want to win that kind of a race. Now, checking back through the files, I find that famous AP dispatch of February 1972 that quotes you as saying that you would support in your own state, a statewide boycott of schools only if the General Assembly fails to pass a resolution calling for a constitutional amendment prohibiting busing, And that then you might support a boycott of schools as a last resort. Isn't that a kind of a campaign—or not a campaign, but a statement with racist connotations?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I think not. At that time, of course, I was not a candidate. I was governor.\n', 'Herman. I understand.\n', ""Governor Carter. And I was faced with a massive effort supported by many political figures in Georgia to mount an all-out boycott against our public school system because of the threat of busing in Augusta. As an alternative to the boycott, and in order to hold down racial tension in the state, I said that a better way to handle it was to let the legislature pass a simple nonbinding resolution calling on the Congress to address the issue through a constitutional amendment, rather than having all of our kids leave the schools all over Georgia. The impact of my statement would defuse racial tension, and I don't think it was designed to prey on the divisive and emotional and racist attitudes that did exist in a few of our people.\n"", 'Herman. If you were elected President, how do you think you would be able to exert some leadership on the question of schools and integration? Do you have some ideas, some formulas, for achieving certain forms of integration without busing?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think so. One way is that I could use my own family and my own background as an example. I think that the passage of the Civil Rights Acts was the best thing that ever happened to the South in my lifetime. The integration of our schools has not been a step backward for us; it has been a step forward. I think we've made a lot of progress in the South, and I think most southerners are proud of it. I'm not in favor of mandatory busing. We tried it in the South, and it didn't work. The only kids that ever got bused were the poor children. I've never seen a rich child bused. So we worked out in Atlanta a busing system that is my favorite, and I would emphasize this, but I've also made it clear that as President, I would be sworn to uphold the law, and if the federal courts ruled contrary to my own personal desire, that I would support the federal court. Also, I do not favor a constitutional amendment to prohibit busing, I think it would be a very divisive thing.\n"", ""Herman. This is the second time this kind of issue has come up in this program—in this broadcast, and it disturbs me a little bit because I keep hearing you saying that you would follow, rather than that you would lead, if such and such a law were passed you would sign it. In your theory, doesn't the President have some ability and some obligation to lead and to try to get things done himself, rather than simply signing things that come to him?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I certainly do. And to provide equality of opportunity for black people and other minority groups in the schools would be a very important responsibility of mine as President. I think I met that responsibility very clearly in Georgia. As a matter of fact, if there is one uniform base of support that I've demonstrated in all the primaries so far, it is support of black people who have seen what I have done in Georgia as governor, and I would maintain the same posture toward black people as President. But I still would have to say, that I can't mislead the people by saying that I would undo Supreme Court rulings, or if a court ruled contrary to my own beliefs that I would try to fight against a court. I would support the court rulings, even if it did disagree with what I basically believe is best.\n"", 'Novak. Governor, you tend to have it both ways on both busing and abortion by saying you are opposed to forced busing, and you are opposed to abortion, but you would not attempt to amend the Constitution on either issue. Is that because you think you would fail to amend the Constitution, or do you have some philosophical complaint against any further amendments to the Constitution?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't have any philosophical commitments that would be overriding, but we, for 15 or 20 years, in the South, have dealt with the race issue. It was very divisive for us, a very difficult question for us to face. We faced it well. And there was a lot of bloodshed, a lot of heartache. But, I would not favor trying to prohibit busing in the states of the country by passing a constitutional amendment. It would just reopen old wounds and old sores, and have every legislature bogged down in debating back and forth whether or not to try and prevent busing with a constitutional amendment I think that is the wrong way to go about it. We have successfully overcome that problem, and I think that Boston, and other places now, are 10 to 15 years behind the South. I think that eventually they will come basically to the Atlanta plan, which says voluntary busing is OK, but the blacks have to be adequately represented in running the school system. That's my preference, and I don't favor a constitutional amendment on that subject.\n"", 'Novak. I just brought up the abortion issue and you say on the campaign slump that some people think that abortion is murder. Do you?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's a hard question for me to answer. I have a deep feeling that abortion is wrong. At what stage in the development of the fetus it becomes murder, I can't say. But I wish that there were never any abortions. It really bothers me about it. The Supreme Court has ruled that the first 13 weeks the mother and doctor have a right to have an abortion. I wish that there were no abortions but I can't say at what point the abortion becomes murder.\n"", 'Rabel. Governor, many liberals who supported you through the Florida primary, supported you because they felt you could defeat George Wallace, and you did defeat him there, are now having second thoughts about continuing their support. Do you need them now to win the Democratic nomination—the liberals?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, as a matter of fact, I don't agree with your premise. I have seen a shift of many of—several of the liberals who were holding back toward me since the Massachusetts primary. I think my liberal strength has been increasing since Massachusetts, and I believe that after Florida it will continue. Yes, I do need them, very badly, and would like to have them. Some of the leading liberal political activists, particularly in Washington, have never known me, and I've never had a chance to know them, and they've been very reluctant to support me, but they are fine people and I would very much like to have their support, yes.\n"", 'Herman. Governor, this brings up perhaps the most unpleasant question I have to ask you, and that is one of sort of sectarian—a sectional rivalry. There has been a lot of talk that some people in the South believe that liberals in the North are rejecting you because you are a southerner, and I detect a good deal of anger in the South at the idea that northerners cannot support you because you are a southerner. Do you feel that way? Do you feel that northerners have some anti-southern bigotry or prejudice about you?\n', ""Governor Carter. Just a few. I haven't suffered because I'm a southerner, politically speaking.\n"", 'Herman. You have not?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe so. I did very well in Maine, very well in Vermont, very well in New Hampshire. In fact, out of the first four New England primaries, I carried three of them first place. There is still some difficulty in my convincing some northern liberals that a southerner can be a good, honest, decent, nonbiased President.\n"", 'Herman. Are you implying that this prejudice that you encounter is among northern liberals?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right. What there is of it. But I want to hasten to say that I don't consider it to be a major factor. I think this is a tiny majority, I mean a tiny minority, and it doesn't concern me because of the results of the election so far, but I wish it didn't exist at all, and I believe that the fear of me because I am from the South is dissipating rapidly.\n"", 'Novak. Governor, when you are ever asked about your desire to cut the defense budget $7 or $8 billion, you always mention how many generals or admirals there are; do you know, either in percentages or in flat amounts, what the cost of the salaries of the generals and admirals is?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I don't.\n"", ""Novak. It's four-tenths of 1 percent—four one-hundredths of I percent of $41 million. Don't you think that also borders on exaggeration in making that a major issue?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No; it doesn't, because the actual number of admirals and generals is mirrored all the way down through the ranks. We have too much of an overload of bureaucracy in the Defense Department. As I said many times, we have more admirals and generals than we had when we had 11 million Americans in uniform at the end of the Second World War. And when you have an admiral, you've got an awful lot of people under him who are almost admirals. We've got an admiral now for 1.7 ships, we've got 8 captains for every ship, which I think is ridiculous.\n"", 'Herman. I have to interrupt this flow of statistics and thank you very much, Governor Carter, for being with us on Face the Nation.\n', 'Governor Carter. Thank you.']"

In an age when almost all of the world's people are tied together by instant communication, the image of a country, as seen through its policies, has a great deal to do with what it can accomplish through the traditional channels of diplomacy.\n"", 'Fourth, our policies should be aimed at building a just and peaceful world order, in which every nation can have a constructive role.

Of course, there are rivalries—racia', religious, national, some of them bitter.

Every nation wants to be free from the threat of blackmail by international terrorists and hijackers. Every nation, including those of OPEC, sits on limited resources of energy that are running out.

A stable world order cannot become a reality when people of many nations of the world suffer mass starvation or when there are no established arrangements to deal with population growth or environmental quality.

But the majority of its leaders are moderate men and women who are prepared to work with us. When we ignore the Third World, as we have for so long, the extremists will usually have their way. But if we offer programs based on common interests, we can make common cause with most of their leadership.\n', 'Our program of international aid to developing nations should be redirected so that it meets the minimum human needs of the greatest number of people. This means an emphasis on food, jobs, education, and public health—including access to family planning. The emphasis in aid should be on those countries with a proven ability to help themselves, instead of those that continue to allow enormous discrepancies in living standards among their people. The time has come to stop taxing poor people in rich countries for the benefit of rich people in poor countries.\n', 'In our trade relations with these nations we should join commodity agreements in such items as tin, coffee, and sugar which will assure adequate supplies to consumers, protect our people from inflation, and at the same time stop the fluctuation in prices that can cause such hardship and uncertainty in single-commodity countries.\n', 'The burden of economic development is going to be a heavy one. There are many countries which ought to share it, not only in Europe and Asia but in the Mideast. Today, a greater proportion of royalties from oil can be channeled to the Third World by international institutions. Tomorrow, they can receive a part of the profits from the mining of the seas. The purpose of such development is not to level the economic lot of every person on earth. It is to inject the wealth-creating process into countries that are now stagnant; it is to help developing countries to act in what is their own best interest as well as ours—produce more food, limit population growth, and expand markets, supplies, and materials. It is simply to give every country a sufficient stake in the international order so that it feels no need to act as an outlaw. It is to advance the cause of human dignity.\n', 'We must also work with the countries of the communist world. The policy of East-West détente is under attack today because of the way it has been exploited by the Soviet Union. The American people were told it would mean a ""generation of peace,"" at no risk to the nation\'s vital interests. And yet, in places like Syria or Angola, in activities like offensive missile development, the Soviets seem to be taking advantage of the new relationship to expand their power and influence, and increase the risk of conflict.\n', 'I support the objectives of détente, but I cannot go along with the way it has been handled by Presidents Nixon and Ford. The Secretary of State has tied its success too closely to his personal reputation. As a result, he is giving up too much and asking for too little. He is trumpeting achievements on paper while failing to insist on them in practice.\n', 'The relationship of détente is one of both cooperation and competition, of new kinds of contacts in some areas along with continued hostility in others. In the troubled history of our relationships with the Soviet Union, this is where we have arrived. The benefits of détente must accrue to both sides, or they are worthless. Their mutual advantage must be apparent, or the American people will not support the policy.\n', 'To the Soviets, dltente is an opportunity to continue the process of world revolution without running the threat of nuclear war. They have said so quite openly, as recently as 1 month ago at their 25th Party Congress. To the Soviet Union, with our acquiescence, dltente is surface tranquility in Europe within boundaries redefined to their benefit together with support for wars of national liberation elsewhere. It is having the benefits of the Helsinki Accords without the requirement of living up to the human rights provisions which form an integral part of it. This is not the road to peace but the bitter deception of the American people.\n', 'But while dltente must become more reciprocal, I reject the strident and bellicose voices of those who would have this country return to the days of the cold war with the Soviet Union. I believe the American people want to look to the future. They have seen the tragedy of American involvement in Vietnam and drawn appropriate lessons for tomorrow. They seek new vistas, not a repetition of old rhetoric and old mistakes.\n', 'It is in our interest to try to make ddtente broader and more reciprocal. Détente can be an instrument for long-term peaceful change within the Communist system, as well as in the rest of the world. We should make it clear that dltente requires that the Soviets, as well as the United States, refrain from irresponsible intervention in other countries. The Russians have no more business in Angola than we have.\n', 'The core of ditente is the reduction in arms. We should negotiate to reduce the present SALT ceilings on offensive weapons before both sides start a new arms race to reach the current maximums, and before new missile systems are tested or committed for production.\n', 'I am not afraid of hard bargaining with the Soviet Union. Hard bargaining will strengthen support for the agreements that can be reached, and will show that we, as well as they, can gain from ditente. We can increase the possibility that the fear of war and the burden of arms may be lifted from the shoulders of humanity by the nations that have done the most to place it there.\n', 'Our vision must be of a more pluralistic world and not of a Communist monolith. We must pay more attention to China and to Eastern Europe. It is in our interest and in the interest of world peace to promote a more pluralistic Communist world.\n', 'We should remember that Eastern Europe is not an area of stability and it will not become such until the Eastern European countries regain their independence and become part of a larger cooperative European framework. I am concerned over the long-range prospects for Rumanian and Yugoslavian independence, and I deplore the recent infliction upon Poland of a constitution that ratifies its status as a Soviet satellite. We must reiterate to the Soviets that an enduring American-Soviet ddtente cannot ignore the legitimate aspirations of other nations. We must likewise insist that the Soviet Union and other countries recognize the human rights of all citizens who live within their boundaries, whether they be blacks in Rhodesia, Asians in Uganda, or Jews in the Soviet Union.\n', 'Our relations with China are important to world peace and they directly affect the world balance. The United States has a great stake in a nationally independent, secure, and friendly China. The present turmoil in Chinese domestic politics could be exploited by the Soviets to promote a Sino-Soviet reconciliation which might be inimical to international stability and to American interests. I believe that we should explore more actively the possibility of widening American-Chinese trade relations and of further consolidating our political relationships.\n', ""The Middle East is a key testing area for our capacity to construct a more cooperative international system. I believe deeply that a Middle East peace settlement is essential to American interests, to Israel's long-range survival and to international cooperation. Without a settlement, the region will become increasingly open to Soviet influence and more susceptible to radical violence. I believe that the United Stales should insure Israel's security while at the same time encourage both sides to address themselves to the substance of a genuine settlement.\n"", 'There is no question that both Africa and Latin America have been ignored since the Presidencies of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. These areas should become, and indeed will become, increasingly important in the next decade. Our relationships with these must abandon traditional paternalism. The United States-Brazilian agreement, signed recently by Secretary of State Kissinger on his trip to Latin America, is a good example of our present policy at its worst. Kissinger\'s remarks during his visit that ""there are no two people whose concern for human dignities and for the basic values of man is more profound in day-to-day life than Brazil and the United States"" can only be taken as a gratuitous slap in the face of all those Americans who want a foreign policy that embodies our ideals, not subverts them.\n', 'If our aim is to construct an international order, we must also work through the international bodies that now exist. On many of these issues, they are the only places where nations regularly come together. We have all been deeply disturbed by the drift of the United Nations and the other international organizations, and by the acrimony and cliquishness that seems to have taken hold. But it would be a mistake to give up on the United Nations.\n', 'In the future, we should make multilateral diplomacy a major part of our efforts so that other countries know in advance the importance the United States attaches to their behavior in the United Nations and other international oiganizations. We should make a major effort at reforming and restructuring the U.N. systems.\n', 'We should undertake a systematic political and economic cost-benefit analysis of existing international institutions in the United Nations systems and outside, with a view to determining the appropriate level of U.S. support. We should end the current diplomatic isolation of the United States in international forums by working more closely with our allies and with moderate elements in the developing world on a basis of mutual understanding consistent with our respective national interests.\n', ""A stable world order cannot become a reality when people of many nations of the world suffer mass starvation, when the countries with capital and technology belligerently confront other nations for the control of raw materials and energy sources, when open and nondiscriminatory trade has become the exception rather than the rule, when there are no established arrangements for supplying the world's food and energy, nor for governing control and development of the seas, and when there are no effective efforts to deal with population explosions or environmental quality. The intensity of these interrelated problems is rapidly increasing and better mechanisms for consultation on these problems that affect everyone on this planet must be established and utilized.\n"", 'For it is likely that in the future, the issues of war and peace will be more a function of economic and social problems than of the military security problems which have dominated international relations since 1945.\n', 'Finally, I said I would touch on the kind of people we need to administer our foreign policy. I believe that the foreign policy spokesman of our country should be the President, and not the Secretary of State. The conduct of foreign policy should be a sustained process of decision and action, and not a series of television spectaculars. Under the current administration, the agencies which are supposed to conduct our foreign affairs have been largely wasted and demoralized. They must be revitalized and if necessary reorganized—to upgrade their performance, their quality, and the morale of their personnel.\n', 'In our search for peace we must call upon the best talent we can find in the universities, the business world, labor, the professions, and the scientific community. Appointments to our U.N. delegation, to other diplomatic posts, and to international conferences should be made exclusively on a merit basis, in contrast to the political patronage that has characterized appointments under this administration.\n', 'The world needs a strong America and a confident America. We cannot and should not avoid a role of world leadership.

Leaving his case aside, just the general principle of a man or woman serving honorably in the services, being found out or disclosing themselves, their homosexual preferences. Should they be kicked out?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there's only one thing that bothers me about this. I favor the end of harassment or abuse or discrimination against homosexuals. There's one aspect of employment that concerns me, and that's when the homosexual would be employed in an area which is highly sensitive as far as national security is concerned and not have any relationships erf a homosexual nature with other people. It may be that the avowed, open homosexual wouldn't have any reticence about those sexual acts but where the partner in the act might be very highly susceptible to blackmail, but with that one, single exception, I would favor the termination of harassment or discrimination against homosexuals.\n"", ""Q. And considering too, Governor, I've read a number of pieces, as I'm certain you have, about how sex was used in the Second World War, the Korean War. Heterosexual behavior has left some people open to blackmail. Doesn't the sword cut both ways, whatever one's sexual preference?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Sure it does, and I think my position is fairly advanced on that subject, but I do have a hangup about that particular thing, where the blackmail would be possibly used to the detriment of our nation. But I can see that you have an argument there about heterosexual behavior too.\n', 'Q. Well, it\'s not that I have an argument for it, it\'s just that I had Matlovich with us one night, and as he said, ""I spent 5 or 6 years for my country in Vietnam."" He said, ""I am not a person who tries to convince other people to adopt my lifestyle. Why should I pay a penalty for it?"" And I thought that was a good question.\n', ""Governor Carter. It is, and it may be that somebody like Matlovich wouldn't have any reticence, or be subject to blackmail, but in areas that involve the Armed Forces or other security matters of our country, and highly secret things, it may be that someone with whom he had sexual relationships of a homosexual nature would be subject to severe blackmail. I don't think the heterosexual act would be as much of an embarrassment to a man in the security areas of our country as would a homosexual act.\n"", ""Q. Unless he had a wife and two kids who didn't know about it, sir.\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's true, but even then, I think the blackmail effort would be much more, the blackmail attempt might be much more successful in the case of homosexual acts.""]"

They provide entertainment, employment, and housing to millions of Americans. They are the repository of our nation's cultural institutions, art galleries and symphonies. They are the economic backbone for an increasingly urbanized nation.\n"", 'But our cities are facing a crisis which can no longer be avoided. Many of our major cities are rapidly losing population to smaller communities and to surrounding suburbs. It is often the affluent who have fled, robbing cities of needed talent and depriving them of a needed tax base—leaving the poor, who are more heavily dependent on local government services. Just as people have left many of our urban areas, so too have businesses and jobs, thereby further eroding the municipal tax base, and making it more difficult for localities to provide for the increased demand in municipal services. New forms of revenue have not been made available to localities to replace their shrinking tax base. Crime and the fear of crime in our major urban areas keep people out of our cities and make our cities places of forboding rather than hope.\n', 'This disturbing but very real trend has come at a time of both tremendously escalating municipal costs and a rising demand for municipal services.\n', 'If our cities fail, so too will our country.\n', ""Yet in the face of these enormous problems, our nation's cities have been faced with 8 years of self-styled benign neglect by the Nixon-Ford Administrations. In fact, the Republican policy toward our cities has been nothing short of conscious, willful indifference to the plight of urban America. They have promised new programs, such as Special and General Revenue Sharing, to supplement existing programs, and have instead used them to supplant current programs and to lower the level of assistance to cities. Two Republican Presidents have purely and simply written off our cities. They hav6 pitted our suburbs and rural areas against our major urban communities. Their policy has been divisive and disastrous. Rather than launch an attack on our cities' problems, they have declared a war against the cities of America. Our cities have needed help and the Republicans have turned their backs. Our cities needed financial assistance and the Republicans have given them crumbs. Our cities needed attention and the Republicans have given them neglect.\n"", 'Between 1972 and 1974 alone, the Republican Administration cut $4.5 billion in urban programs and another $7 billion in programs to aid the poor, the untrained, the unemployed, and the medically indigent, all at a time when municipalities lost $3.3 billion in purchasing power.\n', 'Our country has no urban policy or defined urban goals, and so we have floundered from one ineffective and uncoordinated program to another. Hopes have been raised only to be dashed on the rocks of despair when promise after promise has been forgotten.\n', 'We need a coordinated urban policy from a federal government committed to develop a creative partnership with our cities for the survival of urban America in the balance of the 20th century. This policy must recognize that our urban problems stem from a variety of factors, each of which must be dealt with directly and forcefully—problems of urban decay, declining tax base, crime, unemployment, lack of urban parks and open spaces.\n', 'We must begin our urban policy by recognizing the human needs of the individuals who live in our cities. The essential building block of our urban policy must be the provision of a job for each person capable of holding gainful employment. I believe every person has a right to a job.\n', 'But our urban unemployment rate is intolerable. This high level of unemployment means less tax revenue for cities, increased social tension, and higher crime rates.\n', 'Unemployment nationally is at 7.6 percent—at least twice the acceptable level. And yet this figure, to which the Republican Administration in Washington points with pride, is itself a gross understatement of the unemployment problem afflicting our major urban areas. According to the United States Department of Labor, central city unemployment for 1975 was 9.6 percent as opposed to 8 percent for nonmetropolitan areas and 5.3 percent for the suburbs. For the poverty areas of cities that figure is 13.8 percent, and for blacks in these areas it is 17.6 percent. Overall, center city black unemployment is at the rate of 14.1 percent. In 1975, every fourth black worker was unemployed and the majority of them were ineligible for unemployment compensation. Teenage black unemployment in some areas of America approaches the staggering figure of 40 percent.\n', 'Indeed, even these figures are deceptive of the real problem, for they do not include the literally hundreds of thousands of people who have gotten completely out of the labor market due to their frustrating inability to find a job.\n', 'These are not simply figures. They represent the crushed dreams of millions of Americans ready and willing to work. The 9.6 percent unemployment rate in our central cities alone means 2.6 million people out of work.\n', 'To make dramatic improvement in the unacceptably high unemployment rate, I propose a creative, joint program of incentives to private employers and a public needs employment program funded by the federal government. Such programs will more than repay our investment, not simply in making taxpayers of those now on unemployment insurance or on welfare, and not simply in generating additional revenues to the federal, state and local governments—although each 1 percent decline in the unemployment rate will produce $13 to $16 billion in federal tax revenues; but rather in restoring the pride and self-respect of those too long ignored and cast aside.\n', 'These incentives to private industry should be geared directly toward the provision of jobs for the unemployed, and toward encouraging industry to locate new plants and offices in urban areas where unemployment is high.\n', ""Almost 85 percent of America's workers depend on private industry for jobs. Most of the unemployed will depend on recovery in the private sector for renewed job opportunities. We cannot afford to ignore well-designed, job-related incentives to private industry to help reduce unemployment. These should take the form of:\n"", '• assistance to local governments for urban economic planning and development and to help local governments, encourage private industry to invest in our cities;\n', '• an expanded employment credit to give businesses benefits for each person they hire who had been previously unemployed;\n', '• as a further stimulant to private industry to hire the unemployed, the federal government should increase its commitment to fund the cost of on-the-job training by business;\n', '• encouragement by the federal government to private industry to prevent layoffs.\n', 'However, private industry cannot meet the task alone! The federal government has an obligation to provide funds for public employment of those who private business cannot and will not hire.\n', ""The Nixon-Ford Administrations' priorities have been grossly misplaced. While adequate unemployment compensation is necessary to protect the unemployed, their best protection comes from jobs. It has been estimated by the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that each 1 percent of excess unemployment adds at least $4 to $5 billion in direct costs for unemployment compensation, food stamps, and welfare.\n"", 'It is an incredible misallocation of resources for the current administration to spend between $17 and $20 billion for unemployment compensation and an additional $2 to $3 billion on food stamps due to unemployment, and yet only $2% billion on public job programs.\n', 'Certainly, money is better spent in creating useful public service jobs to take people off of welfare, food stamps and unemployment compensation and make them tax contributors; yet we are asked to tolerate a policy adjusted to support an unacceptable status quo. Therefore, I propose the following program of public employment as an investment in human beings, an investment which will more than be repaid in uplifted lives, increased tax revenues, and decreased welfare, food stamp and unemployment compensation payments:\n', '• An expansion of the CETA program [Comprehensive Education and Training Act] through which direct federal funds for municipal and other jobs have been provided, with administrative responsibility resting at the local level. This program was originally designed merely to combat structural unemployment in a period of mild recession. It cannot now deal with the cyclical unemployment caused by the severe recession we are in, without an expanded and strengthened role. It now provides only 300,000 jobs. It should produce at least twice this number of jobs. The 9.6 percent unemployment rate in our central cities could be markedly reduced by the provision of 600,000 to 700,(XX) public jobs to the unemployed for useful jobs near their homes, in the cities;\n', '• Passage of an accelerated public works program which would help create new jobs, 80 percent in the private sector and many for our young people. Federal and state governments should also share responsibility for guaranteeing bonds for public works projects;\n', '• Funds for 800JD00 summer youth jobs should be provided;\n', '• Perhaps the biggest single problem created for the poor who live in our cities is the current welfare system and Welfare Reform would be the single most important action we could take.\n', ""As currently constituted, it is a crazy quilt of regulations administered by a bloated bureaucracy. It is wasteful to the taxpayers of America, demeaning to the recipients, discourages work, and encourages the breakup of families. The system lumps together dissimilar categories of poor people, and differs greatly in its benefits and regulations from state to state. It is time that we broke the welfare and poverty cycle of our poor people. My recommendations are designed to satisfy the following goals: (a) we must recognize there are three distinct categories of poor people—the unemployable poor, the employable but jobless poor, and the working poor; (b) no person on welfare should receive more than the working poor can earn at their jobs; (c) strong work incentives, job creation and job training should be provided for those on welfare able to work; (d) family stability should be encouraged by assuring that no family's financial situation will be harmed by the breadwinner remaining with his dependents; (e) efforts should be made to have fathers who abandon their family be forced to continue support; (f) the welfare system should be streamlined and simplified, with a small bureaucracy, less paperwork, fewer regulations, improved coordination and reduced local disparities; (g) persons who are legitimately on welfare should be treated with respect and dignity.\n"", 'To achieve these goals, I propose a single, fair, uniform, national program of welfare benefits funded in substantial part by the federal government with strong work and job incentives for the poor who are employable and with income supplementation for the working poor, and with earnings tied so as to encourage employment, so that it would never be more profitable to stay on welfare than to work. No one able to work, except mothers with preschool children, should be continued on the welfare rolls unless job training and a job were accepted. The welfare burden should be removed from a city such as New York City with all welfare costs being paid by the Federal and state governments.\n', 'The programs I have proposed will be repaid by increased tax revenues generated by the reduction in unemployment from the jobs programs I have outlined. Their financing can be assisted by the $5 billion to $8 billion streamlining of the defense budget I have suggested.\n', 'While we must concentrate on the human needs of those who live in our cities throughout the country, we cannot ignore the fiscal plight of our cities themselves. A recent authoritative survey showed their plight dramatically. Of the cities and towns surveyed, a total of 122 began the last fiscal year with combined surpluses of $340 million and ended the fiscal year with a combined $40 million deficit. This has forced cities to raise local taxes an estimated total of $1.5 billion, or to cut back on important municipal services. These local governments experiencing fiscal difficulties, which in no way are of their own making, had to eliminate 100,000 municipal positions last year alone. The deflationary adjustments state and local governments together were required to make removed $8 billion from the economy last year.\n', 'To alleviate the suffering our cities are being put through by high inflation and continued recession, I propose the following:\n', '• Countercyclical assistance to deal with the fiscal needs of cities particularly hard hit by the recession. The $2 billion of countercyclical assistance recently vetoed by Mr. Ford is essential and affordable. In fact, it is within the budget resolutions adopted by Congress. This aid will go to create new jobs and to maintain current levels of service in hard-pressed cities. Without such aid, cities like Detroit may have to cut back essential services;\n', '• Extension of the revenue-sharing program for 5 years, with an increase in the annual funding level to compensate for inflation and with enforcement of the civil rights provisions of the bill to guarantee against discriminatory use of the funds. I will study whether the revenue-sharing formula should be amended in the future to place greater emphasis on areas of high need. Moreover, I believe that all revenue-sharing funds should go to the cities and that localities should be allowed to use these funds for defraying the costs of health, social services, and education, which they are currently forbidden to do;\n', '• Study the creation of a Federal Municipalities Securities Insurance Corporation to assist localities in marketing their bonds and in reducing interest levels now faced by municipalities, and to provide voluntary selfcontrols in municipal financial matters.\n', 'The problems our cities are facing are compounded by their often deteriorating physical state.\n', ""Housing has deteriorated enormously and new housing is often unaffordable. 1975 was the worst this nation has had in 29 years on the number of housing units constructed. Although this nation in 1968 legislated a goal of 2J4 million new housing units per year to meet current needs, last year witnessed the construction of barely 1 million units. At the same time, housing costs have risen so rapidly that only 3 in 20—15 percent—of America's families can afford new housing. What is likewise appalling is that the government now has thousands upon thousands of abandoned and unused dwellings under its control and deteriorating due to bureaucratic inaction, while tens of thousands seek better shelter.\n"", ""Likewise, our municipal transportation systems are faced with difficult times. For the last 20 years, more than $230 billion has been spent at all levels of government for our highway system. From 1967 to 1975, expenditures from the highway trust fund averaged about $4 billion per year; the administration's 1977 fiscal year budget outlay for highways reached $7.1 billion. From the end of World War II until the mid-sixties, no new major transit construction project was undertaken with public support. Cities were faced with deteriorating buses and subways and inadequate maintenance programs and schedules. Public transit ridership declined from almost 19 billion in 1946 to only 5.5 billion in 1973, reflecting the poor state of our municipal transit systems. By the end of 1974, operating deficits for existing public transit systems nationally were expected to have reached $900 million. We cannot continue to allow our mass transit systems to languish and remain a stepchild. Mass transit, if properly supported, can serve as the means to encourage increased use of our cities as places of business, shopping, and entertainment; and can correspondingly enable urban workers to reach jobs located in the suburbs; all with less pollution and energy use than the present system of transportation.\n"", 'To help solve the physical problems confronting our cities, I submit the following agenda on housing which will, in addition, put back to work hundreds of thousands of unemployed construction workers and fulfill our national commitment to build 2J4 million housing units per year:\n', '• direct federal subsidies and low interest loans to encourage the construction of low and middle income class housing;\n', '• expansion of the highly successful Section 202 housing program for the elderly, which utilizes direct federal subsidies;\n', '• greatly increased emphasis on the rehabilitation of existing housing to rebuild our neighborhoods; certain of our publicly created jobs could be used to assist such rehabilitation. It is time for urban conservation instead of urban destruction;\n', '• greater attention to the role of local communities under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974;\n', '• greater effort to direct mortgage money into the financing of private housing;\n', '• prohibiting the practice of red-lining by federally-sponsored savings and loan institutions and the FHA, which has had the effect of depriving certain areas of the necessary mortgage funds to upgrade themselves, and encouraging more loans for housing and rehabilitation to the poor.\n', 'In tandem with program, I propose to bolster our urban transportation system by:\n', '• substantially increasing the amount of money available from the highway trust fund for public mass transportation;\n', '• studying the feasibility of creating a total transportation fund for all modes of transportation;\n', ""• changing the current restrictive limits on the use of mass transit funds by localities so that greater amounts can be used as operating subsidies, and opposing the administration's efforts to reduce federal operating subsidies;\n"", '• achieving better highway utilization through such means as reserved lanes for bus and car pools;\n', ""• reorganizing and revitalizing our nation's railroads.\n"", 'Our cities can never be what we desire so long as they remain an undesirable environment in which to live and raise a family. Yet too frequently, the specter of crime destroys this environment and creates an atmosphere in which each person lives in fear of the actions of others. All Americans have the right to live free from the fear of crime.\n', 'Surveys indicate that large percentages of the American public fear to come into the cities or walk their neighborhood streets at night. Crime has now become a suburban and rural problem as well as an urban problem. Rising crime rates give reality to these fears. Figures show that one in every four American families will fall victim to crime within the year. A child born in a large American city and remaining in that city throughout his or her entire life stands a greater chance of meeting a violent death than did the average American soldier during World War II.\n', 'In order to restore order and tranquility to our cities, I propose:\n', '• a reform of our judicial system to insure that swift, and predictable punishment follows a criminal conviction. I believe that crime is best deterred by the certainty of swift justice;\n', '• a revision in our system of sentencing eliminating much of the discretion now given to judges and probation officers, and insuring greater certainty in sentencing and confinement and a higher percentage of serious criminals being imprisoned;\n', '• reasonable restrictions on the purchase of handguns, including the prohibition on ownership of guns by certain persons with criminal records;\n', '• upgrading of the rehabilitation programs available to criminals while in prison;\n', '• a concerted attack on the drug traffic and organized criminal activity with which our cities are afflicted;\n', '• federal assistance to the crime prevention programs of local governments with a minimum of federal regulations;\n', ""• an attack on unemployment, the root cause of much of our urban crime, through the programs I have mentioned previously. We should recognize that $3 billion has been spent since 1967 by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in order to fight crime, with more than half of this amount going to the nation's police forces. This alone is not sufficient to reduce crime. We cannot seek cosmetic remedies while ignoring the Case causes of crime.\n"", 'Moreover, our urban existence is often lived out in a sea of concrete. To make our cities more attractive and culturally viable, we should direct greater emphasis on the establishment of parks in urban areas, and we must also expand programs such as the urban walls program and federal assistance to the arts.\n', 'For too long, the doors of the White House have been shut to the needs of the cities and to the mayors who represent them.\n', ""Franklin Delano Roosevelt, one of the prime movers behind the United States Conference of Mayors, recognized the need for a close partnership between the Executive Branch of the federal government and the mayors of America's cities.\n"", ""As President, I shall develop close, personal and continuous working relationships with you.

When I was Governor of Georgia every act that I performed was designed for those who need the services of government the most, black or white—the rural, the inarticulate, the noninfluential, the people who are dependent on the government to give man a better life and who quite often don't have a voice in the shaping of government programs.\n"", 'I tried to correct this by making a large number of appointments, not only to major boards and policy making entities, such as the Board of Regents, which runs our university system, and the Board of Human Resources, which runs our welfare system, but also to boards that concern testing and licensing of practical and registered nurses, barbers, beauticians, funeral directors, and so forth. Before my administration, black citizens had been excluded from that process; decisions had been made by white people for them or by rich people for poor people.\n', 'In the shaping of our tax policies we tried to orient everything that I did toward meeting the needs and caring for the problems of those who ordinarily had not been given an equal chance in the past.\n', 'In the field of education, after we integrated our schools completely, the major thrust of my whole administration was to individualize instruction, to treat each child as an individual and not to treat him as one entity in a homogeneous group.\n', 'We have assimilated our racial integration in the South and I contributed something to it in a very fine way. For example, I have an 8-year-old daughter who goes to a typical south Georgia school in the town where we live; the school is 60 percent black and approximately 40 percent white.\n', 'I think the intimacy in which I live my life and the administration of my responsibilities as a public official have indicated my sensitivity toward the needs of people who are dependent on government.\n', 'The last thing is I think we have the same kind of opportunity yet unrealized in foreign affairs to treat nations as individuals and to deal with them in a predictable and a compassionate and understanding and respectable way. This will particularly apply to the small nations and the nations whose citizens happen to be brown or black, who in the past were often treated with a lack of respect and sometimes even contempt and certainly insensitivity. As President, I think I can change that dramatically.\n', 'Q. What black support do you have?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've got strong support among black leaders, people like Andy Young, who was Dr. Martin Luther King's top fieldworker, campaigning for me around the country. Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr. and his family have opened their doors because they have had a chance to watch me in close quarters in Georgia as a governor and they also see in me the kind of leadership capability, at least the potential, that could change the thrust of our government.\n"", 'I think the President is the only person who can change the direction or attitude of our nation. For example, in 1968, we had a Democratic Congress; perhaps more Democratic than it had been in the past; then we changed Presidents from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to Richard Nixon, and the whole attitude of our government changed toward an unfortunate people.\n', 'Q. What is the most significant change you have noticed that has taken place in the South?\n', 'Governor Carter. The best thing that ever happened in the South, as I have often said, was the passage of the civil rights rulings granting black people the right to vote, hold a job, buy a home, attend schools of their choice, and participate in public affairs on an equal basis with white people.\n', 'When I authorized the unveiling of a portrait of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the State capital, I made a little speech and I pointed out that Dr. King liberated black people in the South, but perhaps more than that, he liberated whites because we have been constrained for generations by the preoccupations of the race issue. I think a lot of progress has been made in the South, but we still have a long way to go.\n', 'Q. Although you have traveled to the Middle East, Europe, and to Latin America, will you, as President, travel to Africa?\n', ""Governor Carter. As President, I will certainly balance my travel among the developing nations, especially in Africa. Although I can't promise you now just where I will travel, I will make sure that the African and South American nations will be top priority on the agenda of my Secretary of State and members of my family. I think this is probably the greatest unmet need in our foreign policy now, because as I have been in smaller and developing countries, I have seen quite often the hurt that exists in them about our callousness toward them.\n"", 'Q. What do you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses?\n', 'Governor Carter. In the first place, I am not a lawyer, and that would ordinarily be interpreted as a weakness, but on the other hand, I am a fanner, a businessman, an engineer, and a scientist, and I think I can make up for not being a lawyer by my broad background of experience in other aspects of human life.\n', ""I come from outside Washington; I've never served in public office in Washington and that would ordinarily be interpreted as a weakness, politically speaking, because I haven't had access to the news media and I haven't been known by the top opinion shapers and the top political figures of this country.\n"", ""I am a relatively unknown person, but at the same time I think that can be turned into an asset because when I get to Washington, I'll come in as a fresh person not committed to the status quo, eager to change things for the better and not responsible for what is there. I have tough, competent managerial experience, demonstrated as a governor, and have the knowledge, at the local level as chairman of a school board, as a state senator, and as a governor, of the problems that Washington creates in the actual delivery of services to human beings.\n"", 'The Congress now has evaluated, for instance, a hundred different programs in the welfare field. Every year they launch three or four ships on the sea of our social structures without a rudder and they float around in the dark bumping against one another. Governors and mayors have to administer those programs and try to orient those ships toward a common goal, and I think I can see that from a perspective that demonstrates vividly the handicaps under which we suffer.\n', ""That is another problem that I may have had as a handicap, because I came from a small town, only 652 people. Still that gives me a very good insight into the proper interrelationship among people. We have fairly wealthy people, very poor people, and 40 percent white people and 60 percent black people, and I think if you want into Plains, Georgia, where I do live, and talked to all 650 people out there, you will find very little lack of knowledge about one another. We know each other and we understand one another's problems. It gives me a mandatory melting pot within which to derive my own consciousness of people's needs and hopes and dreams and aspirations.\n"", ""I've had another potential handicap in that I've never been on the national political scene before; I haven't run for President before, and I was relatively unknown. Even as late as last fall, only about 12 to 15 percent of the people actually knew who I was. If they were asked to name all the Presidential candidates, they could not name me. And I've had to overcome that with just detailed, careful, meticulous organizational work, which I think has laid a good groundwork of a permanent political base for me, which will be an asset in the future.\n"", ""So I think those kinds of aptitudes are good. It's hard for anyone to assess strengths and weaknesses. I think I do have some strength; that I have already described to you. I've traveled extensively in foreign countries in my adult life, and I have experience in the military. I think I would know how to eliminate a lot of problems in the Pentagon and I've got an outstanding family; there are 11 of us who campaign full-time.\n"", ""I think that in general as I personally weigh my assets and my liabilities, my assets far outweigh the liabilities. I haven't worked with Congress, but I have worked with the state legislature, and I think that coming out of Congress you don't have the perspective or the inclination to make tough, bold executive decisions. One tends to equivocate and look at both sides of every issue and to continue the eternal debate and maybe to contrive a new agency or a new law to take care of a need without going to the basis of the problem. I would take just the opposite viewpoint.\n"", 'Q. As President, what would you do to renew confidence in our economy?\n', ""Governor Carter. Our economic base is strong, we've just lost our ability to work together. And we have no vision of what this country can do.\n"", ""The Ford-Nixon Administrations established the wrong priorities—tight constraints on the economy with scarce money, high interest rates, and let the unemployment rate go where it will. I would put the top priority on employment and holding down interest rates. I don't believe this would have too much of an adverse effect on inflationary spirals.\n"", ""I don't think there are any easy answers to the employment problem. I personally don't favor the government's being the prime source of jobs because the only sources of funds to pay government salaries are the people who don't work for the government.\n"", 'But there are many things the federal government can do, including provision of some jobs, orientation of research and development and new kinds of industries. One example of that would be in solar heating; other countries use solar heating to save energy. We are going to come to that very quickly. And this would provide jobs, not for scientists (because the technology is known), but for people like truckers, plumbers, pipefitters, carpenters, electricians, and plastics workers. With a minimum of expenditures you could get greatly magnified job opportunities.\n', ""A second category of job improvement would be in providing our people with a better quality of life. One of the fortunate things about the societal structure is that when you spend money on giving our people better lives, you create a lot of jobs, because that is people delivering services to other people. If you spend a million dollars in either public 01 private funds on better education, day care centers, or housing you get almost a million dollars' worth of jobs. You could spend the same million dollars on one more atomic bomb, but you don't get many jobs. So the orientation of our priorities could be shifted toward alleviating people's problems.\n"", 'Another thing that we need to do to help employment is to revise the federal bureaucracy. There is no way to educate children, to care for the elderly, to have a good health program, to build a transportation system, or to have a fair welfare system with a horrible, bloated, confused, overlapping, and wasteful bureaucracy that is almost impenetrable for the average person.\n', 'When I was elected governor, we had 300 agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions, and so forth. We abolished 278 of them; we set up a simple structure of government. We have only 22 departments now, and anybody in Georgia, even if illiterate, with one telephone call can register a complaint, ask a question, make a suggestion, or get a need met.\n', ""Two other things I will say: One is that we ought to have an aggressive sale of U.S. products overseas. Other countries do this, but we don't. We ought to sell not only ammunition and weapons, which we do very well, but also other things, such as shoes, shirts, and agricultural products. Also, we ought to remove the government incentives, tax incentives and otherwise, that have encouraged U.S. corporations to make products in foreign countries, when people in this nation are out of work.\n"", 'There are some categories where I would provide direct federal aid, particularly among young people. We have a 20 percent to 25 percent unemployment rate among 18 to 21 year olds. Among black and Spanish-speaking young people the unemployment rate is 40 percent to 45 percent. This should be corrected immediately. And federal jobs ought to be provided directly to the young people in these categories, similar to what we did during the Depression with a CCC or a WPA.\n', 'Another thing I would like to try is this. If a town, city, or corporation has to lay off 10 percent of its workers, I would like to see it retain 100 percent of its workers for a shorter workweek with the federal government and the industry sharing the extra cost involved. That is much cheaper and much better than providing unemployment compensation or welfare for the 10 percent of the workers out of work.\n', ""Q. What are the problems that you see in the nation's welfare system?\n"", ""Governor Carter. We've got a serious problem in welfare. It's not fair to taxpayers and it's not fair to the welfare recipients. We have about 12 million people in this country who chronically draw welfare. We have about 2 million welfare workers. They are among my favorite public employees. They want to help alleviate suffering, unemployment, blindness, and so forth. But they don't spend their time doing that. Against their own wishes, they spend their time in offices, bogged down with red tape, shuffling papers, trying to administer these 100 different welfare programs that the federal government is forcing on us.\n"", ""We need a simple, fair welfare system that has several elements. About 1.3 million of those welfare recipients can work full-time; nothing is wrong with them physically or mentally. They should have the opportunity for job training, literacy instruction if they can't read or write, and the services of private and public job placement agencies to match them with the jobs that best suit their capabilities. If they are offered a job and don't take it, I wouldn't pay them any more benefits.\n"", ""The other 90 percent can't work full-time. For them, there should be one basic nationwide payment to meet the necessities of life, varying in amount only to accommodate the cost of living from one community to another.\n"", ""We also should have a work-incentive aspect built in, even for those who could work only part time. For example, if a mother has two little children, the husband is dead, she can leave the children with the grandmother, let's say, for 15 hours a week and she can get a part-time job, she ought to be encouraged to do so, not made to, but encouraged. And she should not have her welfare payments confiscated. Now, a welfare mother who gets a job has to pay over 80 percent of her income in taxes and she loses her welfare benefits.\n"", 'We should also remove the aspects of the welfare law that forces or encourages fathers to leave their homes, or to pretend to leave their homes. In fact, everything that the government does should be designed to hold a family together and not to separate them. And we ought not to have a hundred different programs, but one or two programs at the most.\n', 'Q. In opposing abortion, are you not taking away the accessibility of it for the poor?\n', ""Governor Carter. Georgia had a strict abortion law, which I would favor for the whole country. It was stricken down by the Supreme Court in a test case. In Georgia, we now permit abortions for the first 13 weeks, with the decision made between the mother and the doctor. In the second 13 weeks, abortions can only be performed if the mother's life is in danger or if the pregnancy is the result of rape. When the child is assumed to carry or sustain its life independent of the mother, no abortions are permitted.\n"", 'I want a nationwide federal program established by law to provide educational services, family planning services, access to contraceptives for those who believe in their use, including minors, and better adoption procedures. I think abortions are a result or evidence of a failure to prevent unwanted pregnancies or to encourage a mother who has an unwanted child to carry the child to delivery.\n', ""Under the present Supreme Court ruling, I'll do everything I can as President to minimize the need for abortions in this country.""]"
15,Jimmy Carter ,"April 16, 1976","['I have chosen this occasion to discuss national health policy with you who have crossed a sometimes impassable border of discrimination and financial barriers to achieve your dream.\n', 'Over two-thirds of black medical students come from families with incomes of less than $10,000 a year. In 1975 there was a drop in the number of minority students who entered medical school for the first time in five years.\n', 'This has made it more difficult for you to become doctors—but it has also given you a clearer sight of critical illnesses which no X-ray can show. They are the illnesses not of one patient, but of an entire system. The causes and cures will not be found in medicine alone; the diseases have begun and spread from politics and society itself.\n', 'Some of our medical advances have been remarkable; we have researched and developed new wonders of science and technology. We have made history by our near-conquering of communicable diseases. New technology extends the lives of thousands of patients, as for example with cardiac surgery. Some advances have been matters of basic social justice; we have passed Medicare and Medicaid to provide care for the poor, the disabled, and the aged. We have more hospitals, more equipment, and more clinics, community health and mental health centers.\n', 'But the point of any health care system is its end result—not for bureaus, or hospitals, or universities, or budgets—but for human beings.\n', 'There is a difference between the capacity of our health care system and the state of our health. This nation, first in the genius of its technology and the wealth of its resources, ranks 15th in infant mortality. Our life expectancy is lower than the average lifespan in several western countries. We lead the developed world in areas where we would prefer to be last, in the diseases of highly industrialized nations—the rate of heart disease and cancer.\n', 'Such statistics measure social injustice as much as medical inadequacy. Every shortfall in the health of Americans short-changes poor and minority Americans the most. Life expectancy for all of us is too short, but it is six years shorter for black people.\n', 'In 1965, Americans spent $39 billion, or less than 6 percent of GNP, for health services. By 1975, that expenditure had multiplied three times—to about $550 per year for every man, woman and child in our nation—more than 8.2 percent of GNP. Experts now estimate that, if these trends continue, the costs of continuing the present system will double over the next five years and could triple over the next ten.\n', 'Cost and access barriers are the normal accepted reasons for our problems and the expected focus of political concern. But the deeper causes of ill health, at least equal in their effects, are living conditions which breed half lives of sickness and early death. The problem with lead paint is not so much the price of a doctor to detoxify, but life within the poison painted tenements. The health problem among urban slums and rural shacks is not just a lack of nearby doctors to treat the preventable diseases which fester there, but die environment in which people live.\n', 'What are some of the tragic inadequacies of health care?\n', 'We have failed so completely to control medical costs that only 38 percent of Medicare expenses are now being met, and the elderly have increasingly limited access to needed services.\n', 'Medicaid has become a national scandal. It is being bilked of millions of dollars by charlatans.\n', 'For the first time in our history, we are in the midst of a medical malpractice crisis. Some of the blame for this surely rests on a record of poor quality controls in monitoring health care.\n', 'Overhospitalization, another cause of major national concern, results all too frequently from insurance policy payments limited to inpatient care.\n', 'The Nixon-Ford Administrations have slashed one essential health program after another in the fields of maternal and child health, community mental treatment centers, health manpower, health maintenance organizations, and biomedical research, among many others.\n', 'We have built a haphazard, unsound, undirected, inefficient nonsystem which has left us unhealthy and unwealthy at the same time.\n', ""The complex reality is that health care is one strand of a seamless social web. Our nation's health problems must be attacked from many approaches, one of which is national health insurance. We must begin by considering how best we can spend the health dollar. But first we must ask:\n"", 'Sophisticated and costly medical technology has improved our health. But its duplication and misutilization waste our wealth—and the scarcity of resources then restrains the budget for other social needs.\n', 'Hospital beds often seem to be occupied longer than patients need them because we do not have alternatives or agreed-upon standards.\n', 'The structure of our health insurance encourages in-hospital care. A patient with the same illness would be kept in the hospital an average of four days in Santa Rosa, California, and thirteen days in Brooklyn, New York. We have no adequate explanation for the difference.\n', 'Similarly, the likelihood of surgery is related to the state where a person resides as much as the state of his or her health. A patient in a New York City hospital is twice as likely to be wheeled to the operating room as a patient on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Whether it is the practice pattern or the availability of surgeons is unclear.\n', 'Insurance has helped many Americans meet health care bills. Unfortunately, it may also be an incentive for inefficiency in delivery. Typical public and private insurance plans reimburse hospitals on the basis of costs incurred, frequently with limits on patients benefits, with no real control on the level of hospital costs and physician charges.\n', 'We have not until now controlled costs with incentives for efficiency. For the first time, legislation which is pending in the U.S. Senate makes a serious effort to place controls on hospital costs and physician charges under Medicare and Medicaid.\n', 'Federal policy is equally a problem. Federal programs are fragmented among at least fifteen departments—and the health responsibilities of H.E.W. are subdivided further among ten parts of that one cabinet-level agency. This bureaucratic sprawl of agencies cannot provide effective direction and coordination. Instead, it is a ""disorganization"" of overlapping jurisdictions and redundant programs, each of them with separate grant and reporting requirements. The result is more loss of money and time, and the wasted talents of administrators.\n', 'The administration of Medicare and Medicaid presents a perfect example of the need for government reorganization. The two programs often serve the same people. Each program is in a different agency of HEW. Neither agency is a health agency. Neither relates to programs to provide more professional and allied health manpower, or to research programs. Both Medicare and Medicaid have experienced massive cost increases that were not planned or anticipated. Our government now tries to shift part of the inflation back to the poorest of our citizens in the form of increased deductibles, co-insurance, and consequently reduced benefits.\n', 'First, our emphasis must be on prevention of the killers and cripplers of our people. Our purpose must be to promote health, not just to provide health care as such, and this includes initiative in insuring adequate family incomes and a clean environment as well as reforming the financing of health care. Reform of the welfare morass may prevent more sickness and disease during the next generation than could be achieved by placing $600,000 body scanning X-rays in every hospital.\n', 'The control of occupational hazards can save many workers each year who die prematurely because they are exposed to toxic chemicals, dust and pesticides. These are usually low income workers. Occupational health and safety can reduce cancer, accidents, and respiratory disease.\n', 'The abatement of air and water pollution would protect millions from breathing and drinking poisons which will lead to long, costly illness and disability 10 or 20 years from now.\n', ""Continuing education and information about proper nutrition and selfcare could reduce the $30 billion annual cost of the sicknesses that afflict Americans who eat or drink or smoke too much. Yet, the federal government spends less for this purpose than is planned for a single B-l bomber, and medical schools don't teach enough about nutrition or preventive health care.\n"", 'Reorganization of our government is one of the most important steps we can take. A random system tends to perpetuate every effort of the past, no matter what its record may be, because each agency defends its own fragment of the policy. A consolidated system and coherent planning can weigh competing alternatives, judge comparative results, and budget resources for the best returns in terms of health.\n', 'It would be both cost-efficient and health-effective to use less expensive treatment methods where possible and to improve out-patient services instead of overbuilding and overusing hospitals. And it should be normal rather than exceptional to balance benefits and costs before deciding how and where to distribute the new developments of medical technology.\n', 'Medical care costs must be controlled. We must find incentives for productivity and efficiency.\n', 'Any comprehensive health policy must bring care within the reach as well as the means of all our people.\n', 'The most generous insurance program cannot pay doctors or hospitals that are not there.\n', 'In the county where I farm, there is not a doctor, dentist, pharmacist or a hospital bed. The National Health Services Corps has designated almost three hundred areas of similar shortage across the country. (Even nearby hospital services are remote for indigent people without transportation.) The ratio of physicians to population is three times higher in New York City than in South Dakota. Yet in the New York City ghettoes, physicians are scarce. Metropolitan centers generally have twice as many doctors for each thousand citizens as rural America.\n', 'The changing nature of medical practice compounds the numerical shortage of health personnel. There has been a substantial increase in specialists and a decline in family practitioners and primary care physicians.\n', 'The maldistribution of medical resources is neither inadvertent nor inevitable. It is partly the consequence of government action and the advance of technology. And therefore government can help redirect the trends of the past.\n', 'Medical education is an essential part of the reorientation of our national health care. The way medical schools teach, and the type of physicians they graduate, should reflect national projections of health needs and the rational planning of health services. The medical establishment has not responded to the shortage of primary care services and practitioners. But because of the strong federal and state support of undergraduate medical schools and graduate training, there is an obligation to the taxpayers to direct those funds in the public interest. Our national needs require redirecting medical education toward primary care as one means to correct the geographical and professional maldistribution of services and personnel.\n', 'We must insure more medical education for students from minority and low-income families, and for women, so they may take their rightful place in medicine. A major barrier to medical schools for minorities is financial. Most of your families had more hope than money to contribute to your dream. The government should assure scholarships and low-interest loans to make it financially possible to reach this goal.\n', ""To improve the availability of services, especially preventive services, the work of nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants is critical. In addition to these new clinicians, we need more paraprofessionals and allied health personnel who can free doctors and nurses for the work that only they can da A project in Portsmouth, Virginia, and others that we started in Georgia have demonstrated that many of the poor can fill paraprofessional roles, instead of being forced onto welfare rolls. The preventive work they do in their own neighborhoods reduces sickness and the expense of treatment.\n"", 'Health care is so complex that it requires specialists, generalists and professionals of all levels to analyze problems and offer health services. A cooperative approach maximizes the use of professional time. That is why I support organized approaches to delivery of services.\n', 'Availability is linked to quality in other vital respects. Availability of different kinds of care is one example. Many of the aged live out their lives in nursing homes or hospitals that violate minimal safety, sanitation, and even fire standards. Many of the elderly end their years in impersonal, high cost institutions when lower cost residential and supporting services would permit them to continue living with dignity in their homes and communities.\n', 'Adequate enforcement of hospital and nursing home standards or the expansion of services like meals-on-wheels for the homebound elderly can certainly help. Other needs may be met by development of community-based counselors, themselves older citizens, to act as facilitators for services.\n', 'Quality of care must be a matter of concern for the nation. The public should be protected by explicit standards of competence. The Professional Standards Review system is potentially an important initiative to monitor the quality of medical care. This system needs to correct its internal deficiencies and improve implementation nationally.\n', ""An efficient, cost-effective health care system will deliver and not just promise national health care. We must follow the basic principle that the amount of personal wealth should not limit the state of a person's health.\n"", 'National health insurance alone cannot redistribute doctors or raise the quality of care. So we must plan, and decisively phase in, simultaneous reform of services and refinancing of costs. Reform will enable us to set and secure the following principles of a national health insurance program:\n', '• Coverage must be universal and mandatory. Every citizen must be entitled to the same level of comprehensive benefits.\n', '• We must reduce barriers to early and preventive care in order to lower the need for hospitalization.\n', '• Benefits should be insured by a combination of resources: employer and employee shared payroll taxes, and general tax revenues. As President, I would want to give our people the most rapid improvement in individual health care the nation can afford, accommodating first those who need it most, with the understanding that it will be a comprehensive program in the end.\n', 'Uniform standards and levels of quality and payment must be approved for the nation as part of rational health planning. Incentives for reforms in the health care delivery system and for increased productivity must be developed.\n', '• We must have strong and clear built-in cost and quality controls. Necessary machinery for monitoring the quality of care must be established.\n', '• Rates for institutional care and physician services should be set in advance, prospectively.\n', '• Maximum personal interrelationships between patients and their physicians should be preserved; freedom of choice in the selection of a physician and treatment center will always be maintained.\n', '• Consumer representation in the development and administration of the health program should be assured.\n', ""• National priorities of need and feasibility should determine the stages of the system's implementation. While public officials have continued to dispute whether coverage should be catastrophic at first or comprehensive immediately, the system has become a comprehensive catastrophe. We must achieve all that is practical while we strive for what is ideal, taking intelligent steps to make adequate health services a right for all our people.\n"", ""• A basic concern shall be for the dignity of the person, not for the individual's wealth or income.\n"", '• Incentives for the reorganization of the delivery of health care must be built into the payment mechanism.\n', '• We must have resources set aside to encourage development of alternative approaches and to spur new distribution of health personnel.\n', 'The accomplishment of comprehensive national health insurance will not be quick or easy. It requires a willingness to seek new solutions, to keep an open mind. The problems are obvious, the solutions less so.\n', 'Reinhold Niebuhr said, ""The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.""\n', 'Our nation is still a place of many injustices. There are bars of hunger as well as iron. There are manacles of disease as well as metal. There is the solitary confinement of neglected old age. There are high walls of prejudice and repression. There is the capital punishment of war.\n', 'These prisons will not be unlocked by mere good intentions or political promises in dubious faith. If they could be, humanity would have wished them away long ago.\n', 'There are many doors to be opened—to sounder health, a cleaner environment, racial equality and economic fairness—to all those things to which we pledge our allegiance in a single phrase—""with liberty and justice for all.""']"
16,Jimmy Carter ,"May 01, 1976","['Q. Governor, what would you do to deal with inflation in the economy?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would proceed aggressively, with the first emphasis on jobs. My economic advisers and I agree that until you get the unemployment rate down below 5 percent, there's no real danger of escalating inflationary pressures. I would also favor additional money supply, carefully controlled, but I think a little more than we've had in the past 2 years.\n"", 'Q. You think the money supply should now be increasing more rapidly?\n', ""Governor Carter. I do. I think there was an overreaction in 1973 and 1974 to the rate of inflation, which was caused primarily, I think, by transient and external circumstances—competitive' bidding for scarce commodities, increases in the price of oil, and so forth.\n"", 'Another thing that I think should be done to control inflation is a tight, businesslike management of the government mechanism itself—a complete reorganization of the structure of government, the institution of zero-based budgeting which would screen out old and obsolescent programs, and a heavy emphasis toward a balancing of the budget.\n', 'Q. Would you resort to wage and price controls under any circumstances?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would like to have standby wage and price control authority that could be used for a limited period of time, but I doubt that I would ever use it I know that Arthur Bums has advocated that this authority be permitted for a period of 45 days. This would permit the President, or his surrogates, to try to reach an accommodation with management and labor to hold down preemptory increases in wages or prices. But I would not favor mandatory or permanent wage and price controls. My philosophic commitment is to a freer economy.\n', 'Q. How far do you think you can get inflation down?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't see any reason why the permanent level of inflation can't be as low as 2 or 3 percent. If we get down below 4 percent unemployment, you would have very high inflationary pressures as you tried to reach lower and lower levels of unemployment. I think that most analyses have shown that if you reached a level of, say, 3 percent unemployment through government or private sector efforts, the inflation rate would probably rise above 10 percent.\n"", 'Q. Do you mean in the short run or do you think that’s a permanent characteristic of our economy now?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, I was talking over the next 4 or 5 year period.\n', 'Q. You think you can reach 4 percent without inflationary pressures?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think you can go below 5 percent without inflationary pressures.\n', 'Q. Somewhere between 5 and 4 percent you might run into some problems?\n', ""Governor Carter. When you get down around 4 percent, perhaps you might. But you're talking about 3 or 4 years in the future.\n"", 'Q. You say you feel the supply of money should be increasing more rapidly. Do you think we should continue to have an independent Federal Reserve?\n', 'Governor Carter. I do. I think that the present system has enough flexibility in it. I would not want to remove the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The Congress can modify the income tax laws to give temporary stimulus to the economy through investment tax credits, tax rebates, and so forth. And the President, through his appointments to the Federal Reserve Board, his selection of the chairman every four years, his public statements and private consultations, has an adequate degree of ability to modify policies up and down in an effective way.\n', 'Q. How would you go about the creation of more jobs?\n', ""Governor Carter. In the first place, contrasted with some of my opponents, I would consider the private sector the primary supplier of jobs. I hope that everything the government does will be oriented to magnify the influence of taxpayers' money by providing more jobs in the private sector. For instance, we should allocate research and development funds to the industries that are inevitably going to arise in the future. One example would be solar energy, where a small investment in research and development money can result in a very rapid increase in numbers of jobs—literally tens of thousands of jobs.\n"", 'Another thing that I would do would be to have a complete reorganization of the structure of the federal government, to make it, for a change, economical, efficient, purposeful in management. The bureaucracy is now an obstacle to any sort of economic progress. I think it would help a great deal to have a mechanism by which we can clearly define goals and purposes. The predictability of government policies and goals is very important to industry in such areas as automobile manufacturing or housing.\n', ""I would also promote the aggressive sale of American products overseas. We don't do this nearly so much as other countries do. I spent a lot of my time as governor traveling around in foreign countries trying to sell Georgia products. When I've been on these trade trips, I've seen small countries, like Bulgaria, or large countries, like France or Germany or Russia, with delegations comprised of government, industry, labor, and agriculture, saying, this is what we have to offer you, what can we do to make you our customer. Right on the spot, they can trade with those potential buyers for delivery schedules, the quality of merchandise, the price, interest rates, and repayment terms. As governor, I was never able to get any sort of answer from Washington on those same questions. It really incapacitates our ability to sell American products overseas.\n"", ""Also, I would remove some of the tax incentives and other incentives that have encouraged American corporations to manufacture products in foreign countries, when their own employees in this country are out of work. Other nations don't do this, but we do.\n"", ""Q. Would you remove such incentives if that made it impossible for American companies to compete abroad—even if they wouldn't manufacture more of those products in this country anyhow?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I wouldn't want to paint my picture in black-and-white terms— to say I would go all-out to remove all incentives. The thing that concerns me is that if a company makes a million dollars in Germany, if they reinvest that million dollars in a new shoe manufacturing plant in Italy, they don't have to pay taxes on it in this country. I think that's an unwarranted discouragement of that company to bring its capital profits back to this nation and to invest in a new shoe factory in New Hampshire, where you have a very high unemployment rate within that same company's employees. I have not analyzed the consequences of my beliefs adequately, in economic terms—I will before the general election—but that's the kind of thing that does concern me.\n"", 'Also, there are some options in the identification of a country within which a profit is made that I think are unwarranted—so that if a company actually makes a profit in one country overseas, they can claim to have made it in a different country and reduce their taxes paid in this nation. That I think is not called for. I would be cautious about that change, but I think we ought to recognize that American corporations have a responsibility for employment in this nation, and that the sole motivation for their moving to other countries ought not to be to avoid pollution-control restraints, or to seek cheap labor.\n', 'Q. Would you have the government intervene directly to create jobs?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would provide direct federal job opportunities in some categories of the unemployed—for instance, chronic welfare recipients who have no defect to keep them from working. I would get them off the permanent welfare roles and into productive work. I would train them, give them literacy instruction, the services of private and public job placement agencies— match them with a job and offer it to them. If they didn't accept it, I would not pay them any more welfare benefits.\n"", 'I would also like to try some things of an innovative nature that are working in other countries. One example would be if you had an area of high unemployment, a geographical area, and a company that had 1,000 employees, and they had to lay off 100 employees temporarily, I would like to see the government and that industry, on a competitive bid basis perhaps, for a short period of time, like 6 months, employ all the people there for a shorter work week, and let the government and the industry share the extra cost.\n', ""Q. Would you provide public jobs for people, other than those chronically unemployed, who weren't able to find jobs in the private sector?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't believe we can afford that, on a permanent basis. This would create in our nation an inclination to circumvent the private sector, to depend on the federal government as a first supplier of jobs, and it would be extremely expensive. It costs about $12,500 to supply a job for a person in the public sector. But there are many other things that could be helpful. For instance, a federal-city guarantee of bond repayments for public works construction is the kind of thing that could stimulate the construction industry. A guarantee by the federal government of home mortgage repayments would help a great deal. The construction of low-cost rental homes would help a lot. The guarantee or payment of interest subsidies above a certain level for home mortgages would have a direct impact on the housing industry. But I would not want to use massive public jobs programs except in an extreme case, and I believe that as President I could avoid that circumstance.\n"", 'Q. Do you think public jobs have a tendency to freeze up the job market, in that the person who takes a public job does not look for a job in industry?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I do. It creates an atmosphere or an attitude of permanent commitment and a dependence on the government for jobs, and I just don't think that's a good thing for us to do, unless we get into an extreme and apparently permanent circumstance with high unemployment. I think we can reach a level of unemployment in the neighborhood of, say, 4 percent, with a well-managed government, and with good cooperation from the private sector.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor the federalization of welfare?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think we can do that. But I do think the federal government and the state governments ought to take over the full responsibility of welfare. I don't think the local governments ought to have that responsibility on them. And as increased costs of welfare come in the future, I think the federal government ought to take an increasing responsibility for those financial costs. But it would be too much of a burden to put on the federal government now to take over all the states' portion. It would just mean that the state governments could reduce taxes and you'd have an enormous increase in federal expenditures but no increase in the services to our people.\n"", 'Q. Do you think we need more planning in the overall economy?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't like the prospect of government planning that would be binding on private industry, but my own experience in government is that planning ought to initiate at the executive level, with the President and his office, or with the governor of a state. Second, the goals and policies established ought to be publicly divulged. And they ought to be constantly amended as goals are reached or priorities are changed so that the private sector—business, industry, agriculture, and so forth—can cooperate with the government in the evolution of their own long-range plans. I don't favor government domination of private industry with government plans.\n"", 'Q. What should be the approximate balance between government and private shares of the GNP?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, the government share has been steadily growing. My inclination would be to attenuate the growth, at least. My hope would be that we could hold down or reduce the government proportion of the GNP compared to what it would have been if I wasn't in the White House. I can't promise you that I'll stop it or reverse it, but I'll do what I can to hold it down.\n"", 'Q. What would you do about tax reform?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think the nation is ready for comprehensive, total tax reform. This has been advocated by people from a wide spectrum of basic political philosophies—all the way from the Brookings Institution to William Simon. There are four basic principles that I've adopted. First, to treat all income the same. Second, to tax income only once. Third, a progressive tax rate. And fourth, to greatly simplify the whole system.\n"", 'Q. What do you mean when you say taxing income only once?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, we presently tax corporate income when it's earned and we also tax the dividends paid to stockholders.\n"", 'Q. You would favor not taxing dividends?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would favor taxing income only once. Whether I tax it at the corporate income point or dividends—I would like to keep that option open. I don't favor taxing the same income twice.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor taxing capital gains the same as other income?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; I would tax all income the same.\n', 'Q. Would you tax accrued capital gains on inheritances?\n', 'Governor Carter. That is a question I would rather not go into until I have examined it more closely.\n', 'Q. You have indicated you would eliminate many of the current deductions on the income tax. Can you say which ones you would eliminate?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; that is something I want to avoid. I'm perfectly willing to accept the criticism about not being specific, but I don't know how to be specific yet I would rather wait until I spend a considerable amount of time with a large number of advisers analyzing the entire tax structure, and then I want to propose it as one tax reform measure. I would like not to get pinned down on a particular promise, or commitment, until I can look at the entire concept in a generic sense, in a comprehensive sense.\n"", 'Q. What about the deduction for interest on mortgages that favors homeowners?\n', ""Governor Carter. I haven't ever said I would keep it as an income tax deduction. I've said I would keep the same amount of incentive for homeownership, or more. I think the $10 billion figure to encourage private homeownership is a very good thing—whether it would be done through the income tax structure or another mechanism, I don't know yet. If I make any change in it, it would be to increase the figure, or if I make any change in who gets the benefits, it would be to give low and middle-income families more benefits than they get now.\n"", 'Q. Have you given any thought to how you would shift the benefits to those families?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I've given it some thought. But there again I don't want to get myself into a position of discussing one little tiny part of an overall tax reform package. I'm just not qualified yet. I would want to do it at one time, so that the people could see a balance of where they might have to pay more in one area and get benefits in a different area. That would be OK. But if they only hear about the part that they'll pay more and don't hear about the compensating element of reduction in tax rates, that just creates consternation and concern, and it's a bad political thing to do. I'm not qualified yet to say what specific aspect of a tax reform package I will maintain maybe 2 years in the future after I've had a chance to go into the concept.\n"", 'Q. Do you think we should have more emphasis on antitrust?\n', 'Governor Carter. Absolutely.\n', 'Q. How would you go about applying that emphasis?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, one way would be through enthusiastic enforcement of the present antitrust laws. I would like to get the Attorney General out of politics, and not have any constraint on the Attorney General about which antitrust laws are enforced. I would also like to abbreviate the procedures through which the antitrust laws are administered. It takes too long now for the courts to reach a final determination. There are some areas of antitrust laws that I think are inadequate—both in the procedural approach and also in the exact measurements of a lack of competition. The food processing industry is one that concerns me very much.\n', 'Q. What about the oil industry? Would you be in favor of breaking up so-called vertical integration in the oil industry?\n', ""Governor Carter. The problem of the oil industry that concerns me is at the wholesale and retail end. I don't think I would favor divestiture of the exploration, extraction, refining, maybe even the pipeline distribution areas. But at the wholesale and retail end, I would probably favor divestiture requirements to insure adequate competition, which I don't think exists now.\n"", 'Q. How about horizontal integration? Would you be in favor of getting the big oil companies out of the ownership of other energy resources?\n', ""Governor Carter. There again, my belief is that the present movement of oil companies into, say, ownership of coal mines is not good for the country. I would favor divestiture to the extent that I felt it was needed to provide for a continuing and very enthusiastic competition, and also to the extent that I thought it would encourage increased coal production. I think in some instances coal production has been constrained deliberately by the oil companies, to hold up the price of oil and to hold up the price of coal. We've not had any increase in coal production in the last 4 or 5 years, and I think that's part of the problems, although it's not all of it\n"", 'Q. Several months ago you told us that breaking up General Motors would not be one of your goals. Does that still represent your thinking?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; it does. There are a lot of other things that I would devote my time to doing rather than trying to break up a company just because it's large. I might discover as a candidate, or as President, that General Motors was constraining trade or was monopolistic in its attitude, in which case I would publicly demand that antitrust be enforced in that particular area. Or if I thought that antitrust laws were inadequate, I would do all I could to get new laws passed.\n"", ""Q. Do you feel that there's too much federal government regulation in the economy at the present time? In the transportation industry, for instance?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I certainly do. I think that in the transportation industry some of the rulings of the regulatory agencies are counterproductive to what's best for the consumers. And my primary interest, almost exclusive interest, would be what's best for the consumers of this country. I think competition among the carriers is not adequate. Also in my appointments to regulatory boards, I would lean quite heavily toward appointments that would favor the consumers. And I would try to minimize, to whatever extent possible, the sweetheart arrangements that exist between regulatory agencies and the industries being regulated. I think there's kind of a revolving door concept where people move freely back and forth between the regulatory agencies and the industries being regulated.\n"", ""Q. Would you try to move back toward the market in the transportation industry where it's feasible?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes; that would be a general trend of mine. If I thought that this gives unwarranted advantage to some of the more powerful carriers, which might ultimately result in a lack of competition, then, of course, that's where I would draw the line. That would be a matter of individual judgment on cases to the extent that I would have influence.\n"", 'Q. Some people think that the newer kinds of regulations protecting the environment and health have cost the economy too much for the benefits that they provide. Do you think that there is a problem there?\n', 'Governor Carter. No; I don\'t. I was asked at the National Press Club the day I announced for President, ""If there was a conflict that you couldn\'t resolve between economic development and environmental quality, what would you do?"" And I said that I would go with environmental quality. Because it\'s an irreversible process. I\'ve had experience as a businessman, as an environmentalist, as a governor for 4 years, eagerly recruiting new industry and trying to retain jobs for Georgia people, with some conflict extant between economic infusions into Georgia and environmental quality. I\'ve always gone with environmental quality. I don\'t think it\'s hurt our state at all. And I think there\'s a growing awareness among our people that if there\'s an unequivocal commitment to environmental quality, obviously using common sense, that in the long run both industry, employees, the communities, and our nation are better off.\n', 'Q. Let me ask you two questions on labor policy. Do you favor repeal of the prohibition of common situs picketing?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know enough about it to answer the question about what I would do in the future. At the time the common situs picketing bill was on the President's desk, I was asked this question. And knowing that Truman, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Nixon, Johnson, and Ford—at that time— all promised to sign it, I said that if I was President, I would probably sign it. And I probably will. But I would like to be involved in the process of passing a future common situs bill. There are some things about it that concern me. One is the exclusion of an adequate opportunity for work for smaller businesses that might be deliberately frozen out of a job because of the common situs concept. And I also don't want to create additional disharmony in the construction industry. Now, I believe that I would sign the common situs bill, but I would like to make sure that the common situs bill that is passed and brought to my desk would be one that would assuage my concerns.\n"", 'Q. And you have said that you would sign the repeal of 14-B [the Taft-Hartley Act section that permits states to prohibit the union shop], but you would not promote the repeal?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right. And that's the same position I took as Governor. Of course, on a state level, you don't call it 14-B, it's the right to work. But, yes, that's the position I'd take.""]"
17,Jimmy Carter ,"May 03, 1976","['Q. What is your priority for the United States in economics?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think the major priority of the next administration has got to be employment. My own belief is that we can get the adult unemployment rate down to 3 percent, or the overall rate down to 4.5 percent, without any adverse effect on inflation.\n', 'Q. How would you attack unemployment?\n', ""Governor Carter. My thrust would be in the private sector. Wherever there is a choice between channeling jobs in the private sector or the public, I would favor the private. Quite often, you can get a great magnification of benefits from public money by spending it in the private sector. You don't get much magnification in jobs provided within the federal government.\n"", 'Q. How would you use the private sector for job creation?\n', 'Governor Carter. In a community that had a high unemployment rate, for example, I would explore the possibility of sharing with industry the employment of perhaps all of their employees for a shorter work week. The government and industry would then share the extra costs involved.\n', 'Q. You recently endorsed the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill. Why did you wait so long?\n', ""Governor Carter. I didn't approve of it the way it was originally written. With a mandatory total unemployment goal of 3 percent, taking in all age groups, most of my economic advisers thought that would mean double-digit inflation. And although in its original form the bill professed to make the government the employer of last resort, in effect it placed the government almost as an employer of first resort.\n"", 'Q. What do you mean by employer of last resort?\n', ""Governor Carter. In areas of very high unemployment I wouldn't wait until we tried everything else and found that it failed before I would provide jobs for young people. For example, I would favor not only the summer job program but also in the urban areas a reinstitution of an effort similar to what we did with the Civilian Conservation Corps and the WPA.\n"", 'Q. Would you lower the minimum wage for teenagers?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; quite often they are not part of a family structure. There is no unemployment compensation for them; there is no welfare program when they reach the age of 18. They're forced out in the world [with] the same economic needs as a 45 year old.\n"", ""Q. Humphrey-Hawkins would also put the government into long-range planning. What's your view of economic planning?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I believe in long-range planning so that government, business, labor, and other entities in our society can work together if they agree with the goals established. But at least it would be predictable. I don't favor the federal government making plans for the private sector mandatory.\n"", 'Q. Is a special agency needed for this type of planning?\n', 'Governor Carter. No; I would use the Office of Management and Budget.\n', 'Q. Your ideas for reducing unemployment would seem to feed the inflationary bias in the United States. How would you control inflation?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't agree with your premise. A lot of the inflationary pressure in the past few years has been transient. The quadrupling of oil prices in 1 year, the heavy demand for scarce commodities, the unwarranted sale of excessive amounts of grain to the Soviet Union. Most of my advisers believe that you could reach a low unemployment level with a stable inflation rate of, say, 3 percent or less.\n"", 'Q. Would you use wage and price controls?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would like standby wage-price controls. My guess is that I would never use them. But I would like them as a lever. I wouldn't hesitate to use them if I had to.\n"", 'Q. Many people think the major cause of inflation is big federal deficits. How do you stand on the budget?\n', ""Governor Carter. We can have a balanced budget by 1980 if I'm President. There is no way now to estimate benefits to be derived from top competent management of the government.\n"", 'Q. Could you cut spending sufficiently to balance the budget just by improving the operation of current government agencies?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's obviously part of it. Also by harnessing the tremendous economic resources of our country to stimulate government income. We're operating now at maybe 70 percent or less of capacity in our plants, and we have 8 million to 10 million people out of work.\n"", 'Q. Every President since Eisenhower has complained about the government bureaucracy. Do you have anything in mind that would enable you to handle this problem better?\n', ""Governor Carter. Total, commitment to that goal. My word of honor is at stake. The country is ready for it, and I know how to do it. I intend to go to the convention strong enough to shape the platform of the party, and better management in government will be one of the major issues I'm going to insist on.\n"", 'Q. In Georgia you cut agencies from 300 down to 22, and now on the federal side you want to cut from I £00 agencies down to 200. Yet after you got through in Georgia, why did you end up with 30 percent more employees and a 50 percent bigger budget?\n', 'Governor Carter. The last year I was in office total employees increased only 2.4 percent. We were able to cut administration costs and shift people to more productive jobs. I promised state employees that no one would be discharged as a result of my reorganization. But I did reserve the right not to fill vacancies as they occurred. And I would do the same thing as President.\n', ""Q. You're talking about more efficient government, not necessarily smaller government?\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's right.\n"", 'Q. What changes would you propose in tax policy?\n', ""Governor Carter. I believe the next President ought to assume the responsibility for complete tax reform. One provision would be to tax income basically the same—tax capital income and earned income in the same way. I'd also seek a drastic simplification of the tax system by removing many of the incentives that have been added over the past 70 years to cover transient circumstances. I would go to direct grants that could be reconsidered annually rather than building them into the permanent tax structure. I also favor taxing income only once, and would want to reinstitute a progressive tax rate so that the higher the income a person or corporation earned, the higher the rate of taxation.\n"", 'Q. What do you mean when you say you believe in taxing income only once?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think it's right to tax corporate income and then also tax dividend income.\n"", 'Q. If you change the taxation rate on capital gains, what do you think this would do to the flow of investment?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't want to be evasive, but I can't answer that question. But before the tax reform package would be completed—it probably would take at least a year of analysis—I would be fully aware of the need for investment capital. That's about as far as I can go now.\n"", 'Q. What do you think of the proposal of Walter Wriston [chairman of Citicorp] that we throw out the tax code and start from scratch?\n', ""Governor Carter. I read his proposal and several others like it, but I don't think this approach would provide adequate equity. Some people have very low incomes and need to be protected.\n"", 'Q. Are you against the homeowners9 mortgage interest deduction?\n', 'Governor Carter. No. I have said that this is one of the tax incentives I would consider changing. But I believe we do need some incentives for private homeownership. If I made any changes, I would maintain stimulation for housing but shift the tax credits more toward lower and middle-income families.\n', 'Q. What would you do for housing?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would utilize mortgage guarantees, and I favor interest subsidies—if you give me the flexibility to say what interest level should be subsidized. This program would let the government assist the homeowner when mortgage interest rates get above a certain level, paying the difference between the free market level and some fixed lower level.\n', 'Q. Do you think the Federal Reserve Board has been too restrictive on money supply and that this has kept housing sluggish?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think the Fed was too restrictive in 1973 and 1974, though now it's probably not. But I don't favor destroying the autonomy of the Fed. I think there is enough flexibility built into it.\n"", 'Q. You said in your Chicago foreign policy speech that you favor joining certain international commodity agreements. Why?\n', ""Governor Carter. What I meant was that I favor long-term agreements with other nations, particularly those in the developing world, to stabilize their markets and the amounts they ship. I don't favor indexing, and ( would be much more leery of multinational commodities agreements.\n"", 'Q. But agreements in which you set shipments and prices are cartels and tend to add to the inflationary bias in world trade.\n', ""Governor Carter. If you establish price supports for domestic crops equivalent to production costs, I don't consider that inflationary. The inflationary aspect comes in when you have wild fluctuations in price. Whether you could call price supports equivalent to production costs a domestic cartel, I don't know. I'm not talking about international price supports. I'm talking about a multi-year trade agreement that would involve a relatively fixed price, with some flexibility, and a guaranteed purchase of a certain quantity of the commodity, again subject to fluctuations. If demand were greater than the amount for which we had contracted, then the price for the increased commodity might be higher or lower.\n"", 'Q. There seems to be an ideological difference between the United States and other industrialized countries and the Third World. What LDCs really want is a redistribution of income.\n', 'Governor Carter. The crucial word there is indexing. I would not favor tying prices paid for bauxite, coffee, sugar, or metals to an inflation rate to provide a guaranteed income for the developing nations. I think you ought to be able to negotiate prices, and the free market ought to control prices.\n', 'Q. Who would do this, the government?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't see any reason for the U.S. Government to do it. Private companies could negotiate.\n"", 'Q. If you endorse the current U.S. farm system, why do you want to fire Agriculture Secretary Earl Butz?\n', 'Governor Carter. Butz is a completely unpredictable person. He has not been honoring the commitments that were made. For instance, I would rather have done without the soybeans myself in 1973 than go back on a contract with Japan. And I would never use food as a weapon or withhold sales of food to a foreign country, if we had adequate supplies on hand, merely for domestic political purposes.\n', ""Q. Doesn't that give away a terrific international negotiating chip?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I would not single out food as the single commodity to be used as a bargaining lever or weapon. If I wanted to negotiate with Russia on commodities they wanted, it would also include electronics, Pepsi-Cola, heavy machinery, and other materials.\n', 'Q. Do you favor extending the most-favored-nation principle to the Soviet Union?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's a question I can't answer. I would like to see every pressure maintained on Russia to liberalize its emigration policies toward Jews. I think that can best be accomplished through private negotiations.\n"", 'Q. What changes would you like to see in energy policy?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would continue to import oil at least at the present level. I would let the Arab countries know that if they declare another embargo on oil shipments to us, we would consider this an economic declaration of war and would respond quickly with a boycott against them.\n', 'Next, I would shift toward coal as quickly as I could, using government inducements if necessary. I would increase dramatically the amount of research and development funds that go into solar energy. I would favor strong conservation measures, including mandatory efficiency of autos, better insulation of homes, changes in the rate structure of electric power companies. I would continue to use atomic power as a last priority, and with strict conservation and safety protections required. I favor the deregulation of natural gas for a limited period of time, leaving existing contracts at the lowest price levels intact.\n', 'Q. How would you reconcile the differences between the environmentalists and the coal companies?\n', 'Governor Carter. I favored the strict stripmining bill that was vetoed by President Ford, with a couple of exceptions.\n', 'Q. What about air standards that would permit you to burn coal?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would not favor the lowering of air pollution standards.\n', ""Q. But isn't that a contradiction? How will you get more coal use with existing technology?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't agree. I think we are now burning clean coal, and there's a lot more where that came from.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor breaking up the integrated oil companies?\n', 'Governor Carter. Breaking up the oil companies as a major goal would be counterproductive. At the wholesale and retail level, I think divestiture ought to be considered, unless I was assured as President that there was an adequate amount of competition at those levels. In the exploration, extraction, transport, refining, and distribution of oil, I think divestiture would be counterproductive.\n', 'On horizontal divestiture, there again I would seriously consider it, unless I were convinced that there was adequate competition in the production of coal and uranium.\n', 'Q. How would you help New York City out of its financial bind?\n', ""Governor Carter. If I am elected President in November, I would immediately start to work with the Governor, the mayor, and our advisers to formulate a contract to be signed by me to resolve New York City's financial difficulties.\n"", ""I don't believe we could do it in less than 6 years. But it would require several basic elements. One is to guarantee to my satisfaction that accurate projections were being made on an annual basis for both income and expenditures. Second, after a period of time, the budget would be balanced. Third, bonds already sold and those to be sold would be sound. Fourth, the state and local governments would jointly assume responsibility for those factors.\n"", ""I would use the federal government to guarantee the integrity of New York State's bonds, not New York City's, under which circumstances the bonds would not be tax-free. I don't think that revenue-sharing should go to states. I think it ought to go to local governments. And I don't think that, in the long run, local governments should pay any portion of welfare costs.\n"", 'Q. Would you change the welfare system?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I would. I would not completely federalize welfare. To do so, it's estimated it would cost about $20 billion, which would add to the federal budget without improving the quality of the system at all.\n"", ""We now have about 12 million welfare recipients who are permanently drawing payments; we've got about 2 million welfare workers—a worker for every six recipients. Of the 12 million, about 1.3 million are fully able to work.\n"", ""They're not afflicted in any way and don't have dependent children. I'd take that 1.3 million out of the welfare system entirely and place them under the responsibility of the Labor Department and HEW, give them job training, literacy instruction if they can't read and write, the services of private and public job placement agencies, and match them with jobs. If they're offered a job and don't take it, I would not pay them any more benefits.\n"", ""The others can't work full-time. They ought to be treated with decency and respect, for a change. They ought to be given a fairly uniform nationwide payment, one payment to meet the basic necessities of life. There ought to be a work incentive aspect built in, so that a mother with two little kids and the father dead can get a part-time job, and she ought to be encouraged to do so and not lose her welfare. We ought to remove elements of the welfare system that force a father to leave the home. I think everything the government does ought to be designed to bind the family together, not separate it.\n"", 'Q. How do you categorize your brand of economics? Are you a Keynesian, monetarist, or what?\n', ""Governor Carter. How would you describe me? I don't know.""]"
18,Jimmy Carter ,"May 06, 1976","['Bill Moyers. When you were growing up in that wooden clapboard house on that dusty road, spearing fish in your spare time, or netting fish in your spare time, did you ever think about being President?\n', ""Governor Carter. No. I didn't have but one desire, aspiration that I can remember, and that is going to the Naval Academy. Nobody in my father's family had ever finished high school before I did, and to actually go to college, in itself, was a notable goal to establish in our family.\n"", 'And my father was in World War I, in the Army—I had a very favorite uncle who was in the Navy—and we saw in those Depression years that the best opportunity for me to get a college education was to go to one of the service academies where the tuition would be free. And Annapolis was my goal all the time until I went off to it.\n', 'Q. No other boyhood aspirations, fantasies?\n', 'Governor Carter. No, no. When I was 5 years old, if anyone had asked me—what are you going to do when you grow up? I would have said—I want to go to Annapolis.\n', 'Q. Is that right?\n', 'Governor Carter. And it was a kind of all-obsessive thing.\n', ""Q. I've been intrigued as to why you almost suddenly gave up a military career and went back to Plains. You make a gesture at telling why in there, but there's something missing to me. Your father died. And you thought about his life, and you went back—but was there something else?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, up until that time, I guess I was a naval officer who enjoyed my work. I had the best jobs in the Navy. I put into commission, as a precommission crew chief, the first ship the Navy built after the Second War, and then I went in the first nuclear submarine program. You know, the choice jobs in the whole Navy.\n', ""And then my father had terminal cancer, and I had to go home to be with him about the last month of his life. I hadn't seen him since I was about 17 years old. This was 10, 12 years later.\n"", ""And I had always wanted, I guess, ultimately to be the Chief of Naval Operations, which is, you know, it's top of the Navy. But when I went back home to where I had lived and saw what my father's life meant—in the view of those who knew him best—his service on the school board, his working for a new hospital, his dealing with the education of farmers who bought seed and so forth from him, his life in the church and his life in politics. He'd just been elected to the legislature and served 1 year when he died.\n"", ""Well, I could see then a pull on me that was almost irresistible to go back and resubmit my ties to my birthplace. My family and my wife's family have both lived right there in Plains, Georgia. The members of our family who were bom in the 1700's—we never have moved anywhere—and I guess that was a strong pull, too, that I didn't detect at the time.\n"", 'But I think I had a choice to make. Did I want to be the Chief of Naval Operations and devote my whole life to that one narrowly defined career, which was a good one, or did I want to go back and build a more diverse life with a lot of friends, permanence, stability, in a community, in a relationship, in the life of a whole group of people? And I chose the latter.\n', ""Q. Did you regret that, those last 11 years of your father's life? You had really not been in close touch with him.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I would like, obviously, in retrospect, to have been more with my father. I never thought he would die so young. But I've never regretted a day that I served in the Navy. That was an opportunity for me that paid off. I had a chance to travel extensively. I read and studied everything from, you know, music, drama, art, classical music, and so forth. I stretched my mind and had a great challenge, and I never had any regret for a single day that I spent in the Navy. I never regretted getting out a single day after I left.\n"", 'Q. What do you think it did for you or to you? Did it stamp this discipline that everyone tells me about? This respect for authority?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I think so. Obviously, the Naval Academv is quite heavily disciplined. And a life on a ship—particularly as a junior officer—is a heavy discipline; to move into submarines is a heavier dscipline. And then I met Rickover, who knew me as one of his maybe four young naval officers who had come in on the Seawolf and the Nautilus, which were the two submarines that were built with atomic power. And he demanded from me a standard of performance and a depth of commitment that I had never realized before that I could achieve. And I think second to my own father, Admiral Rickover had more effect on my life than any other man.\n', ""Q. What did he say to you? What was it? You reminded me of something Robert Penn Warren said to me in a recent conversation like this— he said, ftFm convinced now that the single most indispensable element in any human beings life is the touch of another individual who says, 'You matter. You make a difference.9 99\n"", 'And I was going to ask you, who9s done that in your life, and you say it9s your father and Rickover.\n', 'Governor Carter. I said ""men."" Yes. Well, there was no personal interrelationship between me and Rickover. It was an impersonal demand of a perfectionist.\n', 'Q. Can you step back as the civilian Commander in Chief from this heavy influence of the military and of an admiral in your life?\n', 'Governor Carter. I can.\n', 'Q. Can you?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, yes. There's no aspect of a militaristic inclination now on my part. I feel free of that completely. But the self-discipline has stuck with me. I have a constant drive just to do the best I can, and sometimes it's disconcerting to other people, but it's not an unpleasant thing for me. I don't feel that I've got to win, or that I, you know, that I'll be terribly disappointed if I don't win. I feel a sense of equanimity about it. If I—if I do my best and lose, I don't have any regrets.\n"", 'Q. What drives you?\n', 'Governor Carter. [Long silence.] I don\'t know. I—exactly how to express it. As I said, it\'s not an unpleasant sense of being driven. I feel like I have one life to live. I feel like that God wants me to do the best I can with it. And that\'s quite often my major prayer. Let me live my life so that it will be meaningful. And I enjoy attacking difficult problems and solving of solutions and answering the difficult questions and the meticulous organization of a complicated effort. It\'s a challenge—possibly it\'s like a game. I don\'t know. I don\'t want to lower it by saying it\'s just a ""game,"" but it\'s an enjoyable thing for me.\n', 'Q. How do you know—this is a question I hear a lot of young people— how do you know God9s will?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I pray frequently. Not continually, but many times a day. When I have sense of peace and just self-assurance—I don't know where it comes from—that what I'm doing is the right thing, I assume, maybe in an unwarranted way, that that's doing God's will.\n"", ""Q. Let's go back a minute to the people who touched you.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. When you were young. Who else?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there were two women, in particular, when I was young. One, obviously, was my mother. I'm much more like my mother than I am my father. She read day and night, at the breakfast table, the lunch table, die supper table. I do, still. She was very compassionate.\n"", 'Q. You mean she read out loud?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, no. No; she just read books. And so did I, by the way. My father didn't. He read the newspaper and maybe U.S. News and World Report, and that was just about it. Mother always was a champion of disadvantaged people. In our area it was poor whites and all blacks. Later, when she was past retirement age, she, as you know, went to India for 2 years, and she, I think, she came back when she was after 70.\n"", 'Q. The Peace Corps?\n', ""Governor Carter. In the Peace Corps, yes. In the Peace Corps. But she's always been that way. Miss Julia Coleman was a superintendent of our school when I was growing up in Plains. Plains is a town of about 600 population. The schoolhouse is still there. And she saw something in me, I think, when I was a little child, a hunger to learn, and although I lived in a rural area, 3 or 4 miles, 3 miles from Plains. We didn't have electricity or running water. But we didn't suffer. But she made sure that I listened to classical music. She would make me do it. And she'd make sure that I learned the famous paintings, and the artists, and she gave me lists of books to read, and she was very strict with me.\n"", 'Q. Who were the villains in your life?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, I never had any—really any traumatic experiences. I never had any overwhelming fears or deprivations. I lived a sheltered life. My mom and my daddy were always there. And we lived in an isolated area. There were about two white families and maybe 25 or 30 black families around. The dominant family in the community was a black family, an AME bishop, Bishop Johnson.\n', 'But when things went wrong, you know, in the field or in the woods or in school, home was always a haven. So I never did have any fears, I guess, no villains that I can think of.\n', 'Q. You said once that you never really seriously considered disobeying your father. And I wonder if anyone who never disobeyed his father can understand the rest of us.\n', ""Governor Carter. [laughter] Well, as a matter of fact, I never disobeyed my father in that when he said, Jimmy, you do something, I failed to do it. But on many occasions I did things that I knew my father didn't like, and I was punished very severely because of it.\n"", 'In fact, my father very seldom gave me an order. If all the other field workers were off for the afternoon, and he wanted me to turn the potato vines so they could be plowed Monday morning, daddy would say to me— he called me ""Hot.""\n', 'Q. He called you what?\n', 'Governor Carter. ""Hot""—""Hot Shot""—is what he called me. He says, ""Hot, would you like to turn the potato vines this afternoon?"" And I would much rather go to the movie or something. But I always said, ""Yes, sir, daddy, I would."" And I would do it. But he didn\'t have to give me many direct orders. But I never did disobey a direct order my father gave me.\n', 'Q. You wanted to be a good boy?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, it wasn\'t a namby-pamby sort of thing. My father was my friend. And I respected him. I never said ""yes"" or ""no"" to my father. I would say, ""yes, sir,"" ""no, sir,"" to my mother, too, still do, and to most people that I don\'t know well. But it was a matter of respect. It wasn\'t any matter of trying to kow-tow to him or...\n', 'Q. FFaf it a stern life?\n', 'Governor Carter. I—I ...\n', 'Q. I grew up on the Meridian about 500, oh, 400 miles due west from you. We danced not at all. We never went to a movie on Sunday. One of the first spankings I got was when I went—slipped off and went to a movie on Sunday. We had to go to BTU, and if we violated it, we were in trouble. It was a stern life. Was it in Plains?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; it was a stem life. But there wasn't much to do. [laughter] If it hadn't been a stem life—we didn't have any movies in Plains, and I remember that when I was a small child, we had a very small bowling alley that was not nearly as long as a regular one was, but it was an exciting thing for Plains when we had a bowling alley for awhile, with the small balls.\n"", 'But my life was spent in a fairly isolated way, out in the woods and in the streams and swamps and fields. My classmates were—my playmates were black—my classmates were white. And my whole environment was completely rural. Plains was the nearest town, population of 600. And I only went there when I had to. I did attend school there, and it was a—it was a growing factor in my life, but my background is all in the woods.\n', 'Q. What do you do now for fun?\n', ""Governor Carter. I read a lot, and I have a—about the only thing that I do for fun now is to look forward to being home. I stay gone a lot, away from Plains, away from our house, away from our little daughter, away from my wife, away from mother, away from my mother-in-law, my brother, and sisters and my wife's kinfolks. And when I get home, I change immediately into work clothes, put on brogans and dungarees, and either go to the farm or walk in the woods. My wife and I hunt arrowheads. We go out into the fields after they've been plowed and rained on, and we walk some times for hours, just talking to each other about different things, sometimes politics, quite often about our family. We have very few moments alone. And so the fun in my life is just reestablishing for a 24 or 32 hour period, whatever it is, the structure of my family.\n"", ""Q. What do you think you're on earth for?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I don\'t know. I could quote the Biblical references to creation, that God created us in his own image, hoping that we\'d be perfect, and we turned out to be not perfect but very sinful. And then when Christ was asked what are the two great commandments from God which should direct our lives, he said, ""To love God with all your heart and soul and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself."" So I try to take that condensation of the Christian theology and let it be something through which I search for a meaningful existence. I don\'t worry about it too much anymore. I used to when I was a college sophomore, and we used to debate for hours and hours about why we\'re here, who made us, where shall we go, what\'s our purpose.\n', ""But I don't feel frustrated about it. You know, I'm not afraid to see my life ended. I feel like every day is meaningful. I don't have any fear at all of death. I feel like I'm doing the best I can, and if I get elected President, I'll have a chance to magnify my own influence, maybe for—in a meaningful way. If I don't get elected President, I'll go back to Plains. So I feel like a sense of equanimity about it. But what—why we're here on earth, I don't know. I'd like to hear your views on that subject. [laughter]\n"", 'Q. Do you ever have any doubts? People say to me, ""Jimmy Carter appears to be so full of certainty and conviction in a time when, as Gabriel said in Green Pastures, \'Everything that\'s loose is coming, everything that\'s tied together is turning loose, coming loose.\' "" Do you ever have any doubts? About yourself, about God, about life?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't think of any, you know. Obviously, I don't know all of the answers to the philosophical questions and theological questions that— you know, the questions that are contrived. But the things that I haven't been able to answer in a theory of supposition, I just accept them and go on. The things that I can't influence or change.\n"", 'I do have, obviously, many doubts about the best way to answer a question or how to alleviate a concern or how to meet a need. Q. I ran into a—by accident—into a friend of mine who\'s a lawyer in a large firm in New York, and this may have something to do with the origin of the question. He asked me where I was going when he saw me leaving, and I told him where I was coming down io, to do this conversation, and he said, ""Could I ask you to ask Jimmy Carter something?"" And I said, ""Well, I\'ll try."" And I wrote it down. He said: ""What bothers me about Jimmy Carter, the human being, is that he strikes me as a decent but provincial and narrow-minded man from the South who\'s lived most of his life in that environment. And I\'d like to know how a man like that expects to lead a pluralistic society, not to mention the Western world."" And I said I would ask that. [laughter]\n', ""Governor Carter. OK, that's a good question. I'm not sure that you have to have lived in many different places to understand a pluralistic society. I've had a changing career myself. I started out as an isolated farmboy living in—as a minority member—in a predominantly black neighborhood. I moved from that to a smaller town and then from there to a junior college—from there to Georgia Tech and then to the Naval Academy.\n"", ""I've traveled extensively in foreign countries all my adult life. In the last 4 or 5 years, I've moved in foreign affairs on the level with Prime Ministers and Presidents, Foreign Ministers, defense chiefs and so forth, as a governor.\n"", ""For instance, when I've been to Israel, I've been with Mrs. Meir, Mr. Rabin, and Mr. Allon—and Mr. Rabin and others, and Mr. Eban. When I've been to Japan, I've been with Mr. Miki, Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Yokura, and Mr. Hohita [Ohira]. And I've been to Colombia; I've been with the President of Colombia. So I had a chance to learn in a very—as a very eager student the possible ways to improve our interrelationships with those countries, talking to their leaders.\n"", ""I've read extensively in the history of our country, the purpose of the President, the interrelationship between the President and the Congress, about every one of the 435 congressional districts in this country, their demographic makeup, past voting records, primary interests of the people who live there. I've studied the campaign platform of every person who's ever run for President, whether they lost or won. And I've had a chance, as governor, to deal with a multiplicity of problems from different kinds of people, those who are mentally afflicted, those who are very rich and want favors, those who are corporate giants—they want to preserve a special privilege—those who are consumers and are hungry for a chance at the marketplace, those who are poor and illiterate, who are looking and not finding, criminal justice. So I think the diversity of my experience helps alleviate that. In my own career, life, I've been a farmer at first, and still am now, a businessman in a business I built fairly much myself, an engineer, a scientist, a naval officer, local and state government official. So I've had a broad background. That doesn't mean that I'm completely at home with all elements of a pluralistic society, but I think my background would be equivalent to many people who have become President, who have served successfully.\n"", ""Q. What do you think of the three or four lessons that we have to take away from this last decade, if we don't get into trouble again?\n"", 'Governor Carter. One is to strip away secrecy of government in every possible way we can, to open up the deliberations of the Executive and Legislative Branches of government\n', 'Q. Would you let the minutes of the Cabinet meeting be made public?\n', 'Governor Carter. There would have to be some exclusions. States have done this. Fil get back to your question specifically in a minute. Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, California, and Massachusetts recently have done this. There have to be some exclusions.\n', ""When you have staff members advising a superior, that ought to be an area that would be kept private because you've got to have the freedom of debate and the chance for some inferior person in an organization to make a ridiculous suggestion and not be embarrassed later, from that same person a superior suggestion that might be put forward in a tentative way. It wouldn't be if he knew all the rough data was going to be spread in the public at a later time.\n"", 'Q. All right, strip away secrecy.\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, strip away secrecy. The second thing is to make sure that we have, in our government, an access of the people in other ways. I would like to see, for instance, Cabinet members go before joint sessions of Congress to be examined and questioned about foreign affairs, defense, agriculture, and so forth.\n', 'Q. Like the British system?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; I would like to see that.\n', 'Q. You would send your Secretary of State up to a joint session of Congress to actually answer questions from the floor?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; I would. If the Congress would accept this, I will be glad to have it done.\n', ""The President ought to tell the truth always. I see no reason for the President to lie, and if any of my Cabinet members ever lie, they'll be gone the next day.\n"", 'Q. Governor, when you say that, when you say, ""I will never lie, I will never mislead you,"" people have more doubts about your perception of reality than they do about your integrity.\n', 'Governor Carter. I understand.\n', 'Q. Other people are now saying, ""Jimmy Carter is trying to put one over on us. But Jimmy Carter just doesn\'t understand the way Washington international power works.""\n', ""Governor Carter. I understand that. And I have thought about that a lot, because I've been in debate a lot, and one of the great surprises to me in the campaign was that when I made that simple statement 18 months ago—not in a fervent way, not even in a way to surprise anybody—that I, as a candidate and as a President, I'm not going to lie to you, that it became so controversial.\n"", 'Q. Why were you surprised?\n', ""Governor Carter. I was surprised that it was a controversy. The first time I ever voted was in 1948. I was in submarine school. All the other officers there voted for Dewey. I voted for Truman. He's still my favorite President. I don't believe that Truman ever told me a lie or told the American people a lie. He may have, but I don't believe he did. I think other Presidents since then have. I don't see any reason for it.\n"", ""Q. But doesn't this...\n"", ""Governor Carter. To me, that's important.\n"", ""Q. Yes, yes; I can see that. But doesn't this go back to what the lawyer was saying earlier? Jimmy Carter's a nice man, but he doesn't really know that the world isn't a Christian place, that the world isn't a good place. The world is full of power brokers and power seekers, and people want things.\n"", 'Governor Carter. That may be true. But, as you know, Christians don\'t have a monopoly on the truth, and when I go out of office, if I\'m elected, at the end of 4 years or 8 years, I hope people will say, ""You know, Jimmy Carter made a lot of mistakes, but he never told me a lie.""\n', 'Q. If anybody came forward with the evidence in this campaign that you had lied, would you quit?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think I would, because I haven't told a lie.\n"", 'Q. If anybody came forward with evidence that while you were in the White House that you had lied, would you resign?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't say that. But there will be times when I'm asked a question that I might refuse to answer. But if I give an answer, it will be the truth.\n"", ""I think we ought to also have—I've forgotten the original question ...\n"", ""Q. The question was, what are the three or four lessons we musn't forget from the last 10 years if we don't make the same mistakes. You said strip away secrecy.\n"", 'Governor Carter. I would never again------\n', 'Q. Tell me the truth.\n', 'Governor Carter. [Continuing] Get militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country. Unless our own security is directly threatened.\n', 'Q. If North Korea invaded South Korea, would you get involved?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, we're already involved there. And we have a commitment by the Congress, the President, the people and the United Nations in South Korea. I would prefer to withdraw all of our troops and land forces from South Korea over a period of years—3, 4 years, whatever. But, obviously, we're already committed in Japan. We're committed in Germany.\n"", 'Q. Well, where then does the Carter Doctrine apply?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, it would apply in retrospect to South Vietnam. It would apply in recent months to the attempt in Angola. It would apply possibly in the future in a place like Rhodesia. I just wouldn't do it. I don't think the American people need it. We don't have to show that we're strong. We are strong. And I wouldn't get involved militarily.\n"", ""Another thing we must do in this country is to make the government mechanism work. It's an ineffective, bloated, confused, unmanageable bureaucracy there. And it—it hurts our people worse than anything I can think of almost—even compared to integrity in government, the competence of government is missing.\n"", 'Q. Is that your vision? You open your autobiography by saying, ""As we observe the 200th birthday of our nation, it\'s appropriate to ask ourselves two basic questions: One, can our government be honest, decent, open, fair and compassionate? Two, can our government be competent?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right.\n"", ""Q. Is that Jimmy Carter's vision for America—efficient government? Good government?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Good and efficient government. As far as the management of government, yes.\n', ""Q. I read your proposals and the record of your administration in Georgia on that—and I've read a lot of your speeches and analyses—the effect of which, it seems to me, is to centralize the Executive Branch of the government. It's to bring the power of the Executive Branch of government to bear through the White House. Don't you find people wary of centralized authority after the Lyndon Johnson Administration and the war in Vietnam and Richard Nixon and Watergate?\n"", 'Governor Carter. No.\n', ""Q. You don't find people wary?\n"", 'Governor Carter. No; not of what you just described. When you say-—wnen you throw Johnson, Watergate, Vietnam in the question, obviously, people are very wary about that.\n', 'Q. Right.\n', ""Governor Carter. [laughs] But I was trying to separate the subject and the predicate from all the other clauses that you added on to. They're all wary about what occurred with Watergate, with Vietnam, with the CIA, with Johnson, with Nixon—of course they are. But it's not the fact that the government is well organized, managed, a clear delineation of authorities and responsibilities. I did it in Georgia, and not only did we save a lot of money and make it more economical and efficient—that was to some degree important—but the main thing is we opened up government so the people could understand it and control it.\n"", ""It needs to be so that people who do jobs in the federal government—at all levels, from the bottom all the way up to the top—know what they're supposed to do. A clear delineation of authority; a chance for civil service employees to use whatever talent or ability or profession they have in a more productive way. To give service to our people; to minimize red tape, to minimize confusion, to minimize paperwork—just to let the government work.\n"", 'Q. You\'re saying, in effect, ""Trust me. I will do those things.""\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Is that right?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', ""Q. And there's no question but that you have tapped a feeling in the country that wants to trust.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Yet, in 1964 and 1965 and 1966, Lyndon Johnson said, ""I have the facts. Trust me."" In 1968, Richard Nixon said, ""I have a secret plan to end the war in Vietnam. Trust me."" Now, why, after two times burned, should the American people take from another politician the admonition, trust me? \'\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, you know, I can't answer that question. There's a matter that I've already discussed—the absence of secrecy and truth. The only way I know to restore the trust of the American people in the government is for the government to be trustworthy.\n"", 'Q. Well, what does that mean? What would you—openness and, ah ...?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think openness and honesty. And truthfulness.\n', ""Q. Are you aware that once you become President, you will be making decisions that will immediately make some people unhappy who thought they saw in you a champion? Isn't that inevitable?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Well, what do you do about that disillusionment? And don\'t they then say, ""Well, Jimmy Carter\'s not trustworthy?""\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question. I think that we obviously went through this in Georgia. I laid down a whole thing, a series of things, that I promised to people. I campaigned 4 years. I wanted to be governor, didn't intend to lose. My wife and I shook hands with over 600,000 people. When I was elected, I very carefully had kept a list of everything I had promised. I was quite reticent—I carried all the promises. The legislature was not for me to begin with. They had thought my opponent was going to win. I won. And I cooperated with them. We did what I promised. I don't think I disillusioned the people of Georgia. I don't think Georgia is a disillusioned state now.\n"", ""The ones who cling to me as a friend are the ones who throughout their whole lives have been deprived of an opportunity to make decisions about their own lives. I saw clearly as Governor of Georgia, I see clearly now as a prospective, possible President, that in almost every instance, people who make decisions in government that affect human beings very seldom suffer when their decisions are wrong. The people who carved out a disgraceful, wasteful, confused, overlapping welfare system, their families never draw welfare. The people who carved out a disgraceful tax system, they don't ever get hurt because they're cared for when the tax laws are written.\n"", ""The criminal justice system—I'm not a lawyer. We pride ourselves in having a good, fair criminal justice system. It's not fair. Now, wealth is a major factor in whether or not you get justice or not.\n"", 'Q. That brings up the quote that you use in the beginning of your autobiography from someone we both admire—Reinhold Niebuhr—""The sad duty of politics is to establish justice in a sinful world.\'\' Do you think this is a just society?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, no; I don't. I think one of the major responsibilities I have as a leader and as a potential leader is to try to establish justice. And that applies to a broad gamut of things—international affairs, peace, equality, elimination of injustice in racial discrimination, elimination of injustice in tax programs, elimination of injustice in our criminal justice system and so forth.

The profile that emerges is of a man who's into everything and pushing and pressing. How does that square with the reports we're getting of an anti-government, anti-Washington mood in the country which you seem to represent?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I've never expressed deliberately any anti-Washington feeling or any anti-government feeling. When, as Truman said, you know, people say I'm giving them hell, but when I tell the truth they think truth is hell. You know. I'm not going to disrupt anything when I get here to Washington, if I'm elected. I'm not anti-Washington at all. There's no one that I can think of that I would admit that cares more about my government than I do and who's thought about it more, studied it more and wants to see it run well more, wants to see it returned to the control of the people more. And when I come here, I think I'll get along fine. But I would be a very activist President. I never have said I wanted a small government. I want one that, when it performs a function, does it well and performs a function in the ways that alleviate the problems of those who have not had an adequate voice in the past.\n"", 'Q. What do you think the purpose of government is?\n', ""Governor Carter. To provide legitimate services to our. people; to help preserve peace; to provide a mechanism by which the people's character can be expressed in international affairs. I think the purpose of government is to alleviate inequities. I think the purpose of government is to provide for things that we can't provide ourselves.\n"", ""Q. How do you see the Presidency, for example? What's the purpose of the President?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, of course, a President has a many-faceted character. As does an individual. And does a nation.\n', ""I think the major thing that I study about is the relationship between the President and the Congress and the function of a President as he relates to the people. And maybe that's the question that you're asking. And the kind of President that we need.\n"", ""I think the President ought to be—I think the nation's best served by a President who is strong and aggressive and innovative and sensitive. Working with the Congress. Is strong, independent, in harmony for a change, with mutual respect for a change. In the open, and with a minimum of secrecy for a change. I don't think the Congress is capable of leadership. That's no reflection on the Congress, but you can't have 535 people leading the nation. I don't think the Founding Fathers ever thought that Congress would lead this country.\n"", ""There's only one person in this nation that can speak with a clear voice to the American people. There's only one person that can set a standard of ethics and morality and excellence and greatness or call on the American people to make a sacrifice and explain the purpose of the sacrifice, or answer difficult questions or propose and carry out bold programs, or to provide for defense posture that would make us feel secure, a foreign policy that would make us proud once again, and that's the President. In the absence of that leadership, there is no leadership, and the country drifts.\n"", 'So a strong President, yes. But an autocratic President, an imperial Presidency, no.\n', 'Q. You think that day is over?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; it\'s over. But I think the only way to guarantee it—against it is to remove the tight secrecy that binds around someone once they\'ve started making a serious mistake. We\'ve had some Presidents that were incapable of admitting, ""Look, I\'ve made a mistake."" And that\'s been the cause of a great deal of our woe in this country in the last number of years, as you know. Other Presidents said, ""Look, I messed up on that one. This is what happened. I was at fault. This is—the people who were culpable. We\'ve corrected it. It won\'t happen again.""\n', 'But that freedom with the people, and the absence of the need to constantly prove oneself as being superior, is an important personal characteristic in a President. I think it would prevent another Vietnam or another Watergate.\n', 'Q. Let me go back to some personal questions as we close here. You said once that you were strongly influenced by a sermon whose title was— ""If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"" What is the evidence that the rest of us can see of a Christian?\n', ""Governor Carter. [Sigh] I don't know. That's a hard question to answer, because I don't think I'm better than anyone else. I reckon there's my own shortcomings and sinfulness and need to improve, and need for forgiveness among the people around me, and God.\n"", 'I was going through a state in my life then that was a very difficult one. I had run for governor and lost. Everything I did was not gratifying. When I succeeded in something, it was a horrible experience for me. And I thought I was a good Christian. I was the chairman of the Board of Deacons. I was the head of the brotherhood in all the 34 churches in my district, and head of the finance committee, and Sunday school teacher just about all my life. I thought I really was a great Christian.\n', 'And one day the preacher gave this sermon—I don\'t remember a thing he said—I just remember the title which you described—""If You Were Arrested for Being a Christian, Would There Be Any Evidence To Convict You?""\n', 'And my answer by the time that sermon was over was ""No."" I never had really committed myself totally to God—my Christian beliefs were superficial. Based primarily on pride, and—I\'d never done much for other people. I was always thinking about myself, and I changed somewhat for the better. I formed a much more intimate relationship with Christ And since then, I\'ve had just about like a new life. As far as hatreds, frustrations, I feel at ease with myself. And it doesn\'t mean that I\'m better, but I\'m better off myself.\n', 'Q. Do you remember writing that—you were on a submarine, I believe, a submarine in the North Atlantic—when you heard that President Truman had dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is that correct? You were—you were at sea?\n', 'Governor Carter. I was at sea.\n', 'Q. Do you remember what you thought? And Fil come to the point in a minute. Do you remember what you thought when you heard that?\n', ""Governor Carter. We were informed—I was at sea—the whole crew was informed that the President, President Truman, had a momentous announcement to make. We didn't know what it was going to be. The captain of the ship— maybe with orders over the radio—instructed all of us to gather before the loudspeaker systems on the ship. We thought that we had invaded Japan, and a lot of us young naval strategists had estimated how many people would be killed in this country. The generally accepted figure among us was a half million Americans would die as we captured Japan and ended the war.\n"", ""Truman announced not that we had invaded Japan, but that a bomb of unprecedented power had been dropped on Japan. We had never heard of anything like this. It was a mystery to us. I didn't know obviously—have any concept of what was going on.\n"", ""But I felt at that time a tremendous sense of relief that we had not, indeed, begun an invasion of Japan, and I can't remember now that long ago------\n"", 'Q. Are you—\n', 'Governor Carter. [Continuing] Other thoughts.\n', 'Q. Do you have the capacity to make that decision?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; I believe so. I would use every resource in my life to prevent it. But I think I would have the capacity to make the choice between the lesser of two evils—and in my opinion, that was the kind of choice that Truman had to make. So, in a similar circumstance, the answer would be ""Yes.""\n', ""Q. Tom Ottenad, who's a very well-known writer for the St. Louis Post Dispatch—1 see you know him------\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes; I know him.\n', 'Q. [Continuing] Said recently, ""In a ruthless business, Jimmy Carter is a ruthless operator. Even as he wears his broad smile and displays his southern charm."" And the question that arises, and I\'ve been inside the White House—I know some of the influences that work on a man trying to do the right thing—can you be ruthless in the way I think he means it here? And a Christian?\n', ""Governor Carter. I presume—well, I'm a Christian, no matter what.\n"", 'Q. But how do you reconcile?\n', 'Governor Carter. OK, he was talking about the campaign. And I don\'t know what he meant by ruthless. I don\'t think I\'ve ever deliberately hurt one of my opponents to gain an advantage. I try not to. I don\'t remember when I have. There may have been something that I\'ve said in the heat of competition that made them feel discomforted. I can\'t deny that. But—most people when they get to know me think that ... finally decide that I\'m much tougher than is originally apparent. So the word ""ruthless"" to me has connotations of cruelty. And I\'m not sure I could be cruel.\n', 'Q. Let me ask it to you this way ...\n', 'Governor Carter. I think I can be tough in making decisions that were difficult. And I can be tenacious under difficult circumstances.\n', ""I have temptations to which I yield often. You know, to make compromises. One of the major criticisms of me by my opponents in the legislature, who've never yet been assuaged, is that I can't compromise. And that, that's a common criticism. I often had to compromise, but I didn't compromise in a back room. And didn't compromise to begin with. My preference was to spell out my position openly—this is what I propose; this is the reason for it; this is the mess we have now; this is what we can accomplish—try to work harmoniously with the legislature; try to give them all the credit they could, and then fight to the last vote. And I never was much able to get in a back room and compromise away the things I believed in.\n"", ""And that's a very legitimate source of criticism for me. I'm not a good compromiser.\n"", ""But I'll—I didn't suffer. I don't think Georgia suffered under my administration because of that attitude.\n"", 'Q. I think what some people in this town are talking about is the unwillingness of Woodrow Wilson to compromise on the League of Nations.\n', 'Governor Carter. Sure.\n', 'Q. The unwillingness of Lyndon Johnson to compromise on the war, or Richard Nixon on the opposition of the war, and a feeling that a disciplined, principled man, convicted of his own rightness, or having a private pipeline to God, in a sense, is going to say, ""I\'m right."" And the town won\'t function because of his inability to compromise. Is that a legitimate danger?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe so. I can see that would be a legitimate concern, but I think the concern will be proven unjustified. They have a right to be concerned, but I don't think they need to be.\n"", 'I\'d like to quote one other thing—you\'ve gotten into theology—Tillich said, ""That religion is a search for the relationship between us and God and us and our fellow human beings."" And he went on to say, ""That when we quit searching, in effect, we\'ve lost our religion."" When we become self-satisfied, proud, sure, at that point we lose the self-searching, the humility, the subservience to God\'s will, the more intimate understanding of other people\'s needs, the more inclination to be accommodating, and, in that instant, we lose our religion.\n', ""So, the fact that a person has deep religious convictions doesn't necessarily mean that that person always thinks that he's right, that God's ordained him to take a dominant position.

I never—[laughter]—I never asked God to let me win a single nomination. Never.\n', 'Q. What do you pray then?\n', ""Governor Carter. I ask God to let me do what's right. And to let me do what's best—that my life be meaningful—in an optimum way, and, if I win or lose, I believe I can accept the decision with composure, and without regrets, or without animosities or hatreds, or deep disappointment even.\n"", ""Q. In your own search for what Tillich said is the truth about man's relationship to man and to God?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', ""Q. What's the most significant discovery Jimmy Carter has made?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I think I described it superficially a while ago. I think it affected my life more than anything else. This is embarrassing a little bit for me to talk about it, because it's personal, but in my relationship with Christ and with God, I became able in the process to look at it in practical terms, to accept defeat, to get pleasure out of successes, to be at peace with a world, and when I—for instance, one of the things that I derived from it in a—again in a kind of embarrassing way—is that when I stand on a factory shift line, like I did this morning in Erie, Pennsylvania, the General Electric plant, everybody that comes through there—when I shake hands with them, for that instant, I really care about them. In a genuine way. And I believe they know it. A lot of times.\n"", 'Quite often I will shake hands with a woman who works in a plant, say, an older woman, and I\'ll just touch her hand, and quite frequently, they\'ll put their arms around my neck and say, you know, ""God bless you, son.""

I\'ve still got a long way to go, but you asked me a difficult question. What was the major discovery of my life? That\'s a hard thing to answer.\n', 'Q. But you care, though.

He said it's a disgraceful profession, stay out of it. And, I got angry, and I turned to him and kind of lashed back. I said, how would you like to be a pastor of a church with some 80,000 members?

But I like to have a chance to change things that I don't like, and to correct the inequities as I discern them, and to be a strong spokesman for those that are not strong. And I guess that's power. So, I can't deny that one of the purposes that I want to be President is to have power, yes.\n"", 'Q. One final question. If we learned anything the last few years, it has been that good intentions in the use of great power are no guarantee that that power will be used wisely.\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right\n"", 'Q. That the character of the man is less important to the safeguards against the abuse of power than the checks and balances on the office and on the power.\n', 'Governor Carter.

And trust me, I won\'t abuse the power.""\n', 'Now, after the last 10 years, why should someone believe you? They may trust you. They may know that you are sincere and well-intentioned, and yet they know it is power that often changes the man, and not the man who changes power.\n', ""Governor Carter. I know. I can see that. That's why I go back to what I said originally. You need to have an open government. You need to tell the truth. A minimum of secrecy. Let the people have a maximum part of play in the evolution and consummation of our domestic and foreign policies. That gives you a safety net under an incompetent or distorted President— the people themselves. And I think had we told the people the truth about Vietnam, we would have been out very early. Had the people had the truth about Watergate, it would never have happened.\n"", ""Q. So you're saying Jimmy Carter's character is not enough.\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's right.\n"", 'Q. You want checks. You want balances. You want safeguards.\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't object to those. I don't object to a strong, aggressive Congress. A strong, aggressive Supreme Court. And a strong, aggressive President—if what goes on in our government is known by, debated by, questioned by, controlled by the people of this country.\n"", 'Now, I can see that there are times when an inspirational leader can actually elevate the people. That may happen on rare occasions. I think for a while, at least, John Kennedy did it. Roosevelt did it. This is a part of the Presidency. There are times when the Presidency, perhaps the government itself, might tend to sink below the standards, accumulatively speaking, of the people of this country—in which case, people support or boost that official or those officials in a weak moment. But to exclude the people completely, as we have tended to do in recent years, removes that common sense judgment, character, safety that can preserve our country.\n', ""And it also destroys the concept of our government which did say that the government ought to be controlled by the people—and not by a powerful, secret, hidden, isolated, mistaken President I don't want to see that ever happen again in this country. And I'd like to set the kind of tone, and perhaps the kind of laws, that would prevent a recurrence of these things, if that's humanly possible.\n"", ""Q. What do you want for your children that you didn't have?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I have to say that I had almost everything that I would have needed. I worked hard when I was a little child, but I'm proud of it. I lived in an isolated area when I was a little child, but I don't regret it now. I think those travels through the fields and swamps were, in retrospect, very precious days for me.

As far as knowledge is concerned. But also, they've lost something.\n"", 'Q. Lost something?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. Did I mention earlier, I think, in our conversation? I had a stability there, you know. When things started going wrong in my own life, my father and mother were there, and my sisters and brothers were there. And my church was there.

But there are advantages now: knowing more earlier, traveling more, having a tighter interrelationship with your own peer group than I had. But which is best, I don't know. But maybe we could go back to some of those old principles which we knew when we went to BYPU on Sunday afternoon—[laughter]—and at the same time keep the advantages of a modem world. I'm sure we can keep the advantages of the modem world, but going back to those principles that give stability— of things that we're searching for. We haven't found them yet.\n"", ""Q. I better explain to people that BYPU means Baptist Young People's Union.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Exactly.\n', 'Q. What was your favorite Baptist hymn?\n', 'Governor Carter.

19,Jimmy Carter ,"May 13, 1976","['Mr. Chairman, Mr. Director-General, Captain Cousteau, Ambassador Akhund, Mr. Lehman:\n', 'I have a deep personal concern with the subject of this conference today—""Nuclear Energy and World Order.""\n', ""I have had training as a nuclear engineer, working in the United States Navy on our country's early nuclear submarine program. I learned how nuclear power can be used for peaceful purposes—for propelling ships, for generating electric power and for scientific and medical research. I am acutely aware of its potential—and its dangers. Once I helped in disassembling a damaged nuclear reactor core in an experimental reactor at Chalk River, Canada.\n"", 'From my experience in the Navy and more recently as Governor of Georgia I have come to certain basic conclusions about the energy problem. The world has only enough oil to last about 30 to 40 years at the present rate of consumption. It has large coal reserves—with perhaps 200 years of reserves in the United States alone. The United States must shift from oil to coal, taking care about the environmental problems involved in coal production and use. Our country must also maintain strict energy conservation measures, and derive increasing amounts of energy from renewable sources such as the sun.\n', 'United States dependence on nuclear power should be kept to the minimum necessary to meet our needs. We should apply much stronger safety standards as we regulate its use. And we must be honest with our people concerning its problems and dangers.\n', 'I recognize that many other countries of the world do not have the fossil fuel reserves of the United States. With the four-fold increase in the price of oil, many countries have concluded that they have no immediate alternative except to concentrate on nuclear power.\n', 'But all of us must recognize that the widespread use of nuclear power brings many risks. Power reactors may malfunction and cause widespread radiological damage, unless stringent safety requirements are met Radioactive wastes may be a menace to future generations and civilizations, unless they are effectively isolated within the biosphere forever. And terrorists or other criminals may steal plutonium and make weapons to threaten society or its political leaders with nuclear violence, unless strict security measures are developed and implemented to prevent nuclear theft.\n', 'Beyond these dangers, there is the fearsome prospect that the spread of nuclear reactors will mean the spread of nuclear weapons to many nations. By 1990, the developing nations alone will produce enough plutonium in their reactors to build 3,000 Hiroshima-size bombs a year, and by the year 2000, worldwide plutonium production may be over 1 million pounds a year—the equivalent of 100,000 bombs a year—about half of it outside of the United States.\n', 'This prospect of a nuclear future will be particularly alarming if a large number of nations develop their own national plutonium reprocessing facilities with the capacity to extract plutonium from the spent fuel. Even if such facilities are subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency and even if the countries controlling them are parties to the NonProliferation Treaty, plutonium stockpiles can be converted to atomic weapons at a time of crisis, without fear of effective sanction by the international community.\n', 'The reality of this danger was highlighted by the Indian nuclear explosion of May, 1974, which provided a dramatic demonstration that the development of nuclear power gives any country possessing a reprocessing plant a nuclear weapons option. Furthermore, with the maturing of nuclear power in advanced countries, intense competition has developed in the sale of power reactors, which has also included the sale of the most highly sensitive technologies, including reprocessing plants. With the spread of such capabilities, normal events of history—revolutions, terrorist attacks, regional disputes, and dictators—all could take on a nuclear dimension.\n', 'Dr. Alvin Weinberg, former Director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and one of the most thoughtful nuclear scientists in the United States was properly moved to observe, ""We nuclear people have made a Faustian bargain with society. On the one hand we offer an inexhaustible supply of energy, but the price that we demand of society for this magical energy source is both a vigilance and a longevity of our social institutions that we arc quite unaccustomed to.""\n', 'Nuclear energy must be at the very top of the list of global challenges that call for new forms of international action. The precise form which that action should take is the question to be addressed by this distinguished group of scientists, businessmen, diplomats and government officials during the next four days.\n', 'I would not presume to anticipate the outcome of your expert deliberations. But I suggest that new lines of international action should be considered in three main areas:\n', '(1) action to meet the energy needs of all countries while limiting reliance on nuclear energy;\n', '(2) action to limit the spread of nuclear weapons; and\n', '(3) action to make the spread of peaceful nuclear power less dangerous.\n', '1. We need new international action to help meet the energy needs of all countries while limiting reliance on nuclear energy.\n', 'In recent years, we have had major United Nations conferences on environment, population, food, the oceans and the role of women—with habitat, water, deserts, and science and technology on the schedule for the months and years immediately ahead. These are tentative first steps to deal with global problems on a global basis.\n', 'Critics have been disappointed with the lack of immediate results. But they miss an important point: a new world agenda is emerging from this process—an agenda of priority problems on which nations must cooperate or abdicate the right to plan a future for the human condition.\n', 'The time has come to put the world energy problem on that new agenda. Let us hold a World Energy Conference under the auspices of the United Nations to help all nations cope with common energy problems—eliminating energy waste and increasing energy efficiency; reconciling energy needs with environmental quality goals; and shifting away from almost total reliance upon dwindling sources of non-renewable energy to the greatest feasible reliance on renewable sources. In other words, we must move from living off our limited energy capital to living within our energy income.\n', 'Such a conference would have to be carefully prepared. Just as the World Food Conference provided us with a world food balance sheet, this conference could give us a world energy balance sheet. Just as the World Food Conference stimulated international cooperation in agricultural research and development, so a world energy conference could stimulate research and development in the field of energy.\n', 'Existing international ventures of energy cooperation are not global in scope. The International Energy Agency in Paris includes only some developed non-Communist countries. The Energy Commission of the Conference on International Economic Cooperation does not include countries such as the Soviet Union and China, two great producers and consumers of energy. And the International Energy Institute now under study does not call for a substantial research and development effort.\n', 'A World Energy Conference should not simply be a dramatic meeting to highlight a problem which is then forgotten. Rather, it should lead to the creation of new or strengthened institutions to perform the following tasks:\n', '• improving the collection and analysis of worldwide energy information;\n', '• stimulating and coordinating a network of worldwide energy research centers;\n', '• advising countries, particularly in the developing world, on the development of sound national energy policies;\n', '• providing technical assistance to train energy planners and badly needed energy technicians;\n', '• increasing the flow of investment capital from private and public sources into new energy development;\n', '• accelerating research and information exchange on energy conservation.\n', 'An international energy effort would also be the occasion to examine seriously and in depth this fundamental question:\n', 'Is it really necessary to the welfare of our countries to become dependent upon a nuclear energy economy and if so, how dependent and for what purposes? Surely, there is a moral imperative that demands a worldwide effort to assure that if we travel down the nuclear road we do so with our eyes wide open.\n', ""Such a worldwide effort must also provide practical alternatives to the nuclear option. Many countries, particularly in the developing world, are being forced into a premature nuclear commitment because they do not have the knowledge and the means to explore other possibilities. The world's research and development efforts are now focused either on nuclear energy or on the development of a diminishing supply of fossil fuels.\n"", 'More should be done to help the developing countries develop their oil, gas, and coal resources. But a special effort should be made in the development of small-scale technology that can use renewable sources of energy that are abundant in the developing world—solar heating and cooling, wind energy, and ""bioconversion""—an indirect form of solar energy that harnesses the sunlight captured by living plants. Using local labor and materials, developing countries can be helped to produce usable fuel from human and animal wastes, otherwise wasted wood, fast growing plants, and even ocean kelp and algae.\n', 'Such measures would be a practical way to help the poorest segment of humanity whose emancipation from grinding poverty must be our continuing concern.\n', 'And all countries could reap benefits from worldwide energy cooperation. The costs to any one country would be small if they were shared among nations; the benefits to each of us from a break through to new energy sources anywhere in the world would be great. We have tried international cooperation in food research and it has paid handsome dividends in high-yielding varieties of com, wheat, rice and sorghum. We could expect similar benefits from worldwide energy cooperation.\n', 'The exact institutional formula for coping with energy effectively on a world level will require the most careful consideration. The IAEA is neither equipped nor staffed to be an adviser on energy across the board; nor would it be desirable to add additional functions that might interfere with its vitally important work on nuclear safeguards and safety.\n', 'One possibility to be considered at a World Energy Conference would be the creation of a new World Energy Agency to work side by side with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. A strengthened International Atomic Energy Agency could focus on assistance and safeguards for nuclear energy; the new agency on research and development of nonnuclear, particularly renewable, sources.\n', '2. We need new international action to limit the spread of nuclear weapons.\n', 'In the past, public attention has been focused on the problem of controlling the escalation of the strategic nuclear arms race among the superpowers. Far less attention has been given to that of controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities among an increasing number of nations.\n', 'And yet the danger to world peace may be as great, if not greater, if this second effort of control should fail. The more countries that possess nuclear weapons, the greater the risk that nuclear warfare might erupt in local conflicts, and the greater the danger that these could trigger a major nuclear war.\n', 'To date, the principal instrument of control has been the Non-Proliferation Treaty which entered into force in 1970. By 1976 ninety-five non-weapons states had ratified the Treaty, including the advanced industrial states of Western Europe, and prospectively of Japan. In so doing, these nations agreed not to develop nuclear weapons or explosives. In addition they agreed to accept international safeguards on all their peaceful nuclear activities, developed by themselves or with outside assistance, under agreements negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency—a little appreciated, but an unprecedented step forward, in the development of international law.\n', 'Important as this achievement is, it cannot be a source of complacency, particularly under present circumstances. There are still a dozen or more important countries with active nuclear power programs which have not joined the Treaty. Hopefully, some of these may decide to become members; but in the case of several of them, this is unlikely until the underlying tensions behind their decision to maintain a nuclear weapons option are resolved.\n', 'The NPT was not conceived of as a one-way street. Under the Treaty, in return for the commitments of the non-weapons states, a major undertaking of the nuclear weapons states (and other nuclear suppliers in a position to do so) was to provide special nuclear power benefits to treaty members, particularly to developing countries.\n', 'The advanced countries have not done nearly enough in providing such peaceful benefits to convince the member states that they are better off inside the Treaty than outside.\n', 'In fact, recent commercial transactions by some of the supplier countries have conferred special benefits on non-treaty members, thereby largely removing any incentive for such recipients to join the Treaty. They consider themselves better off outside. Furthermore, while individual, facilities in these non-treaty countries may be subject to international safeguards, others may not be, and India has demonstrated that such facilities may provide the capability to produce nuclear weapons.\n', 'As a further part of the two-way street, there is an obligation by the nuclear weapons states, under the Treaty, to pursue negotiations in good faith to reach agreement to control and reduce the nuclear arms race.\n', 'We Americans must be honest about the problems of proliferation of nuclear weapons. Our nuclear deterrent remains an essential element of world order in this area. Nevertheless, by enjoining sovereign nations to forego nuclear weapons, we are asking for a form of self-denial that we have not been able to accept ourselves.\n', 'I believe we have little right to ask others to deny themselves such weapons for the indefinite future unless we demonstrate meaningful progress toward the goal of control, then reduction, and ultimately, elimination of nuclear arsenals.\n', 'Unfortunately, the agreements reached to date have succeeded largely in changing the buildup in strategic arms from a ""quantitative"" to a ""qualitative"" arms race. It is time, in the SALT talks, that we complete the stage of agreeing on ceilings and get down to the centerpiece of SALT—the actual negotiation of reductions in strategic forces and measures effectively halting the race in strategic weapons technology. The world is waiting, but not necessarily for long. The longer effective arms reduction is postponed, the more likely it is that other nations will be encouraged to develop their own nuclear capability.\n', 'There is one step that can be taken at once. The United States and the Soviet Union should conclude an agreement prohibiting all nuclear explosions for a period of five years, whether they be weapons tests or so-called ""peaceful"" nuclear explosions, and encourage all other countries to join. At the end of the five year period the agreement can be continued if it serves the interests of the parties.\n', 'I am aware of the Soviet objections to a comprehensive treaty that does not allow peaceful nuclear explosions. I also remember, during the Kennedy Administration, when the roles were reversed. Then the United States had a similar proposal that permitted large-scale peaceful explosions. However, in order to reach an accord, we withdrew our proposal. Similarly, today, if the United States really pushed a comprehensive test ban treaty, I believe the United States and the world community could persuade the USSR to dispose of this issue and accept a comprehensive test ban.\n', 'The non-proliferation significance of the superpowers\' decision to ban peaceful nuclear explosions would be very great because of its effect on countries who have resisted the Non-Proliferation Treaty\'s prohibition of ""peaceful"" nuclear explosives, even though they are indistinguishable from bombs.\n', 'A comprehensive test ban would also signal to the world the determination of the signatory states to call a halt to the further development of nuclear weaponry. It has been more than a decade since the Limited Test Ban Treaty entered into force, and well over 100 nations are now parties to that agreement.\n', 'It now appears that the United States and the Soviet Union are close to an agreement that would prohibit underground nuclear tests above 150 kilotons. This so-called threshold test ban treaty represents a wholly inadequate step beyond the limited test ban. We can and should do more. Our national verification capabilities in the last twenty years have advanced to the point where we no longer have to rely on on-site inspection to distinguish between earthquakes and even very small weapons tests.\n', 'Finally, such a treaty would not only be a demonstration on the part of the superpowers to agree to limit their own weapons development. As President Kennedy foresaw in 1963, the most important objective of a comprehensive treaty of universal application would be its inhibiting effect on the spread of nuclear weapons by prohibiting tests by every signatory state.\n', '3,\n', 'We need new international action to make the spread of peaceful nuclear power less dangerous.\n', 'The danger is not so much in the spread of nuclear reactors themselves, for nuclear reactor fuel is not suitable for use directly in the production of nuclear weapons. The far greater danger lies in the spread of facilities few the enrichment of uranium and the reprocessing of spent reactor fuel—because highly enriched uranium can be used to produce weapons; and because plutonium, when separated from the remainder of the spent fuel, can also be used to produce nuclear weapons. Even at the present early stage in the development of the nuclear power industry, enough materials are produced for at least a thousand bombs each year.\n', 'Under present international arrangements, peaceful nuclear facilities are sought to be safeguarded against diversion and theft of nuclear materials by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. As far as reactors are concerned, the international safeguards—which include materials accountancy, surveillance and inspection—provide some assurance that the diversion of a significant amount of fissionable material would be detected, and therefore help to deter diversion.\n', 'Of course, as the civilian nuclear power industry expands around the globe, there will be a corresponding need to expand and improve the personnel and facilities of the international safeguards system. The United States should fulfill its decade-old promise to put its peaceful nuclear facilities under international safeguards to demonstrate that we too are prepared to accept the same arrangements as the non-weapon states.\n', 'That would place substantial additional demands on the safeguards system of the IAEA, and the United States should bear its fair share of the costs of this expansion. It is a price we cannot afford not to pay.\n', 'But in the field of enrichment and reprocessing, where the primary danger lies, the present international safeguards system cannot provide adequate assurance against the possibility that national enrichment and reprocessing facilities will be misused for military purposes.\n', 'The fact is that a reprocessing plant separating the plutonium from spent fuel literally provides a country with direct access to nuclear explosive material.\n', 'It has therefore been the consistent policy of the United States over the course of several administrations, not to authorize the sale of either enrichment or reprocessing plants, even with safeguards. Recently, however, some of the other principal suppliers of nuclear equipment have begun to make such sales.\n', 'In my judgment, it is absolutely essential to halt the sale of such plants.\n', 'Considerations of commercial profit cannot be allowed to prevail over the paramount objective of limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. The heads of government of all the principal supplier nations hopefully will recognize this danger and share this view.\n', 'I am not seeking to place any restrictions on the sale of nuclear power reactors which sell for as much as $1 billion per reactor. I believe that all supplier countries are entitled to a fair share of the reactor market What we must prevent, however, is the sale of small pilot reprocessing plants which sell for only a few million dollars, have no commercial use at present, and can only spread nuclear explosives around the world.\n', 'The International Atomic Energy Agency itself, pursuant to the recommendations of the Non-Proliferation Treaty review conference of 1975, is currently engaged in an intensive feasibility study of multinational fuel centers as one way of promoting the safe development of nuclear power by the nations of the world, with enhanced control resulting from multinational participation.\n', ""The Agency is also considering other ways to strengthen the protection of explosive material involved in the nuclear fuel cycle. This includes use of the Agency's hitherto unused authority under its charter to establish highly secure repositories for the separated plutonium from non-military facilities, following reprocessing and pending its fabrication into mixed oxide fuel elements as supplementary fuel.\n"", 'Until such studies are completed, I call on all nations of the world to adopt a voluntary moratorium on the national purchase or sale of enrichment or reprocessing plants. I would hope this moratorium would apply to recently completed agreements.\n', 'I do not underestimate the political obstacles in negotiating such a moratorium, but they might be overcome if we do what should have been done many months ago—bring this matter to the attention of the highest political authorities of the supplying countries.\n', 'Acceptance of a moratorium would deprive no nation of the ability to meet its nuclear power needs through the purchase of current reactors with guarantees of a long-range supply of enriched uranium. Such assurances must be provided now by those supplier countries possessing the highly expensive facilities currently required for this purpose.\n', 'To assure the developing countries of an assured supply of enriched uranium to meet their nuclear power needs without the need for reprocessing, the United States should, in cooperation with other countries, assure an adequate supply of enriched uranium.\n', ""We should also give the most serious consideration to the establishment of centralized multinational enrichment facilities involving developing countries' investment participation, in order to provide the assured supply of enriched uranium. And, if one day their nuclear programs economically justify use of plutonium as a supplementary fuel, similar centralized multinational reprocessing services could equally provide for an assured supply of mixed oxide fuel elements.\n"", 'It makes no economic sense to locate national reprocessing facilities in a number of different countries. In view of economies of scale, a single commercial reprocessing facility and a fuel fabrication plant will provide services for about fifty large power reactors. From an economic point of view, multinational facilities serving many countries are obviously desirable. And the collocation of reprocessing, fuel fabrication and fuel storage facilities would reduce the risk of weapons proliferation, theft of plutonium during transport, and environmental contamination.\n', 'There is considerable doubt within the United States about the necessity of reprocessing now for plutonium recycle. Furthermore, the licensing of plutonium for such use is currently withheld pending a full scale review by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of the economic, environmental, and safeguards issues. And there is a further question to be asked: If the United States does not want the developing countries to have commercial plutonium why should we be permitted to have it under our sovereign control?\n', 'Surely this whole matter of plutonium recycle should be examined on an international basis. Since our nation has more experience than others in fuel reprocessing, we should initiate a new multinational program designed to develop experimentally the technology, economics, regulations and safeguards to be associated with plutonium recovery and recycle. The program could be developed by the U.S. in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n', 'If the need for plutonium reprocessing is eventually demonstrated—and if mutually satisfactory ground rules for management and operation can be worked out, the first U.S. reprocessing plant which is now nearing completion in Barnwell, South Carolina, could become the first multinational reprocessing facility under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Separated plutonium might ultimately be made available to all nations on a reliable, cheap, and non-discriminatory basis after blending with natural uranium to form a low-enriched fuel that is unsuitable for weapons making.\n', 'Since the immediate need for plutonium recycle has not yet been demonstrated, the start-up of the plant should certainly be delayed to allow time for the installation of the next generation of materials accounting and physical security equipment which is now under development.\n', 'One final observation in this area: We need to cut through the indecision and debate about the long-term storage of radioactive wastes and start doing something about it. The United States could begin by preparing all high-level radioactive wastes currently produced from our military programs for permanent disposal. Waste disposal is a matter on which sound international arrangements will clearly be necessary.\n', 'The nuclear situation is serious, but it is not yet desperate. Most nations of the world do not want nuclear weapons. They particularly do not want their neighbors to have nuclear weapons, but they understand that they cannot keep the option open for themselves without automatically encouraging their neighbors to ""keep options open"" or worse.\n', 'It is this widespread understanding that it is not in the interest of individual nations to ""go nuclear"" which we must use as the basis of our worldwide efforts to control the atom. We must have negative measures—mutual restraint on the part of the producers and suppliers of nuclear fuel and technology. But these negative measures must be joined to the larger, positive efforts of the non-nuclear weapon states to hold the line against further proliferation.\n', 'The recent initiative of the Finnish Government along these lines deserves commendation. The Finns have urged a compact among the purchasers of nuclear fuel and technology to buy only from suppliers who require proper safeguards on their exports.\n', 'This proposal would convert the alleged advantages to a supplier of breaking ranks and offering ""bargains"" in safeguards into a commercial disadvantage. Instead of broadening his market by lowering his standards, the supplier would narrow it. There would be fewer purchasers for his dangerous merchandise than if he maintained a common front on safeguards with other suppliers. There would be competition to offer to buyers the safest product at the best price.\n', 'Most important, the Finnish proposal would plainly put the full weight of the non-nuclear world into the effort against proliferation. It would make it evident that this struggle is not a struggle by the nuclear ""haves"" to keep down the nuclear ""have-nots""; it would be a common effort by all mankind to control this dangerous technology, to gain time so that our political structures can catch up with sudden, enormous leaps in our technical knowledge, to turn us around and head us in the right direction—toward a world from which nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear war have been effectively eliminated. That may be a distant goal—but it is the direction in which we must move.\n', 'I have talked to you today about the need for new international action in three areas—action to meet the energy needs of all countries while limiting reliance on nuclear energy, action to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, and action to make the spread of peaceful nuclear power less dangerous.\n', 'Of one thing I am certain—the hour is too late for business as usual, for politics as usual, or for diplomacy as usual. An alliance for survival is needed—transcending regions and ideologies—if we are to assure mankind a safe passage to the twenty-first century.\n', 'Every country—and the United States is no exception—is concerned with maintaining its own national security. But a mutual balance of terror is an inadequate foundation upon which to build a peaceful and stable world order. One of the greatest long-term threats to the national security of every country now lies in the disintegration of the international order. Balance of power politics must be supplemented by world order politics if the foreign policies of nations are to be relevant to modem needs.\n', 'The political leaders of all nations, whether they work within four year election cycles or five year plans, are under enormous temptations to promise short-term benefits to their people while passing on the costs to other countries, to future generations, or to our environment. The earth, the atmosphere, the oceans and unborn generations have no political franchise. But shortsighted policies today will lead to insuperable problems tomorrow.\n', 'The time has come for political leaders around the world to take a larger view of their obligations, showing a decent respect for posterity, for the needs of other peoples and for the global biosphere.\n', 'I believe the American people want this larger kind of leadership.\n', 'In the last two years, I have visited virtually every one of our fifty states. I have found our people deeply troubled by recent developments at the United Nations. But they do not want to abandon the UN—they want us to work harder to make it what it was created to be—not a cockpit for controversy but an instrument for reconciling differences and resolving common problems.\n', 'And they want UN agencies to demonstrate the same commitment to excellence, impartiality and efficiency they are demanding of their own government.\n', ""We want to cooperate—not simply debate. A joint program—whether on nuclear energy or other global problems—is infinitely preferable to sustained and destructive polemics. Our desire for global cooperation is prompted by America's confidence in itself, in our capacity to engage in effective cooperation, and upon the moral imperative that as human beings we must help one another if any of us is to survive on this planet.\n"", 'The nuclear age, which brings both sword and plowshare from the same source, demands unusual self-discipline of all nations. If we approach these problems with both humility and self-discipline, we may yet reconcile our twin goals of energy sufficiency and world order.']"
20,Jimmy Carter ,"May 24, 1976","[""Q. Governor Carter, what do you regard as the nation's top priority in the field of economics?\n"", 'Governor Carter. The No. 1 domestic commitment of the next administration will be to create jobs and reduce unemployment. I would set a goal of bringing unemployment down to 3 percent among adults, 4 or 4J4 percent for the whole labor force.\n', 'Q. How would you go about doing that?\n', ""Governor Carter. We have to pursue an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy in the near future—with some budget deficits if necessary. That doesn't mean spending simply for the sake of spending. It means government ought to take specific steps to cope with the problem, working largely through private industry.\n"", 'Q. What sort of steps?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think that government ought to stimulate industry to hire the unemployed through increased federal funding of on-the-job training programs by business. We ought to furnish incentives specifically geared to hiring young people, those who've been out of work for a long time, and to women entering the job market.\n"", 'Q. Do you think the government ought to guarantee a job for every American who wants to work?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think the government ought to set up public programs to train people for work in private jobs. And it has an obligation to provide money to create meaningful public jobs in the cities and neighborhoods.\n', 'Q. Will all this government spending reignite inflation?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I don't think so. For one thing, our economy is performing far under capacity. Also, a lot of the inflationary pressures in recent years have been transient—caused not so much by excessive demand as by dollar devaluations, the big jump in oil and food prices.\n"", 'In any case, there are far more human and economically sound solutions to curbing inflation than enforced recession, unemployment, tight money, and high interest rates.\n', 'Q. How would you deal with inflation, then?\n', ""Governor Carter. We need measures to increase the productive capabilities of our economy. We've been virtually ignoring the supply side of our economy. Increase productivity, and we grow without inflation.\n"", ""I'd like to see a reform of government regulations that tend to drive up costs—for example, the rule prohibiting a truck from carrying goods on its return haul. We ought to have stricter enforcement of antitrust laws and of consumer protection laws. And we need a monetary policy that encourages lower interest rates, so investment capital will be available at reasonable costs.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor wage/price controls?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm against across-the-board permanent controls, but I do favor standby controls which the President can apply selectively. Right now, though, I don't see the need for use of standby controls.\n"", 'Q. You mentioned accepting deficit budgets if necessary. Is the idea of a balanced budget out of date now?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I favor balanced budgets over the business cycle. If the economy is managed progressively, we can attain a balanced budget with full employment by 1979—before the end of the first term of my administration. Putting people to work, don't forget, would enlarge the amount of taxes the government collects and reduce what it spends to fight unemployment.\n"", 'Q. Can you achieve a balanced budget without cutting spending on social programs?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; when we give our people a better quality of life, when public or private money is spent on things like health care, day-care centers, care for the elderly, education—well, you create jobs and get millions of dollars of new income. So you realize higher revenues for the government, too.\n', ""Q. You spoke of the need for lower interest rates. Yet the President doesn't control the Federal Reserve Board—\n"", ""Governor Carter. We need closer cooperation between the Federal Reserve and the Executive Branch. I think the Board should maintain its independence from the Executive Branch, but I do feel it is important that throughout a President's term that he have a Chairman whose economic views are compatible with his own. So I would propose that the President be given the power— subject to Senate confirmation—to appoint his own Chairman, who would serve a term coterminous with the President's.\n"", 'Q. There seems to be a campaign in Congress for broad national planning by the government. What are your views?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm a firm advocate of the private enterprise system. I'm against the type of rigid, bureaucratic, centralized planning you get in Communist countries. But I do think we need better general economic planning by the government to get rid of the roller-coaster dips and curves we have faced in the last 8 years\n"", ""There's got to be some increased interrelationship among government, business, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, science and education in our society. There's just no predictability now about government policy—no way to tell what we're going to do next in the area of housing, transportation, environmental quality or energy. So I favor coordinated government planning to attack problems in these and other fields. '\n"", 'Q. With a big new bureaucracy?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I think we can do it by extending existing agencies and techniques. The role of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, for example, could be expanded to include this type of planning and to deal with long-range problems to fit individual sectors into an overall plan for the economy.\n"", 'Q. Turning to defense issues, what is your main concern?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe that our basic strategic interests have been reassessed since 1950. That needs to be done in a long-range fashion. We need to have a simplification of the purposes of the military. I think that a singular purpose of the military ought to be the capability to fight, and with that capability will come the best hope of permanent peace.\n"", ""Now the military duplicates. There's an unbelievable bureaucratic hierarchy that's been established since the Second World War. We've got an overloaded number of high officials—admirals, generals, and their immediate subordinates. We've got too many support troops for combat troops.\n"", 'Some management improvements, I think, would restore to a great degree the confidence of our people in the military. It would also let the President and the Congress play a much more legitimate and continuing role in the planning and evolution of new weapons systems, which quite often have been wasteful.\n', 'Q. Do you think the defense budget can be reduced?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I think these management improvement efforts would result in roughly a $5 to $7 billion dollar decrease in the defense budget. I might add, however, that the No. 1 responsibility of any President is to guarantee the security of our country. I would never permit our nation to be subjected to successful attack, threat of attack or blackmail. And I would keep our defense capabilities adequate to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.\n', 'Q. What changes would you make in our policy of détente?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would continue the effort to be friendly with Russia, trade with Russia, have student exchange, tourist exchange, and consultations. I recognize that we will never have permanent peace, or an end to the threat to South Korea, a solution to the Middle East question, a substantial reduction in atomic weapons—none of these things—without the cooperation of the Soviet Union.\n', ""I think, though, that we've come out second best in every negotiation with the Soviet Union. We've been so eager for some sign of agreement that we've yielded. That includes the Helsinki Conference, the Vladivostok Conference—agreement on nuclear-arms limitations—the wheat deal in 1972, even the space flight last year.\n"", 'I would be a much tougher negotiator and make sure that, whenever the Soviet Union gets an advantage, we get an equivalent advantage from them. I also would not neglect our natural allies and friends, as we have in recent years. I would strengthen those ties, consult with them frequently, let our own positions be predictable.\n', 'Q. How would you work for peace in the Middle East?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe anybody has the instant solution to the Middle Eastern crisis. I would make it clear that our nation's commitment is to the preservation of Israel; its right to exist in peace. This ought to be unequivocal.\n"", 'Also, we ought to constantly probe for ways to find mutual agreements to implement United Nations Resolution 242, including bilateral discussions between Israel and its neighbors. [U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 called for a cease-fire, troop withdrawals and peace negotiations.]\n', 'Q. Would you recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization—the PLO?\n', ""Governor Carter. The legitimate interests of the Palestinians have to be recognized. But I would not personally favor recognition of the PLO or other government entities representing the Palestinians until after they have convinced me that they recognize Israel's right to exist in peace.\n"", ""Q. Closer to home, how can the federal bureaucracy be made more responsive to the people's needs?\n"", ""Governor Carter. If I'm elected, one of my major commitments will be to completely reorganize the Executive Branch of government—to make it efficient, economical, purposeful and manageable for a change. I know how to do it, I believe. I've done it successfully as Governor of Georgia, and I believe the Congress is also ready to see this done.\n"", ""Second, we need to have a budgeting technique that really reassesses priorities annually. I used one in Georgia throughout the time I was in office as governor. This is zero-based budgeting. You strip the government down every year to zero and start from scratch. Every program that spends the taxpayers' money has to rejustify itself annually. You have an automatic weeding out of obsolete programs, an automatic detection of overlapping and duplication within government agencies. There is an automatic reassessment in priorities, so you spend your money next year on things that are needed next year—not 45 or 50 years ago.\n"", 'And the third thing would be to have a minimum of secrecy and a maximum dependence on long-range planning. We need to spell out what we hope to achieve as a government at the end of a year, 2 years, 5 years, even 20 or 25 years, with approximate cost figures estimated for the near term.\n', 'Q. Do you favor busing to achieve school integration?\n', 'Governor Carter. Mandatory busing, no. Voluntary transfers, yes. I do see a need, however, which I would honor, for the President to support the federal courts. And if the courts should rule differently from my own personal beliefs, of course I would support the federal courts. I do not favor a constitutional amendment to prohibit busing.\n', 'Ultimately, I think the best solution is voluntary transfers for students who want it, and adequate representation of minority leaders in the administration of a school system.\n', 'Q. Does the welfare system need overhauling?\n', ""Governor Carter. Absolutely. It's not one of the greatest needs that I know of. This is one advantage in having served as governor. I've seen the almost unmanageable characteristic of the welfare system. We now have roughly 12 million people who chronically draw welfare. We've got 2 million welfare workers—that is, a worker for every six recipients. They don't spend their time alleviating suffering or unemployment or old age or blindness. They spend their time shuffling papers, bogged down in red tape, trying to administer about a hundred different federal programs.\n"", 'Q. What would you do about it?\n', ""Governor Carter. First of all, I understand we've got about 1.3 million people drawing welfare who are able to work full-time. They don't have anything wrong with them physically or mentally. They don't have dependent children. They ought to be taken out of the welfare system—trained for a job and offered a job. If they don't take a job, I would not pay them any more benefits.\n"", ""The other 90 percent can't work full-time. There ought to be one fairly uniform, nationwide payment to meet the basic necessities of life, varying in amount to accommodate cost-of-living changes from one community to another. There ought to be a work-incentive aspect built in, so that welfare recipients who can work part-time are encouraged to do so without having all their welfare payments confiscated.\n"", ""We should remove laws that now force or encourage a father to leave the home. In fact, everything the government does ought to be designed to draw families together. And instead of having a hundred different programs, we ought to have one or two basic programs. Those changes need to be made, and I'm going to pursue those changes very aggressively as President.\n"", 'Q. Do you have any plan for reducing crime?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. We need judicial reform, a much better administered court system, merit selection of judges and prosecutors, briefer trial periods, recodification of the criminal codes.\n', ""Next, we need to allot crime prevention funds in areas that can actually prevent crime, and not just to build jailhouses, or to buy helicopters, and so forth. We need to concentrate police officers in high crime areas. We need to have full backing for police officers from all public officials. We need to have better street lighting. We need to have surer—and perhaps briefer— sentences for those who commit crimes, so that there's a fairly good certainty that if someone is convicted, they'll be punished.\n"", ""We also need to understand the major causes of increases in the crime rate. I think that the major contributing factor has been high unemployment. That's not an excuse for crime, but it's a cause of crime. We've got about a 40 to 45 percent unemployment rate among our minority young people, and if they could be gainfully employed, their tendency toward crime would be reduced.\n"", 'Q. Do you believe that the federal government should finance a national health insurance program?\n', 'Governor Carter. I favor a nationwide, comprehensive, mandatory health insurance program. It ought to be financed partially from federal funds. Also, employees and employers ought to contribute to the cost of the health program. Patients should retain the right to choose their doctor and place of treatment. I want to keep the personal relationship between doctors and patients.\n', ""The plan should be designed to minimize unnecessary medical costs. We now have a wide disparity of length of stay in hospitals, a wide disparity of charges for the same services, a wide difference also in the chance of one's undergoing an operation. It depends on what geographical area in which the hospital might be located.\n"", 'We need to have an emphasis on preventive health care, and an increased use of other medical personnel in addition to physicians, under the supervision of medical doctors.\n', 'Q. What, if any, presidential or congressional action do you favor to resolve the controversy over abortion?\n', 'Governor Carter. The only thing that I can see that can be done effectively—and one that I will pursue—is to have an affirmative program established by law to minimize the need for abortion. This would include family planning, better sex education, access to contraceptives for those who believe in their use, and better adoptive procedures.\n', ""I do not favor using federal moneys for abortions, unless mandated by the federal courts. I think abortion is wrong. I don't think the government ought to do anything to encourage abortions, but I don't think it's advisable to have a constitutional amendment to totally prohibit abortions, nor to give states that option.\n"", 'Q. Do you want the largest oil firms broken up?\n', ""Governor Carter. I haven't taken on the oil companies as scapegoats. When competition inadequate to insure free markets and maximum benefit to American consumers exists, I will support divestiture.\n"", ""At present, I support restrictions on the right of a single company to own all phases of production and distribution of oil. However, it may not always be in the consumer's interest to limit a company to one single phase of production. Such a restriction, for example, might make it illegal for the same company to explore for oil and then extract that oil from the ground once discovered. That would clearly result in tremendous price increases to the consumer.\n"", 'I support legal prohibitions against ownership of competing types of energy—oil and coal, for example. However, I cannot promise to oppose any joint responsibility for any phase of production of competing energy sources. Fuel oil and some propane, for example, are produced from crude oil. Their production clearly cannot be separated until after extraction and refining take place. It may not be beneficial to the consumer to separate control of these two competing energy sources until even further down the distribution line.\n', 'Q. What do you regard right now as the single most important issue this election year?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would say that people are looking for three things:\n', ""Competence—can my government perform the functions for which it's designed? Sensitivity—does my government and the officials in it understand my special needs, my hopes, my dreams, my aspirations? And third, integrity—can I trust my own government?\n"", 'Those three factors are the ones that will determine the outcome of the election this year.']"

What this is, is this, for those of you who are not familiar with it. The possession of small quantities of marijuana is still a crime. It is punished, however, not by a felony sentence or imprisonment, it is punished by a heavy fine like $200. It doesn't leave a permanent criminal record on the life of a young person or old person who is caught with that small amount. At the same time, you increase, if possible, the penalties for the sale or distribution of marijuana and other drugs, and put the pushers in jail. That is a good approach to it.

They thought it would get delivered on time at least twice a month.\n', 'Somebody else said that the reason they raised the rates on post—on mail, on letters from 10 cents to 13 cents, was that the extra 3 cents went for storage.\n', ""Well, I can't answer your question, I will have to admit that.

And, I would assume the responsibility for the Post Office Department as part of my Presidential duties. It wouldn't be taken on lightly.\n"", 'First of all, I would choose people in whom I had complete confidence to assess how much of the mail could be delivered by electronic means. I would keep control of the delivery of first-class mail in the post office to have some financing. I would not hesitate to subsidize the delivery of mail from general funds to make sure that our people do have that service. I would very carefully analyze the postal service of other nations to see what we could learn from them, and let the American people know about all of these procedures as they went forward.\n', ""I can't answer your question any better than that, I am sorry.\n"", ""Let me say this in closing.

A general settlement is needed—one which will end the conflict between Israel and its neighbors once and for all.\n', 'Now the guide to a general settlement is to be found in United Nations Resolution 242 which has been accepted by Israel and all her neighboring governments.

Without this basic change, no permanent peace is possible.\n', 'The other principle of the United Nations Resolution 242 calls for, and again I quote, ""withdrawal of Israel\'s armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict."" This language leaves open the door for changes in the pre-1967 lines by mutual agreement\n', 'Final borders between Israel and her neighbors should be determined in direct negotiations between the parties, and they should not be imposed from outside.\n', 'Now this general settlement we all want to see will take time to negotiate and even more time to implement. Its execution would probably come in stages. This would permit both sides to test the durability of the settlement, and it would give either side the opportunity to halt the process if it found that its own interests were being violated.\n', 'We are dealing with a deep and bitter legacy of hatred and distrust which can only be dissipated over time. This makes it all the more important now to lift the sights of all concerned by focusing on the long-term goal.\n', 'While we work toward peace, we must acknowledge the lessons of the past wars. Progress toward peace requires that Israel remain strong enough that it can neither be overrun militarily nor isolated in the international community.\n', 'Israel has never sought American soldiers and in all of the many discussions I have had with top Israeli leaders in the present and past governments, in the Knesset, in the military, I have never heard an Israeli leader say they might some day need American troops. They seek only the tools to assure their own defense.\n', 'We should continue to supply, in the full amount necessary, economic and military aid so that Israel can pursue peace from a position of strength and power.\n', ""We should continue to aid Israel's economy which has been strained to the utmost by the burdens of defense. Mrs. Meir told me that over 40 percent of Israel's total budget went for defense.\n"", 'We must also continue to maintain our strong military presence in the Eastern Mediterranean under every circumstance, with a capacity to reinforce that presence powerfully, if need be, in order to deter outside interference in any local conflict.\n', ""Now none of this need prevent our maintaining good relations with the Arab States. Avoiding conflict and achieving a settlement is in their interest as well as in Israel's.\n"", ""In assisting both sides' efforts to achieve such a settlement we not only fulfill our commitments to Israel, we strengthen the strong lines of friendship that have developed between us and the Arab countries over many years. The process of peace will be best served if these relations deepen—not at the expense of Israel—but in the interest of all countries involved. I do not believe it serves the cause of peace if we arm any country beyond its legitimate needs for defense. Local arms races, besides being very costly, increase the chances of war.\n"", ""I said 2 months ago that I do not favor supplying offensive weapons to Egypt and I still hold to that view. We should help Egypt obtain housing and jobs and health care for its people, not such offensive weapons as tanks and attack planes and missiles. Investing in Egypt's economic development is an investment in peace.\n"", 'We have already developed close ties of investment and economic aid with many Arab countries. This shows that economic interdependence can also be a foundation of peace, that Arab people are no less tired of war than Israel, no less weary of its burden and waste, and no less mournful of their dead. Some Arab States have set goals for economic development and education which are worthy of great respect as well as our aid and participation. But their dreams, like the dreams of Israel, will come true only if there is a lasting peace in the Middle East\n', 'Unless there is peace the Arab countries will inevitably become radicalized, more militant, and more susceptible to Soviet reentry, both politically and militarily. If that happens, Israel will be confronted with an even greater threat than she faces today.\n', 'Peace in the Middle East involves difficult, highly emotional issues. In face-to-face negotiations, if all parties will act with fairness and goodwill, the questions of boundary lines and the status of the Palestinians can be resolved.\n', 'There is a humanitarian core within the complexities of the Palestinian problem. Too many human beings, denied a sense of hope for the future, are living in makeshift and crowded camps where demagogues and terrorists can feed on their despair. They have rights which must be recognized in any settlement and the Government of Israel has made it clear that it is sensitive to that fact.\n', ""But those terrorists who wage war and deny the very concept of Israeli nationhood only undermine their own people's best interests. We must make it clear to the world that there can be no reward for terrorism.\n"", ""I am going to speak to you of the Soviet Union. We want no clash with the Soviets, but we cannot accept the intervention of its combat forces into any Arab-Israeli conflict. Our naval and air presence in the eastern Mediterranean should make this clear. Mutual nonintervention by the superpowers serves these powers' interests and also the interest of all states in the area.\n"", 'By the same token, I do not believe that the road to peace can be found by United States-Soviet imposition of a settlement. It would, however, be desirable to attain Soviet agreement and support for any settlement, since we do not want to give the Soviet Union any reason or excuse to subvert or undermine that settlement We seek the support of the Soviet Government in the search for peace, but we will continue that search with or without her support.\n', 'We all want to see a Middle East dedicated to human progress rather than sterile hate. We want to see the desert bloom on both sides of the River Jordan, and along the Nile River, and everywhere that human beings hope for better life for themselves and for their children.\n', 'We must work towards these goals through international organizations, as well as bilateral negotiations.\n', ""This is a difficult time for Israel in the international arena, primarily because of the importance of oil to the world's developing nations. I deplore the actions taken recently in the United States. I reject utterly the charge that Zionism is a form of racism. Indeed, as you know, Zionism has been, in part, a response to racism against the Jewish people. The concept of the State of Israel was bom out of centuries of persecution of human beings because they practiced a different religion.\n"", 'For these 2,000 years, the Jewish people in century after century, in country after country, have faced propaganda, attempts at forced conversion, discrimination, pogroms, and death, until the ultimate horror of the holocaust. Surely, the Jewish people are entitled to one place on this earth where they can have their own state on soil given them by God from time immemorial.\n', 'For years the vision of Israel has embodied the dream that there could be at least one place on earth where racism could never exist. Now that dream has come true. As a country founded upon religious freedom and dedicated to brotherhood, America has a special responsibility, not only to oppose this baseless charge wherever it appears, but to keep that dream alive.\n', 'Finally, I want to say that there have been far too many secret undertakings, covert assurances, contradictory promises, and diplomatic sleights of hand. Maneuvers of this kind are bound to produce, as they have produced, both failure in negotiations and suspicion among the participants.\n', 'American policy toward the Middle East and toward every other part of the world should be shaped with the knowledge of the Congress from the outset on a bipartisan basis. It would emerge from broad and well-informed public debate. Indeed, this is a necessity. In every foreign venture that has failed, whether it was Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Angola or in the excesses of the CIA, our government operated secretly, and forged ahead without consulting the American people. It did things that were contrary to our basic character.\n', 'Public understanding and support today are as vital to successful foreign policies as they are to any domestic policies. No one can make our foreign policy for us as well as we can make it for ourselves. It should be based not just on military might or economic power or political pressure, but also on truth, justice, equality and a true representation of our moral character and the compassion of our people. A policy of that kind will reflect the best in all of us. And that kind of policy can succeed.\n', 'Peace in the Middle East is not an impossible dream. It can be a concrete objective, and it is one to which the next President should direct his efforts from the date he takes office as a matter of the highest priority and the greatest urgency.\n', ""If I become your President, I will do everything in my power to make our nation an agent of peace in the Middle East; a just and lasting peace that will be in keeping with the teaching of Scripture, in keeping with our nation's best traditions and in fulfillment of the highest hopes of all mankind.""]"
24,Jimmy Carter ,"June 19, 1976","[""John Ryor. Jimmy Carter has had a varied career. He's been a farmer, an engineer, a scientist, a planner, a businessman, and more recently, the Governor of his home State, Georgia. Mr. Carter graduated from the US. Naval Academy in 1946. He did graduate work in nuclear physics and worked under Admiral Hyman Rickover on the development of the world's first nuclear submarine. Mr. Carter was elected to the Georgia Senate in 1962. He was elected Governor of Georgia in 1970 and served as the State's Chief Executive for 4 years. In 1974 the Democratic National Committee tapped Governor Carter to serve as the party's national campaign chairman for the 1974 national elections. We're very pleased to have you here for this interview, Governor, and if you're elected, I should say, if you're nominated by your party, why should the teachers of America support you for the Presidency?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, you've left out a couple of very important aspects of my career there. My first entry in the government life was as a member of a county school board, and I was chairman of it during the years through integrating our schools and learned a great deal during that 7 year period about the practical applications of education. When I was elected to the Georgia Senate, I ran because I was concerned about the potential destruction of the public school system during the integration years in the South, and my only request, as a new senator, was that I be put on the Education Committee. I was the author of the minimum foundation program for education bill that was passed in Georgia in the middle sixties, and then when I became governor, we initiated and passed a comprehensive program for education in Georgia which was one of the prides of my whole administration. I've got three daughters-in-law, all of whom work in education, one in teacher certification in the Education Department, and the other two are first grade or pre-first grade school teachers. I think that my background and my record has been one of intense involvement in education. Even earlier than that, when I taught USAFE courses on the first battleship and that was my responsibility as a young naval officer. This approach to education that we've had to accommodate, particularly in the South first, with different kinds of children in the same classrooms, I think is a preview of what needs to be done on a nationwide basis, that is, to individualize instruction to treat each child as an individual with separate problems, unique talents, and I think we've been able to do this very well. We still have a very bad circumstance in our country with an inadequate attention given to education. I see a stronger and stronger role to be played by the federal government in the financing of education, and I would also insist on the local and state governments being responsible for their management of the school system. We need to increase the emphasis on career education on a lower and lower level in school and to breakup the sharp division between vocational instruction and academic instruction. These are some of the things that I've had to experience, I might say in an enjoyable way as a state legislator and also as a governor, and I'd be glad to answer specific questions about those items which I'm sure you have in store for me now."", 'Q. Thai leads us into the next question, Governor. As you know, there are great disparities in the per child expenditure of funds, state to state, locality to locality, which make it difficult to grant equal educational opportunity for all children. What measures would your administration take if you were elected President to insure equal educational opportunity?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I've been completely dedicated to this principle ever since the early sixties. I think one of the crucial elements of the minimum foundation program for education in Georgia was that property was taxed where it existed and then that money was put into the general fund receipts from sales tax, income tax, corporate tax, and so forth and then the money that was available was distributed where every child was located. This was done adequately to finance the basic minimum educational requirements. When I became governor, we saw that this was not adequate so we revised the law to increase the allocation of funds more to equalize instruction. I think this is a major place where the federal government ought to play a role in the future as it has, to some degree, in the past To identify those areas of our nation which are very poor, even as large as state boundaries, and certainly communities and cities and counties, and also individual kinds of children who come from families where opportunities have been scarce and to let the federal allocation of money as it increases, I hope very rapidly in the next few years, be designed to compensate as much as possible for that inequity in tax money per child which is so crucial to provide equality at opportunity. I'm heavily committed to that, and I think my record as governor and as a state legislator would testify to that fact."", 'Q. You indicated in your written response as well as in your conversation here today that the federal share simply was inadequate.', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', 'Q. What do you see as an appropriate level of expenditure for the federal government in paying for public education in the United States?', ""Governor Carter. It would be hard for me to put a particular or special figure on it at this point without studying the whole budgetary process and assessing relative priorities. I know what the NEA goal is which I think would cost an additional $18 to $20 billion above and beyond the present allocation of funds. I think that's a good goal, but I can't say just in what number of years it might be achieved. There are some interim things that can be done, however, to let money be made available to education without delay. One would he to remove the prohibition against the use of revenue sharing money for education. This would release to the communities which have that urge a substantial amount of money to be used specifically for the education of our children which can't be done now. And, I think we ought to also elevate the department in the federal government responsible for education to a much higher status which would focus the attention of the nation, our people, and our government, on the need for increased emphasis on education. I can't give you a specific figure or percentage at this point, but I'll be committed along with you to a rapid increase in the proportion of education costs that will be financed by the federal government."", ""Q. Another corollary question, Governor, considering the difficulty of many, many middle-income parents to afford to send their children on to postsecondary education, what role or what responsibility do you think the federal government has in providing financial assistance either to students or to postsecondary institutions in order that they might relieve the load as it ' falls on the middle-income taxpayer?"", ""Governor Carter. I think again this has been an interest of mine for a long time. First, two Mils that I have introduced as a chairman of the University Committee where I served in the senate, as a freshman senator, were bills to establish scholarship and loan programs for students at the post-high school level. This was done in 1964, and John Gardner and others at the federal level in 1965 passed a Higher Education Bill which was correlated very closely with what we already had established in Georgia. I think we ought to reduce the number of different kinds of scholarship and loan programs to a minimum number—I don't know if it would be three or four at the most—to make their allocations clear-cut, to increase the amount of money appropriated for that purpose, and to let the money be permitted to go to students on the basis of financial need as a major factor provided, of course, the students can meet the academic requirements cf the college or the vocational school involved. So, to minimize the number of different kinds of scholarship and loan programs, to correlate them accurately with the state funds that are available and also private funds, to let the money be used for the accommodation of financial need primarily if academic requirements are made, and to increase the amount of money available—those would be the factors that I would consider as President."", 'Q. If we could go back just a minute to aid to education on the federal level. What form do you see aid to education from the federal government taking, Governor—categorical aid, general aid, or what options do you have?', ""Governor Carter. I would like to reduce drastically the number of categorical aid programs. I think when Eisenhower went out of office we had about 150 in the whole federal government; now we have almost 2,000, and a substantial amount of the administrative work that's performed by state departments of education, for instance, is oriented toward the preparation of education grant requests and the monitoring of the separate and independent and narrowly defined grant programs. I would like to make these much more general in nature. The only category that I would like to maintain is to insure that the federal monies are spent for the kinds of children who need help most: those who come from deprived families or who have some special learning disability, those who come from poor areas of our nation where the tax base is not adequate for a good education. But I would drastically reduce the number of categorical grant programs, let the money be issued in larger block sums but make sure that the money is spent from the federal level for the children that need it most."", 'Q. Very good. In recent years, Governor, there has been a great deal of conversation both in the public media and in our cities and states about the right of public employees to negotiate, to bargain with their employers.', 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir.', 'Q. Do you support a federal statute to grant teachers and public employees in general the right to collective bargaining?', ""Governor Carter. Well, let me answer you this way. I think that when there is a law that permits public employees to negotiate, I prefer binding arbitration to the right to strike for teachers, and for firemen and policemen. I think it's better for those employees to have it that way. Once the dispute is submitted to an arbitration board, if the employer will not accept the ruling of the board, then I favor the right of the employees to strike. I would prefer to have that arrangement if it was left to me. I have some concern about the federal government requiring that all employees be organized. I would prefer to let the states handle this question themselves, and I do favor states having legislation of this kind. Whether I would favor the federal government making it a mandatory thing throughout the country is something that I have yet to decide. I've told the leaders of the NEA that I would certainly not veto such legislation as President, that I would work for the right of teachers and others to strike if an arbitration board decision is refused by the employer, but as far as having a mandatory thing nationwide, that's something I still want to reserve judgment on."", 'Q. Well, let me restate the question, Governor, if I might for just a second. The problem, as we see it, is the disparity in the way public employees are treated. We have Pennsylvania, New Jersey, cities right across the river from one another, we have teachers who bargain in both places. When the frustration gets so high that the teachers find it necessary to strike, in New Jersey they go to jail, in Pennsylvania there are other options for resolving the conflict. They do not go to jail.', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', ""Q. Now, it seems to me that the question is not, are we going to mandate, but would you support a process which allowed teachers and public employees of their own volition to negotiate, and would you support legislation that would make it possible to resolve the conflict that causes strikes? That's the central concern I believe."", ""Governor Carter. Well, as I say, I don't have any objection to that, and I would strongly support legislation in a circumstance that you described, for instance in New Jersey, that if the arbitration is completed and the teachers, for instance, still have no redress except to strike, that they be granted that right without the fear of punishment."", ""Q. We talked for just a few minutes, Governor, about HEW and about the size of the bureaucracy. Its often been said that the E is caught between the H and the W and forgotten and that much of that budget is fixed and consequently the part that isn't, education's share, is always hacked away at, but we're very concerned about the role of education in the federal government and the federal government's commitment to it. As part of that, would you restate your position in regard to Department of Education at the Cabinet level?"", ""Governor Carter. All right. Let me say first of all that following the convention, if I'm a nominee, I intend to work very closely with the NEA officials and other educators throughout the country, with local and state leaders, school board members, state superintendents and others, in evolving a 4 year program for educational progress in this country so that we can spell out year by year, throughout the first administration following the election this year, what ought to be done, with approximate costs, the priorities of improvements to be made so that there can be a nationwide commitment to it pursued by me as a nominee and hopefully Democratic candidates for Congress, for Governor, for U.S. Senate as we approach the November elections. I think that this would be a very attractive thing for us candidates to present to the American public. I think the public is ready for a clear expression from the national viewpoint about what we should do for education in this country. It's something that's been relegated to a secondary position in the past. The only new department that I know of that ought to be created is a separate Department of Education. I will pursue this goal in the context of an overall reorganization of government. My goal expressed many times during the campaign was to reduce the 1,900 different agencies and departments down to no more than 200. I believe that's an achievable goal. The one new department that I would favor creating would be a separate Department of Education."", 'Q- One of our other concerns, Governor, is the involvement of teachers in educational policy development at every level, particularly at the national level. What steps would you take to ensure that appointees you made to HEW or NIE or to the Office of Education had the perception of the elementary and secondary classroom teacher?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think I would be making a very serious mistake if I tried to evolve policies for our nation to pursue relating, for instance, to elementary education or preschool education or high school education or vocational education, if I didn't call upon the professionals who had devoted their lives to that pursuit to help me with it. So, I would have a heavy concentration of appointments to those administrative positions from among the teaching ranks."", ""Q. NEA also has a long history of commitment to civil and human rights in this country and in light of that we have very deep concerns about some pf the attempts to reduce the effect of, or in some cases eliminate entirely, parts of Voting Rights Act and Civil Rights Act, and what we'd be concerned with is your views and what your administration would do to maintain the guarantees gained in those struggles."", ""Governor Carter. Those acts would never be weakened while I'm in the White House. If anything, they would both be strengthened and their provisions would be rigidly enforced. I think the best thing that ever happened to the South in my lifetime was the passage of the Civil Rights Acts and the granting to black people of a chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs on an equal basis with whites. It not only liberated our black citizens, it also liberated the white citizens from the constant millstone that had been around our neck for generations of preoccupation with the race issue. And I could not be sitting here as a possible nominee for the Democratic Party, having won a substantial majority of all the primary contests in the country, had it not been for this change and the granting to minority groups of an equal opportunity. We've still got a long way to go in employment and in redressing some of the deprivations that have been a part of the lives of minority groups in this country, and I hope that, if I'm elected President and, when I go out of office, our minority groups and those who are interested in civil rights and human rights will say that my administration measured up to the highest possible standards of commitment to the redressing of those grievances."", ""Q. In the last 10 years, Governor, there has been a great deal of effort on the part of the government, and certainly with the support of our organization, to overcome some of the historic errors and sins brought about by segregated society and segregated schools. As you know, there are many politicians who've used that issue and played on the emotions of people and have generated a good deal of hate and hysteria. What would your administration do, particularly around the question of busing to achieve integration, to relieve that hysteria?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there's only one person in this country who can speak with a clear voice or set a standard of ethics and morality or excellence or greatness or detect and expose and root out injustice or inequality or prejudice or hatred or propose and carry out bold programs, and that person is the President. In the absence of that leadership in the White House, there is no leadership and the country drifts. I remember how drastically our nation changed in 1968 when the Johnson and Kennedy Administrations ended, and the Nixon-Ford Administrations began. The Congress didn't change, it was still heavily Democratic, but our country changed, and the people who lost most were those who were poor, or black, or unemployed, or elderly, or sick, and what they lost was hope because they felt that no one spoke for their views, so the elimination of discrimination and the granting of equality of opportunity would be a deep commitment of my administration."", 'Q. Along the lines of human rights, NEA has worked very hard to eliminate sex discrimination and, as you know, 60 percent of our membership are women. What initiatives would your administration take, specifically, to eradicate inequality in the world of work and leadership in our institutions, particularly government and education?', ""Governor Carter. Right. One of the earliest things that I can do is to express, or continue to express, my complete commitment to the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. I have no fear of this. We've still got four states to go. I know the Democratic Party is committed to it and, if we can ever get an awareness among the working women of our country about the need for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, that would help a great deal. Secondly, the President is the unique individual who can express to the American people a dissatisfaction with the last remaining vestige of legal or mandatory discrimination. Many of our laws encompass inadequate rights for women in the ownership of property and benefits to be derived from Social Security and treatment of the tax laws. Our women get about 60 percent of the pay for doing the same jobs as men do, their promotional opportunities are inadequate. Another thing that's important to us is to have the presently existing equal employment laws enforced. We now have seven different federal agencies responsible ostensibly for enforcement of equal opportunity provisions of the law, but we have a backlog now of about 30,000 cases which means about a 30 month delay and, before a complaint can be resolved that's filed by a woman who has felt the burden of discrimination, quite often the witnesses to the incident are gone, the testimony is old, their interest in it is lost, the women might have found a different job and no longer have a pursuit of her case as a top priority. So I think selection of key test cases that might be generic in nature would be a very good thing for me to do and also to have a nationwide commitment expressed by me as President to the enforcement of the laws that we already have on the books concerning equal employment."", 'Q. You indicated in your written answers support for the portability of teacher retirement funds.', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', 'Q. Governor, what kinds of problems do you foresee in trying to achieve that goal?', ""Governor Carter. Well, it would be hard for me to outline all the problems. I do see some need for federal legislation that would express some requirements for standardization of retirement benefits. Also, that would permit the transfer of benefits across state lines, that would recognize the high mobility of teachers in a modem day world, but exactly what legal obstacles are there, I haven't studied that question enough to enumerate all of them. I'm sure there are some, but I believe that with the purpose expressed by the teaching profession and by representatives of teachers and others around the country that whatever obstacles are there can be substantially eliminated. I have confidence we can do it, but I can't list for you all the obstacles."", ""Q- Governor, we're about out of time, and we've talked about educational issues and issues of concern to the teachers of NE A. One last question. What are your major aims aside from your commitment to education and major objectives as President, if elected?"", ""Carter- I and my supporters have been very instrumental in helping to devise a Democratic Party platform, and I intend to carry out that platform. I think for the first time you'll see a campaign conducted in the fall election based on the platform commitments that have been derived from the early primary elections. We've had 30 primaries in which you could acquire committed delegates, and I've been in all 30 of them, so government reorganization, the structure of government to make it efficient, economical, purposeful, and manageable for a change; basic welfare reform to give us a simple, fair, and compassionate system; basic tax reform that would provide some equity and some fairness in the income tax structure of our country; comprehensive nationwide health program which we sadly lack; and long-range commitments to programs in education, working with educators and parents and others; and similar programs or commitments in the field of transportation or energy. These kinds of bold approaches to government are ones that I think our nation seeks, and I believe that people are ready to accept them. I think that my success in the primaries have been an indication that what I've just outlined to you is similar to what the American people want."", 'Q. Thank you. On behalf of the National Education Association Board of Directors and our NEA Political Action Committee and my colleagues on the Steering Committee, we thank you very much for taking the time out of your very busy schedule to submit to this interview.', ""Governor Carter. It's been a great pleasure for me. I look forward to working closely with you the rest of this year and hopefully the next 4 years.""]"

These countries already have a significant world impact, and they are prepared to play even larger global roles in shaping a new international order.\n', 'There are those who say that democracy is dying, that we live in the twilight of an era, and that the destiny of modem man is to witness the waning of freedom.\n', 'In Japan, Western Europe, Canada, some countries in Latin America, Israel, and among many other people, I have found not a decline of democracy but a dynamic commitment to its principles.\n', 'I might add that I can testify personally to the vigor of the democratic process in our own country.\n', 'In addition to cooperation between North America, Japan and Western Europe, there is an equal need for increased unity and consultation between ourselves and such democratic societies as Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and other nations, such as those in this hemisphere, that share our democratic values, as well as many of our political and economic concerns.\n', 'There must be more frequent consultations on many levels. We should have periodic summit conferences and occasional meetings of the leaders of all the industrial democracies, as well as frequent cabinet level meetings. In addition, as we do away with one-man diplomacy, we must once again use our entire foreign policy apparatus to reestablish continuing contacts at all levels. Summits are no substitute for the habit of cooperating closely at the working level.\n', 'In consultations, both form and substance are important. There is a fundamental difference between informing governments after the fact and actually including them in the process of joint policy making. Our policy makers have in recent years far too often ignored this basic difference. I need only cite the ""Nixon Shocks"" and the abrupt actions taken by former Treasury Secretary Connally.\n', 'We heed to recognize also that in recent years our Western European allies have been deeply concerned, and justly so, by our unilateral dealings with the Soviet Union. To the maximum extent possible, our dealings with the communist powers should reflect the combined view of the democracies and thereby avoid suspicions by our allies that we may be disregarding their interests.\n', 'We seek not a condominium of the powerful but a community of the free.\n', 'There are at least three areas in which the democratic nations can benefit from closer and more creative relations.\n', 'First, there are our economic and political affairs.\n', 'In the realm of economics, our basic purpose must be to keep open the international system in which the exchange of goods, capital, and ideas among nations can continue to expand.\n', 'Increased coordination among the industrialized democracies can help avoid the repetition of such episodes as the inflation of 1972—73 and the more recent recessions. Both were made more severe by an excess of expansionist zeal and then of deflationary reaction in North America, Japan and Europe.\n', ""Though each country must make its own economic decisions, we need to know more about one another's interests and intentions. We must avoid unilateral acts, and we must try not to work at cross-purposes in the pursuit of the same ends. We need not agree on all matters, but we should agree to discuss all matters.\n"", 'We should continue our efforts to reduce trade barriers among the industrial countries, as one way to combat inflation. The current Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations should be pursued to a successful conclusion.\n', 'But we must do more. The International Monetary System should be renovated so that it can serve us well for the next quarter of a century. Last January, at a meeting of the leading financial officials, agreement was reached on a new system, based on greater flexibility of exchange rates. There is no prospect of any early return to fixed exchange rates—divergencies in economic experience among nations are too great for that. But we still have much to learn regarding the effective operation of a system of fluctuating exchange rates. We must take steps to avoid large and erratic fluctuations, without impeding the basic monetary adjustments that will be necessary among nations for some years to come. It will be useful to strengthen the role of the International Monetary Fund as a center for observation and guidance of the world economy, keeping track of the interactions among national economies and making recommendations to governments on how best to keep the world economy functioning smoothly.\n', 'Beyond economic and political cooperation, we have much to learn from one another. I have been repeatedly impressed by the achievements of the Japanese and the Europeans in their domestic affairs. The Japanese, for example, have one of the lowest unemployment rates and the lowest crime rate of any industrialized nation, and they also seem to suffer less than other urbanized peoples from the modem problem of rootlessness and alienation.\n', 'Similarly, we can learn from the European nations about health care, urban planning and mass transportation.\n', 'There are many ways that creative alliances can work for a better world. Let us mention just one more, the area of human rights. Many of us have protested the violation of human rights in Russia, and justly so. But such violations are not limited to any one country or one ideology. There are other countries that violate human rights in one way or another—by torture, by political persecution, and by racial or religious discrimination.\n', 'We and our allies, in a creative partnership, can take the lead in establishing and promoting basic global standards of human rights. We respect the independence of all nations, but by our example, by our utterances, and by the various forms of economic and political persuasion available to us, we can quite surely lessen the injustice in this world.\n', 'We must certainly try.\n', 'Let me make one other point in the political realm. Democratic processes may in some countries bring to power parties or leaders whose ideologies are not shared by most Americans.\n', 'We may not welcome these changes; we will certainly not encourage them. But we must respect the results of democratic elections and the right of countries to make their own free choice if we are to remain faithful to our own basic ideals. We must learn to live with diversity, and we can continue to cooperate, so long as such political parties respect the democratic process, uphold existing international commitments, and are not subservient to external political direction. The democratic concert of nations should exclude only those who exclude themselves by the rejection of democracy itself.\n', 'Our people have now learned the folly of our trying to inject our power into the internal affairs of other nations. It is time that our government learned that lesson too.\n', ""While it is too early to appraise the ultimate result erf the weekend's elections in Italy, and though the outcome is a source of some relief since the Communist Party failed to obtain the plurality, it is clear that Italian political problems have been caused by the underlying social malaise of the country. Coping with this continuing malaise will require not only a major act of will on the part of Italian political leadership, but patient and significant assistance from Italy's Western European neighbors, as well as from the United States. We must give our most alert and sympathetic consideration to such needed assistance.\n"", 'The second area of increased cooperation among the democracies is that of mutual security. Here, however, we must recognize that the Atlantic and Pacific regions have quite different needs and different political sensitivities.\n', 'Since the United States is both an Atlantic and a. Pacific power, our commitments to the security of Western Europe and of Japan are inseparable from our own security. Without these commitments, and our firm dedication to them, the political fabric of Atlantic and Pacific cooperation would be seriously weakened, and world peace endangered.\n', ""As we look to the Pacific region, we see a number of changes and opportunities. Because of potential Sino-Soviet conflict, Russian and Chinese forces are not jointly deployed as our potential adversaries, but confront one another along their common border. Moreover, our withdrawal from the mainland of Southeast Asia has made possible improving relationships between us and the People's Republic of China.\n"", 'With regard to our primary Pacific ally, Japan, we will maintain our existing security arrangements, so long as that continues to be the wish of the Japanese people and government.\n', 'I believe it will be possible to withdraw our ground forces from South Korea on a phased basis over a time span to be determined after consultation with both South Korea and Japan. At the same time, it should be made clear to the South Korean Government that its internal oppression is repugnant to our people, and undermines the support for our commitment there.\n', 'We face a more immediate problem in the Atlantic sector of our defense.\n', 'The Soviet Union has in recent years strengthened its forces in Central Europe. The Warsaw Pact forces facing NATO today are substantially composed of Soviet combat troops, and these troops have been modernized and reinforced. In the event of war, they are postured for an all-out conflict of short duration and great intensity.\n', ""NATO's ground combat forces are largely European. The U.S. provides about one-fifth of the combat element, as well as the strategic umbrella, and without this American commitment, Western Europe could not defend itself successfully.\n"", 'In recent years, new military technology has been developed by both sides, including precision-guided munitions that are changing the nature of land warfare.\n', ""Unfortunately, NATO's arsenal suffers from a lack of standardization, which needlessly increases the cost of NATO, and its strategy too often seems wedded to past plans and concepts. We must not allow our alliance to become an anachronism.\n"", ""There is, in short, a pressing need for us and our allies to undertake a review of NATO's forces and its strategies in light of the changing military environment.\n"", ""A comprehensive program to develop, procure, and equip NATO with the more accurate air defense and anti-tank weapons made possible by new technology is needed to increase NATO's defensive power. Agreement on stockpiles and on the prospective length of any potential conflict is necessary. We should also review the structure of NATO reserve forces so they can be committed to combat sooner.\n"", 'In all of this a major European and joint effort will be required. Our people will not support unilateral American contributions in what must be a truly mutual defense effort.\n', 'Even as we review our military posture, we must spare no effort to bring about a reduction of the forces that confront one another in Central Europe.\n', 'It is to be hoped that the stalemated mutual force reduction talks in Vienna will soon produce results so that the forces of both sides can be reduced in a manner that impairs the security of neither. The requirement of balanced reductions complicates negotiations, but it is an important requirement for the maintenance of security in Europe.\n', 'Similarly, in the SALT talks, we must seek significant nuclear disarmament that safeguards the basic interests of both sides.\n', 'Let me say something I have often said in recent months. East-West relations will be both cooperative and competitive for a long time to come. We want the competition to be peaceful, and we want the cooperation to increase. But we will never seek accommodation at the expense of our own national interests or the interests of our allies.\n', 'Our potential adversaries are intelligent people. They respect strength; they respect constancy; they respect candor. They will understand our commitment to our allies. They will listen even more carefully if we and our allies speak with a common resolve.\n', 'We must remember, too, that a genuine spirit of cooperation between the democracies and the Soviet Union should extend beyond a negative cessation of hostilities and reach toward joint efforts in dealing with such world problems as agricultural development and the population crisis.\n', 'The great challenge we Americans confront is to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that our good will is as great as our strength until, despite all the obstacles, our two nations can achieve new attitudes and new trust, and until, in time, the terrible burden of the arms race can be lifted from our peoples.\n', 'One realistic step would be to recognize that thus far, while we have had certain progress on a bilateral basis, we have continued to confront each other by proxy in various trouble spots. These indirect challenges may be potentially more dangerous than face to face disagreements, and at best they make mockery of the very concept of détente. If we want genuine progress, it must be at every level.\n', 'Our democracies must also work together more closely in a joint effort to help the hundreds of millions of people on this planet who are living in poverty and despair.\n', 'We have all seen the growth of North-South tensions in world affairs, tensions that are often based on legitimate economic grievances. We have seen in the Middle East the juncture of East-West and North-South conflicts and the resultant threat to world peace.\n', 'The democratic nations must respond to the challenge of human needs on three levels.\n', 'First, by widening the opportunities for genuine North-South consultations. The developing nations must not only be the objects of policy, but must participate in shaping it. Without wider consultations we will have sharper confrontations. A good start has been made with the Conference in International Economic Cooperation which should be strengthened and widened.\n', 'Secondly, by assisting those nations that are in direct need.\n', 'There are many ways the democracies can unite to help shape a more stable and just world order. We can work to lower trade barriers and make a major effort to provide increased support to the international agencies that now make capital available to the Third World.\n', 'This will require help from Europe, Japan, North America, and the wealthier members of OPEC for the World Bank\'s soft-loan affiliate, the International Development Association. The wealthier countries should also support such specialized funds as the new International Fund for Agricultural Development, which will put resources from the oil exporting and developed countries to work in increasing food production in poor countries. We might also seek to institutionalize, under the World Bank, a ""World Development Budget,"" in order to rationalize and coordinate these and other similar efforts.\n', 'It is also time for the Soviet Union, which donates only about one-tenth of one percent of its GNP to foreign aid—and mostly for political ends—to act more generously toward global economic development.\n', 'I might add, on the subject of foreign aid, that while we are a generous nation we are not a foolish nation, and our people will expect recipient nations to undertake needed reforms to promote their own development. Moreover, all nations must recognize that the North-South relationship is not made easier by one-sided self-righteousness, by the exercise of automatic majorities in world bodies, nor by intolerance for the views or the very existence of other nations.\n', 'Third, we and our allies must work together to limit the flow of arms into the developing world.\n', 'The North-South conflict is in part a security problem. As long as the more powerful nations exploit the less powerful, they will be repaid by terrorism, hatred, and potential violence. Insofar as our policies are selfish, or cynical, or shortsighted, there will inevitably be a day of reckoning.\n', ""I am particularly concerned by our nation's role as the world's leading arms salesman. We sold or gave away billions of dollars of arms last year, mostly to developing nations. For example, we are now beginning to export advanced arms to Kenya and Zaire, thereby both fueling the East-West arms race in Africa even while supplanting our own allies—Britain and France— in their relations with these African states. Sometimes we try to justify this unsavory business on the cynical ground that by rationing out the means of violence we can somehow control the world's violence.\n"", ""The fact is that we cannot have it both ways. Can we be both the world's leading champion of peace and the world's leading supplier of the weapons of war? If I become President, I will work with our allies, some of whom are also selling arms, and also seek to work with the Soviets, to increase the emphasis on peace and to reduce the commerce in weapons of war.\n"", 'The challenge we and our allies face with regard to the developing nations is a great one, a constant one, and an exciting one. It is exciting because it calls for so much creativity at so many levels by so many nations and individuals.\n', 'I have suggested steps which we and our allies might take toward a more stable and more just world order. I do not pretend to have all the answers. I hope you will help me find them.\n', 'What I do have is a strong sense that this country is drifting and must have new leadership and new direction. The time has come for a new thrust of creativity in foreign policy equal to that of the years following the Second World War. The old international institutions no longer suffice. The time has come for a new architectural effort, with creative initiative by our own nation, with growing cooperation among the industrial democracies as its cornerstone, and with peace and justice its constant goal.\n', 'We are in a time of challenge and opportunity. If the values we cherish are to be preserved—the ideals of liberty and dignity and opportunity for all—we shall have to work in the closest collaboration with like-minded nations, seeking, through the strength that follows from collective action, to build an international system that reflects the principles and standards of our national heritage.\n', 'The primary purpose of our foreign policy is to create and maintain a world environment within which our great experiment in freedom can survive and flourish.\n', 'Ours would be a chilled and lonely world without the other democracies of Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and this hemisphere with whom we share great common purposes. There is a special relationship among us based not necessarily on a common heritage but on our partnership in great enterprises. Our present limits are not those of natural resources but of ideas and inspirations.\n', 'Our first great need is to restore the morale and spirit of the American people.\n', 'It is time once again for the world to feel the forward movement and the effervescence of a dynamic and confident United States of America.']"
26,Jimmy Carter ,"June 29, 1976","[""More than 40 years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt declared that America's No. 1 economic problem was poverty in the South.\n"", 'President Roosevelt was right, and he had the vision and political ability to enact programs such as TVA and REA that changed my life and the lives of millions of southerners.\n', ""Today, America's No. 1 economic problem is our cities, and I want to work with you to meet the problems of urban America just as Franklin Roosevelt worked to meet the problems of the rural South in the 1930's.\n"", 'I want to make one point at the outset, as plainly as I can.\n', 'There is no room in my concept of the Presidency for the politics of alienation and division.\n', 'For 8 years, our cities and their people and their elected officials have too often been viewed by the White House as adversaries and used as political whipping boys.\n', 'Too often our highest federal officials have tried to score political points by pitting the suburbs and the rural areas against the cities.\n', 'Too often, these administrations have ignored the common interests which unite our local, state, and federal governments.\n', 'I pledge to you an urban policy based on a new coalition—recognizing that the President, governors, and mayors represent the same urban constituency.\n', 'I pledge to you that if I become President, you, the mayors of America, will have a friend, an ally, and a partner in the White House.\n', 'The mayors of America will have direct access to the White House to get prompt assistance on any problems that may arise.\n', 'It is time for our government leaders to recognize that the people who inhabit even the poorest and most deteriorating of our central cities are our fellow Americans, and that they want the same things we all want; personal security, a decent job, a good education for their children, opportunities for recreation—in short, the basic American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n', 'Our goal must be to develop a coherent national urban policy that is consistent, compassionate, realistic, and that reflects the decency and good sense of the American people.\n', 'We have never really had a comprehensive urban policy in this country, although we have been moving toward one, in fits and starts, for several decades.\n', ""The initial steps came in the late 1930's when we began the first public housing projects. In 1949 we started the Urban Renewal Program. In the 1960's the Anti-Poverty Program and the Model Cities Program broke new ground in urban policy, and gave us some successes, some failures, and much experience to draw upon.\n"", 'But for the past 8 years we have drifted; we have seen indifference replace experimentation, and divisiveness replace the search for unity that this country so urgently needs.\n', 'Between 1972 and 1974 alone, the Nixon-Ford Administrations cut $4.5 billion in urban programs and another $7 billion from programs to aid the poor, the unemployed, and the medically indigent.\n', 'The cities, with their revenues already reduced by the worst recession in 40 years, and with rapidly rising costs, could only respond to the financial crunch with higher taxes or reduced services. Thus, in 1957, our cities enacted $1.5 billion in new taxes while reducing expenditures by $1.4 billion. The result of these increased taxes and reduced services can only be to speed the flight to the suburbs and leave behind urban dwellers bereft of the hope for a better quality of life.\n', 'In short, in the absence of understanding and coordinated assistance among government leaders, many of our cities are caught in a vicious cycle, a downward spiral that can only be broken by new attitudes, new initiatives, and new leadership.\n', 'The time has come for us to work together toward a restoration of federalism, through the creation of a balanced national partnership that is based on mutual trust, mutual respect, and mutual commitment to the future of the American city.\n', 'The balanced national partnership I envision must incorporate three basic elements.\n', 'First: The federal government must provide predictable and adequate financial support to assist communities in meeting your legitimate fiscal needs, so that localities can avoid excessive service cutbacks and inordinate property tax increases.\n', ""Of course, we must be realistic. We cannot just throw money at problems. We must respect the desire of the American taxpayer to get a dollar's worth of results for each dollar spent. But I believe that if we talk sense to the American people, we will find support for a realistic program to meet the urban crisis. That is what I intend to do as President.\n"", 'Second: A balanced national partnership must, to the greatest degree possible, grant to the local governments the administrative freedom needed for innovative, creative programing.\n', ""Between the mid-1950's and this year, the number of categorical grant programs grew from 150 to more than 1,600, each with its own administrative bureaucracy, its own restrictive conditions, individual application procedures, review conditions, and funding priorities.\n"", 'These categorical grants can often serve important functions. On a program of national dimensions, such grants can maximize local involvement in confronting national problems.\n', 'In practice, however, the proliferation of grants has built an irrational structure, which has often limited local initiative and fragmented local efforts toward sound fiscal planning.\n', 'It is important to attach conditions to programs which insure that funds are directed toward the beneficiaries intended by Congress and the President. But too often programs designed for the ghetto families have been shifted to further benefit affluent families whose political influence can prevail.\n', ""You, this nation's mayors, are the people on the firing line, fighting a hard battle against heavy odds, and we cannot expect you to fight well if you are trapped in the bureaucratic strait jacket that categorical grants have too often imposed.\n"", 'To achieve a balanced national partnership, I intend to undertake a review, beginning this year and involving full consultation with state and local officials, and congressional leaders, to determine in which instances consolidation of categorical grants would be desirable.\n', 'That process of consolidation will insure that the federal structure is organized to allow localities maximum flexibility in delivering services within the framework of national standards. I can insure that consolidation will not be a cover to reduce needed federal assistance, or to change the distribution of benefits so as to discriminate against those individuals with the greatest need.\n', 'Third: A balanced federal partnership must involve the governors and the mayors in the earliest stages of formulating our national urban policy, and in the design of new administrative machinery to implement that policy.\n', 'Finally, federalism is not going to mean anything until the federal government sets its own house in order. I intend as President to direct a complete reorganization of the Executive Branch of the federal government along rational functional lines, one that will enable Washington to work more effectively with you in responding to the urban crisis.\n', 'I look forward with interest to observe similar improvements in municipal government organization and management which you are sharing with one another. We have long recognized that federal tax funds should not finance local waste.\n', 'My own views on federalism are not just theories: they directly reflect my experiences in dealing with the delivery end of complicated programs when I was Governor of Georgia.\n', 'I learned, along with you mayors, just how confused and irrational the Washington bureaucracy can be. For example, when we started a drug treatment program under one state agency, we discovered there were some 14 different agencies that were funding various aspects of the drug problem, and with little, if any, coordination among them.\n', 'But I am absolutely convinced that if we work together on the task, we can come up with a federal system that is effective and efficient and that can be a source of national pride instead of national embarrassment.\n', 'We simply can no longer afford the price of the red tape. We must get the money and services to the people who need them, and not just to the communities that happen to be most skilled in the art of grantsmanship.\n', 'These are among my beliefs as I consider the urban problem. Now I want to discuss some of the specific programs I support.\n', 'The first thing we need is jobs, a job for every American who wants one. Unemployment and poverty are at the heart of the urban problem.\n', 'Last year, the central city unemployment rate was 9.6 percent, and among black teenagers, the jobless rate in many areas was over 40 percent. Those figures are unacceptable. They reflect a national sickness that we must confront head on. They reflect not only human tragedies but they axe at the heart of the fiscal and social problems of cities. The only way to achieve the growth in the urban tax base required to meet rising expenditures is through a healthy local economy.\n', 'To provide employment, we need both a program of incentives to private employers and a program of public needs employment.\n', ""We must recognize at the outset that almost 85 percent of America's workers depend on private industry for jobs. I would like to maintain or improve this ratio.\n"", 'To encourage new industrial development in the cities, I have proposed assistance to local governments for urban economic planning, employment credits to businesses for hiring the unemployed, and federal funds to support on-the-job training by business.\n', ""In terms of public employment, I favor an improved CETA program, an accelerated public works program, and funds for a total of some 800,000 summer jobs. Like some of you, I remember the impact of the CCC and WPA in the 1930's, and I think similar initiatives are called for today, but with stress on urban rather than rural work projects, and with maximum possible local control over those projects. Public employment must be meaningful and productive in meeting the most urgent needs of the community.\n"", 'Our efforts toward full employment must be supplemented by fiscal assistance, and in particular by an improved program of revenue sharing.\n', ""I predicted at the outset of the Nixon Administration's revenue sharing program that it would eventually be used to reduce, rather than increase, net federal assistance to our states and cities. Unfortunately, I was correct.\n"", 'I stand with you in urging Congress to extend the General Revenue Sharing Program with an inflation factor and with full enforcement of the civil rights provisions of the bill.\n', 'As perhaps you know, I have for some time stated my belief, even when I was a governor, that revenue sharing funds should go directly to localities, and that they should be free to use those funds to defray costs of education and social programs.\n', 'We also need countercyclical assistance, with revenue sharing and other financial aid designed to meet the special needs of the most hard-pressed urban areas. We need an automatic countercyclical assistance program, with a long-term authorization, triggered by carefully defined economic conditions in particular localities and designed to maintain service levels in our cities and thereby avoid disruptive tax increases and public employee layoffs.\n', ""I regret President Ford's veto last year of the Public Works Economic Development Act, with its needed provision for public works, for countercyclical aid to cities and for waste-water treatment plants, and I join you in urging that he sign the new version passed with overwhelming Democratic majorities, which now awaits his action.\n"", 'The present bill is within the budget resolutions adopted by Congress, and it would not be rejected by a President who genuinely understood and cared about our cities and their people.\n', 'In the past year, the dramatic financial difficulties of New York City have been the focus of national attention on urban fiscal problems. But the truth is that cities throughout America share the same problems of declining revenues and increasing costs. Your own 1976 economic report makes that point abundantly clear. For the first time, cities of every size, and in every part of the nation, including the Sun Belt, are face to face with financial crisis.\n', ""I think the public at large does not yet realize that what we confront is not just New York City's fiscal crisis, but a national problem. It will be your duty and my duty to make the nation aware of the broad nature of the urban problem, and to provide the leadership and the ideas that can cope with it\n"", 'Another need in easing urban problems, as I have stressed throughout my campaign, is a complete overhaul of our welfare system.\n', 'Our present system is a failure deplored alike by those who pay for it, those who administer it, and those who supposedly benefit from it.\n', 'About 10 percent of those on welfare are able to work full-time, and they should be offered job training and jobs. Any such person who refuses training or employment should not receive further welfare benefits.\n', 'The other 90 percent of the people on welfare are children, persons with dependent children, old people, handicapped people, or persons otherwise unable to work full-time. They should be treated with compassion and respect.\n', ""We should have a simpler national welfare program, with one fairly uniform standard of payment, adjusted for cost-of-living differences by areas and with strong work incentives built in. In no case should the level of benefits make loafing more attractive than working. And we should have welfare rules that strengthen families rather than divide families. Local governments should not be burdened with the cost of welfare and my goal would also include the phased reduction of the states' share as soon as that is financially feasible.\n"", 'I believe we are competent enough to create a welfare program that is both efficient and compassionate.\n', 'We also need Presidential leadership in helping cities meet their housing and transportation needs.\n', 'Our worst year in nearly three decades in terms of the number of housing units constructed was 1975. We set a goal in 1968 of 2½ million new bousing units per year; last year we constructed barely 1 million.\n', 'At the same time, costs have been rising so that only one American family in six can now afford new housing.\n', 'We need a program that will provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed construction workers and also fulfill our national commitment to adequate housing construction.\n', 'Our long-range, comprehensive and predictable national housing policy must include:\n', '• Federal subsidies and low-interest loans for the construction of low and middle income housing;\n', '• Greater effort to direct mortgage money into the financing of private housing;\n', '• Expansion of the successful ""Section 202, Housing Program for the Elderly"";\n', '• Greater emphasis on the rehabilitation of existing housing to rebuild our neighborhoods and publicly created jobs to spearhead this rehabilitation;\n', '• Continued construction of rental homes for low income families; and\n', '• Prohibition of red-lining practices by lending institutions.\n', 'We should give serious consideration to the proposals now before Congress for a domestic development bank that would make low interest loans to businesses and state and local governments to encourage private sector investment in chronically depressed areas.\n', 'The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 can be improved when it comes up for reauthorization next year. If I become President, it will be necessary for me to submit my proposals on this program to Congress very soon after taking office, and I want your ideas and recommendations on how it can be made more effective.\n', 'The plight of our municipal transportation systems is another subject for Presidential concern and initiative.\n', 'For 20 years, we have spent tens of billions of dollars on the Interstate Highway System while virtually ignoring public transportation. Our bus and subway systems have deteriorated, public use of them has declined, and deficits have mounted.\n', 'Although we must expedite final completion of the Interstate Highway System, we cannot allow mass transit to remain a national stepchild. If people cannot get in and out of our cities in comfort and safety, then the economic strength of our central cities is doomed.\n', 'As first steps toward revitalizing our urban transportation system, I propose:\n', '• To create a total national policy for all modes of transportation;\n', '• To increase the portion of transportation money available for public mass transportation;\n', '• To change the current restrictive limits on the use of mass transit funds by localities, so more money can be used as operating subsidies:\n', ""• To revitalize our nation's railroads.\n"", 'There is also a tremendous opportunity for relatively inexpensive transportation improvement by strong local action to provide offstreet parking, one-way streets, exclusive bus lines, limited unloading hours for downtown stores, more carpools, and staggered working hours for public and private employees.\n', 'These are some of the necessary first steps if we are to deal with the urban crisis. There are obviously other areas of need, such as parks and recreation, education, pollution, and crime prevention, that must also be addressed.\n', 'Perhaps most importantly, we must recognize that many federal programs in the past have had a counterproductive effect on the health and wealth of our cities. It is time to assure that federal spending policy takes into account the best interests of our urban communities.\n', 'In order to have a comprehensive urban strategy, federal, state and local governments must provide incentives to direct the resources of private enterprise into our cities. Our national urban partnership would be incomplete without the creative involvement of private resources. The public sector cannot rebuild our cities alone. An optimum public-private partnership must be forged.\n', 'In this era of scarce resources, the federal government can help magnify limited public sector funds by engaging substantial private sector investment in our cities. As urban economist Anthony Downs noted, ""Federal funds alone—and even all public sector funds together—have little chance erf stimulating effective community development unless they are used as a catalyst to attract large amounts of additional resources from the private sector.""\n', 'The government can also help local communities encourage innovative new structures, such as tax increment financing, which allows a city to use growth in its property tax in a given area to stimulate needed urban reinvestments, and joint public-private development mechanisms.\n', 'The Community Development Act should not only be extended, but its scope should be significantly oriented to encourage financial and political innovation by municipalities and their private sector partners. Community development funds, local tax increment financing, federal loan guarantees, and other pubEc and private funds should be used flexibly to create a revolving pool of financial resources for urban redevelopment Unfortunately, the Ford Administration has not yet even implemented a small scale version of the current act, which affords an outstanding opportunity to combine public and private urban development investments.\n', ""Privately operated nonprofit organizations committed to urban redevelopment, such as Central Atlanta Progress in my home state's capital, are being formed throughout the country to help serve as a catalyst for private investment in our cities. They must be encouraged in their efforts.\n"", 'I do not underestimate the magnitude of the problem. But neither do I underestimate the strength and compassion and good sense of the American people, when they are given the right kind of leadership and make up their minds to solve a problem.\n', 'A nation that can send men to the moon can meet its urban needs. It is a matter of priorities, of leadership, and of determination.\n', ""I think we stand at a turning point in history. If, a hundred years from now, this nation's experiment in democracy has failed, I suspect that historians will trace that failure to our own era, when a process of decay began in our inner cities and was allowed to spread unchecked throughout our society.\n"", 'But I do not believe that must happen. I believe that, working together, we can turn the tide, stop the decay, and set in motion a process of growth that by the end of this century can give us cities worthy of the greatest nation on earth.\n', 'I recall the oath taken by the citizens of Athens:\n', '""We will ever strive for the ideals and sacred things of the city;\n', '""We will unceasingly seek to quicken the sense of public duty;\n', '""We will revere and obey the city\'s laws;\n', '""We will transmit this city not less, but greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.""\n', 'Those words are more than 2,000 years old, but they are still valid today.

27,Jimmy Carter ,"July 06, 1976","['Since 1945, when President Roosevelt died, no former governor served in the White House.\n', ""In the 30 years following President Roosevelt's death, we have seen a steady expansion of the role of the federal government. It has been an era of some good beginnings, and of some great national triumphs—in education, health care and social services for the indigent and elderly, and civil rights. It was an era in which the federal government broadened the opportunities for millions of Americans. We can be proud of those achievements, although a great deal remains to be done.\n"", 'But it was not a great era for federal-state relations, nor was it a great period for the states themselves. As the federal government assumed important new responsibilities, too often programs were enacted which denied the diversity of American life, which created a growing bureaucracy, and which robbed state and local governments of flexibility in responding to local problems.\n', 'Too often, the states were caught in a financial squeeze as the federal government cut back on funds for vital programs which the federal government itself had created.\n', ""We will never know whether a gubernatorial viewpoint would have alerted a President to the erosion in the role of the states. But there is a new humility today about the federal government's ability to legislate problems away. There is a new understanding that often the machinery of government impedes our common objectives.\n"", 'The states need a compassionate partner in Washington—a partner that will provide predictable, adequate assistance to enable states to meet their legitimate needs. But they also need an efficient partner in Washington— a partner that understands the virtues of forbearance, a partner that knows what the states can do as well as what they cannot.\n', 'No assembly of men and women in America understands more clearly than you do the defects of the present relationship, and nobody wants more than you to forge a new balanced partnership.\n', 'I know, because I have shared your experiences and your frustrations— but, most importantly, I have also shared your dreams.\n', 'I promise you that, if I am fortunate enough to be nominated and elected as President, I will not preside over an administration which ignores the lessons of my own personal experience. Last week I made a similar pledge to the mayors and today, as part of that same programmatic approach to government reform, I pledge to you, if elected, a sensitive ally in the White House, and I pledge to work with you to bring about a restoration of true federalism.\n', 'Historically, the states have been the laboratories of public policy. They have pioneered management, economic, labor, and social programs which have been models for later federal programs. The states should serve as 50 independent experiments, each with its distinctive qualities and conditions, each providing a unique experience upon which federal and other state officials can draw. Instead, they are trapped between the federal bureaucracy and the state and local bureaucracies which you have been forced to create to cope with all the federal programs.\n', 'For too long, Woodrow Wilson\'s prescription that the states be ""laboratories for experimentation"" has failed to be a consistent objective of federal policy. For too long, federal programs have put the states in a strait jacket which has hampered local initiative. Yet, states in recent years have been the most creative segment of government.\n', 'The national government might have seen earlier the virtues of regional compacts, sunshine and sunset laws, zero-base budgeting and other reforms recently initiated by many of you at the state level, and only now being considered in Washington.\n', 'For too long, the maze of restrictive federal programs has denied the diversity of life in this nation. Instead of rejoicing in pluralism, the federal bureaucracy in effect negated it with programs which were written as if the entire United States were less diverse than the State of Pennsylvania.\n', 'I see state governments not as impediments, but as effective instruments in achieving the objectives we share.\n', 'After 18 months of campaigning, the instincts with which I began this campaign have been reinforced, and I have no intention of rejecting my own experience now. The most important commitment I can make to you is a simple one. If I am elected President, I will review every appointment, examine every program, to build an attitude of respect for the role of state government into the highest levels of the federal bureaucracy.\n', 'We will have a government structure that encourages rather than stifles local flexibility. I believe it is time that the federal government recognized that states and localities retain a special knowledge of local problems, and that responsive and flexible state and local leadership is essential to representative government in this nation.\n', 'The first requirement is to improve the coordination of federal activities as they relate to each state.\n', 'The structure and missions of the various federal agencies and programs are often overlapping and uncoordinated, making it difficult for private citizens and public officials alike to resolve an individual or a community\':"" problems.\n', 'If elected President, I intend first to upgrade the role of regional councils representing the federal government to assist state and local officials, as well as private citizens, in dealing with federal agencies on any matter involving a federal question that might arise. These offices will be empowered to review conflicts among the various federal agencies and will have speedy access to the highest levels of the federal government.\n', 'Second, I will establish a system in the Executive Office of the President which enables the President to keep abreast of local initiatives, and which permits state and local officials to consult with the highest levels of the federal government on the full range of their concerns. I seek your assistance and advice in designing a machinery to meet that need, and to insure that consultations occur regularly.\n', 'Third, to the extent possible, we have to begin centralizing federal activities within each city in one location. The outposts of the federal government should be accessible to ordinary citizens when they need assistance, so that ""one stop"" federal service is available.\n', 'Not only will we try to improve the relationship of the separate states to the federal government, but the federal government needs to make it easier for states to develop cooperative mechanisms to deal with regional problems.\n', 'The states have already begun to look beyond their borders to solve common regional problems. They have done this around the country in the Midwest, in the Great Lakes Commission which has recently emphasized the cleanup of that great natural resource; in the western states, the Interstate Nuclear Board has been working on the problems of the development of nuclear power for the region; in the South, there is the Southern Growth Policies Board working for regional economic growth. These are only a few examples. Most recently, there is the coalition of northeastern governors trying to meet the problems of revitalizing the economy of that region.\n', 'But there is still more that might be done. The use of the natural resources of one region for the benefit of the nation can leave that region with the permanent negative impacts of that exploitation. The federal government and the affected region must find ways to see that those consequences are avoided, and that the hidden costs of seeing to it are equitably shared. If the coal beds of the country are used, the results of that process should return the land for other uses—for future generations. And the costs should not be only a local problem.\n', 'The place to start with these solutions is the administrative reform which we must accomplish in Washington.\n', 'A balanced national partnership must, to the greatest degree possible, grant to the local governments the administrative freedom needed for innovative, creative programing.\n', ""Between the mid-1950's and this year, the number of categorical grant programs grew from 150 to more than 1,600, each with its own administrative bureaucracy, its own restrictive conditions, individual application procedures, review conditions and funding priorities.\n"", 'These categorical grants can often serve important (unctions. On a program of national dimensions, such grants can maximize local involvement in confronting national problems.\n', 'In practice, however, the proliferation of grants has built an irrational structure, which has often limited local initiative and fragmented local efforts toward sound fiscal planning.\n', 'It is important to attach conditions to programs which insure that funds are directed toward the beneficiaries intended by Congress and the President. But too often programs designed for the ghetto families have been shifted to further benefit affluent families whose political influence can prevail.\n', 'To achieve a balanced national partnership, I intend to undertake a review, beginning this year and involving full consultation with you as governors and with local officials and congressional leaders, to determine in which instances consolidation of categorical grants would be desirable.\n', 'That process of consolidation will insure that the federal structure is organized to allow localities maximum flexibility in delivering services within the framework of national standards. Consolidation must not and will not be an excuse to reduce needed federal assistance, or to change the distribution of benefits so as to discriminate against those individuals with the greatest need.\n', 'If a balanced partnership is to prevail, it is necessary that governors and mayors be involved, not only in the review of categorical grants, but in the formulation of legislation and the promulgation of regulations as well. Usually, state officials receive their first notice of proposed rules when they are printed in the Federal Register. It is time that we recognized that we have become a government of regulations rather than laws; reform will be empty unless it is accompanied by a comprehensive review of existing regulations and the implementation of procedures to assure future state and local involvement in the early drafting of rules and regulations.\n', 'I do not underestimate the difficulties we will face in achieving regulatory reform, but we must persevere. The cost of excessive regulation goes beyond higher consumer price. Federal regulatory requirements have bureaucratized the private sector itself. Only large businesses can afford the cost of the internal bureaucracies that they must maintain to meet complex federal standards. The federal regulatory environment must be comprehensively reviewed to assure that it does not stimulate increased concentration of private economic power in a few hands.\n', 'Finally, federal budget policy must become more predictable. Predicting state revenues with accuracy is difficult under any circumstances, but the federal government can at least carry its burden by assuring that it meets commitments that it has previously made. Three-year federal budgeting will permit more effective planning by the states. A lawsuit has just successfully challenged the arbitrary food stamp cutbacks proposed by the Ford Administration. With an administration committed to predictable and compassionate policy making, 3-year budgeting, and long-term planning, such litigation should not be necessary.\n', 'There is no simple rule to follow in determining the proper role of the federal government in addressing a problem. In some areas, such as welfare reform, the federal government must assume increased responsibility. In establishing regional alliances, federal, state, and local government should serve as equal partners. In other areas, such as transportation, where some of the categorical grant programs are too restrictive, state and local discretion must be increased. What we are seeking is not a wholesale cutback of federal programs but a judicious consolidation and reoiganization which allows states to meet their needs without undermining legitimate national objectives.\n', ""A major item on your agenda is welfare reform. Throughout my campaign, I have stressed the urgent need for a complete overhaul of our nation's welfare system.\n"", 'Our present system is a failure deplored alike by those who pay for it, those who administer it, and those who supposedly benefit from it.\n', ""We all know of the need to remove from our welfare rolls those individuals who are ineligible for, or are not in need of, assistance. We have all read about the deplorable inefficiency which permeates our welfare systems. We know of the inequities which characterize many of our welfare programs ; we know, for example, that where one lives is often more important than what one needs in getting assistance. We also know that working for a living and staying with one's family can sometimes deprive that person's family of benefits otherwise available.\n"", 'You here also understand, perhaps better than most, how the present system is bankrupting both our cities and our states. As your welfare reform task force report points out, in fiscal year 1977, combined federal, state, and local costs of public assistance are projected to be about $25 billion. Medical assistance costs and food stamps raise this figure to almost double— $47 billion. Because of existing federal laws and standards, this burden is not equally distributed among states. In some counties, more than 50 percent of county revenue goes toward welfare purposes.\n', 'Continuing increases in costs are denying states and local areas the flexibility they need to meet the needs of our people.\n', 'This must be changed.\n', ""I am particularly pleased by the work of the National Governors' Conference in this area and of your interest in joining with other governmental units, the Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the Conference of State Legislators, to develop a common position on welfare reform. I hope to work closely with you in this effort and to begin discussions with you and other groups as part of a development of a specific welfare reform proposal. What I want to share with you today are the basic principles which I believe should form the framework for welfare reform.\n"", 'About 10 percent of those on welfare are able to work full-time and they should be offered job training and jobs. Any such person who refuses training or employment should not receive further welfare benefits.\n', 'The other 90 percent of the people on welfare are children, persons with dependent children, old people, handicapped people, or persons otherwise unable to work full-time. They should be treated with compassion and respect.\n', ""We should have a simpler national welfare program, with one fairly uniform standard of payment, adjusted to the extent feasible for cost-of-living differences by areas and with strong work incentives built in. In no case should the level of benefits make not working more attractive than working. And we should have welfare rules that strengthen families rather than divide families. Local governments should not be burdened with the cost of welfare, and my goal would also include the phased reduction of the states' share as soon as that is financially feasible.\n"", 'Simultaneously with welfare reform, there needs to be a major restructuring of state employment offices, existing job training and job creation programs in order to insure that all those who want to work can work. The federal welfare reform proposal should be developed in the context of reform of other related programs.\n', 'I believe we are competent enough to create a welfare program that is both efficient and compassionate.\n', 'These goals, programs and reforms are not impossible. Indeed, with your help, we can realize them all. I ask your cooperation. You shall have mine.']"
28,Jimmy Carter ,"July 11, 1976","['Monroe. Our guest on this special edition of ""Meet the Press"" is the former Governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter. Mr. Carter accomplished the unusual feat of beating 11 other Democratic candidates in the 1976 primary elections and, in effect, winning the Presidential nomination weeks before the party convention. He will be officially nominated by the Democratic National Convention, which opens tomorrow here in New York City. He will then indicate his choice of a vice presidential running mate.', 'We will have the first questions now from Lawrence E. Spivak of NBC News.', 'Spivak. Governor, you once said, ""I want the American people to understand my character, my weaknesses, the kind of person I am,"" and, Pd like to direct my question toward that end. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal charges that you seem much more preoccupied with getting to the White House than with what you hope to achieve after you get there. Can you give us some idea of what you want to achieve as President?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I will try. There are a lot of specific issues that affect the American people: Jobs, inflation, energy policy, agricultural policy, education, health, fair taxes, and many others, and I intend to address them all. The Democratic Party platform does this very clearly, and we had a major input into its exact wording and into the principles expressed therein.', 'There are three general issues that have been most important, I think, in the election and ones that I have very heavy on my shoulders as a responsibility.', 'One is whether or not our government itself can be competent, whether it can deliver services that our people expect and need.', 'Second, whether the government itself, particularly the President or the leaders, would be constantly sensitive to the needs of people who are most deprived, who are most dependent on government to correct a problem in their lives or give them a chance to live a useful and a fruitful life, and a third one is to restore the confidence of our people, the faith of our people in the government itself.', 'But I intend to start working immediately after the convention with leaders of Congress, with our staffs, with advisers, with my own staff members, to put together proposals that I will pursue during the general election and then when I am elected President, if I am successful this fall in the campaign, to start reorganizing the structure of our government, making it competent, dealing with health issues, welfare issues, tax reform, and other matters of this kind.', 'So I am working very hard to express as a candidate, and, hopefully, as the next President, the ideals and aspirations of the people and to correct their fears, prejudices, and needs.', 'Spivak. Governor, a great many important members of the press who have followed you still find you hard to understand; their analysis of you runs from sensitive and compassionate, through enigmatic, to tough, and even ruthless. Why do you think there is such a wide variation of opinion about you?', 'Governor Carter. Well, assuming that the press is completely unbiased, which is an assumption I have a hard time maintaining constantly, I would say that I am an average person; I am no more complicated or enigmatic or mysterious than other people. I have heavy responsibilities on me during the campaign. Sometimes I am quite cautious in making unguarded statements to 40 or 50, or sometimes more, news media representatives who are looking for every nuance of meaning in every word I say. I have been a little bit hesitant during the campaign to tell jokes or to make light of things because there might be 1 out of 40 news people who will accept it as a very serious statement; but I think, in general, the public has gotten to know me very well, and I think there is more and more of a consensus now among the press, at least in the columns I read, about what kind of person I am; and I think I am sensitive; I am tough. I think I am a good planner, and I am still searching for answers to complicated questions.', 'I have always avoided trying to give simplistic answers just for political * expediency, and I have had another very unique opportunity, almost unique, in not having to respond to the pressures of special interest groups.', ""During the campaign itself, I have gone directly to the people because powerful political figures didn't have any confidence I might win, and these kind of characteristics of the campaign itself, I think, have caused some of the doubt about what kind of person I am."", 'Spivak. May I be a bit more specific? Surveys by the New York Times and CBS News this year have shown time and time again that conservative voters tend to view you as a conservative, moderates see you as moderate and liberals see you as liberal. How do you explain that?', 'Governor Carter. I think the American people resent being put in boxes and I have always avoided that myself.', 'Obviously, since the beginning of this calendar year, as the Iowa Caucus approached, I have been heavily covered by the news media, and it is not possible for me to make a different statement in Iowa than the one I make in New Hampshire or Florida.', 'I think that the differences among our ideological categories of people have been removed; conservatives quite often in the past have been stigmatized by racism. That is no longer the case. I think many conservative people now are fully committed to the principles of human rights, civil rights, and equality of opportunity.', 'On the other hand, many liberals who have been categorized in the past as eager to waste money or to have a complicated, overbearing bureaucracy now see that services in which they are deeply interested, better health care, comprehensive welfare programs, can best be delivered with tough management.', ""I think many of the people in the South have always looked on the federal government as a legitimate part of our lives, and we have never feared government as long as we felt we were controlling it. We don't like to see the government control us. So I think those sharp differences that used to exist between the liberal and conservative elements of our society have pretty well been removed, so when I say I am going to manage the government in a tough, competent, businesslike way, and also deal with the sensitive needs of our people on human rights, civil rights, good environmental quality, I don't believe there is as much alienation of groups as there was before."", 'Hoge. Governor Carter, in a recent interview you were quoted as saying that the nation is best served by a strong, independent, aggressive President working with a strong and independent Congress. Now, there is great public doubt at the moment that Congress is or will be strong, and there is also great public fear that during the last several administrations the Presidency became so strong as to become a threat to democracy.', ""Why shouldn't people fear that an extension of that trend would occur under your leadership since you believe in an aggressive Presidency, and, furthermore, you have won the nomination and might win the election without owing anything to those kinds of organized coalitions and interest groups that might act as a check on your intentions?"", 'Governor Carter. Is it all right with you if I complete the quote?', 'Hoge. Surely.', 'Governor Carter. I also said that the President and the Congress ought to deal with each other on that basis with mutual respect for a change, in the open, for a change, and with dose consultation, for a change.', 'I have been a governor; I have had to deal with a legislature in a very controversial and also very innovative administration; and the best way I know to restore the sometimes lost leadership capabilities of the White House and the Congress is to have a searching for mutuality of purpose. When we get ready to reorganize the structure of the federal government, there is no way I could do that without the Congress; and I want to be sure that the responsible congressional leaders work with me at the initial stages along with, by the way, governors, mayors, and other officials of that kind.', 'When we get ready to put into effect a new welfare system or revise the tax programs, I want to be sure there is careful, long, detailed consultation between the White House and the Congress. But I am convinced that if this is done in the open so the American people know what is going on in the government, they would tend to prevent an abuse of strength and let the American people always have a voice in our deliberations as a government itself.', ""I think every time we have made a serious mistake in recent years in domestic or foreign affairs it has been because the American people have been excluded from the process. We have been held at arm's length; we have been misled; sometimes we have been lied to, and I want to put an end to that; and in that process I think we need a strong Congress and a strong President"", ""I don't believe there will necessarily follow abuses."", 'Hoge. Well, Governor, you say that openness is a check against abuse and part of the process of openness is the press?', 'Governor Carter. That is right', 'Hoge. At the time of the disclosure of the Pentagon papers you counseled that there ought to be laws enforcing criminal liability against the press for publishing classified information and, indeed, some unclassified information.', ""My question is, if that was so, under certain circumstances, what would check the government's penchant to overclassify information to protect its own reputation rather than to protect the national security?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't believe that is an accurate statement of my position now or ever in the past"", 'Hoge. Well, it is from the Atlanta Constitution.', 'Governor Carter. I understand that.', 'My preference is that the press be open. I personally feel that the Pentagon Papers should have been revealed by the New York Times, and I would do everything I could to protect the right of the press to conceal its sources of information, and let the responsibility of the press be its major check on how it acted as it deals with sensitive material or with matters that might affect our own country.', 'I would have the strongest possible commitment as President to protect the independence and the autonomy and the right of the press to speak freely, and I favor strong sunshine laws. One of the first acts I intend to take if I am elected President is by executive order to open up as many of the deliberations of the Executive Branch of government as possible, and I would join with the efforts that have been pursued by Senator Stone and Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida and others to pass a comprehensive sunshine law for the whole federal government. So everything I do as President will be designed, within the bounds of rationality, to open up the deliberations of government to the people through the press.', 'Warren. In this regard, Governor, would you go as far as opening up your meetings with congressional leaders to the press and to the public?', ""Governor Carter. When I am the host of a meeting where decisions are made I would favor the meetings being open. But when an executive officer is trying to formulate decisions, I don't think that is a proper time for the public to be completely involved in the process. You have to have subordinates able to deal with their superiors, and you have to have congressional leaders able to deal with the President in the formative stages of ideas or decisions without the press being present."", 'Warren. If you will forgive me, Governor, in the past that deliberative period has lasted quite awhile, and most discussions between Presidents and congressional leaders have been private for that reason. I am wondering if you would really be able to change that without a declaration or a resolution from the Congress?', 'Governor Carter. Well, as you possibly know, a number of the states in this country, the ones that I know, Florida, Georgia, Arkansas, California, recently Massachusetts, and I am sure others, have comprehensive sunshine laws. That is what they are called quite often. And they have been honed down now by experience so that the things that have to be reserved for privacy, ones that I have just described, plus quasi-grand jury investigations of maybe unwarranted charges against people should be private; but whenever there was a doubt in my mind about whether a meeting should be open or closed, I would go with the open meeting.', 'Frankel. Governor, just a couple more questions to find out who you are. You have probably studied the electorate in your path toward the nomination even more than the New York Times and CBS poll. Which of your political convictions, what things that you believe on the issues, have you found to be absolutely the most difficult politically to sell? That is, where do you find yourself different from the prevailing moods of the voters?', 'Governor Carter. The one single issue that comes to mind with which I have had the most difficulty has been the amnesty question. I struggled with this a number of months before I finally arrived at a decision that suits me. It is the one that is expressed now in the Democratic Party platform, which I favor. That is to pardon those who have defected from our nation during the Vietnamese war in violation of the draft laws, but to deal with deserters on an individual case basis. Now, this decision is not acceptable to a lot of American people, but it is what I intend to do. And I will begin the consummation of that promise the first week I am in the White House.', 'Frankel. Will you, by the way, also pardon the government officials who were involved in what you say was misleading or lying to the American public? That is that vast array of public servants who were involved in that policy? Are they available for duty in the Carter administration?', 'Governor Carter. Well, they are certainly available for duty. Whether I will call on them would be a matter of individual judgment again.', 'Frankel. Some of them will get pardoned?', 'Governor Carter. Perhaps.', 'Frankel. Are there any other issues that you sense the mood of the people on, where you think you are going to have to lead and get out in front, where the mood is not right for something that you feel needs to be done, and where you are likely to take one of these profiles in courage and take a plunge?', ""Governor Carter. Well, in many instances this would be the case. For instance, on the welfare program, there is no way to suit everyone. About 10 percent of our present welfare recipients are completely able to work full-time. I would like to remove them from the welfare system altogether; place them under the responsibility of the Labor Department, the Education Department, give them job training, match them with a job and offer them a job. If they are offered a job and don't take it, I wouldn't want to pay them any more benefits."", ""The other 90 percent can't work. I would like to treat them with compassion and concern and let them have an adequate income to meet their needs. That is controversial with some people."", 'On tax reform, it is going to take a full year at least to go through a comprehensive analysis of what our tax laws shall be. When the final report is made and when I lend my weight as President, if I am elected, behind it, I am sure a lot of people will oppose what the changes might encompass.', 'Frankel. Including most of the people in your own party in Congress?', 'Governor Carter. Most?', 'Frankel. Well, a lot of them who have been writing the tax laws for 20 years.', 'Governor Carter. I think some of them might I have already discussed this matter, though, with some of the leaders in Congress in both Houses, and they have professed to me they are ready to see this comprehensive approach taken to the tax laws. They have been revised piecemeal now for 40 or 50 years. In most instances when you do a small section of the tax law at a time, the special interest group that gets a favor from that particular aspect of the law can focus its full attention on that section to derive a continued benefit. The general public who might be cheated in the process has very little ability to understand what is going on. And I want to be sure that we have a comprehensive overall complete reformation of the tax laws. I am sure some people are going to get hurt. The ones that get hurt in my opinion, and if I am able to do what I am committed to, will be the ones who have been getting unfair, advantage in the past', ""We have other matters. For instance, in agriculture—I happen to be a farmer—I would favor full production, I don't favor any sort of price supports that would exceed the cost of production. I favor an aggressive sale of American products overseas, including agricultural products, once our own needs are met. Some people disagree with this."", 'In the field of transportation, we have seen a derogation of the quality of our railroads, inadequate attention given to mass transit. We have got too much blocking of streets unnecessarily because of inactivity or weakness on the part of local officials. We are spending enormous amounts of money putting in subways when just off-street parking and one-way streets might solve some of the problems. So I hope to be a strong and aggressive President if I am elected, and I would not fear making tough decisions if necessary. And I hope that I could persuade the doubters in the public, if I am right, that my position was advisable.', 'Monroe. Governor Carter, could you see religion possibly becoming an issue in the campaign coming up, considering that some people have expressed uneasiness about what it would mean to have in the White House a Southern Baptist, a ""born again Christian,"" a man who is not hesitant to talk about his religious views in public?', 'Governor Carter. Well, that, as you know, has been a focal point of some of the news reporters. I have never initiated any issue about religion, but I generally try to answer the questions frankly. And it was a hard thing for me to decide about, whether to respond truthfully about my own religious beliefs or to try to avoid that issue. I finally decided to respond truthfully, because I think the American people ought to know it.', 'We have had a Baptist in the White House before. His name was Harry Truman, and I think he was able to exemplify a compatibility between deep religious beliefs and also public service. I have never had any problem as governor maintaining my very deep and fervent and lifetime religious beliefs as a ""born again Christian"" with my objectivity in dealing with the needs of Georgia\'s people.', ""One of the basic tendencies about this church, in fact one of the reasons it was originally formed, was an insistence absolutely on the separation of church and state. So I don't think this would be an issue that would be very cutting or biting or detrimental to our campaign."", ""Monroe. Chairman Robert Strauss of the Democratic Party, meeting at breakfast with some newsmen this morning, said he felt there might be a potential problem in terms of your candidacy with Catholic voters. I don't know exactly what he had in mind. He may have noted that a Catholic archbishop attacked the Democratic Party platform on abortion just a few days ago. Do you see yourself needing perhaps to address any uneasiness or any possible doubts among Catholic voters?"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I do, and Protestant voters and non-believers and Jews. You know, there are doubts among all kinds of voters. I don't think you can categorize, though, Catholics as one particular group of people to be addressed in a unique or strange way."", 'I personally would have expressed the Democratic Platform plank on abortion a little bit differently. Under the Supreme Court ruling, I will do everything I can as President to minimize the need for abortions. I think abortions are wrong, and I think we ought to have a comprehensive effort made by the President and the Congress, with a nationwide law, perhaps, adequately financed, to give sex instruction and access to contraceptives for those who believe in their use, better adoptive procedures, just to hold down the need for abortion.', ""I think abortions are patently and obviously a result of a failure of contraceptive techniques. So I don't believe there is anything that would divide myself and my campaign from Catholics who themselves, as you know, have a wide diversity of opinions on almost every conceivable issue, including abortion."", 'Monroe. Do you think Mr. Strauss is worrying about that much when he says there is a potential problem among Catholic voters?', ""Governor Carter. There is a potential problem among Catholic voters, but I think that we have met the same problem during the primary successfully, and I believe that you couldn't categorize Catholics as being any sort of uniform bloc, any more than you could Protestants or others. So I think we can deal with them on the issues of the nation, and I think they, as they always have, will respond favorably."", 'Spivak. Governor, I hope I quote you accurately on this. You have said you are conservative on spending but a liberal on human welfare. Is that correct?', 'Governor Carter. Human rights, civil rights, yes, sir.', 'Spivak. Now, I am not quite clear as to just what that means. How can you be liberal on human welfare, which requires the expenditure usually of a great deal of money, and conservative on spending? How are you going to reconcile the two?', 'Governor Carter. I would certainly continue, if I am elected President, with the same attitude toward government management as I did as governor. We maintained a balanced budget, we had strict budgeting rules that I initiated in Georgia. I think for the first time in any government, zero-based budgeting, where we automatically weeded out old and obsolescent programs. We established renewed priorities every year to make sure we spent the money or other resources on things that were of highest need in that particular year. We reorganized the structure of government to make it simple and manageable. We invested state funds on a competitive bid basis, and I think I ran the Georgia government as well as almost any corporate structure in this country is run, in personnel management, transportation, electronic processing, and so forth. At the same time, I think the best investment our nation can make of its resources is in human beings and not in buildings, not in construction. I think that when we spend money on better health care for our people, a better education for our people, that that is a legitimate and a very good investment for the future. But I would each year put into effect the principles of zero-based budgeting, where you reassess priorities on an annual basis. So where we did have a need, it was met.', 'I would expect before my administration would be over, or before the 4 year period passed, that we would have a balanced budget, assuming normal economic circumstances, and that would be something that I would strive for.', ""So I think there is a good balance there, and I don't believe that you can meet human needs or root out injustice or give people a quality of life without a well-managed government with the waste eliminated."", 'Spivak. But Governor, your critics insist that your general rhetoric is anti-Washington, anti-big government, anti-big spending, but your specific social programs that you propose will result in bigger federal government and increased spending. How do you reconcile this? Are you going to spend more on education, more on transportation, more to the cities, more on welfare, more on health, more on housing, more on jobs, more on Social Security? How are you going to keep from getting bigger and spending more?', ""Governor Carter. It would be ridiculous for me to say the government is going to be smaller at the end of the 4 year period than it was when I went into office. But I want to make sure when we do spend our nation's resources we spend on the things that are needed most, to give our people a good quality of life, to let our nation be adequately protected, to enhance the vision of our country within the nations of the world, and so that our people will feel responsible for and a part of their own government And I have never claimed at the end of a 4 year period we would have a smaller government than we have now. We will have a better one, closer to the people, so that when we do spend money or spend our nation's resources, it would be in an optimum fashion."", 'Hoge. Governor Carter, a couple of questions about specifics in the Democratic Platform, which as the nominee-presumptive you have endorsed, at least in general. One has to do with the Humphrey-Hawkins bill. The objectives of that bill have been incorporated in the platform. It would provide for federal job assistance to reduce the unemployment rate to about 3 percent within 4 years.', 'In a recent interview in Time magazine, June 28, your chief economic adviser, Lawrence Kline, said: ""This bill could become an albatross, but no bill goes through Congress without amendments, and I can envision 10 amendments that would make this a good bill.""', ""Now my question is, is that a long way of saying that you don't consider it realistic to reach a 3 percent unemployment rate within 4 years, and at the same time reach your stated objective of an inflation rate of about 3 percent?"", 'Governor Carter. No, the principal expressions of the Democratic Platform are those I expressed personally in a public news meeting in Philadelphia shortly before the Pennsylvania primary. It does include a 3 percent—you left out one word, ""adult"" unemployment—which is in the Democratic Platform and also in my statement, and with the expectation that this would not result in high inflationary pressures, that with a normal 4 to 6 percent annual growth in our national product, which is slightly below what we are experiencing now, that we would have a balanced budget by 1979.', 'I think all those things would be achievable. I think that the Humphrey- Hawkins bill, which has never gotten out of either committee in the House or Senate so far, first, has too much of an emphasis on government jobs. I favor the orientation of government programs into encouraging private employment, not government jobs themselves; and I was concerned at first about how much influence or domination the federal government planners might have on the private sector. I believe in a free enterprise system with a minimum of federal regulation. But I think that the Humphrey-Hawkins bill is coming along in the right direction, and the principles expressed in the Democratic Party platform are those on which I can run and run with enthusiasm.', 'Warren. Governor, to explore a little further your position on the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, even if you attack the adult unemployment and reach a 3 percent rate, which would be about 4.5 percent of the total unemployment, how are you going to avoid what some of your advisers have warned would be a 15 percent inflation? How are you going to keep the federal government out of being an employer of the last resort?', 'Governor Carter. I have about 10 economists who work closely with me and who have for a year or so. They represent a wide spectrum of basic economic philosophy from liberal to quite conservative, and there is a unanimous belief among them based on careful analysis, on econometric computer models and likewise, that we can have down to 3 percent adult unemployment at the end of 3 years or 4 years with a minimum amount of inflationary pressures, still keep the inflation rate down to 4 or 5 percent, with proper government management. My own belief is that this is an accurate analysis. I am not an economist. But I think just common sense shows that one of the major inflationary pressures has been brought about by very high unemployment rates.', 'I have spent a lot of time in recent years studying the history of our country and almost invariably, when the employment rate is high, the inflation rate has been low.', 'One example that I remember specifically was when Harry Truman went out of office after 7 years. We had an unemployment rate less than 3 percent, an inflation rate less than 1 percent and during his 7 year period we had an average surplus of, I think, $2.4 billion rather than deficits, and at the same time the interest rates were low too.', ""I think the FHA loan interest rate then was 4 percent. So I don't think there is any incompatibility between low unemployment and low inflation. I think, in general, they go together."", 'Warren. If you were President today, would you have vetoed the jobs bill that President Ford vetoed?', ""Governor Carter. No, sir, I wouldn't. I think that was a very serious indication of President Ford's insensitivity to people's needs. We have got such a high unemployment rate, for instance, in the construction industry, I think about 14 percent on the average. I read an article in the newspaper this morning that showed among black young people we have an unemployment rate of about 40 percent. You have about $20 billion that goes into extra welfare payments and unemployment payments that could be corrected to some degree by that. This would have provided, I think, about 600,000 jobs in our country; and when you put, for instance, construction workers back to work, there is a very great magnification effect. I think President Ford made a serious mistake in vetoing that bill."", 'I might add one other thing. It was supported overwhelmingly, and I think the veto will be overridden by very conservative Members of the Congress. I think 80 or 90 percent of the Members of the Senate voted for the bill, including the Senators of my own state who are quite conservative on economic affairs.', 'In addition to that, it was well within the budgetary limits that have been established by the Congress in both Houses. It would not have exceeded the budget totals that have already been established by them as reasonable, so I think he made a mistake in vetoing the bill. I would not have vetoed it.', 'Frankel. We have discovered here in New York and in other big cities that what was probably the unwitting net effect of federal policies in creating )obs and :n dealing with poverty and welfare issues has been to concentrate poverty. The jobs have been created, by and large, in America outside the big cities in our recent boom. The poverty and support burdens have been left to the cities. So much so that that in itself has become among policy discussions an issue. That is, do you keep poverty concentrated, or should the net effect of federal policies be to disperse the poor among wealthier communities?', 'Governor Carter. There is where a well-managed government can help, Mr. Frankel, and also a commitment to restore a proper relationship between the President, a governor, and a mayor. And also to restore the proper relationship between the government, business, industry, agriculture, labor, science, education, and other entities in our society.', 'There is no way now to predict what is going to happen next. That would help a great deal.', 'Another thing is we have got too many categorical grant programs. Everything is fragmented so finely that the administrative costs and the confusion and the lack of clear assignment of responsibility almost prevents even a good program from success.', ""Another point I would like to make is this: Even though the President and the Congress might have their hearts in the right place, they might provide a very good program designed for those who need it most, quite often the final delivery of services or opportunities don't get to the people in the ghetto areas and cities who do need the services most, because quite often those who put in applications, who organize, who speak, are much more socially prominent; they are much better organized, they are much more articulate."", 'The ones that need services most quite often are deprived of the very services offered them by Congress. Those things have got to be addressed, I think, in the next administration; and if I am President, that would be a major responsibility that I would assume.', ""Frankel. I think the reverse is also true, that in many places now the jobs exist and the poor can't get at them either because of transportation or zoning laws or ethnic cohesion or whatever the issue is. The question is, would you favor really consciously using federal incentive programs to disperse a larger number of the poor, both to relieve the pressure in the cities and to get people out to where the jobs are now being created?"", ""Governor Carter. I would have to say that wouldn't be my first preference. My first preference would be to orient the job opportunities where the poor people live. I will just take one example to abbreviate the answer; housing programs quite often have been envisioned to build homes where poor people live. A lot of the housing emphasis has gone out into the suburbs, and that means that people who are carpenters, who are bricklayers, who are manual laborers, who live in the downtown areas where housing renovations are most needed, have to go out to the more influential neighborhoods in the suburbs for their jobs. And I think the federal government, working with the local governments particularly, could orient new manufacturing and factory jobs downtown more than they have in the past."", 'We have had too much of a carelessness in the past about putting new factories out in the beautiful outdoor suburban areas. As a farmer, I hate to see this land taken away from agricultural production in the first place, and I think it would be a good thing for the federal government, working with the local governments, to try to orient the jobs where the people live, rather than to move the people away from where they are now, out to where the jobs have been created inadvertently sometimes or inadvisedly.', 'Monroe. Governor Carter, there has been some confusion or uncertainty about your attitude over a period of time on Vietnam. Did you, like a lot of Americans and a good -many political leaders, start out with one attitude toward that war and over a period of time change it?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I did. I think that the attitude of myself and almost everyone that I know who lives in the South was fairly well expressed, for instance, by Senator Dick Russell and others. And I think there was a great compatibility. He always said, and I agreed—although I was just a farmer, I didn't hold public office—that we should never have been in Vietnam; that it was a mistake to get there; that it was a quagmire; that we ought to try to escape. But that, as long as we were there, we ought to bring a quick termination to the war, to back the federal government that had committed us to be involved, and, of course, all of us were misled to some degree by, I think, the misleading statements that the Vietnamization Program was working, that the South Vietnamese favored our positions, that they supported their own government, that this was an attack by Communist forces from the north, that it was not really a civil war among the same people. We all were adversely affected in our judgment, I think, by these claims on the part of our own government in which we trusted. The first time that I spoke out openly to get out of Vietnam, whether we won or lost, was in March of 1971, just a month or two after I became governor, But I think I was compatible with most of the American people who thought it was a mistake to get there, that we ought to get it over with and finally we said, well, let's get out, whether we have won or lost."", 'Monroe. What about your support in April of last year for one last final, huge appropriation of something like half a billion dollars for Saigon not long before Saigon fell? That appeared to some to make you out to be a last-ditch hard-liner on Vietnam.', ""Governor Carter. That was designed, and I think the Congress went along, to let us withdraw from Vietnam as we did, working jointly with our South Vietnamese allies who had fought with us, along with us, for 25 years. There were some who advocated our preemptory withdrawal from Vietnam, abandoning the 20,000 or 30,000 people who had worked very closely with us in leadership positions in Vietnam. I don't think we ever could have escaped from Vietnam without having the South Vietnamese turn on us had we abandoned them and taken a position we wanted to get the Americans out, but we don't want to get out of Vietnam those who have been our allies and friends and joint participants in the war. I favored at that time a quick withdrawal of our troops from Vietnam, completely."", 'Spivak. Governor, most, if not all of the southern states have right- to-work laws and your position on right-to-work laws has been somewhat in controversy. Can you tell us whether you believe in the principle behind right-to-work laws? Namely, that an American worker should not be compelled to join a union in order to hold his job?', ""Governor Carter. I think in general that principle suits me fine if the states prefer it, but I have always taken the position that if the legislature changed the law, I would favor it. I have a hard time deciding, Mr. Spivak, about this particular principle. I grew up in a right-to-work state; I ran for governor with a commitment to the labor leaders and others that I would be glad to sign a repeal of the right-to-work law in Georgia. I didn't want to see the federal government make that decision for the state."", 'I have maintained that position all the way through. But I have now taken a position that I think is compatible—that, as President, if the Congress repeals 14(b), that I would be glad to sign the repeal into law.', 'Spivak. But why, if you approve of the principle and consider it important, why would you sign a law?', ""Governor Carter. I don't see it as an important consideration. I have mixed emotions about it. If I deeply felt that, one way or the other, I would not hesitate to take a strong position on it I don't have any strong belief on one side or the other, and it is something about which I think there is much more of a litmus test on philosophy than there is a deep desire on the part of the labor people, the labor members to pursue. But it would suit me all right if the law stayed as it is now, but I just never have felt strongly about it one way or the other."", ""Spivak. Governor, I don't like to pursue this too far, but since so many people, particularly—your southerners------"", 'Governor Carter. Yes, I know.', ""Spivak. [Continuing.] Think this is a very important issue, why shouldn't you, as leader, take a position and fight for that position, either to get people to go along with you or the other way?"", 'Governor Carter. Well, as I said, I would not object to the law staying the way it is. As you know, we have had some very strong and very aggressive Presidents from other parts of the country. Presidents Truman, Kennedy, and later Johnson from Texas; 14(b) has never been repealed under their leadership.', ""I don't think they ever took a strong executive position that it ought to be repealed. I think their position has been basically the same as mine. If 14(b) is repealed by the Congress, representing all the states, that they would sign it into law; but I don't intend to take it on as a crusade because I don't believe deeply that it is a bad circumstance, nor do I have strong feelings on the other side. It is just one of those issues on which I think the argument is more important than the outcome, and I don't—if I felt strongly about it, or if I become convinced 14(b) should be repealed, I would fight to get it repealed. I just don't feel that way now."", 'Hoge. Governor Carter, on the defense budget, in March of 1975 you were calling for cuts in the defense budget of about $15 billion. By last November, your figure was down to $6 to $8 billion, and now I believe you are using a $5 to $6 billion figure, which is what is in the Democratic platform.', 'If that kind of progression was to continue, by the time you get into office you might be favoring increases in the defense budget rather than cuts. 1 am wondering what evidence you can give now that this figure, a $5 billion cut in the defense budget, is a meaningful one. In other words, where will the cuts come from?', 'Governor Carter. Well, the position I have had ever since I have been a candidate has been consistent. That is to keep a strong defense, which I think is the first priority of any President, the first responsibility of any President, a defense adequate to guarantee the security of our country from the threat of a successful attack or blackmail, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy.', ""At the same time I would eliminate as much as possible the waste that presently exists in the Defense Department. My estimate, after a very careful analysis about a year and a half or more ago, is that this would involve a reduction of $5 to $7 billion, which is about 5 percent. There is not much difference between $6 billion and $5 to $7 billion. I don't know the exact figure."", ""I think we have too many troops overseas, too many military bases overseas. I think we have too many big-shot military officers. I think it is a topheavy personnel structure. I think we build too many military weapons that we don't need. I think the contractual arrangements with defense suppliers have been too loose. We have got too many instructors per student. We have less than two students per instructor in the military. And there has been too much of a spreading out of the Defense Department in areas that I think could best be handled by civilian agencies of government. So these changes that I have described to you would cut back waste equivalent to about 5 percent of the total defense budget, and at the same time give us a tougher, more muscular, more simple, well-organized fighting force. I think the unique responsibility of the Defense Department ought to be the capability to fight if necessary, and with that capability I believe is the best possibility for peace. So ever since I have been a candidate, my position has been what I have just described to you. I consider it to be consistent."", 'Hoge. Governor, on another foreign policy or national security issue: In the event of renewed Middle East hostilities and a resulting Arab oil embargo, you have called for a tough counter-boycott this time, in essence restricting all Western goods and services to the Arab world?', ""Governor Carter. That's right."", 'Hoge. Such a posture was considered in 1973 but it was considered futile because there were so many other markets, East and West, to which Arab nations could turn.', 'I am wondering what makes you think such a tough line would be effective this time around, if there is another time?', ""Governor Carter. Well, now, I think that is getting the cart before the horse. I think if we as a nation take the position ahead of time and the President expresses a position, which I have as a candidate, that if there is another embargo, if there is another attempt at blackmail, which was successful in 1973, that we would instantly consider it a declaration of economic war, and we would respond accordingly, with an embargo against the Arab countries who declared an embargo against us; and that we under those circumstances would not ship them any food, weapons, spare parts for weapons, oil drilling rigs, oil pipes, or anything. I think that is the best way to prevent an attempt at blackmail or another oil embargo. I don't think the advisable thing would be to wait until an embargo occurred and then to respond. I would do it if I said I was going to. But I think this is a good way to prevent an embargo, and I would carry this out."", 'Warren. Another foreign policy statement you have made is that you would encourage better consultation with our allies overseas?', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', 'Warren. Now, in the situation we have just been discussing, a potential oil embargo, would not our allies react the same way they did in 1973 and go their own way with the Arabs, and therefore would not our counterembargo fail for that reason?', ""Governor Carter. It may or may not. I have never tried to speak for all our allies on the response to an Arab embargo that I have just described. We can get along without oil from Arab nations in an emergency if we have to. Some of our allies cannot. Japan could not. They import about 98 percent of their total energy needs, and I would not try to make the allies be compatible with us by force or heavy persuasion. But I think it would be very good for them to know what our position would be if an embargo was declared against our country. This is a serious thing that I would like to avoid. We are now importing between 40 and 50 percent of our total oil needs. But that doesn't mean that all that import comes from Arab countries; and I think it would be good for us, and for the Arabs as well, to know it would be a very serious thing for them economically to declare another embargo against our country."", 'Monroe. We have about 2 minutes.', ""Frankel. Providing you control it, Governor, if you were President, would you use the CIA for subversion abroad to bring down a Communist government we didn't like?"", ""Governor Carter. No, I wouldn't. I think the proper role of the CIA is the role that was spelled out in the original legislation that set up the CIA as a source of information and intelligence. And I would try to have the CIA perform its functions effectively and efficiently and legally for a change, and I would be responsible to the American people for that performance. I would have no objection to congressional oversight. I personally would favor a joint congressional committee rather than independent committees of the two branches of Congress. But I don't see any reason for the CIA through covert means to try to overthrow governments."", 'Monroe. Governor Carter, something you said at the Governors Conference, in press conference a few days ago, suggested to me that you might be considering a trip abroad in the next few weeks. Is that a possibility?', ""Governor Carter. No, I don't intend to go abroad until after the election in November."", 'Spivak. Governor you said the other day that your list of possible Vice Presidential choices has been narrowed to about seven. Have you been able to narrow it any further since then?', 'Governor Carter. Mr. Spivak, I still have three other people that I am going to meet and interview. We have done the most careful, possible preparation for a final decision, consulting with distinguished leaders all over the country who are not considered for Vice President, analyzing the voting records and past attitudes of these candidates, and then personal interviews by staff members representing me, and then personal interviews by me. And I have maintained an open mind deliberately until after all the interviews are over. The last interviews will be conducted tomorrow.', 'Spivak. Will your choice still be from those mentioned, or have you added to your list, or do you feel free to add to your list?', 'Monroe. In about 5 seconds.', 'Governor Carter. The last two people with whom I will meet will be tomorrow, and they will be Senators Church and Stevenson. I will be meeting with Congressman Rodino today, and as far as I know, the Vice President will come from one of those seven people.', 'Monroe. Our time is up. Thank you, Governor Carter, for being with us today on ""Meet the Press.""']"
29,Jimmy Carter ,"July 12, 1976","['Governor Carter. Senator Stevenson and I have had a very productive meeting concerning the role of the Vice President, and we have discussed a great number of matters that you might want to question us further about.\n', ""We were listening to some of the chants outside, and I told Senator Stevenson that I wanted the Vice President to be in charge of women's rights, amnesty, abortion, gun control, Gay liberation, and I told him this at the end of the conversation so he wouldn't leave.\n"", 'I look forward to that relationship with the next Vice President if we are elected.\n', 'We have had a good meeting, and I was extremely grateful to him and his wife, Nancy, for coming.\n', 'We have had a chance to discuss in depth some of his own responsibilities in the Senate concerning energy—he is on the Commerce Committee—and multi-national corporation interest, and economics, perhaps more than anyone else.\n', 'And I have now completed my own personal meetings with those that I have been considering as a recommendation to the delegates.\n', 'I have had a chance earlier to meet with Senator Stevenson, about the time of the Maryland primary, at his home, and so was better acquainted with him than with most of the other persons that I have had a chance to meet within the last week. And this has been a follow up to that earlier conversation.\n', 'We are both of us available now for questions if you would like to ask them.\n', 'Q. When you are considering the Vice Presidential candidate, what do you have in mind exactly?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, as I have said many times, there are three overall considerations. The first one is by far the most important. It is who, in my own opinion, would be the best qualified person to lead this nation if I should not finish out my term and if he should become the President of our country.\n', 'It is undoubtedly the most important decision that I shall make this year, perhaps one of the most important of my whole life.\n', 'And of course the second thing that makes it so important for me to meet with them personally is that I would like to be assured that there is an adequate degree of compatibility between myself and the person who would run with me this year in the campaign and serve with me if we are elected for the next 4 years.\n', 'The other aspect is some sort of balancing to compensate for my own lack of experience.\n', 'One of those characteristics that I do lack is knowledge of the Washington political scene, and that is why I have decided that a Member of Congress would be a better person to serve with me.\n', 'Q. Governor, are you now absolutely finished with your interviews; and will you, as you said yesterday, absolutely select your Vice President from among the seven candidates you have seen?\n', 'Governor Carter. That is my present intention, barring some completely unforeseen circumstance—yes.\n', 'Q. Governor, have you now made up your mind who that selection will be, and if not, have you nan owed it to two, and if you have narrowed it to two, can you tell us who they are?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I haven't narrowed it at all. I have deliberately tried successfully not to narrow it. I have a completely open mind about it. I am going back and reassess my own notes and think about the different persons, and I will spend, I would guess by tomorrow night—it is a guess that I will have narrowed it down, but I have deliberately refrained from any sort of closing of my mind about all of the persons being considered.\n"", ""Q. Senator, there is an impression in the public print, at least, that you are not near the top of the Governor's list. I would like you to tell me where you think you rank.\n"", ""Senator Stevenson. I think that question should go to the Governor. But I might add, I might say, Governor, that hearing that description of the Vice President's duties, I am not sure I want to be on that list.\n"", 'Q. Seriously, it was a serious question, do you think this is just a courtesy that the Governor is extending to you------\n', 'Senator Stevenson. No, sir; of course not.\n', 'Q. There has been a lot of speculation in the press corps, al least, about whether you are a dull campaigner. Was this question raised in your conversation with Governor Carter and was it discussed at all?\n', 'Senator Stevenson. Well, the Governor took great courtesy in not raising that. It has been raised in all my prior campaigns before now, and maybe dullness is what it takes to win.\n', 'Q. Senator, do you believe that a President Carter would offer his Vice President a role that you would like, that it would be worth leaving the Senate for?\n', 'Senator Stevenson. Gentlemen, let me first say that Governor Carter and I have had a most friendly and useful conversation.\n', 'I told the Governor that I expected him to be elected President of the United States, that I felt he would have the greatest opportunity of any President since Franklin D. Roosevelt to unite and to lead forward our country, and that I would serve him as President and as the candidate for the Presidency in any capacity, including the Vice Presidency.\n', 'I am convinced on the basis of this conversation and on the basis of what the Governor has said about that office that he intends to make the Vice Presidency a significant office.\n', 'Q. Governor, can I ask in your deliberation how much weight you are giving the recommendations of the so-called distinguished Americans whom you have contacted as part of this process?\n', 'Governor Carter. Not so much anymore. At the beginning of the process, I would guess in all 20 or 25 different people were recommended to me by those distinguished Americans, who represented every aspect of American society—Members of the House of Representatives, of the Senate, advisory groups who worked closely within the structure in Washington, business and professional leaders, educators, and others who were in a position to judge the quality of prospective leaders of our country.\n', 'From those earlier recommendations and based on my analysis of past voting records and general philosophical attitudes, we started narrowing down the list.\n', 'Since then we have shifted gears to a much more advanced analysis of individual potential nominees, status within the Senate or House, interviews with their peer groups, other Senators who worked with them on committees, we have asked them for health and financial records. Then this final stage which has just been completed, my own detailed personal interviews with the person to arrive at some assessment of our compatibility on major issues and just in a personal way.\n', 'In this latter stage the recommendation of the original group of so-called distinguished Americans played a relatively minor role.\n', 'Q. How significant is it to you that Mayor Daley is supporting Senator Stevenson and is very vocal in that support?\n', 'Governor Carter. Mayor Daley has never suggested to me that I should choose Senator Stevenson. I have read in the news media statements that he has made, expressing his confidence in Senator Stevenson, but in all my conversations with Mayor Daley he has never tried to influence my decision at all.\n', 'I interpret that, and I think accurately, as his own recognition that it is a personal decision for me to make. I understand very clearly the high esteem in which Senator Stevenson is held by Mayor Daley, but he has never tried to persuade me to make a choice.\n', 'Q. Governor, Mayor Daley held a breakfast for you in Chicago. Apparently, Cardinal Cody boycotted the breakfast. Today he said he did so because of your views on abortion. I wonder if you expect to run into any official church opposition on that account?\n', 'Governor Carter. I have never known that Mayor Daley held a breakfast for me. I was not there either.\n', 'Q. It was at the dinner for Michael Howlett, which you addressed, a fundraiser for Michael Howlett, which the Cardinal was invited to attend. Today he issued a statement, it was not any affront against Daley or Howlett but because of your stand.\n', 'Governor Carter. I would certainly not question a statement made by a distinguished leader of the church.\n', 'My position on abortion is very clearly known. I am against abortion. I think abortion is wrong, and I think that within the present ruling of the Supreme Court that everything possible should be done to minimize the need for abortions, and I will do that. But it is not a recent revelation of my position. And if the leaders of the church feel strongly enough that they cannot appear on the same podium with me or platform with me, that is a decision for them to make.\n', 'I honor their posture and hope they will understand mine.\n', 'Q. Governor, when you make your choice for Vice President, you may be anointing the front runner in successive races after you retire from office. Is that a consideration of yours in selecting a Vice Presidential candidate?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. In fact I have discussed that possibility, which is obvious, with almost all the ones that I have met with, the fact that they might very well be my successor, because if something happened to me during my term, or if I should finish out my term, they might very well be the next natural candidate for President or even nominee.\n', 'I feel a very heavy responsibility on my shoulders in that I might very well be helping to choose the next President of our country if I should be successful in being elected, and I recognize that very clearly, yes.\n', ""Q. A follow-up question on criteria. What kind of balance, along with the rumors of the distinguished Senator's alleged dullness, what kind of balance are you trying to strike as far as political philosophy and ability on the campaign trail as a hard hitting politician?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I consider the dullness to be part of compatibility, not part of contrast.\n', ""I think Senator Stevenson's ability and knowledge of the congressional structure, his work in the U.S. Senate, the fact that he comes from a different part of the country than I do, his knowledge of politics from his infancy, as his father's son, and family that served in public life—those kinds of things. I do not think there is any contrast or supplementation to cause a difference of attitude toward basic political philosophy or stands on the politician spectrum.\n"", 'Q. How well did Senator Stevenson stack up in the polling done, in the pairing with you that Pat Caddell did?\n', 'Governor Carter. I do not recall exactly, but I know Senator Stevenson was one of those who did not cut down on my lead. I think that, to be frank, only 2 of the ones out of 14 actually added to the strength that I presently have. I believe one of those was Senator Muskie and the other was John Glenn. It was primarily because of their name recognition factor.\n', 'But that would be very slight differences between them and the position occupied by Senator Stevenson. That was obviously a very preliminary thing and has practically no significance.\n', 'Q. With any of those gentlemen with whom you have had your conversations—there has been some rumor that several have asked not to be considered.\n', 'Governor Carter. I said this morning that we had approached Senator Ribicoff, and he asked not to be considered.\n', 'Q. I mean of those with whom you held conversations so far?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; one of them asked not to be considered.\n', 'Q. Who was that?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would rather not say at this point.\n', 'Q. So you are now down to six?\n', 'Governor Carter. That is correct This will be the last question.\n', 'Q. What procedure will you use to make your decision and how are you going to set aside the time for it?\n', ""Governor Carter. It will be a personal decision of mine. I don't know how to describe the procedure, unless just the thought process.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
30,Jimmy Carter ,"July 12, 1976","['Governor Carter. Senator Church and I have had a chance this morning to discuss at length matters concerning the relationship between the President and the Vice President, foreign affairs in particular, on matters concerning his work on the Interior Committee, the secret of the campaign when he beat me so bad in some states. And we have had a very fruitful discussion, as has been the case with the others who met with me. And as we both understand it, there is no obligation on his part or mine concerning these meetings.', 'It has been a very constructive thing for me.', 'In spite of his youth, he has had, as you know, long experience in the Senate, particularly in the field of foreign affairs. And he has been very helpful to me this morning in understanding what the relationship ought to be between the Vice President and the President, between the Vice President and the Cabinet Members, and some of his own commitments of long standing concerning correcting the problems that exist in the bureaucracy in Washington. We have had a productive and fruitful meeting.', 'We are now prepared to answer your questions on our meeting this morning.', ""Q. Governor Carter, do you share Senator Church's deep concern over excesses in the American intelligence community; and if so, how would you state that?"", 'Governor Carter. Yes; I do. Throughout the campaign when this question has been put to me—and it came often as you can well imagine because of the high publicity concerning CIA and FBI investigations—I expressed my concern about it.', 'I think we need a good, competent intelligence network. We now have, I think, seven different agencies—I think that is probably too many to be deriving information from. I think there is a legitimate need for the President and the other leaders in Washington to have accurate information on which to predicate decisions concerning national defense and foreign matters. I think in addition to effectiveness, the CIA should function, for instance, in a legal way. I would want to be personally responsible to the American people as President for the proper performance of the intelligence-gathering network of our nation. And I would welcome a sharing of responsibility with the Congress.', ""I personally think that the oversight committee of Congress ought to be a joint committee. That is my preference. I think that's a decision for Congress to make."", ""And the last point: I don't think the CIA or any other agency representing our country ought to be involved in overt efforts to overthrow or modify the character of governments of foreign countries."", 'I think collection of information ought to be the primary role of the CIA.', ""Q. Does Senator Church's exposure of abuses by the CIA and the FBI create a problem for you in terms of possible selection of Church as Vice President?"", ""Governor Carter. No, sir; even before the last primaries were concluded, we had conducted nationwide polls concerning myself versus either Mr. Ford or Reagan; and as a part of that polling effort, which I didn't know about at the time, Patrick Caddell and Hamilton Jordan included a pairing of myself and other possible persons to be Vice President—of course Senator Church was one of those—and among them, I have forgotten how many, 14 or 15 persons who were paired with me, Senator Church was at or near the top as far as being an asset to the ticket politically."", 'And I think that his extremely great success in the primaries of which he did enter as a candidate showed that even in very conservative states like Nebraska his role in the CIA investigations was certainly not a detriment politically, but it was an asset', 'Q. May we ask Senator Church a question?', 'Governor Carter. Of course.', 'Q. Coming away from this meeting with Governor Carter this morning, after some of your predecessors have met with him in Plains for a half day or more, do you have the impression that you are really in the running or that this was a courtesy extended to you?', 'Church. Well, I have no idea. I think that Governor Carter is seriously considering several, and he has been good enough to include me in that group.', 'Q. What will be your assets if you were asked to be on the ticket? What would you bring to the campaign?', 'Church. I think that that is for Governor Carter to judge. I did go out as a Presidential candidate, I went to the people, and late in the campaign I won some primaries. The Governor and I got acquainted on the campaign trail. That is the best place to get acquainted.', 'That is the best place to demonstrate whatever you can bring to the ticket.', 'Q. Senator, do you and the Governor have any major disagreements? ... you said in the past you knew of no major issues that separated the two of you. You have now had a good head-to-head meeting. How do you feel on this now?', ""Church. I didn't discover any this morning. It seems to me that we are compatible in our viewpoint, both with respect to American domestic and foreign policy."", ""Q. Governor, you seem to be stressing Senator Church's background in foreign affairs, his interest in that field. That would tend to support those suggestions, very hard suggestions, that Senator Church is being considered as a possible Secretary of State in a Carter Administration. I wonder if you would comment on that?"", 'Governor Carter. Well that is an erroneous assumption. The meeting was arranged within the last few days. When Mr. Kirbo went to meet with Senator Church, he pointed out that he and his family had planned for a long time to go to the Caribbean for a vacation. And during the early part of last week he was not in the country.', 'I told the news media in the past that the order of my meeting with these leaders had no significance at all. Senator Jackson specifically requested that we wait until we get up here. And Senator Church indicated he would come back from the Caribbean—he went to the Bahamas—if necessary, but this was his only chance to be with his family. So we tried to accommodate his inclinations. The order of sequence has no significance at alt', 'Q. Governor, there is a report this morning that Senator Glenn has passed along tax returns to you that indicate an extensive use of tax shelters.', 'Was that checked out by Arthur Anderson; and if so, what conclusions did you reach?', ""Governor Carter. Yes; it was checked out by an accounting firm, I believe, and I am not sure which accounting firm checked the return, but I think that—I am sure there was no detrimental aspect to the way that Senator Glenn's income tax returns were approached. I don't feel inclined to reveal the details about it, but I can tell you that he paid an awful lot of taxes, and the tax shelter and the assessment made by the accounting firm was that it was perfectly proper—in fact, there was a very conservative approach on his part to the amount of tax money that he did pay, that he could have cut corners, but he did not."", 'Q. Governor, how would you describe the delicacy or sensitivity of con* ducting what amounts to a job interview with Senators; and if Senator Church would address himself to that kind of position also.', 'Governor Carter. That is a hard thing for me to address, but I thought about this a lot, I devised in my own mind the best procedure that I could conceive to get advice from people throughout the country, in whose judgment I trust, as a first step. The normal conversation was, if you were in the position of choosing a Vice President as your running mate, whom would you choose?', 'And quite often the persons that I contacted, either senior members of the Congress or those who worked closely with Congress otherwise, would say, ""My own preference would be so and so, but I think the other two persons mentioned would be good.""', 'I would say: In alphabetical order, how do you feel about another five or six?', 'And in addition to that, Mr. Kirbo, who is speaking for me, the only one speaking for me, met and talked with many others who were not being considered for Vice President.', 'Following that, and after studying in some detail the past records of those persons, I finally decided on seven people that in my own mind are the best qualified persons to be President or would be compatible with me, and as another fact would supplement my own weaknesses and so forth.', 'Let me say one other thing. I think that in my opinion, if I were still the Governor of Georgia, and I was invited to meet with a potential Presidential nominee as a prospective Vice President, I would consider it as an honor and not as an insult.', 'I might say that the meetings have been voluntary. We have only asked one person who said that he did not want to be considered, and that was because of other reasons, not because of the interview procedure.', 'I think it is a good procedure, and I think I will make the best judgment.', ""Church. I don't know of any other way for the nominee of the Democratic Party to determine who his running mate should be than the way—or no better way than the way that Governor Carter has chosen. It seems to me that he must make a judgment on the capacity of the man he chooses to serve as President, if that would happen, and also the extent to which the running mate might make a contribution in the campaign, and afterwards, the administration."", ""And this seems to me to be a method calculated to provide those answers, and I am glad that I was included, whatever the Governor's final decision may be, that he will be looking for the strongest possible nominee."", 'Governor Carter. With the exception of Senators Muskie and Jackson, I have never known these men before, except I had met just in passing Senator Church on the campaign trail, and Senator Glenn 7 or 8 years ago when he was working with RC Cola. I had no other way to get to know them.', 'Q. Now that we are down to that, why are they all Members of Congress?', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question. I did not deliberately try to exclude mayor and governors. They were in the original group of 15 or so that were recommended to me by persons, there were mayors and governors included."", 'But one of the aspects that might be a factor is that I feel a need to know more about the Washington political procedure. This is an aspect of my own experience that is missing. That would be a factor.', 'Q. CIA Director George Bush flew up to Hershey to brief you during the Governors? Conference, Can you give us some indication of the parameters of that briefing, and did you discuss it with Senator Church this morning?', 'Governor Carter. I did not discuss that briefing with Senator Church. I had asked the President about 3 weeks ago for briefings following the convention and asked him to let me know under what basic rules those briefings could be provided. When I called him back about a week later at his request, I was informed that George Bush would like to meet with me personally to tell me the procedures to be used following the convention. And that was the substance of the meeting.', 'I was not given a briefing on Angola or Rhodesia or other sensitive spots around the world, but I was given procedures to be followed for those briefings. The first major briefing will be, I would say, within a week or 10 days following the convention itself, and a designated person from the CIA, a professional who has been there 25 or 30 years, will come down, probably to Plains, to meet with me for possibly a full day.', 'And what I am going to ask the CIA is just to brief me on matters that are not of public record that might be important for me to know as I discuss foreign relations.', 'Q. Was there discussion about any of the potential candidates with CIA Director Bush?', 'Governor Carter. No, sir. That was never mentioned.', 'Q. Verification of something you said a moment ago------', 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir.', 'Q. Did you say there would have been eight people that you would be meeting with, except that one person declined to accept the invitation?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir.', ""Q. Of the eight finalists, who did not want or wasn't interested in seeking it, can you tell us who that was?"", 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir. That was Senator Ribicoff. And when we discussed it with Senator Ribicoff, Mr. Kirbo did, he said he did not want to be considered. . . . This will be the last question.', ""Q. In your meeting with Senator Church this morning, since you didn't have any major differences, what impressed you most of all the things he had to talk about?"", 'Governor Carter. That is a hard thing for me to answer. But one is his youthful approach to controversial issues, despite his youth, he has been in Congress for a long time. He is very conversant with matters of government.', 'Q. What field------', 'Governor Carter. Innovative approach toward matters that are controversial. I think there are a lot of Senators that would not have been willing, particularly with aspirations to be President, to handle the CIA question. It could have been a fatal blow to aspirations for higher office.', 'I think his early opposition to Vietnamese war showed a great deal of courage, particularly representing a state like Idaho where his views would probably not have been most popular in the state.', 'But I have a great admiration for him, and I also have observed very carefully, when he and I met on the campaign trail, that he often beat me. And I have a respect for his political philosophy.', 'Thank you very much.']"
31,Jimmy Carter ,"July 15, 1976","['Jordan. In mid-April, I think on the 17th, we presented a general kind of outline of the processes that the Governor might follow, options in terms of selecting a Vice Presidential running mate. On June 2, we presented him with a very complete list of all people who might be considered, Members of Congress, Democratic mayors and governors, with some arbitrary evaluations that resulted in him being able to reduce the number of people being considered from, I think, 300 or 400, to what, Jimmy—he went from there to 24.', 'Q. State the number again?', 'Governor Carter. There were several hundred. That included people like college presidents and leaders in business and heads of nonprofit organizations.', ""Q. Was the list prepared at the Governor's request or by staff initiative?"", 'Jordan. Which list?', 'Q. The June 2 list. Did he ask for a list?', 'Jordan. After Pennsylvania—before Pennsylvania, on April 17, I gave Jimmy this memorandum outlining the processes and between Pennsylvania and June 2, Mr. Kirbo and I and the Governor started talking about this thing that we hoped we are going to have to do and that resulted in my writing the memo that I gave to Jimmy on June 2 that carried it the next step.', 'At the same time, back in May, Pat Caddell and I had the brilliant idea of polling to see which of these guys would help us. We found out none of them would help us, and none of them would hurt us.', 'The Governor was really not involved or informed of that until the results were known.', 'Governor Carter. Until the article came out.', 'Jordan. I think somebody wrote it in the Globe.', 'Governor Carter. I think the effort there—I was a little bit aggravated when I discovered that the poll had been done. But what they tried to do was not to select 14 specific people necessarily, but just 14 different kinds of people to illustrate the relative public acceptance of them. They were all good people by the way. All of us felt that the results of the poll were preliminary and that any immediate asset or liability would be overcome in the campaign itself.', 'Most of them detracted more than they helped at that point.', 'Q. Detracted, you said most detracted?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, most of them detracted. One of the several things— Pat can explain this better than I—but he took just theoretical Republican tickets and ran myself and one particular other person against the ticket and saw whether it added or detracted from my rating against the Republican alone.', 'Q. Was Senator Mondale in this list of 14?', 'Caddell. Yes.', 'Q. How did he finish?', 'Governor Carter. Go ahead and tell.', ""Caddell. I don't remember. He was not very well known. In fact in the group he was one of the least well-known candidates."", 'We made a judgment at that time, given his recognition levels that were so low, the significance in terms of the unknown was not very great, and really not very helpful.', 'Governor Carter. I do remember that Glenn and Muskie were well at the top and Mondale well at the bottom.', 'Q. Is this the poll you referred to this morning when you said it held one person higher------', ""Governor Carter. Yes. If I remember correctly, Mondale's recognition factor was something like 30 percent. Seventy percent of the people didn't know who he was."", 'Caddell. Of the 30 percent, we considered only about half of that to be really able to recognize who he really was.', 'Governor Carter. At that time we were not oriented to Mondale at all.', 'Q. Did you also do a poll at this time on the Catholic problem? Is that in that poll?', 'Governor Carter. I think Pat could answer the questions about the polls better than I. I generally just receive the summaries of polls. Only on request do I get a complete poll to take home and study.', 'Caddell. We were already doing some national questions on image and things of that nature. Hamilton and I in our brilliant move decided to really add this stuff on top of it. That was a survey to make a strengths and weaknesses and perceptions test.', 'Essentially the survey was geared to doing that, measuring those qualities; Governor Carter versus any one of the potential Republicans.', 'Q. On that point, too, a followup question. Did you do subsequent polling on any or all of these, and most particularly did you do any very recently?', 'Caddell. There is a rumor floating around about a survey done this last weekend which is not true. A couple of people asked me on the floor about that. We did not do any surveys in the last week.', 'We did go back about a week after we completed these results simply to recheck some of the interviews we did on a couple of things.', 'Q. What date are you roughly talking about?', 'Caddell. I would say it would be about the 17th or so. It was rough reinterviews to cover a couple of points we had not done on some subjects.', 'Q. Was this a new area you had to go back and recheck?', 'Caddell. We had some political questions we wanted to look at in reinterviewing, and we also took a look at a couple of names.', ""Governor Carter. I think we added a few names by the way. I said why don't you add a few more."", 'Q. You said that you made one choice after the Ohio primary. This was right after the Ohio primary. Did you make one choice on the 9th and another choice------', 'Governor Carter. I never closed my mind and said this is my person. But had I been required at that moment to have the press conference that I had this morning, I would have chosen different people.', ""I am not going to name those people. I don't think it would be appropriate now."", 'I might later on for historical purposes.', 'Q. In that connection some of us thought that the inevitable order of such a choice would be Church to Glenn to Muskie to Mondale. Is that wrong?', 'Governor Carter. That would be in the framework of rationality, but I would not want to------', 'Q. That was not the order?', ""Governor Carter. I said that would be within the framework of rationality, but I wouldn't want to confirm or deny it specifically. You can interpret that circumlocution any way you want to."", 'Q. It sounds like the Governor of California.', 'Governor Carter. I was with him this morning.', 'Q. About that meeting this morning, you did not mention Walter Mondale at all in that meeting with the California delegation. Was that an oversight or what?', ""Governor Carter. If I didn't, it was an oversight."", 'I had discussed Senator Mondale with Brown very thoroughly and also with the two Senators about Mondale in the campaign and asked them when they did their own polling, particularly Senator Tunney, that they tried to identify areas in California where he would be most helpful.', 'Q. Governor, could you tell us something about your interview with Senator Mondale and what sort of things you thought you were going to see and maybe what sort of impression that you made?', 'Governor Carter. Do you all have any other questions about this particular sequence first?', 'Q. On the questionnaires, were the questionnaires standard questionnaires or did each of the Senators and Congressmen who got the questionnaires get a tailor-made questionnaire from Mr. Kirbo?', 'Kirbo. Yes, I left one with them.', 'Governor Carter. You said the same questionnaire with each one of them.', 'Q. There was a standard form? Because we heard, for example, Senator Glenn got a shorter form than somebody else.', 'Kirbo. He thought he did. What happened in the preparation of these, the first page was some items used to refresh my memory and points I wanted to make before I gave them the questionnaire. Page two started with the questions.', 'So I left Senator Glenn only beginning with page 2, and the staff ran me down later on in the day and said I left off the first page. He thought he missed something.', ""I explained to them that they didn't have to fill out the questionnaire and suggested that they might want to assemble the information and have it ready if they preferred to keep it until they thought that they had a better chance of being selected or if for any reason keep it for a while, I would pick it up later."", 'I left it entirely to them as to whether they wanted to sign it and told them it would not affect their consideration if they elected not to reveal all of the information requested. That was the sort of thing that might have been on page one.', 'Q. Mr. Kirbo, we had heard that Senator Muskie had first declined to complete the questionnaire.', ""Kirbo. That is not correct. He didn't decline it. I just went to Senator Muskie and Ribicoff at the Governor's direction, after I had gone to the others, and asked them if they would be willing, if they desired to be considered, and I didn't ask them to fill out a questionnaire, and told them if they desired to be considered, we had the questionnaire, and had Senator Muskie look at it and asked him how long it would take to assemble that information if the Governor desired to select him. He told me that he had no objection to answering those questions and could assemble it in a fairly short time and that he was interested."", 'I was reading a paper on the plane coming back to Washington a day or two later, and I saw in the paper where the staff said I failed to leave a questionnaire. I assumed maybe they wanted one.', 'So I went by his office and carried it, and he filled it out, and I came back and picked it up later.', 'Governor Carter. Have the questionnaires been handed out?', 'Powell. We handed them out downstairs this morning.', ""Q. I understand someone in the Carter campaign called Senator Church's aides on the weekend before last and asked where Senator Church would be located. And as I understand it, they were told. And then no call came for a period of 3 to 4 days. I do know for a fact that they were epileptic at Church headquarters in Washington about that."", 'Governor Carter. I was told that Church was going to the Bahamas with his family. I really tried to accommodate the scheduling and the desires of the Senators involved.', 'I was a little embarrassed at first about asking him to come to Plains. In every instance I left that up to them. I offered to come to Washington or to meet them at the convention or to have them come to Plains.', ""I did not call Senator Church because Mr. Kirbo told me he had a long term schedule with his family to go to the Bahamas on a sailboat or something. I didn't want to interrupt that. So that is why I delayed that request."", 'Kirbo. He said he could get back up here mighty fast if we needed him and that I would find out how to locate him through his staff.', 'Q. The questionnaire seems a very thorough one. How do you know they were telling the truth?', ""Governor Carter. I don't remember the details of the questionnaire, but Mr. Kirbo followed up the questionnaire with a very careful and detailed, and I think lengthy discussion with them. And some of the questionnaires that were given to them were substantiated by documents, financial status, previous income tax returns, and then to get to the point that has not been discussed yet, we also asked some of the newspaper leaders in Atlanta, in each instance to contact on a confidential basis news media leaders in the states involved, and to give us a summary of any detrimental comments that have been made about the persons and the assessments of whether it had substantiation or not."", ""My presumption has been that the persons did make truthful statements. In fact some of the statements made on the questionnaire may or may not have been complimentary to themselves. I can't prove everything that was put was true, but I believe it was."", 'Q. I just wondered, for example, where you asked if there ever had been a problem with income taxes or if there was anything in their background to be detrimental, you had a cross-check?', ""Governor Carter. Yes. I think that they were very meticulous about that I believe more than one said their income tax returns had been checked by IRS. I think mine has been checked almost every year, which I don't object to. I don't think there was any inclination on their part to mislead me or make a false statement."", 'Obviously had we detected the slightest degree of evasion there, there would have been possibly a fatal increment in the decision.', 'Q. Did you use any outside people, investigators or accountants routinely with these people?', 'Governor Carter. I will let Mr. Kirbo answer that. The answer is yes.', 'Kirbo. A questionnaire was designed to bring out any problems. After you get answers from the questionnaire or—either information from other sources or from what I gathered from the interview with him, there would be some problem—for instance if you had a net worth statement or you had income tax returns that I thought areas needed to be worked out, that I would get an accountant to give us a memorandum on his version of it.', 'Some of my partners in the law firm are tax lawyers. I would ask them questions and go over it with them. And then where it was necessary to check partners or associates or substantial contributors or any person in connection with it, I thought it was a briefing, I had someone, usually two sources, check on the person and see what sort of reputation he had and what business he was in and that sort of thing so we could determine whether the person that this senator or congressman was associating with was a man of good character or might cause some problem, political problem later on.', 'Governor Carter. I would like to add one thing. All of this was done with the consent and knowledge of the person being considered.', 'Q. Can you tell us the news media leaders that you asked to help you?', 'Governor Carter. Did they say it was OK?', ""Powell. I don't think I would mention it, the ones I talked to, I prefer not to."", 'Governor Carter. I think we can say it was executive officers and others in Atlanta newspapers.', 'Q. Were any reporters or writing editors involved?', 'Governor Carter. They were people that had personal relationships with other papers and who had counterparts in other papers and calls basically posed general questions about this person or that person. ""What do you think?""', 'Q. Were they writing people though, were they publishers?', 'Governor Carter. They were executives.', 'Kirbo. Those were executives. They were a combination of both. They were writers, and in addition to that, I talked—I interviewed several reporters on a rather broad scale and took notes and submitted that to Governor Carter. Every time a reporter would interview me, I would interview him on those questions.', 'Governor Carter. Also during the whole process there were quite a number of uncomplimentary statements made or allegations of impropriety, and we very carefully checked out all of those.', ""As I said this morning, I am sure Mr. Kirbo will confirm this, because we talked about it, on all six persons, seven including Congressman Rodino who did not want to be considered finally, there was' no revelation of any factor that would have been detrimental to them had they run for Vice President. There was nobody eliminated from consideration."", 'I had thought earlier, just in a tentative way, that out of six or seven people a couple of them would have something that would make it difficult to run with them. That was not the case, and I was surprised at that.', 'Q. Governor, what are you going to do with the files on those that were not successful? This gives you rather complete information on persons who are not in your administration.', 'Governor Carter. I have those files in my own home in Plains in a secure place. I had never thought about it, they might want them back, I would be glad to return them. There is only one copy of them.', 'Kirbo. I told them we would return them.', 'Q. It seems that the questionnaires and this part of the process was, as you say, looking to see if there were detrimental information of a personal or financial nature. That probably was a difficult process. But the other parts might have been more difficult, assessing their leadership and political qualities and so forth. How did you go about that?', ""Governor Carter. That was primarily my responsibility. Mr. Kirbo did talk to—I am not going to start naming names, I don't want to be exclusive—people like Tip O'Neill, the Speaker of the House, Senator Mansfield and others on down in the elected hierarchy of the Congress who know these people well, and there were long detailed conversations about all the persons."", 'In addition I talked to, I would say, 30 or 40 people whose names I think would all be known to you, about their ideas concerning the Vice President.', 'And my question—I developed a formal and fairly standard routine saying : If you were called upon to select a Vice President, what persons would you consider? And they would ordinarily give sometimes one, most often two or three names, in an order of priority, and I would say among five or six other names that I will give you alphabetically, would you tell me how you feel about them?', 'We used three measurements of qualification. One was the ability to govern.', 'The second was general reputation, integrity, character.', 'The third one was any comments about the political aspects of their placement on the ticket.', ""That was one of the major sources. I found that there was only one exception, but out of 30 or 40 people I never had anyone say I don't want to participate. The one person by the way who did not want to give me specific names was John Gardner, who heads up Common Cause."", 'I called and talked to him. He said he would like to talk to me. After 4 or 5 days, I called him back and he gave me help on the characteristics that would be important and so forth, but he said he thought it was inappropriate for him in his position to name names.', 'With that one exception, the other people I called did give me their recommendations. That was one way.', 'Of course I had other people of my staff, Stu Eizenstat in particular, to prepare for me two very thick notebooks about that thick [indicating] describing general background and characteristics, record in previous election, rating by different groups, so forth, on the candidates.', 'Q. This is on the final seven or the bigger list?', 'Governor Carter. This was on a bigger list because I never told Stu Eizenstat who the final seven were.', ""Q. One of these persons was almost surely Senator Humphrey. In view of your selection of Senator Mondale, I wonder if you would share with us in just that case some of Senator Humphrey's thoughts and how important they were to you?"", ""Governor Carter. No; I won't do that. But I would certainly confirm that Senatoi Humphrey was one of those that was interviewed by Mr. Kirbo, not by me. It was just coincidence. You are perfectly willing to go and talk to Senator Humphrey about that. I don't want to reveal how he might have ranked Mondale in relation to others."", 'Q. On that, how important in your own thinking were the views of Senator Humphrey in the decision that you reached?', ""Governor Carter. Well, important, but there was a very remarkable pattern that developed after I talked to 30 or 40 people. I think Mr. Kirbo would confirm this. We didn't detect any additional persons who were named. There weren't any startling surprises. And every now and then, there would be one person who would recommend a name we weren't considering deeply. But there was a remarkable pattern to it. That was important to me. And then out of those interviews with Senators Humphrey and Mansfield and others, as far as I am concerned they are confidential, they are welcome to reveal what they said if they want to, we extracted not only compliments, but also concerns."", ""Then this was all done really almost exclusively by me and Mr. Kirbo. I didn't want other people to be involved in it."", 'If Mr. Kirbo picked up a concern, he would share it with me and vice versa.', 'Then as we had subsequent conversations with people on a confidential basis, we would cross-check those who had knowledge of that characteristic of whether or not there was an agreement on that defect. So it was a very careful, methodical thing. I kept all the records, made notes, and Mr. Kirbo did too.', ""I don't want to reveal what any particular person said about another person."", 'Q. Could we focus on Senator Mondale a bit?', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', ""Q. You listed all the 'various categories, but 1 wonder if you would be a little more detailed about what were the things that turned your mind finally to Senator Mondale. Were there specific things that you constantly kept coming back to that finally tipped you over in his direction?"", ""Governor Carter. It is hard for me to answer that without comparing him with other candidates in a detrimental way to them. I don't have any doubt that I made the right choice."", ""Sometime in the distant future I might feel like I made a mistake. I don't think I shall. But when he came to Plains, I had never known him before. I had just met him; once I testified simultaneously with him in a congressional hearing on Title IV(a), and I had seen him. He came down once to make a very brief breakfast speech on behalf of Andy Young. I came and made the first speech and left. I didn't even hear Senator Mondale's speech."", 'I had not known him. When he came, I was prepared and he was extremely well prepared. I asked him a question: What did he think the relationship ought to be between a Vice President and a President, and he knew what he wanted to say. He had carefully considered it. He knew that relationship.', 'I asked him: What do you think the relationship ought to be between the Vice President and the Cabinet?', 'He had a very thorough and carefully considered answer.', 'The same thing about foreign affairs, diplomatic meetings, the same thing with interrelations with Congress.', ""He had thought about nuances of difference between a Vice President's impact in dealing with the Senators and the impact that might be contrasted with the House of Representatives. I learned a lot from him. I felt a sense of ease with him."", ""He has obviously, as he said this morning, read my major speeches and he was familiar with what I stood for. I didn't know what his stand was—I had a statement from Stu Eizenstat about his stand on busing, for instance. Stu had said Senator Mondale is not for forced busing, but he has consistently opposed legislative attempts to circumvent constitutional provisions."", 'When I asked him the question, he gave me the same answer. He was very consistent with his past record. I had been involved with him in a nonpersonal way in dealing with problems of day care centers and the elimination of Title IV(a) programs under Nixon, and what the strength ought to be for revenue sharing for state and local government.', 'I had respected him from a few telephone calls I had while governor. I felt his judgment was good. He is young, but he is experienced. I think he has approached the other members of the Senate with a superb degree of compatability. There was a remarkable acceptance of Senator Mondale, approval of him, among both the liberal and the very conservative members of the U.S. Senate.', 'And one thing that made an impression on me was that he had been able to work harmoniously with Russell Long in the Finance Committee and also with Senator Muskie on the Budget Committee.', 'As you know, quite often those two committees have been in contention with one another. In both areas apparently, he had done a good job.', ""So I don't know exactly how to express it, it was a subjective analysis and a subjective judgment."", ""Q. Was the process, Governor, though, a positive one or did you eliminate the others because there was something you decided you didn't want?"", 'Governor Carter. No; it was a positive one. It really was.', ""Q. There wasn't something about each of the others that turned you away?"", ""Governor Carter. No; I can't really say that that was the case. That was a relative degree of acceptance, but I think had I chosen any one of those persons, the nation would have accepted------"", ""Q. Is there anything in the personal interviews you had with any of your men that tended you to think perhaps they would not be good running mates for you or something perhaps more negative than the interviews that you didn't find in your session with Mondale?"", ""Governor Carter. I have to say frankly that he came out on top. I've already demonstrated that with the press conference announcement this morning."", 'I could have run with a feeling of equanimity with any of them.', 'Q. I have two questions. Did you similarly poll your own staff for their recommendations?', ""Governor Carter. I didn't have to."", 'Q. 1 understood that at Sea Island you did sit down at one point and go around with them.', 'Governor Carter. The only poll I ever took was that Amy prepared a ballot at Sea Island. She distributed them to my sons and my daughters-in-law and my wife. That was the only poll that was taken. I encouraged the staff members to be aggressive in their own recommendations, and Hamilton was forceful in his espousing of a person.', 'I had the feeling Mr. Kirbo favored a different person. Amy is still the only unreconciled one in the family. Her preference is John Glenn. I have talked with her about it since lunch, since 12, and she still has got to be convinced that I made the right choice.', 'Q. Why do you favor such young polltakers?', ""Governor Carter. I didn't initiate that poll. Amy just did it."", 'Q. Can you tell us what the results of that poll was?', 'Governor Carter. Well, there was a preference for Senator Church then.', 'Q. In your family?', 'Governor Carter. That was right after the elections and before we started the process.', 'Q. Governor, in your talk with Senator Mondale, does anything of the small town background, the fact that his father was a minister, did that affect the chemistry at all?', ""Governor Carter. I don't know about the chemistry, but it did affect my preference. Had he come from a metropolitan area and had, say, been a Catholic, that would have probably have been an asset. But, no, I don't------"", 'Q. Maybe I am not stating it well.', ""Governor Carter. I can't describe the chemistry of it. I felt at ease with him. I didn't feel ill at ease with any of them."", 'I think everyone with whom I met would probably confirm the feeling; they may have been a little tense when they came to Plains and came here. I really felt when we had concluded the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 hour interviews, that they went away feeling compatible.', 'Q. This subject brings up to me one of the major political considerations for some of us. Thai is the question, the Catholic question. Did you change your views as time went on about the importance of the Catholic voters, and did you wish at any point that you had broadened your list to include possibly more Catholics from which to choose?', 'Governor Carter. No.', 'Q. This did not increase in importance in the last week or two?', 'Governor Carter. No.', 'Q. Can you give us a little of your thinking about that?', ""Governor Carter. I think it would be better to restrict the question. I don't want to cut you off."", ""Let me answer questions about the selection process. My answer is accurate. That is a factor. I said earlier this week, when I came down with one of the tickets, that I cannot balance a ticket geographically between me and the Congress, and between aggressive campaigners and more dormant campaigners and in a religious way, I just can't balance the ticket in all the different ways. I finally just eliminated that process."", 'I came to the conclusion, as I said this morning, that if I chose a person that I felt would be the best President or Vice President, regardless of race, or regardless of location, background or religion, that I was making the right political decision. I still feel that way.', 'Q. Governor, I was just going to essentially ask the same question relating to chemistry. Those of us who saw you and all the prospects, 1 think it seemed to most of us that the chemistry looked like it worked with you and Mondale down in Plains, much more so than anybody. He was loose. You were loose. You didn\'t feel, I hate the word ""vibes""—it looked like you had good vibes with Mondale, perhaps better than any of the others.', 'Governor Carter. That is hard to say. I think if somebody would ask me with which one did you feel most at home, I would probably have said Glenn even 5 minutes ago. Glenn kind of fit in with our family and we had a good relationship.', 'Q. What about wives, compatibility with wives?', ""Governor Carter. I didn't have much to do with their wives, except they did come in, two or three of them, and stay during the interview that I had with the Senators. That was a good—if you know their wives, they are all superb women and very fine politicians, but I really can't say honestly that had anything to do with it."", 'Q. Just going in your general thought process on this, when did you sort of feel Mondale coming to the top, rising to the surface? When did you begin to get the feeling that that would be your choice?', 'Governor Carter. It was after I got up here that I began to feel that.', 'Q. What were the primary factors there?', ""Governor Carter. I can't identify any one particular factor. I hate to answer completely frankly, but I don't want to say anything detrimental about the others, but there was a kind of organic change within my staff members, my key advisers, my family, toward Mondale. I think if you could plot it on a graph, the number of people out of 20 who gave me continuing advice, the number who supported Mondale, it would have just gone up steadily. That may have been influenced by a number of factors. I don't know exactly what it was."", 'But I made the decision. I might say this. The last 3 or 4 days there was no strong advocacy positions put forward to me. I think Hamilton, Piat and Jody and everybody else felt it was time for them to back off an let me make my own decision. At first they were very aggressive in pursuing their preference. I think they saw I was having a hard time with it and they backed off and let me make the decision.', 'Q. The stories that leaked out about Muskie and Mondale, did that represent division within the staff rather than any ranking within your own mind?', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that. There has never been a single person to whom I expressed a preference, never. I avoided that. There is nobody in the world closer to me than Charles Kirbo and I never expressed my preference to him, and I didn't tell Mr. Kirbo who my choice was this morning until after I had already called Mr. Mondale. I told my wife only about 2 minutes before I placed the call because she had specifically requested that I not tell her as she was interrelating with the news media."", ""She wanted to be able to tell them truthfully that she didn't know."", 'Q. You had seven press conferences in a row with your prospective nominees. In each case you stood aside and listened while the rather aggressive members of the press asked some questions which were fielded.', 'I wonder whether in listening to those questions, you were also turning over in your mind how this person as a potential Vice President might react under those kinds of pressures and whether that was a factor in your decision?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, it was. I thought it was a good part of the learning process.', ""Q. Governor, you mentioned this morning you were anxious that Senator Mondale would go down to Georgia and Alabama. Can you tell us, this doesn't reflect on the selection necessarily but you wanted his staff to get together with Ham and the staffs. When are you going to meet with him again and project the campaign?"", ""Governor Carter. I am going to meet with him tomorrow at noon I believe for lunch probably here in this suite. I haven't talked to Jody about it. But I would guess we would make a brief photographic availability there and then check the doors and then let me and him and Joan and Rosalynn have a chance to talk. In the meantime the staffs have already begun to interrelate. Senator Mondale came up here after we left, when I went to California caucus, and they have already begun to extract from one another mutual ideas on how best to conduct the campaign."", 'My own instructions to Hamilton are to let Senator Mondale and his staff make a proposal on their own initiative on how he can best work in the campaign itself. My guess is that that would be what we would adopt', ""Q. I have a question which isn't involved with the selection process, but it is on something you raised yourself. You said you thought your tax returns had been checked probably every year. I just wondered if you could tell us what the nature of those checks were? Were they audits?"", 'Governor Carter. They were routine IRS audits. When I was governor, I do not know if there was any motivation from the White House to check all Democratic governors—some Democratic governors think so—my income has been at a fairly high level, not exorbitant level. I think I ordinarily make $75,000 to $100,000 a year. I think in that income bracket there is a fairly routine procedure of checking income tax returns. They always go to my accountant in Georgia. His name is Robert Perry. He is a very conservative CPA.', 'Whenever there is a doubt, he goes with the IRS. In retrospect, I am glad of it. I used to argue with him quite a bit. But I am glad.', 'I think the New York Times, by the way, I think Mr. Horrock went down and checked our returns. I think he has access to all of them. When he made his report, I believe he also confirmed after an independent auditing firm had gone over my returns what I just said is true that we had taken a conservative position in every instance. When there was a doubt, we paid the taxes.', 'This is a good posture.', 'My major motivation in life is not to make money, but to stay in public service.', 'Q. Governor, I wonder, without any derogatory comparisons, if you could tell us what you saw as strengths of Senator Muskie and what you would have recommended in him if you had gone with him?', 'Governor Carter. I had known Senator Muskie perhaps better than any of the other candidates with a possible exception of Senator Jackson. I went to see Senator Muskie several weeks ago, not to consider him for Vice President, but to talk to him about budgeting procedures and how they were working out.', 'He particularly had asked me to come by and asked me to talk to him about the sunset law of zero-based budgeting. I was very deeply impressed with him, with his knowledge of procedures, and with the thorough approach to that kind of responsibility that he had assumed.', ""So when we started the interviews, although he had not been on the original broad list, I asked Mr. Kirbo to include him if he was willing to be considered. I didn't know whether or not he would. I felt the others by the way would."", ""He has a maturity that would be valuable to me. He is from New England, obviously he is Catholic. He represents a minority, white ethnic group. He has had experience not only in Congress but also in the electoral process. He had thought quite deeply, which was obvious in my interview, about relationships with Vice Presidents to the President, although he said he and Senator Humphrey had never discussed that in great depth, but he had certainly thought about it. There was a general political feeling that he had been a victim of the dirty tricks campaign and he didn't quite get a fair presentation to the public in the 1972 effort."", 'I think I can say—I think I am right—among all the persons who were put forward in the public opinion polls, Senator Muskie I think almost always showed up on top. Those are some of the good aspects.', 'Q. Can you tell me at what time did you say to yourself, ""Mondale is the man""? When was that decision made, and were there any other concerns besides high blood pressure and low recognition factor that you had to get over before going with Mondale?', ""Governor Carter. I didn't until yesterday—although I think the movement toward Senator Mondale was almost inevitable. The only concern that I had about Senator Mondale was political in nature. I really tried to relegate that to a secondary position, and that was about his acceptance in the South."", 'Our polls show that I am very strong, as you can well imagine, in the South. But I was surprised when the Atlanta Constitution polled the Georgia delegation—this was the day Senator Mondale came down, when it was published, and he was the one most favorably mentioned, and I think the same thing was the case with the Alabama delegation.', ""It was between Mondale and Glenn. I think some of the Alabama folks thought Glenn's position on gun control would hurt him there. So far as I can tell, there was not substantial amount of difference. Yesterday—and those are not serious concerns—I just searched to see if there was concern that I had."", 'Q. Governor, it is not to suggest that you made the decision for that purpose, but yesterday when you spoke to Western State caucuses, you gave a very interesting speech about not only desirability, but in your opinion the possibility that the party could be reunited ideologically over a broad range. Not to say you made the selection for that purpose, but do you think the scene tonight, the two of you together, this choice is going to go a long way toward that?', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I do. That is a factor.', 'Q. Could 1 follow up?', 'Governor Carter. Just a couple more questions.', 'Q. You said with Georgia and Alabama delegations added to—was it genuine or were they anticipating what they thought you were going to do?', 'Governor Carter. This was a long time ago.', 'Q. A long time ago?', 'Governor Carter. Yes.', 'Q. On that point, could you say, I know what you said this morning about political considerations not being prime, but looking to the future, could you say what strengths and weaknesses dispassionately you see in this ticket that you have now put together? You have touched here on this possibility of a concern that you felt about Mondale in the South. What else?', ""Governor Carter. I see its strengths. The only weaknesses that I see would possibly be because of the religious issues and perhaps in the far West I had a very good meeting this morning with Governor Brown. I hope and expect him to play a major role in our campaign. I believe he would help me as a matter of fact with both those problems. I hadn't even thought about them though, both of them together until this moment. But I think we have an excellent chance to overcome both of those."", 'Q. Could you define what you mean by religious issue?', 'Governor Carter. The fact that both of us are Protestants.', 'Q. Could you explain why in your press conference with Peter Rodino that you did not, neither of you mentioned that he had asked his name be withdrawn.', ""Governor Carter. It wasn't that firm. He had told me when I talked to him on the telephone that he was going—no, when he was trying to make an appointment with Mr. Kirbo to see him, that he had to go to the hospital for a glaucoma problem. When he came up here, as we closed the conversation, he expressed some reservations about his age and about his possible problem with glaucoma. He also said that he was strongly for me and he would like to do anything he could to help me, even including possible nominating speech."", ""I said if I don't choose you for Vice President, I would like you to be the one who makes the nominating speech. So that was the circumstance when we went down to the press conference."", ""Later we both decided, he decided more than I did, he didn't want to be considered for Vice President at all, that he would be glad to make the nominating speech."", 'Before I let Jody announce that, we called Congressman Rodino, and discovered after talking to him, that he had already had a similar revelation on his part about his problem with glaucoma. It was something that would not have been a serious thing, but in his mind it was serious about his age.', 'Q. Governor, I am not sure if we have covered this, maybe we have, but you have described the way in which your thinking about Mondale evolved. Could you give us some idea of where you started, that is, what was your image of Mondale?', 'You said he was quite low on your list, not really under serious consideration. If somebody said the name Mondale to you at the time this process started, what thoughts and what image would have flashed in your mind?', 'Governor Carter. Let me just tell you two or three concerns that I had at the beginning that have been alleviated and I think long ago. I had the impression that Senator Mondale was primarily concerned with peripheral issues in the federal government.', 'The more I got into his voting record, his committee assignments, his involvement, congressional deliberations, the more I found that was not true. I did not, for instance, know that he was on the Finance Committee or the Budget Committee. And when I began to talk to the leaders of the Senate, that is where they felt that his contributions had been greatest.', 'I was also concerned about his withdrawal from the Presidential race, although I was glad to see him get out. There was a slight feeling of resentment that I worked harder and he was not willing to work hard. But I discovered after talking to those who knew him well and as confirmed by his own private statement to me that he made what he considered to be an all-out effort year before last and just was not successful and that he was faced with a fruitless campaign compared to increasingly gratifying experience in the Senate. And had he thought he maintained a chance to be President, he would have stuck with the race.', 'In checking with some people in Minnesota, they said he has run aggressive campaigns there when necessary. He was appointed I think to attorney general, and then just 2 or 3 months later he had to run for attorney general. He won overwhelmingly.', 'As he pointed out to me, he did most of his campaign work before the campaign started.', 'The fact that he won by strong majority ought not to be held as a factor against him, that he did work early in the morning, late at night on senatorial duties, which had been confirmed too. So his reputation I had of lassitude or disinclinations for hard work was completely erroneous as confirmed by many sources.', ""I didn't know what his specific stand was on national defense. I think it is compatible with my own. He is in favor of a very strong national defense posture. He has voted for some of the major issues. He said he had never voted for a specific cut. He has voted against specific weapons systems, which I would have done myself."", 'I thought he was in favor of forced busing. His record as confirmed by my staff was he was not.', 'He has always tried to find an alternative to busing. His stand on gun control is identical to mine.', 'Philosophically, I find myself to be much more compatible with him than I thought.', ""One more question if you don't mind."", 'Q. Governor, in regard to the concern with the South, the 30 or 40 people that you talked to, can you say whether Governor Wallace was one of them or not?', ""Governor Carter. No, I did not talk to Governor Wallace. I didn't deliberately exclude him. One time I placed a call to him to try to talk to him and I missed him. I didn't go back to him."", 'I talked to very few governors as a matter of fact What I wanted was people who had personal knowledge of Washington leaders.', 'I was not looking for political approbation or disapproval of my prospective nominees. I was looking for personal experience with these people to indicate there are strengths and weaknesses in their own demonstration of leadership capability.', 'Thank you very much.']"
32,Jimmy Carter ,"July 15, 1976","[""I have two announcements to make. One is that I've decided to accept the nomination of President. And the other one is that I've asked to serve as my running mate—if the delegates will approve—Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota."", ""This has been, as you can well imagine, one of the most difficult decisions that I've ever had to make. But I have absolutely no doubt that I have made the right decision."", ""During the process, which has lasted for about 30 days, I've actually changed my mind three times as I've learned more and more about the relationship that can exist between myself and the Vice Presidential nominee, as I've had a chance to get to know Senator Mondale personally, to study his past voting record, his qualifications, his capabilities, the acceptance that he enjoys among a wide range of Democrats, and have discerned a great compatibility between him on the major issues that face our nation and myself."", ""I've informed, this morning at 8:30, Senator Mondale of my preference. He was already awake when I called him, and he graciously agreed to run with me, and then immediately, I called the other five members of the U.S. Senate whom I have been carefully considering even in recent days of my own choice."", ""Every one of them was very gracious. They didn't indicate any overt disappointment. I'm sure they felt some disappointment, but they all pledged themselves to support me and whoever it was I chose. I did not tell the other five of my choice except that I had decided to choose someone else."", 'Questions', 'Q. One of your first criteria all week was that you would try to select the man who was best qualified to be President if you could not serve the full term. Precisely why do you think Walter Mondale fits that description?', 'Governor Carter. The fact is, I always said, even 18 months ago when it was an idle query, that my first responsibility would be to choose someone to run with me, if I was successful, who would be the best person to lead this country if something should happen to me. Without any inclination to derogate the qualities of the other men whom I also think would be successful in governing this country, I think Senator Mondale has a great feeling of understanding and comprehension and compassion for people who need services of government most.', 'I think he has demonstrated sound judgment in times of difficulty; I think he has the trust of a wide range of Democrats and those who have no party preference in our nation. He has a very clear concept of what the Presidency should be. And I think he also has prepared himself in a very satisfying way to me.', ""I've had a chance, beginning even more than a month ago, to talk with 30 or 40 people both in and out of government, whose judgments I trust Those who are advocates for consumer protection, for citizens' rights, for different special interest groups and for peer group members in the Senate itself. And their judgment, who know this man best, is that he will be superlatively qualified to lead our country."", 'Q. What sorts of duties would a Vice President Mondale have in a Carter Administration?', ""Governor Carter. Well, the first duty Senator Mondale will have will be to help win the election in the fall. I have to be frank in telling you that the relative duties that would be accepted by me and by Senator Mondale if we are elected will have to be evolved as we get to know one another better and as we discern each other's particular strengths and weaknesses and particular interests in matters of public importance."", ""I am determined, beyond what has ever been done in this country, to put major responsibilities on the Vice President if I'm elected President."", ""I can't give you now any better analysis than that, but I have discussed it enough with him to know that he and I will be searching for a way to let the Vice President be completely involved in our nation's affairs."", ""I would never keep military or security secrets from the Vice President. I feel completely compatible with Senator Mondale. I don't believe that there would ever be an occasion when there would be a constraint between him and me that would prevent full communication or expression of doubt or concern in a time of crisis or if an unforeseen circumstance evolved."", 'Q. [Not clear.]', 'Governor Carter. Will I advocate in the future having Presidential nominees being given a breathing spell or a time interval before they make their selection. Yes, I would.', 'I intend to recommend to the Democratic National Committee that in the future the convention has a right, following the nomination of a President, to adjourn or recess for a period of about 30 days, to give the nominee— once that person is identified—an opportunity to follow a similar procedure to the one that I just followed.', 'At the end of that period, the convention could either reconvene in its entirety—which I think would probably be ill-advised—or designate the authority to the Democratic National Committee itself, about 200 to 250 people, to confirm the choice of the Presidential nominee.', ""I think that ought to be an option. I believe it's been very good for me— and I believe for the country—to have had this time of careful consideration. And I would advocate the same procedure in the future."", 'Q. Besides Washington experience, what other strengths do you think Senator Mondale brings to the ticket to balance out your own weaknesses?', ""Governor Carter. I'll take two questions at once."", ""Q. There are reports this morning that you may approach the Catholic hierarchy on the abortion issue. Do you have any plans to make an initiative on that issue in the light of what's happened this week in Chicago and Cincinnati—and there's a report in New York that the Cardinal would not come."", ""Governor Carter. Well, Senator Mondale obviously represents an agricultural state in the North. I think he's been very deeply involved in matters concerning finance. He's on the Finance Committee, as you know, serving under Senator Russell Long. He's on the Budget Committee, serving along with Senator Muskie. I'm not sure, but I believe he's the only Senator who serves on both those committees."", ""And he's had a chance .to bridge the gap between those major committees involved in raising tax revenues and the very cautious and proper expenditure of revenues. He's been a strong advocate of social programs, particularly for the disadvantaged; for child abuse. And I remember very distinctly that when I was a governor and faced with determination of Title 4 aid funds and the evolution of revenue sharing, that Senator Mondale was the one with whom I worked most intimately. And I believe that's a similar circumstance with other governors."", ""So he has a broad range of experience, as an attorney general, as someone from a northern Midwestern state, in agriculture, in finance, in social programs, and a knowledge of Washington. As you know, he's also been, as other Senators, involved in making major decisions concerning international affairs with the very critical votes on aid to Israel and on the Cyprus question and many others, including Angola."", 'On the abortion issue, I personally would have favored a different wording than that in the Democratic Platform on the abortion issue.', 'I would have preferred wording that would stay within the bounds of the Supreme Court decision, whatever it might be now or in the future.', ""That we should do everything we can to minimize the need for abortions. That's been my position throughout the whole campaign."", ""I've spelled out my position as clearly as I can, and among those leaders in the church who have recently expressed displeasure, they've been acquainted with the Democratic Platform for the last 30 days. I did not have any input, I might say, personally or through my staff so far as I know with the adoption of this particular abortion plank."", 'I did not try to dominate the platform committee. There were some things with which I was concerned, but that happens not to have been one of them.', ""I'll do everything I can as a President, within the rules set down by the Supreme Court, to minimize the need for abortion. And I will be calling on other leaders in our nation, both secular and religious leaders, to help me pursue this goal. But I will be making myself available to leaders in the church, and I'll do everything I can to eliminate the displeasure that the people feel about the Democratic Party platform."", ""But I've expressed my position. It's very close to what the Democratic Party platform said. I would just have worded it differently."", ""Q. Governor, for the last 4 years you've been campaigning 18 to 20 hours a day, working very hard to get the nomination. But now you've picked a man who, a year ago, said that he did not want to run for President because he did not have the heart for a long campaign and did not want to involve himself in it. Isn't there an inconsistency there? Don't you feel a little uneasy about that?"", 'Governor Carter. Senator Mondale pointed out, and outlined to me, the very complete and enthusiastic campaign that he conducted until his withdrawal. At this point, he said the main reason he withdrew is because he knew he could not win. The support that he hoped to achieve did not materialize, the elements of the Democratic Party that he hoped to inherit when Senator Kennedy withdrew did not come to him.', 'And he finally discovered, because of that failure of his own campaign as a candidate, and because of the difficulty of maintaining his Senate duties and conducting a full campaign, that in that choice he thought it would be better for him to withdraw and stay with his Senate duties.', ""I have investigated among people in Minnesota who know Senator Mondale best, his attitude toward campaigning itself, toward his degree of commitment to his work in the Senate. There's no doubt in my mind that he will work long hours, completely committed, and that he's perfectly determined to stick with a difficult assignment when there is an element of disappointment or discouragement there."", ""Q. [Not clear] . . . Senator McGovern . . . Do you feel you've had a full and frank discussion with Senator Mondale over any medical problems . . ."", ""Governor Carter. The question is about Senator Mondale's health, am I satisfied about the problem that was identified there earlier."", ""In the last few days, I have had several very serious allegations made against some of the senators whom I was considering. I don't know of anything that would have been embarrassing, about any of the six. Senator Mondale has a slight problem with hypertension. We asked for, and received, a complete statement from his own medical doctor who gave us the exact readings of his blood pressure tests over an historical period."", ""We took that analysis and gave it to an independent physician—it happened to be the personal physician for Mr. Kirbo in Atlanta—he checked with a specialist in that field and said that was a normal problem for someone to have at Senator Mondale's age."", ""I think the diastolic pressure was up to a 100 and it was supposed to be about 85. That's the one that's under the line, I think it's diastolic, I'm not sure. And there is a very slight problem. Senator Mondale does take a very mild medication for it and since he's been taking the medication he has had no recurrence. And his doctor—not as a result of my consideration of him— has been to Washington to observe Senator Mondale even under times of stress, because he wanted to be sure that he didn't have an unforeseen difficulty, an undetected difficulty. And it proved to be of no concern."", 'After the question and answer session, Mr. Carter introduced Senator Mondale, and the Senator stated:', ""Permit me to say that no one could be honored more than Governor Carter honors me and Joan .this morning. To be selected as a Vice Presidential running mate at any time is a high honor and a great challenge. But particularly to be selected by this remarkable and good man who's brought so much hope and unity to this country, who will be elected President of the United States, but more importantly will be elected on principle and will bring this country together and put us on the road that we all want to go on—the road of principle and decency."", ""I've had a chance to come to know Governor Carter these past few weeks, and the people of America should know that he's an uncommon man, terribly gifted, committed, skilled, experienced, ready, but above all, a good man. And I'm proud and honored to be a part of this team."", 'Joan and I commit ourselves to Governor and Mrs. Carter, to the Democratic Party, but more than that, the people of America, to give all that we have to the election of this great man and to assist him in every way possible in what I know will be one of the greatest Presidencies in American history.', 'Governor, my children—our children—are coming up shortly, and they want you to know that each of them has already taken on an assignment.', 'Teddy will handle all the dirt bike riders in America.', 'My daughter will handle all the horse ladies and horsemen in America.', 'And my younger son, William, will handle all the football players, wrestlers, and lacrosse players.']"

34,Jimmy Carter ,"July 17, 1976","['Q. Would you describe in your own words the style and character of leadership you would bring to the Presidency?\n', 'Governor Carter. The President ought to be a strong leader... The nation is best served by a strong, independent and aggressive President, working with a strong and independent Congress, in harmony for a change, with mutual respect, in the open.\n', ""I have a great respect for the Congress, but I don't consider the Congress to be inherently capable of leadership. I think the Founding Fathers expected the President to be the leader of our country. The President is the only person who can speak with a clear voice to the American people and set a standard of ethics and morality, excellence, greatness. He can call on the American people to make a sacrifice and explain the purpose of the sacrifice, propose and carry out bold programs to protect, to expose and root out injustice and discrimination and divisions among our population. He can provide and describe a defense posture that will make our people feel secure, a foreign policy to make us proud once again.\n"", ""The degree of strength of the White House is probably proportionate to the confidence and trust of the people in the office of President. There is not a time for timidity, but there is a time for careful, cautious consideration of complicated issues, searching for harmony among the disparate groups that comprise American society. I think the Democrats, and indeed the nation, are looking for an end to distrust. I think we've already seen strong evidence of this desire in the evolution of the Democratic Platform, where very controversial issues were handled with sensitivity, and with an adequate degree of aggression, but still an inclination to arrive at a harmonious answer to complicated questions.\n"", 'The consummation of the platform promises ought to begin in the fall elections when candidates seeking offices of Congress, Senate, possibly governorships, will comment in their own campaigns ... on the Democratic Party commitments. This would be a good way to bridge the gap among the President and the other office seekers so that during and after that period, detailed legislation might be evolved jointly by the President and congressional leaders to carry out the approaches of our party. I think that would be good politics and would also add some substance to the platform promises, which quite often in the past have not been adequately used.\n', 'Here is where the President should provide the leadership, and I intend to do that in my major statements during the fall campaign, to cover the items in the platform plus others I might add, to provide, a general debate and a framework on which we Democrats can make commitments. So in relationship with Congress and the population of the country and other officials, the leadership, the role of the President is perhaps most important of all. I intend to provide that leadership as a candidate and hopefully as a President.\n', 'Q. Would you say that the general tone and mode of leadership that you would exercise as President would be close to or substantially different from the tone and mode of leadership you exercised as Governor of Georgia?\n', ""Governor Carter. It would be similar. I can't change my basic character or basic approach. I learned a lot as governor that would stand me in good stead as President. I think I can do a better job now of being aggressive and innovative and dynamic as a leader and also have a closer relationship with the Congress.\n"", 'Everything I did as governor was done jointly with the legislature. It had to be. But there was room for improvement in personal relationships between myself as governor and the leadership of the legislature that I would hope to realize as President with the leaders of Congress.\n', ""Q. Some people have likened your approach to Theodore Roosevelt's— aggressiveness, activism, personal discipline, the theme of moral revitalization in American life. Do you see any parallel there in your own reading of American history?\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's a great compliment to me. It's too early to say that I would like to be able to measure up to that kind of standard. But I think it's too early just looking at the campaign to say what kind of President I would be. I've always admired Theodore Roosevelt. Truman had the same approach to the Presidency in a much more quiet and less dramatic way. And I think to some degree, Franklin Roosevelt did too. I've spent a lot of time in the last three to four years reading about various Presidents and their attitude toward the position. I think I would be strong and aggressive— maybe a good deal quieter about it than Theodore Roosevelt.\n"", ""Q. Is the description by James David Barber of an active-positive President along the lines you'd like to bring to the office?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I think so. Again, it's a very subjective expectation and analysis, I would guess. I would be active and, I think, positive in approach. I don't feel ill at ease. I don't feel afraid of the job. I think I would be able to admit a mistake publicly when one was made.\n"", ""I would not be reticent to use the office of the White House. I think I would be sure enough about my performance to strip away a maximum amount of secrecy that surrounds the President's function.\n"", 'Q. How do you arrive at a decision on a major policy issue?\n', 'Governor Carter. Exact procedure is derived to some degree from my scientific or engineering background—I like to study first all the efforts that have been made historically toward the same goal, to bring together advice or ideas from as wide or divergent points of view as possible, to assimilate them personally or with a small staff, to assess the quality of the points of view and identify the source of those proposals and, if I think the source is worthy, then to include that person or entity into a group I then call in to help me personally to discuss the matter in some depth. Then I make a general decision about what should be done involving time schedules, necessity for legislation, executive acts, publicity to be focused on the issue. Then I like to assign task forces to work on different aspects of the problem, and I like to be personally involved so that I can know the thought processes that go into the final decisions and also so that I can be a spokesman, without prompting, when I take my case to the people, the legislature or Congress.\n', ""I have always promised the people willing to help me that we would not yield to political expediency—only when absolutely necessary to save the whole project. I think this gives volunteer contributors a sense of purpose and feeling the governor or President will indeed pursue the ideas proposed aggressively and without reticence. Most of the studies that have been made in the past ... [on welfare, tax reform, etc.] have wound up in a beautiful bound volume and the President has never put the force of his office behind it But I don't intend to do that\n"", 'Q. Many people suggest that after the many inputs have been made, you make the decision essentially alone. Is that a correct perception?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, it is to some degree. In reorganization, the members of the legislature, the civil service workers, the business, professional and educational communities were intimately involved in the process from the beginning. They also thought they had a role to play in it. Somebody has to make the final decision in areas of controversy. To some degree that circumstance can be minimized by the degree of harmony that you are able to weld among those who do the basic work, and to the extent that the executive leader is part of the whole process. Then the isolated decision making role can be minimized.\n', 'Q. Some persons say that though they admire your decision making process, that either on policy or strategy, it takes heaven and earth to move you thereafter. Is that allegation of stubbornness on your part fair criticism?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think so. But you have to be certain the position you propose is best, and it can't be a unilateral decision. You have to have a mutual agreement this is the best road to pursue.\n"", 'Quite often there are alternative decisions that can be made on the same subject with very little to choose one above the other. In grey areas, the necessity to compromise is obvious.\n', ""I've always been inclined on a matter of principle or importance not to compromise until it's absolutely necessary. I don't see any reason to compromise away a position early in the stage of passage through the Congress or the legislature.\n"", ""There is a final forum that even transcends the inclination ci the legislative body. That's the people themselves. When you do have a difference of opinion with the legislative body, then the people themselves ought to be acquainted with the discussion. I've never had the inclination nor the knowledge about the process to twist arms or force people to vote different from what they thought. But I've always seen the effectiveness of convincing the constituents back home about the question and then giving the legislative members maximum credit for the success achieved. If the legislative leaders can be involved in the initial stages of a project, if they can take credit for what is done, and not be placed in a combative attitude, then most of those disharmonies can be avoided.\n"", ""Q. Do you see any validity in people's suggestion that when you're convinced the principle is right, the brittleness could be so great you'd get into a Woodrow Wilson-League of Nations type of situation?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I can't recall an incident when that's happened yet in my public life.\n"", ""I've been through profound changes in the Georgia government that involved prison reform, education reform, government reorganization, judicial reform, mental health programs. I can't remember any instance, minor or major, when an adamant position on my part doomed a desirable goal.\n"", 'Q. There were some comments that Jimmy Carter approached being governor like being skipper of a submarine. As President, would you like to avoid that type of feeling and have a more harmonious working relationship?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't accept that categorization as accurate. It was made by the present speaker of the Georgia House, Tom Murphy, who's always been a political critic of mine. I never tried to be autocratic as governor or to run other people's feelings.\n"", 'If I had, I would have had an adamant resistance from the legislature instead of the cooperation we experienced. But I would be much more able now, with the experience of four years as governor, to assure harmony.\n', 'Q. A constant theme of some observers of the Presidency is the dangerous sense of invincibility and infallibility that pervades the White House, especially after there1s been a successful campaign and the winning team and its leader are in office. Some talk of ""groupthink""—a mutually reinforcing idea that we\'ve conquered the opposition and therefore whatever problem lies ahead of us, even like a Bay of Pigs in the early \'60s under Kennedy, we can conquer also. Have you thought about that type of occurrence in your Presidency and do you see a way to prevent it happening?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I've thought about it. Obviously, I've seen it in other administrations. It's a serious enough matter to make every effort to remember the possibility and also to prevent the eventuality. One obvious measure that can help to prevent that kind of circumstance is a maximum degree of openness in government—a constant relationship between the President and the people of this country and the President and Congress. I favor strong sunshine legislation, and I will pursue that aggressively through Executive order. I'll open up as much as I can of the deliberations of the Executive Branch of government to public scrutiny.\n"", 'Another measure that could prevent a recurrence of those tragedies is to have foreign and domestic policy shaped with a maximum interrelationship with the congressional leaders. I need their help.\n', ""I recognize my inexperience in Washington. Many congressional leaders have already pledged their support to me, if I should become President, in the most complete way. Another prevention that can be instituted is to maintain a staff with free access to me and encouragement of an almost unrestricted debate within the White House circles. I think we had this while I was governor. I guess there were 200 people in the Georgia government who had unimpeded access to me, through memoranda or personally. This was a problem that sometimes I had with department heads because the key members within their departments knew they could come to me directly whenever they chose. I won't go into detail about the sensitive relationship between them and their superiors, but it worked well.\n"", 'I think this kind of mistake can be prevented.\n', 'Q. Do you have persons on your staff who feel free to say ""that\'s wrong— everybody else in this room is wrong—including you?""\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Do you encourage that?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I do.\n', ""Q. George Reedy says that's impossible to maintain in the White House.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I've read his book. I recognize that the stature of the Presidency itself is much more awe-inspiring that the stature of a governor or candidate for President. I hope, I believe, I can maintain my commitment to those preventive steps that I've described to you.\n"", 'Q. Are there several members of your staff who feel they have that freedom?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes... We had quite an argument yesterday afternoon, as a matter of fact, about whether I should release the names of 12 or 15 potential vice presidential nominees. And there was quite a free-wheeling discussion about that. I don't believe there was any reticence about it at all.\n"", 'Q. Some say your wife also performs this function at times.\n', 'Governor Carter. She does. You could leave off ""at times.""\n', 'Also, I intend to restore frequent press conferences. I would say every two weeks, at least 20 times a year. And also restore the format of the fireside chat.\n', ""I believe an open presentation by the President to the American people of his ideas on matters of controversy or potential seriousness is a very self-disciplinary measure that would require the President to reexamine his position before those positions are made public. Once they are made public, then you have a massive amount of editorial comment. This would apply to our relationships with the Soviet Union or the 200 mile fishing limit or environmental quality or International Monetary Fund or aid to developing countries, for example. Many matters of foreign policy, plus a much larger number of domestic matters. I'm committed to doing that on my word of honor to the American people, and I don't believe I would ever be tempted not to carry out that commitment.\n"", 'Q. Do you mean in relationship to these subjects?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, the frequency of the press conferences and also the fireside chat format.\n', ""Q. You've made a suggestion on accountability, of Cabinet members going before a joint session of Congress. Do you see any merit to another proposal that the President might appear two or three times a year with the congressional leadership in a televised discussion of national issues? Does that type of idea have any potential?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Possibly. I don't know how much validity it would have if it was preplanned or staged. I'm not sure.\n"", ""Q. Other ideas are people's press conferences or even letting people telephone in occasionally questions to a President in some type of a public format.\n"", 'Governor Carter. I would certainly have no objection to that. While I was governor, we had a similar format, in that I would travel around the state for anywhere from four to eight days at a time. Let the radio stations know in advance when I would be there. They would call in questions ahead of time. The radio station manager would read the questions to me. This would be done live, and I would respond to the questions.\n', ""That was always a great pleasure to me. In addition, we had visitors' day once a month when anyone in Georgia who wanted to see me personally could come and do so. That would be a difficult thing to handle as President, but anything I can devise that would maintain a feeling of open access to me by the American people—I would try it.\n"", 'Q. You seem to be seeking some historic breakthrough in terms of communications.\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, it could prevent recurrence of Watergate. I think we'd also contribute to prevention of another Vietnam or Cambodia, when the President hid behind a veil of secrecy and the people of this country were misled about what was going on.\n"", ""There would be no sure prevention for mistakes, obviously. But if you can tap on a truly continuing basis the experience and common sense and sound judgment and high moral character of the American people and let that be exemplified within the government of our country through the President and Congress, it's a great insurance against a serious national mistake, such as we've witnessed in recent years.\n"", 'Q. The type of open Presidency you\'re describing—does that include ""pressing the flesh""—or don\'t you think that\'s as essential as the kind of communication you\'re describing?\n', ""Governor Carter. I really don't think that's as essential. It's enjoyable and it's great for the ego of the President. It's fairly non-substantial as far as communication is concerned. In transient moments of contact with individual persons, there's very little opportunity for exchange of ideas. I think that would probably be of less significance than earlier, but I would certainly do it on occasion.\n"", 'Q. People like George Reedy have talked about a republican officer as President—lower case ""r""—less emphasis on ""Hail to the Chief,"" great booming guns and so on. Have you given some thought to that?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I\'d like to minimize the-pomp and circumstance of the office. And I think the American people would appreciate that. I would not form a secret White House ""palace guard."" I would expect Cabinet members to play a much larger and more autonomous role, much like the role that was played by the cabinet heads when I was Governor of Georgia.\n', 'I would try to appoint members of the Cabinet in whom I had complete confidence, who could speak clearly to the American people and had judgment enough to act on their own. I would monitor their performance and try to bring cohesion within the Executive Branch of government as different departments shared a common purpose. But I would not have anyone within the White House try to administer the affairs of the Executive Branch of government.\n', 'Q. You have talked about your contact with everyday citizens, the help you felt that gave you to keep in touch with people when you were governor, and the help it could give in avoiding misadventures as President. Could you give me one or two examples of such contacts, when you were governor, that led you to new policy positions or new insights?\n', 'Governor Carter. Every month I was governor, as I told you before, I had a visitors\' day, when anyone who wanted to could come in and see me. On one of the first visitors\' days, although my wife and I had already participated publicly in a program for hiring the handicapped, I had a young man with a withered hand who came in to talk to me. He said that it was impossible to take the merit system examination for employment in the state government because he was handicapped. ""Well,"" I said, ""I\'m sure that your own relatively minor handicap of having one withered hand would not be an obstacle to employment."" He said, ""They won\'t let me take die examination for employment."" And I said, ""That cannot possibly be die case."" And he said, ""Governor, I can tell you for a fact that it is."" And so I went over and picked up the phone and called the head of our merit system, which is civil service in Georgia, and reported to the administrator of the system what the young man had reported to me. The head of the merit system said, ""Yes, sir, that\'s right. Four or five governors ago a decision was made that we would not employ handicapped people in the state government."" So the policy was changed. We later had an aggressive program for hiring the handicapped. But I could very well have gone through a large portion of my administration pushing hiring of the handicapped in private industry and other ways and then discovered that state government had a policy of not hiring handicapped people.\n', 'Another example was during my campaign for governor, when it became obvious toward the end of my campaign that I might very well be governor. People would quite quickly come up to me and say ""Governor,"" or ""Jimmy,"" or ""Senator, I\'ve got a handicapped child at home, and I hope you\'ll do something about it."" And I would glibly say, ""Yes, this is going to be one of the major thrusts of my administration if I\'m elected""—just to get votes. I didn\'t really think seriously about what I was going to do. And after I got the nomination, one day in a grocery store a fellow came up and touched me on the shoulder, and I turned around and he said, ""I\'m going to vote for you for Governor."" I said, ""Well, I really appreciate that."" And he said, ""Do you know why?"" And I said, ""No, why?"" ""It\'s because I\'ve got a retarded child at home."" And he turned around and walked away. And I stood there shocked in a way to realize that the kind of political statements that I\'d been making in the campaign about retarded children were actually such a deep, personal thing for a lot of Georgians. So I marshalled then a major effort to revise completely the mental retardation system in Georgia. I did it successfully, I think. So that\'s the kind of contact to me that\'s very important And under the zero-base budgeting technique, the instigation for change and for better delivery of services is deep within the department among people who actually deliver those services.\n', ""Q. Is it possible to make the vice presidency a substantially important position? There's been certainly, with a strong White House staff, a constant tendency to downgrade the Vice President's role, to make sure that he gets neither the exciting nor credit-winning jobs, and he's left with very heavily partisan duties or going to funerals in other parts of the world. Do you think there's a way to prevent that from happening?\n"", ""Governor Carter. [laughing] I think it's an inherent danger. I'm certainly determined to make the vice presidency a substantive position. I see no reason for the President to be worried about challenge in public acceptance or public stature from the Vice President or anyone else. The office of the Presidency is so powerful and so much a center of attention that the idea of competition with a Vice President seems quite remote. I hope to have the kind of Vice President, if I am elected, who would share with me all the purposes of the administration in an easy, unrestrained way. And I think both the President and Vice President are best served, no matter what their future aspirations might be, by working in harmony. I think the people would react adversely to any sort of disharmony or conflict. I think the country loses when a competent Vice President is deprived of an opportunity to serve in a forceful way.\n"", ""Q. It's just that it seems to have happened every time, no matter what everyone's intentions were at the start. Some people believe the problem is so inherent that they say there should be no Vice President.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I recognize that. That's why I laughed at first and said that it seems to be inherent. But I'm determined to try.\n"", 'Q. Would the Vice President or another White House staff person with direct access to you be given broad responsibility in the intergovernmental relations area?\n', 'Governor Carter. I intend to use the Vice President in major roles. It would depend on the background and experience and knowledge of the Vice President, where the emphasis might be placed. And I have not made that decision yet\n', 'Q. If not the Vice President, would another person have that role [in intergovernmental relations], with direct access to you?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', ""Q. Some of the experts on Presidential leadership—Thomas E. Cronin in particular—say that there are really two Cabinets—the inner Cabinet of Secretary of State, Attorney General, the Secretaries of Treasury and Defense, and the outer Cabinet of Agriculture, Labor, HEW, Transportation, etc. The latter are said, after a few weeks of becoming Cabinet members, to become advocates of the special constituencies that they represent, and to become, as Vice President Charles G. Dawes once said, the natural enemies of the President because they're always trying to get more of the fiscal pie for their special concerns. Often Presidents do interpose staff members to fend off the outer Cabinet members. Do you think that's avoidable? Is there a way to treat your outer Cabinet as counselors rather than advocates?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I believe so. Of course the same situation, the same parallel exists in a state government. The best mechanism to minimize this problem is the establishment of long-range goals or purposes of the government and a mutual commitment to those goals by different Cabinet members, both so-called inner and outer Cabinet members. The preparation of the budget in accordance with the long-range goals of the nation would help to cement the different Cabinet functions to a common purpose. Another element is the relevant priorities of the President himself. HEW, for instance. President Johnson was probably more aggressive in trying to deal with human needs than even Secretaries of HEW were.\n', ""The same thing applied in other administrations, depending on the relative importance of different elements of government service to the President and his staff. In any instance, when the President is laggard in meeting the needs of people, a given Cabinet member in that neglected area will probably be more of an advocate than a counselor. I think that's a good, built-in minor system of checks and balances. And I see nothing wrong with it.\n"", 'Q. You\'re saying that you will have no ""oversecretaries of domestic affairs"" in the White House to whom these Cabinet members speak. Are you making a pledge that if you\'re elected President these Cabinet members will have direct access to you?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right. But I would certainly reserve the option of using the Vice President in a major role to be determined later. I would expect the Vice President to help carry out, in a generic sense, the commitments of my administration and to deal directly with governors and other state officials, to work closely with the Congress and obviously work directly with the Cabinet members. I would not prevent, though, the governors, mayors, Congress and Cabinet members to have direct access to me.\n"", ""Q. What kind of people and qualities are you looking for in the Cabinet and other major policy making roles? What kind of talent hunt method are you thinking of and what goals beyond just the brightest and best people in America—what types of directions are you looking in? How much would you be looking toward traditional establishment figures who've been in other administrations and have an understanding of federal policy making? How much fresh appeal?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think my inclination would be to go toward a new generation of leaden. I would put a strong emphasis on executive management capacity and sensitivity to people's needs. Obviously compatibility would be an important factor—not only with me but with other members of the Cabinet. I would ensure that those who are most dependent on government to meet their human needs would be reassured by the record and reputation and attitudes of the appointments I would make in the field of human rights, civil rights, justice, health, welfare, education, housing, transportation.\n"", 'I would choose those in whom I have complete confidence to orient government services where services are the most needed—among the poor, deprived, the illiterate, and minority groups—and at the same time have the competence to deliver those services in an efficient, economical way.\n', ""I will probably continue to form my opinions about potential Cabinet members in the period following the convention when we start detailed preparation of legislation for issue analysis for the fall election. I will observe personally as much as possible the relative competence of the people who might be in the Cabinet in the future. I would deliberately seek advisers during the pre-election period with that as a major factor. If someone recommended to me a future Cabinet member, I'd be inclined deliberately to seek out that person as a working companion during the post-convention period so that I could become personally acquainted with him. I would seek the advice obviously of those who've served in previous administrations. I can't say I would never use somebody who had served in a previous administration. Obviously I will use some. But my inclination would be to go to a new generation.\n"", 'Q. Do you desire a high degree of independence among your Cabinet members?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Should a President tolerate Cabinet members who dissent from administration policy as heavily as James R. Schlesinger did as Secretary of Defense?\n', ""Governor Carter. I believe I could prevent that disharmony occurring by being more heavily involved in the evolution of basic commitments. I always managed the affairs of Georgia on long-range goals and I can't imagine a basic strategic difference developing between myself and one of my Cabinet members if the understanding were that we worked toward the long-range goals. There might be some difference on tactics. But I think I could tolerate the degree of independence shown by James Schlesinger—yes.\n"", 'Q. You recently stated that foreign and domestic issues are becoming more and more interrelated, and ""we must develop a policy-making machinery that transcends narrow perspectives.91 How would you propose to do that?\n', ""Governor Carter. Within the Cabinet structure, and within the process of evolving well-understood, publicly described, long-range policies in, for instance, economics and foreign political affairs, there's got to be some coordination. I would not make the Secretary of State the boss over his domestic counterparts. I think that the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Commerce and others all inherently play a major role in the carrying out of matters that relate to foreign policy. Rather than make one of those leaders dominant over all the rest, the coordination has got to come from the President, I would say within the structure of the National Security Council, or perhaps some other Cabinet structure. But I think there ought to be a realization on the part of the Secretary of State that these are the long-range commitments that I've made in the fields of agriculture, commerce, treasury, and so forth, and that the other Cabinet members have a similar awareness of the long, range commitments in foreign policy, and let me ensure, as President, through proper administrative mechanisms, that the disharmonies among these leaders be minimized.\n"", 'Q. Do you expect to continue both the Domestic Council and the National Security Council?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm not yet ready to answer that question.\n"", 'Q. Would you pick many Cabinet or sub-Cabinet or key staff members from state and local governments?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Is it correct to assume that some of your long-term associates, including Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell, would be members of your White House staff?\n', ""Governor Carter. That would be a good guess, but I think assumption is too strong a word. I've never discussed it with any of them. And I will reserve that judgment.\n"", 'Q. Do you have in mind what other type of persons you would seek for close-in staff—what kind of qualifications would you look for?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would guess that most of them would come from those who would help me following the convention in putting together plans for the election, for implementation of the platform, for working harmoniously with the Congress. There would certainly be some exceptions to that But I would depend quite heavily for advice, at least for the identification of staff members, on those with whom I've been associated during the campaign itself up through November.\n"", 'Q. Many past administrations have been heavily manned with former Capitol Hill staff, who were familiar with various areas of federal policy. Would that be true in your administration?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well I think ""heavily"" is the only word with which I would disagree. I certainly expect to have some representation within the White House staff from those who are familiar with the workings of Washington, and also working with Congress. But it would not be a dominant role.\n', 'Q. Do you think the White House staff should be cut from its current level of 500 or 600?\n', 'Governor Carter. You can depend on it.\n', 'Q. Do you think there3s a need for a single White House chief of staff?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe so. I did not have a single chief of staff as governor. I had, I would say, three or four persons who had equal responsibilities for different aspects of my own duties. And I would probably continue that approach as President.\n"", 'Q. How central a role would the Office of Management and Budget have in your administration? Do you see using it as the effective arm to manage the federal government?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes. Not particularly management, but in planning and budgeting, yes. I favor a complete melding of the planning and budgeting process, using the monitoring of the expenditure of funds in the carrying out of programs as a basis on which to predicate decisions concerning the next year's budget.\n"", 'In Georgia, we had a team made up always of planners and those evolving the next budget. And this was an extension of myself as governor. We never got the Office of Planning and Budget involved in the actual administration of programs, but in the monitoring of them, yes.\n', 'Q. Would the consultation you talk of with Congress begin with key congressional figures in the formulative stages of legislation?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, it's already begun, as a matter of fact.\n"", 'Q. Would it extend to broad numbers of Senators and Representatives who are not in leadership positions?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. Not only in the actual work with key staff members, but also during the campaigning process itself in 1976. I would hope that with a very good Democratic Party platform, which we now have, that there would be a mutual commitment by myself and the 85 percent of the Democratic Members of Congress who are running for reelection this fall that we would carry out the provisions of the platform. And at that very early stage, there would be a method by which they could cooperate.\n', 'Q. Do you think there are circumstances under which a President should seek to influence the outcome of a competition for leadership posts in the House or Senate?\n', ""Governor Carter. No. I really don't think so. I attempted that a couple of times in Georgia as an ostensible demonstration of my strength. It was a mistake. And I don't intend to try to determine in the Congress who occupies positions of leadership.\n"", 'Q. Do you think the recent moves toward increased congressional independence—the War Powers Act and most particularly the new congressional budget process—will make it more difficult for a Democratic President to deal with a Democratic Congress?\n', ""Governor Carter. No. Not necessarily. I think it makes it much more incumbent on the President and Congress to share the responsibilities at the early stage of the evolution of foreign policy. I think the stronger the congressional budgeting process might be, the more sure the nation can feel that the final budget will be both proper, substantive and responsible. So I don't fear that at all. I'll prepare the Executive budget, using the zero-base budgeting technique. I'll submit it to the Congress for final disposition. I'll reserve the right to use my influence within the Congress to prevail on recommendations in which I have a deep sense of conviction they're proper. But I don't see anything wrong with the Congress having a very strong, very competent, very responsible budgeting procedure. That's good.\n"", 'Q. Would you consider negotiation to set common budget goals with the Senate and House Budget Committees?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think consultation would be better than negotiation. I'll reserve the right to make the final decision on the Executive budget recommendation. I'll reserve the right to determine how much consultation there ought to be. As the Congress considers the budget that I propose to them, then will come the time for negotiation and consultation in a much more in-depth manner.\n"", ""Q. When you were governor and consumer legislation was blocked in the legislature, you were openly critical of the special interest lobbies and the legislature's listening to them. Are there circumstances under which a major piece of legislation could be blocked in Congress, and you would feel compelled to make a similar statement as President?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes. And I would not hesitate to do it.\n', ""Unfortunately for Georgia, I started working on consumer protection legislation too late. I was so wrapped up in complete reorganization of the government, mental health programs, prison reform, a new basic law on education, judicial reform, zero-base budgeting, that I didn't start early enough in my administration on consumer protection, and the special interest groups prevailed on about half of it. I prevailed—rather the Georgia people prevailed— on the other half.\n"", ""I would use that influence of going directly to the people and identifying special interest groups that block good legislation. And I believe the President's voice would be much more authoritative and much more clear than any governor's voice could be, because of the close attention paid to the President's statements by the news media—much more so than any Governor.\n"", 'Q. Would you describe your opposition to incremental reform?\n', ""Governor Carter. Most of the controversial issues that are not routinely well-addressed can only respond to a comprehensive approach. Incremental efforts to make basic changes are often foredoomed to failure because the special interest groups can benefit from the status quo, can focus their attention on the increments that most affect themselves, and the general public can't be made either interested or aware.\n"", 'Let\'s say welfare or tax reform or government reorganization is addressed, then a governor or a President can say ""this is what we have now—quite often a terrible mess—this is what we can have—a much improved circumstance— and these are the steps to arrive at the change.""\n', ""If it's clear, comprehensive and it's presented in such a way as to arouse the support of the people, then the special interests quite often back off because most of them don't want to be exposed to a public altercation against the people of a state or nation. So the comprehensive approach is inherently necessary to make controversial decisions.\n"", 'Q. Everyone says that in reorganization, you bird-tailed every detail, both in passage and implementation.\n', 'Governor Carter. I think I did. When the process was approaching a conclusion, I knew as much about the state government—its present form, the need for the changes—as anyone in Georgia. I also had a close enough relationship with the specialists in matters like personnel management, transportation, electronic data processing, printing, plus organizational structure, to speak with authority on the subject. But somebody has to understand the whole process in the comprehensive state. If the person is a good manager and organizer, this can be done without interfering with the administrative responsibilities of the executive.\n', ""I recognize you can't as governor or President, you can't drop everything and just work on one item exclusively... You don't drop everything else. But you have to let your workers know you're deeply interested and you have to let the persons who are deeply affected by the changes participate in the project from its inception.\n"", 'Q. Do you remain committed to seeking reauthorization of the Executive Branch reorganization authority that was enacted in 1949 but expired in 1973?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. And are you going to ask Congress early in 1977 to grant that authority as an early priority?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I might even ask them in 1976 during the campaign.\n', 'Q. If this attempt to win reorganization authority were to fail, would the ""sunset"" bill now before Congress—which would put all federal programs on a five-year cycle and thus provide an opportunity for Presidential leadership in what is extended and what not—be a logical fallback position for you?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't consider that a fallback position, but I consider that a correlative commitment. The two are mutually exclusive. I don't believe that the sunset legislation or zero-base budgeting would be effective with the present conglomerate organizational structure. So I consider them to be separate considerations entirely, all of them almost mandatory: government reorganization, and either zero-base budgeting or the sunset approach. I personally favor zero-base budgeting, but they are related, one to another.\n"", ""Q. Both—sunset legislation and zero-base budgeting—could coexist, couldn't they?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes, they could, certainly.\n', 'Q. Would you expect reorganization, in addition to making the federal bureaucracy more rational and accessible, to cause the elimination of a substantial number of outmoded programs?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes. The programs themselves are much more effectively eliminated through zero-base budgeting techniques. But as the programs become obsolescent, the major consideration is to detect that obsolescence and to act on it. I think that the proliferation of government agencies is quite often related to the number of programs, so that I don't believe it will be possible to separate the considerations.\n"", 'Q. Wouldn\'t any reorganization plan that you proposed be likely to encounter massive and perhaps crippling opposition from entrenched federal interest groups? I can name three: the government employee unions, leery about any steps that might cut the number of jobs; the so-called ""poverty-industrial complex"" of social workers and others; and third, congressional chairmen and subcommittee chairmen who are fearful of any departmental reorganization that could render obsolete their chairmanships, power and patronage.\n', 'Governor Carter. All three of those are possible sources of opposition. Similar opposition is obviously a characteristic of state government. But the answer to all those is to provide more effective government in the areas of life that interest those groups.\n', 'When I demonstrated to the civil service employees in Georgia that their professional careers could be more productive—the clear assignment of responsibility, clear delineation of authority, minimum of red tape, minimum of paperwork, much more productive delivery of services—they became strong supporters of reorganization. At first, they were very afraid of it.\n', 'Secondly, the special interest groups. If we can combine comprehensive welfare reform, comprehensive national health care, better tax programs and tax reforms, this is the best way to assuage the special interest groups that are interested in social programs.\n', ""The Congress is a key to the whole question. I believe that most of the Members of Congress, and certainly all with whom I've discussed this question, recognize the low esteem now of Congress in the eyes of the public. I think they'll be very eager to share the credit for government improvement Their interest is the same as mine. I think most Members of Congress want to do a good job. I don't think they would put their own chairmanships above the public interest if that public interest could be clearly identified.\n"", 'The other factor is this; we will have made, during the campaign this year, a commitment to the people to carry out these changes. I hope that as many candidates for Congress as possible will have an opportunity to express themselves on the subject. And if I should have an ultimate disagreement with any of these groups, including the Congress, I would take my case directly to the people and let them be the ultimate forum. And I think they could prevail over public employees, they could prevail over the special interest groups, they could prevail over the Members of Congress.\n', 'Q. Can a President really control the permanent bureaucratic government in Washington? A corollary is—can the President use inspirational leadership to motivate the Civil Service?\n', ""Governor Carter. The President can't control the bureaucracy if there's a disharmonious or combative relationship between the President and those responsible for carrying out executive responsibilities. I don't intend to have that kind of relationship. I'll consider the employees of the federal government to be my allies, not my enemies, and try to work intimately with them in the consummation of any changes that relate to their own public service. There's no other source of leadership of a comprehensive nature than the President. In the absence of that leadership, there is no leadership.\n"", ""Q. Would some of the type of inspirational leadership you've used in the campaign be applicable to working with federal workers?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I believe so. I believe that there's a desire among elected officials and professional career workers in the federal government to do a good job.\n"", 'Q. Some citizens are concerned about federal pay and fringe benefits that are above those paid in private industry. Is that a concern of yours?\n', 'Governor Carter. Some aspects of retirement are definitely a concern of mine. I would want to make sure that retirement benefits and pay for federal employees are compatible with those in private life, and not excessively superior, and certainly not inferior.\n', ""Q. Some studies have shown an immense turnover in high administration ranks, especially at the assistant secretary level—16 months, for instance, being average tenure. Many people then leave before they’ve mastered their jobs. Do you think that's a serious problem? Do you see a way to counteract it?\n"", ""Governor Carter. It's a serious problem. I don't blame them for leaving. With the present bureaucratic mess we've got in Washington, the experience of trying to administer an unmanageable bureaucracy must be extremely frustrating to anyone. I believe that my record in Georgia, with tremendous stability at the leadership level, would be a good indication of what might very well materialize in the next administration if I'm President. But this is something that can only be corrected with proper management, with clear goals and policies, with coordination of different elements of the Executive Branch of government, a close working relationship with the Congress, a sense of gratification and a justifiable degree of appreciation within the public for the good job that's being done in Washington. Almost all those elements now are missing.\n"", 'Q. On civil service, because of the many incredibly hard and rigid rules and conditions on hiring, promoting and firing, some people have suggested that the U.S. Civil Service Commission should be split. They suggest there should be a hiring management arm of the federal government to get the best possible employees, and then a separate agency for their protection against political abuse or unjust firing or other unfair treatment. Have you ever considered that type of change?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I haven't thought about it. Georgia has both functions combined into one department.\n"", ""Q. The federal government does too, in the Civil Service Commission. Some people believe that's part of the problem.\n"", ""Governor Carter. My experience with the Georgia merit system administration was fairly good, although it's a thankless job. I couldn't say we didn't have problems with it—we had constant problems. I haven't considered whether any of the problems were because of a need for separation of the two functions. I wouldn't mark it off...\n"", ""We had some problems with reorganization. I didn't fire anybody because of reorganization, but I reserved the right to transfer them to more productive jobs with no loss in pay status or seniority. And I also reserved the right not to refill vacancies as they occurred. That was enough of a leverage for me to exert.\n"", ""The time frame of planning out a reorganizational proposal is long enough so that normal attrition provides you with a tremendous amount of flexibility; So we didn't have any problems there. As a matter of fact, before the recession came, and unemployment went way up and state jobs got so valuable, we had an average of about a 15 percent attrition rate every year—this was a nationwide average for state governments. I haven't seen a more recent figure—I'd guess it might be half that or maybe 8 or 10 percent. If it takes you three years to carry out something with a 15 percent annual attrition rate, that's a maximum.\n"", ""Q. Would you be so fortunate at the federal level, where you're dealing with a much more entrenched bureaucracy?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes, I know that. I recognize that.\n', ""Q. A contributing factor is that the employee benefits are so high that people fust can't think of leaving after a few years. Doesn't that make the job of an executive, to motivate federal workers, all the more difficult?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, public scrutiny and natural pride in one's one and only life work on earth is a pretty heavy motivation. And I think it's a mistake— and I don't think I'm being naive about it—I think it's a mistake for us to think that I as a politician, or you as a journalist, have a higher commitment to do something worthy with our lives than the ones who work in public office...\n"", ""And there's a peer pressure, too, that exists there. When higher standards are demanded of people and when there's a spirit of competition involved, then to have one laggard in an office quite often results in focusing criticism on this person by their peers...\n"", 'Q. Would their understanding of intergovernmental relations be one reason for your intended choice of many key local officials for positions in your administration?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. And I also intend to adhere strictly to a rule of having representatives of state and local government to help me in the evolution and consummation of major program changes, including the drafting of legislation. I want to make sure that the programs we put through Congress work at the delivery end. I think the best way to assure that is for governors, mayors and other officials of state and local government to be involved from the beginning.\n', 'Q. Your statements and the Democratic Platform indicate a desire for more federal aid to states and cities in the next years. If that issue is then put to the side, how do you feel about ""New Federalism"" in terms of devolution of authority to state and local governments? Do you favor more of it?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I do. There are some programs that must be coordinated at the federal level just to provide equity. But whenever possible, I would give the authority to the local or state government to deliver services and to control the mechanism of delivery to meet the needs of the citizens of individual communities.\n', 'One area, to illustrate the point, would be in the field of education. I see a growing role for the federal government in financing education to eliminate discrepancies in the amount of local financing available in a community for the children who live there. But I would want to keep control of the school system as near as possible to the local government.\n', 'Q. Are you concerned about federal funding reaching such levels that the impetus is lost for fundamental tax reforms on the state and local level, particularly the state level?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe that's a danger. I would be much more inclined to give local governments financial relief than I would be to give states financial relief—for several reasons.\n"", ""One is that the states have almost complete flexibility in their basic taxation and their rate of taxation. Second, the states have much more flexibility in the services that they deliver. Third, the states have a much greater authority to decide their own commitments than do local governments, because many of the local governments' decisions are made at the state legislative level. And fourth, the states have a much more progressive tax structure, based quite often on income tax, corporate tax, corporate and personal income taxes, whereas the local governments' tax base is most often restricted primarily to property taxes and state taxes, which are inflexible and also fall more heavily on the low-income families. So for all those reasons, I would favor, when given a choice, the allocation of federal funds to local governments in preference to state governments.\n"", 'Q. Would some devolution of authority to state and local governments be part of your reorganization?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think that would come more naturally under the process of writing new programs in the field of education, health care, welfare reform, than under the reorganization of the federal government mechanism itself.\n', 'Q. Would the heaviest priority of your administration be on foreign or domestic affairs?\n', 'Governor Carter. The number one responsibility of any President, above everything else, is to guarantee the security of his country—freedom from fear of attack or successful attack or blackmail, the ability to carry out a legitimate foreign policy. I would certainly place that aspect of life and world peace in a preeminent position. As far as the amount of time devoted to domestic or foreign affairs, I would guess that most of the time would be devoted to domestic affairs.\n', 'Q. Some recent Presidents seem to have had a sickly fascination with foreign affairs—crisis management, the daily secret briefings, dealings with heads of state—all the while avoiding some hard domestic problems and slogging budget questions. Would you seek to avoid that type of diversion of time into foreign affairs?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I would. I think a crucial prerequisite of an effective foreign policy is to restore the confidence and morale and commitment of our people in their own domestic affairs. So I would not use foreign affairs or foreign trips as an escape mechanism to avoid responsibilities on the domestic scene.\n', 'Q. What type of qualities would you look for in a Secretary of State? What type of background and personal characteristics? Would you like to have someone who came out of the foreign policy ""establishment"" and had been involved in foreign affairs over the years? Or someone who had been watching it in a more detached way?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's something I haven't yet decided, nor have I had to decide it I would probably depend more upon my confidence in the intelligence and judgment and moral commitment of. the person, than I would on the particular environment that has shaped that person's knowledge of foreign affaire. I've got about 15 or 20 people in whom I have placed a lot of responsibility, and among that group I would seek advice before I made a final decision on Secretary of State. The main thing that's missing now is confidence by the Secretary of State in the sound judgment, common sense and integrity of the American people.\n"", 'Q. Would a Secretary of State in your administration be basically there to make foreign policy or to carry out the foreign policy that you make?\n', 'Governor Carter. Both. I would retain the responsibility of making the final decisions. I would insist on being clearly informed. And I would retain the role of being spokesman for this country. But I would consider the Secretary of State to be a partner with me, an adviser, an administrator of the complex foreign affairs mechanism that falls within the responsibility of the Secretary of State. But I would be the ultimate one to make the decisions.\n', 'Q. Do you see a model in any of the recent Secretaries of State—William Rogers, who was sort of a sword carrier, Henry Kissinger the policy maker, or perhaps Dean Acheson, who seemed to do it fairly cooperatively with the President?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think Dean Acheson, George Marshall would be two who did a superb job, in my opinion. I don't think there was ever any doubt in the minds of the American people about who was responsible ultimately. Even when those two very strong Secretaries of State were in office, it was the President They were men of conviction, of sensitivity, of competence and authority. And they worked harmoniously with the President. And they carried out the responsibilities specifically designated to them by the President, on an individual basis of agreement. So I think those two would be the kinds of persons that I would admire very much.\n"", 'Q. In the foreign policy area, would your priorities be more East-West, dealing with traditional allies and the Soviet Union, or North-South, in planning for future relationships with the underdeveloped world?\n', ""Governor Carter. I really see three relationships. One is in our relationship with our natural allies and friends—the democratic, developed nations of the world: Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and others such as Australia, New Zealand, Israel. That's one solid base of strength, mutual purpose, consultation, and it must be maintained. It's been damaged severely, in my opinion, recently.\n"", ""The second relationship would be the relationship between the democracies of the world and the socialist or Communist nations—our relationship with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Not a unilateral relationship between the United States and those nations, but as much as possible involving the other democracies of the world.\n"", 'And third, of course, would be the relationship between the developed nations and the developing nations. And I would like to get as much as possible the OPEC [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries] countries and the Soviet Union, for instance, to join with the developed democracies of the world to share the responsibility for the less developed nations.\n', 'Q. What qualities and experience would you look for in a Secretary of Defense?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would look on each Cabinet member to some degree as being an advocate for that department. And this would certainly include a Secretary of Defense who believes that we must always be able to defend our country without doubt. I would want one committed to the proposition of peace. I would want one to share my commitment that we should not become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was directly threatened. I would want one who could withstand the pressures from special interest groups, including munitions manufacturers. I would want one who is an outstanding administrator, recognizing the complexities of the Defense Department organizational structure. I would want one who could reduce the involvement of the Defense Department in matters that can be equally well addressed by the civilian agencies of government, to remove the overlapping functions and singly address the Defense Department toward the capability to fight. I would want one who was willing to reduce waste in personnel allocations and also in unnecessary weapons systems that don't corollate with the long-range purposes of our own security and foreign policy. And one who could work harmoniously with the other Cabinet members. Those are some of the characteristics that come to mind at this moment.\n"", 'Q. Of the recent Secretaries of Defense, is there one that you have found you admire the most as a model for the job: Schlesinger, Melvin Laird, Clark Clifford or Robert McNamara?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I'm a little reluctant to choose one because of the implied criticism of the others. I think they all brought beneficial characteristics to the job—McNamara was coldly analytical, and I think operated under very difficult circumstances in Vietnam. Laird was much better able to work harmoniously with the Congress. I think Schlesinger was a brilliant strategist who was very independent, who thought he didn't have quite close enough relationships with the President and the Secretary of State to avoid public disharmonies, but I think a very competent, brilliant man. I wouldn't want to say who was my favorite.\n"", 'Q. Will the Joint Chiefs of Staff have a veto over military policy?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, the President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces and makes the ultimate decisions. It would be a violation of the Constitution if the ultimate decisions in an incident of disagreement between the President and the Joint Chiefs was resolved by the Joint Chiefs. I think I have enough knowledge of the military and enough of an adequate concept of the Presidency to avoid those conflicts. The Joint Chiefs would not be completely subservient to the President They have a responsibility on their shoulders to testify openly and I presume aggressively before the committees of Congress, and the Congress would make the ultimate decisions on weapons of war and on organizational matters. But I, as President, would not defer to the Joint Chiefs if I thought that my opinion was in the best interest of our country.\n', ""Q. Do you think the United States basically should look to buying enough military hardware for what is assessed as real strategic needs, or buy what's perceived as important in keeping up with the Soviets?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think the best approach is to buy what's necessary to meet the strategic security needs of our country and to meet our legitimate obligations to our allies.\n"", 'Q. In Georgia, you established a judicial nominating commission and selected judges from a list that had been submitted. Would you do the same as President in nominating judges?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Would you seek Supreme Court nominees of a certain ideological persuasion or bent?\n', ""Governor Carter. Among the few best qualified potential appointees that were available to me, I would probably choose the one that I thought was the most compatible with my own basic philosophy. That's the human thing to do, and I can't claim otherwise.\n"", 'Q. Would you look for Supreme Court Justices who had the same qualities of compassion and caring for people that you described for other types of appointees?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think so. There's a great deal of injustice that still exists in this country, and I believe that the final arbiter of that injustice is the Supreme Court. So I would look for that as an ultimate characteristic compatible with the guarantees in the Constitution, which in my opinion are designed to correct those same injustices.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor reform of the federal judiciary and court system anywhere near as comprehensive as what you were able to effect during your four years as Governor of Georgia?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I've only done an embryonic study of the federal judiciary, but the answer's yes. I believe that the speeches that have been made recently by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger are good indications that substantive organization is necessary. To the extent that it was appropriate, I would work closely with him and the other federal judicial leaders of the country in seeking far quicker trials, assured justice for equitable sentences, and a fair treatment of our people within the criminal justice system, without respect to wealth or social prestige or influence.\n"", ""Q. The strong self-confidence in yourself that everyone comments on— does that stem in part from the lonely but ultimately vindicated position your family took on race relations in the 1950's in south Georgia?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, I don't think you could take a particular instance in our family life and ascribe one's self-confidence in it. We've always had a closeknit, I think competent, family group, who shared major problems and opportunities and with a mutual purpose. Any observer of the campaign itself would say that my family and the strong support I got from my home state were the two factors I had that gave me a decided advantage over all my opponents. It's a mistake to exaggerate—we were probably drawn together as a family because there was some degree of isolation here.\n"", ""But then we had enough independence and enough stature in the community to prevent that isolation being a sacrifice or a danger. It wasn't a big factor of courage. I always felt southern people even in those days were searching for some way to get past the racial question, even though publicly they weren't ready to accept the rulings of the Supreme Court or HEW or civil rights laws or integration of churches. They were looking for a few people in the South—perhaps like myself—who were in a position of influence to speak frankly. There was not that vicious reaction against us that might otherwise have been there. I think southern people were ready for it.""]"
35,Jimmy Carter ,"July 19, 1976","['Q. How will your fall campaign compare with your campaign during the primaries?\n', 'Governor Carter. The careful planning, the broad scope of my effort, the complete commitment of myself and my family and supporters will be the same. It will be an all-out, very aggressive campaign. The major difference will be the harmonizing of our effort with that of other candidates who run as Democratic nominees for U.S. Senate, governor, Congress and lesser offices. I think that this will permit us to mutually strengthen one another, to acquaint the American people much more clearly with the principles of our party as expressed in a very good platform.\n', 'Q. Will it be more substantive? Less handshaking and more major speechmaking?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've made a major speech about once every 2 or 3 weeks on domestic or foreign policy, and I would guess that it would be still about one major speech of a different and comprehensive nature every 2 weeks. I would like to retain, as much as possible, the personal interrelationship with voters. It becomes more difficult with the larger and larger press and security entourage, but I would like to maintain that as much as I can. The explanation of specific platform commitments will be made jointly by me, by the Vice Presidential nominee, and by the major spokesmen in the party, so I think the cumulative effect of a presentation of the same themes will be much more effective.\n"", 'Q. So you would expect your Vice Presidential nominee to be talking about reorganization, and welfare reform, and tax reform as much as you do?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I think so. As the major spokesman, I will probably deal with the controversial issues between our party and the Republicans, obviously, but I'll divide the responsibilities with the Vice Presidential nominee so we can provide the American people with a much more all encompassing explanation of what our administration will do.\n"", 'Q. What do you see as the major issues? The ones you articulated in the primaries?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think there'll be a shift toward foreign policy. There'll be a shift toward the failures of the present administration. There will be a shift toward White House-Congress cooperation and the prospects of that cooperation if the Democrats are in the White House.\n"", 'Q. Where will you campaign?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would be foolish to promise to go into every state. I would never do that. But I don't intend to yield any states. Either I, the members of my family, or the Vice President and his family, will cover every geographical region of the nation and I'll be moving very rapidly and constantly from one part of the country to another ... I think the strategy for specific state time allotments could not be fully decided until after the Republicans identify their candidate. But I would have an excellent chance to win Michigan against Ford or California against Reagan.\n"", 'Q. Will your campaign vary depending on whether Ford or Reagan is nominated?\n', ""Governor Carter. Slightly. We'll leave a minimal amount of flexibility in my time allotments among states, as we did in the primaries. Our original strategy was fairly well carried out in spite of changing circumstances and changing opponents in the latter stages of the primary campaigns. There will be some flexibility that will be built in for the general election and that flexibility would be to accommodate the identity of the Republican nominee.\n"", ""Q. But you won't name the individual states?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No; I think that would be inappropriate. It's obvious that the very large states—New York and California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania—would be important and hard fought no matter who the Republicans would have as their leader ... Whether we spent more time in Texas or more time in Michigan or whether we spent more time in New York or more time in California might be determined by the identity of the nominee of the Republicans.\n"", 'Q. Do you have special plans for your two weakest areas, the East and West coasts?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't say what specific things because the platform planks, the thrust of our issue presentation, would be fairly uniform throughout the country. I think the emphasis would be derived from the amount of time that I spend, or the Vice Presidential nominee spends, and the placement of advertising media—but not thematic emphasis.\n"", 'Q; Would Reagan or Ford be easier for you to beat?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think it's really a tossup, and I don't have any preference. I can see differences. Ford would have all the advantages of the incumbency. He would be much more able, I think, to unify the party behind his campaign. Reagan is an accomplished actor, he's superbly used to television. His support is much more fervent, and he's from outside of Washington.\n"", 'Q. You used to say that you thought Reagan would be easier to defeat than Ford because he is divisive candidate. Do you still think that?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't say that any more. Obviously Reagan's strength in the political process as contrasted with Ford's has been greater than I had thought, as proven by the Republican race itself.\n"", 'Q. Will you be traveling immediately after the convention?\n', ""Governor Carter. Very little. I've had several heads of state who want to meet with me following the convention. I'll be meeting with task groups to assess how we can best complete my promises and how we can best incorporate the staff of the Members of Congress with my own staff members and volunteers, to put together comprehensive proposals of tax reform and welfare reform and 15 or 20 other major issues. And we'll also be dividing up the responsibilities between my own campaign and that of the Vice President. In fact, that will probably commence before the Vice Presidential nominee leaves New York.\n"", 'Q. Your aides say that you are already preparing a legislative program.\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; if I am elected, we'll be ready with a complete post-election transitional plan. I would want to move aggressively and rapidly to correct some of the nation's problems, to restore the elements of leadership, to coordinate the functions of the different branches of government and be ready to be a good President. One very good benefit that accrues from that is that I'll be able to assess the relative qualities of people who helped me during the planning period, so that when I am elected, I will know which persons to ask to help me as President in major Cabinet posts and in hundreds and hundreds of lesser posts which I'll be called upon to fill.\n"", 'Q. Can you say who in Congress is helping you with the program?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, not yet, that will come a little later. I don't want to put them in an embarrassing position. But we've started identifying with the help of the congressional leaders the particular Members of Congress— the House and Senate—who are knowledgeable about energy, agriculture, health, education, welfare, taxation, and so forth, and have contacted or begun to contact those congressional members to ask them to let their staffs work with us, so that we can have as much benefit from their experience in the legislative field as possible.\n"", 'Q. Are you worried that the convention may be boring?\n', ""Governor Carter. If I had my choice between having a boring convention because the contest for the nomination is over, or having an exciting convention because I still had a major political battle, I would choose the boring convention. I think it's going to be a good convention. I hope that the people of the country are in a sober enough mood, and an inquisitive enough mood so they'll be interested in the platform commitments, the analysis of the Democratic Party principles, the presentation to the public of other leaders in the party who'll be joining me in the next administration—if we are successful. It'll be a good convention.\n"", 'Q. Many Presidents have talked about making the Vice Presidency meaningful. What makes you think you can bring it off?\n', ""Governor Carter. In the first place, I don't believe that I would ever feel threatened by the stature or the competence or intelligence or fame of a Vice President. I think the Presidency itself is such a powerful office that there is no reason to feel threatened. Second, in the complexities of a modem technological world with the changes coming so rapidly, a President needs more and more to have someone with official status on whom he can rely for ceremonial functions, for dealing with the Congress, for the carrying out of major campaign commitments, for dealing with international matters. And because of the time that's been allotted to me, when I make a choice, I will have chosen the person I think is best qualified and most compatible with me—and this would help to insure his use in the future. And the last thing is that I have promised the prospective nominees that they would play a major role, and I would not break my promise to them or to the people.""]"
36,Jimmy Carter ,"July 19, 1976","['Q. Some polls indicated that your support, while broad, is rather thin, and there is resistance, for example, among some Catholics and union leaders. How do you propose to deal with this?\n', ""Governor Carter. A lot of it has been derived from the tough combat between me and the 12 or 15 other major Democratic candidates. We've been emphasizing one another's weaknesses. We've not emphasized the compatibilities among us and the basic principles of our party.\n"", ""Q. You're saying these elements will probably join you as the general election campaign progresses?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes. In fact, there is a tremendous amount of that already among my previous opponents, mayors, governors, U.S. Congressmen and Senators.\n', 'Q. Do you think you will have any different approach to campaigning depending on whether Ford or Reagan is nominated by the Republicans?\n', ""Governor Carter. I doubt it. The issue would be to some degree, on one hand, the radical, perhaps dangerous nature of Ronald Reagan's character, and on the other hand, the absence of strong leadership capability on the part of Ford.\n"", 'Q. What kind of President do you want to be?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'd like to be a President who is both competent and inspirational, who could be incisive in his analysis of the major problems of our nation, who could arouse support for the solution of those problems among a broad bas? of American citizens. I'd like to arrive at a maximum degree of harmony.\n"", 'Q. But what kind of mark would you like to leave on the country?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've studied the finer aspects of previous administrations: the easing of fear by the Roosevelt Administration, the humility and courage and tenacity of Mr. Truman's Administration, the inspiration of Kennedy, the elimination of discrimination and inequity by the Johnson Administration. I would like to exemplify the finest aspects of each one of those great Presidents of the past. Whether that would be possible it is too early to say, but that's my goal.\n"", 'Q. What should the country look for, assuming you are elected, in terms of appointments?\n', 'Governor Carter. Cabinet members in my administration will be independent, competent managers, advocates for the Americans served by their own departments, able to share with me the responsibilities of evolving long-range, consistent purposes for the administration. I do not intend to run the affairs of government through the White House staff.\n', 'Q. What would you do to reduce the imperial qualities of the Presidency?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would want to do everything I could to retain a closeness with the people by having a sunshine law in Washington, fireside chats, frequent or constant communication with the leaders of Congress and thorough explorations of the controversial matters that affect us—such as energy, transportation, elements of foreign affairs, defense—so that people think they are part of the government, part of the White House.\n', 'Q. Many people in this coalition of yours feel very strongly about some important issues, and you are going to have to make decisions that will antagonize one group or another.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, so be it. I would like everyone in the country to be acting in harmony, but I don't expect it. When I was governor, some extremely controversial decisions came up—abortion, amnesty, gun control, the death penalty, government reorganization, prison reform. I never had any problems making decisions forcefully, calling on the people to support my position. I think there is a great inclination on the part of the American people to yield to some degree in order to realize major achievements of which our nation is capable. I don't think I'll ever be tentative.""]"
37,Jimmy Carter ,"July 22, 1976","['The questioners were William Randolph Hearst, Jr., editor in chief; Donald 1. Rogers, economic editor; J. Kingsbury-Smith, national editor; Marianne Means, Washington columnist; and William McCullam, chief editorial writer.\n', 'Hearst. First of all, thanks for coming.\n', 'Governor Carter. I am glad to come.\n', ""Hearst. We very much appreciate it and I don't want to forget to congratulate you on the sweep you made of your party and the cleaning up you did. It is a hell of an accomplishment. It must be really unique in American political history.\n"", ""I bet you, as well as we, are bothered with the fact that a lot of people seem to be unsure of where you stand on some issues. They quote you, sometimes, that you say one thing one day and then the opposite the next day, but—and then—politicians—hell's bells, you are not the first one to do it.\n"", 'I am going to try and give you a question. For example, you have said that you expect to balance the budget by 1980 and hold inflation under 4 percent. At the same time, though, you actually supported the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, which I think Mr. Hawkins himself estimated will cost $40 billion annually, and Teddy Kennedy expanded. And the national health program, which ought to go another $50 billion or more. Pretty near $100 billion annually.\n', 'How do you propose to spend that much more money and balance the budget? We have all been through the English thing. I am scared, as a businessman.\n', ""Governor Carter. The Humphrey-Hawkins bill, as it was originally introduced, I did not support it. As you know, it is still in committee at the House and Senate. As the Humphrey-Hawkins bill has been amended—I don't know whether you kept up with it or not, we have—it presently calls not for a flat 3 percent total unemployment rate at the end of 18 months, but a 3 percent adult unemployment rate at the end of 4 years, which is about a 4 1/2 percent unemployment rate.\n"", 'Also, we believe—by we, I mean myself and a large group of economic advisers, including some that you might know, the members of the conference board, Mr. Summers Klein, he heads up the Wharton School of Business and is one of the top economists of the world, a Nobel Prize winner, and three or four others—that is, 8 or 10 others.\n', 'We have made projections that with the 4/2 percent unemployment rate at the end of the first term, 4 years, and with a normal growth and gross national product of 4 to 6 percent, and it is presently running at a rate in excess of that, that the inflation rate could be about in the neighborhood of 4 to 5 percent.\n', 'That we could meet all of my own commitments on expenditures and have a balanced budget as you described. This projection has been confirmed by the Wharton School of Business, and I think there is a unanimous agreement among those who advise me on economics, no matter how liberal or conservative, that it is a good and reasonable suggestion.\n', 'I have never adopted any sort of health plan that was equivalent to the Kennedy-Corman bill. I think I am the only Democratic candidate who did not. I do favor comprehensive health care, phased in over a period of time, I would say 3 to 4 years. It would involve a heavier emphasis on prevention of disease, a much heavier use of non-physicians to deliver health care and better distribution of health care throughout the country, not just in the more affluent communities.\n', ""We now spend $550 for every man, woman and child in this country on health care and I would guess that the total health care package would not be substantially in excess of that expenditure. It might be derived from different sources in some areas but it wouldn't be a $40 or $50 billion increase in health expenditures.\n"", ""Hearst. You don't favor that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, sir; I don't. We have also a commitment to have careful long-range planning, to reorganization of the structure of government, to adequate financing of new programs that are put forward with the 5 year projection of cost of service to be run to different recipients on the correlation between the business, between labor and agricultural communities of government.\n"", 'I would have, I think, an ability to manage a government in a businesslike way, as you manage your own newspapers and other periodical producaction, as [I did as] Governor of Georgia. And I think that the projections are reasonable that we made.\n', 'Hearst. You couldn\'t just get into, ""It costs money, only ...""\n', ""Governor Carter. I wouldn't do that. Any new programs put forward by myself, with the Congress, I would estimate as accurately as possible the cost for at least a 5 year period and provide financing when the program was put forward.\n"", 'Smith. I have a question on the subject of foreign policy which relates to nuclear weapons. It is in three parts:\n', 'Under what circumstances would you, as President, order the use of strategic nuclear weapons?\n', 'Do you think that the United States should, if necessary, risk its own nuclear destruction to save Western Europe from Soviet military conquest, and do you foresee any circumstances on which we would be justified in resorting to first strike with nuclear weapons, strategic or tactical?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know the answer to those questions. I think it would be inappropriate to spell out precisely what circumstances might prevail that would cause me to use atomic weapons.\n"", 'The only general response I can give is that if I was convinced that the security or existence of our own nation was threatened, under those circumstances I would use atomic weapons.\n', 'The agreements that we have in Europe are binding on us; they have been agreements that have been ratified by the President, past Presidents, and the Congress and the American people and our NATO allies, of course.\n', 'Although we have substantial control over the nuclear weaponry in Europe, the use of atomic weapons in Europe would certainly not be contemplated by me without agreement of the nations who would be most directly affected by retaliatory actions using nuclear weapons on the Soviet Union.\n', ""I certainly couldn't imagine us using nuclear weapons in Europe without Germany and Austria and perhaps France approving their use.\n"", ""There again we are committed, along with European nations, to the balance of power being maintained with nuclear weapons as a major factor. We can't equal the Soviet Union now in the number of troops or tanks or airplanes in Europe, and never have since the Second World War was over; and the stand-off strength between us and the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons, where both of us have substantial overkill capabilities, is a major deterrent to war in Europe.\n"", 'If there was a massive invasion in Europe by the Soviet Union, I think the likelihood would be that atomic weapons would be used. My own belief is that limited nuclear war would be unlikely. I have read some of the statements made by Soviet leaders, and I think their commitment to limited nuclear war is very doubtful.\n', 'We have predicated a lot of our new weaponry acquisitions on the premise that we need to have both first-strike capability and also retaliatory capability with a presumption that massive strategic attacks on population centers would not follow. That certainly is a possibility but I think a doubtful one.\n', 'Preemptive strike, again, would only be used, just to keep my answer deliberately in very general terms, if I was convinced that the existence or the security of our nation was threatened.\n', 'Rogers. Governor Carter, you have addressed the problem of housing, both public and private, at various times during the campaign. I wonder if you could be specific about some of your plans for housing and, more specifically, the problem that seems to be present for young people. My three young sons inform me that young Americans feel quite turned off. They feel they will never be able to afford to buy a home. Prices are so high and the requirements of down payments are so tough.\n', 'Do you have any specific plans for meeting this problem?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, I think so. I have three sons, all of whom are married. One lives in a rented apartment in Atlanta; one lives in a private home that they purchased in Calhoun, Georgia, and another one lives in a mobile home in Plains that they bought. So, there again, I have the same acquaintance and knowledge of the housing problem that you have derived from your own children.\n', 'I think there is no industry that I can think of in the country that would have a more greatly magnified beneficial effect on employment and general stimulus of the country than housing. Here we have suffered because of an inadequate commitment on the part of the federal government to constraints and predictable housing policy.\n', 'We have got developers who would like to build homes, and 600,000 construction workers who want to go back to work, and lenders who want to lend money for better housing. But I think last year we only completed about 1 million housing units, whereas normal would be 2 million per year, and the goal established by Mr. Nixon before he impounded housing funds was 2J4 million per year.\n', 'So, the dormancy there, lack of aggressiveness, is derived to a substantial degree by an unpredictable federal housing policy. I think, again, we could spend money in housing to a minimal degree and have greater magnified beneficial effects in the guarantee of mortgages by public and private guarantors. If this was constant and predictable, this would help a great deal. It has been pretty well subverted lately.\n', 'I also favor the reconstitution of some that have been successful; 202 housing for older people, for instance. Then the renovation and subsequent sale of homes in downtown areas. Several cities have done this quite successfully. Baltimore has a very good program where they have reconstituted housing at an average cost of $12 to $13 a square foot and subsequently sold the housing for families and have a long waiting list.\n', 'It costs about $27 to $30 a square foot for urban renewal projects to build a housing unit. I think that would be a good investment of funds.\n', ""In addition, I think we need to buikl some low cost rent units. When I came home from the Navy in 1953 I didn't have any money, and I had three little children, the oldest of whom was in the first grade. I moved into the government housing projects, cinderblock housing in Plains. It is still there.\n"", ""My rent was $31 a month, and the first year, 1954, I didn't make enough net profit to pay my house rent. I made less than $300 the first year.\n"", 'I know how much it meant to me just to have a place to rent. I think we ought to construct low cost rental homes or apartments.\n', ""The other point is that I would favor some sort of interest subsidy. We could set a level, I don't know exactly what level should be maintained. I would say 7 percent as an arbitrary figure. So, that on a long-term mortgage for 25 years or more or less, that any excessive interest charges that would accrue from government policies or worldwide economic circumstances would be absorbed by the federal government so that a family could purchase a home with a reasonably sure knowledge of what the monthly payments would be.\n"", 'Those are some of the things that could be done. They are not extraordinary, not radical. Most all have been tested. The major element would be the predictability and sureness and constancy of it. I think this would help a great deal.\n', 'Rogers. Would you describe that as an open-end mortgage, so to speak, with the government picking up the lag?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir.\n', 'McCullam.

Do you feel it still merits our support, financially and morally, in view of some of the things that have occurred there recently, which are disgraceful, at least in my opinion, or is there a better alternative?

I think that, contrasting the present function of the United Nations with its original concept in 1946, it has not measured up to the expectations.\n', 'The idea was that the United Nations would be a viable organization with a relatively small number of sovereign nations negotiating in the General Assembly for a unified purpose, and for the Security Council to be the entity that would effectuate those agreements.\n', ""I don't think anybody anticipated that in the 30 years following the establishment of the United Nations that we would have 100 new nations formed.

Ambassador], we saw very vividly the possible use of the United Nations as a forum to express our ideas. I think he was ill advised on some of the things he said but I think he was a very vivid advocate of his, and the nation's purposes, and the politicians wanted the United Nations as a forum for the expression of ideas.\n"", 'I think we could strengthen the United Nations considerably. I would, first of all, put the person that I thought was the best diplomatic official in the United Nations.\n', 'McCullam. Can you suggest any name?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, sir; I wouldn't suggest names. But I would like to have someone that I thought would have a worldwide acceptance as being a superb spokesman for our country. I would also make sure that the world would know, and make sure it was accurate, that the United Nations Ambassador spoke for me as President and for the Secretary of State so there would be no semblance of doubt that this was the voice erf the United States when a major statement was made.\n"", 'I would strengthen our relationship with the other members of the United Nations by dealing bilaterally with the smaller and developing nations of the world.

We seem to come out on the short end of the stick time and again, because the United Nations is used as a propaganda agency by our ideological enemies in this world, and they outnumber us, and outvote us; they pull outrageous stunts time and again for propaganda purposes.

I think that is getting into a speech.\n', ""Governor Carter. That may be inevitable, but I don't think so. Part of the fault is ours. We have relegated it to that in international affairs and I think in doing that we contributed to the quality you describe. It may be that my assessment is more sanguine than is justified, but I would make a major effort as President to elevate the importance of the United Nations, still retaining, of course, a veto power within the Security Council to make sure they didn't carry out any actions that were contrary to the best interests of our country.\n"", 'Means.

My polls do not indicate that, but there is a general feeling that------\n', 'Means. The polls have been published.\n', 'Governor Carter. In the post-election analyses, following Pennsylvania and Ohio and Illinois and other states, we have done very well among Catholic voters.

You think that it is more important than the so-called cultural gap between your religions?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't tell which would be the most important cultural gap. As I campaigned around the country, I haven't detected any lack of support or concern among Catholics as a group. The only group with whom I have had very serious difficulties in the primaries has been the Jewish voters. I always come out very short among Jewish voters as I campaigned, primarily, I guess, because one of my major opponents was Senator Jackson who has very strong support there.\n"", 'At this point, because of some of the statements of some of the Catholic leaders, some of them as you know refused to give the benediction during the convention because of the platform, we do have a problem.

You have two directly conflicting elements in the problem. One is the illegality of the entry into our country and the competition among undocumented workers competing with citizens of our country on the one hand and the other one is that some of these families have been here 15 or 20 years and they are citizens in every sense except the legal sense and they always have been welcomed by employers; not just those who want to cheat them but those who have depended on them.\n', 'The only approach I know is one that has been put forward almost unanimously by the people I have discussed and Congressman Rodino, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has this under his responsibility.\n', 'And that is to recognize to some degree, or document to make legal, the working of those who are already here or put it off at some date, and then to put on the employers the responsibility of not giving employment to others, and that there be a fairly heavy criminal or civil penalty for an employer who gave a job to someone who did not have the proper documents.\n', ""I don't know of any alternative to that.

Governor, how do you intend to pay for what you plan to do in the job creation, health, energy, and social welfare fields and by what specific measures do you plan to bring about a balanced budget in 1980?\n', ""Governor Carter. I tried to address that earlier in my first answer. I can't give you any sure response. In the first place, I am going to administer the affairs of government in a tough, I believe, competent, businesslike way.\n"", ""I am going to reorganize a structure of government to make sure that we don't have the present ineffective administration. I am going to institute zero-base budgeting the first week I am in the White House as an executive decision. This does not require action by the Congress.\n"", ""It's a budgeting technique I used throughout my term in Georgia effectively. Others have documented it now. The effectiveness does not depend on the scale or scope of its production, no difference if it's a state or city.\n"", '[With] unzero, you have overlapping or duplication of programs. [With zero-base, you have] elimination of the obsolete; automatic reassessment of priorities on an annual basis.\n', 'I would also proceed with the requirement as I expressed earlier that as we initiate new programs there has to be a long-term commitment to their financing. Congress has to face the fact that we cannot continue to spend money in new programs without providing new mechanism for payment.\n', 'I think this would be a conservative approach to government, and I think, advisable. We have got to have some inevitable increase in revenues built in, as you know, that always occur on an annual basis, and those increases in revenues would be allotted by me to areas where I thought the need was greatest.\n', 'There [has] been in the past, I think, an ability to correlate low unemployment rates with relatively low inflation rates. Historically, they have gone more hand-in-hand than they have been in contravention, one to another.\n', ""But I can't give you a specific answer in addition to proper management and screening out of old programs. I will give you one specific example that I think is important just to illustrate the point.\n"", 'We have 72 agencies in the federal government responsible for physical health care. I think 37 responsible for mental health. We have Medicaid and Medicare in another one. Neither one of those agencies are related to health.\n', 'As we implement a health program in the country over a 3 or 4 year period, commensurate with that would be a reorganization of health care. If we put in a perfect bill for comprehensive health care in this country and kept the existing organizational structure, administrative structure, that would almost mean it would be ineffective and costly.\n', 'So to define responsibility would be a great help. I can only refer back to the analysis advice I have gotten from economists who helped me at Harvard and MIT, at the Wharton School in Pennsylvania and in the conference board and I believe that unanimously they agreed that under normal circumstances that we can carry out all the programs that I have made and have the budget balanced by the time you have described.\n', 'Rogers. Governor, it looks as though inflation is going to return with a vengence during the last half of this year. Both food prices and the already mandated energy increases. Assume that you are going to be facing double digit inflation when you take office, what would be your immediate plan to counteract that?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe that we will have as high as a 10 percent inflation rate by January, but the inflation rate is going up. I recognize that.\n"", ""I don't know how to answer your question with that supposition. If we had a 10 percent inflation rate what would I do?\n"", ""Rogers. Let's say 8 or 9 or somewhere. A higher inflation rate.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think at the beginning the only inevitable commodity that's going to increase in price is food.\n"", ""I believe that historically, over a long period of time, the demand for food as contrasted with the world's capacity for production is going to increase the price of food no matter what we do. I think our country might benefit as being the only major country now in the world that has assured export capability.\n"", ""Of course when we export food on a world market, prices are going to go up. That's built in. I don't think we can do anything about that.\n"", 'There obviously are ways to help control inflationary pressures by controlling the supply of money.\n', 'Here, I think that the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, the Treasury Secretary and myself, plus at least the Finance and Ways and Means chairmen in the Senate and the House would have to try to jointly control [that] through tax measures and through available supplies of money on inflationary prices.\n', 'I would personally like to have standby wage and price control authority. I doubt that I would ever use it. But I would like to have the authority that existed 4 or 5 years ago. I think this would probably help and be a restraining affect.\n', 'A constraint on governmental expenditures would certainly become a much more heavy factor, and I think this would probably affect the rapidity of effectuating a health care system, among others; if the inflation rate was that high.\n', 'There would be another factor and that is the expenditure of federal funds for capital improvements, rapid transit systems, highways. I would have to make a tradeoff there between job availability and inflation.\n', 'The general presumption that I have and still maintain is that until we get down in the neighborhood of 5 percent unemployment plus or minus a half percent, that could only be judged as the time approached, that the efforts to increase employment would not have a—would not be a major factor on an inflation rate.\n', ""Commodity supplies would be one additional source of high inflationary pressures.

At this point I don't favor that.\n"", 'I would try to build about one Trident submarine per year. I think we are getting into a dangerous position with respect to the Soviet Union on that naval strength.\n', 'The Soviet Union has made a major commitment in recent years to get away from a confrontation with too many weapons and maybe by the use of surrogates and they have committed themselves to worldwide influence to the naval forces.\n', ""They have had a rapid escalation in the strength of their navy.

They are almost completely invulnerable to missile attack and their deterrent value is superb.\n', 'With the MIRV missiles we have now, we have a vast security strength [compared] to the Soviet Union. They are overcoming that superiority by their own missiles.\n', 'I think the amount of money we could save as compared to present projections would be in the neighborhood of 5 percent, $5 billion or $7 billion.\n', 'I think we have got an overly costly personnel system in the Navy and other Armed Forces now, more admirals and generals than we had in the Second World War when we had 11 million people in uniform. In our instructional force there is an extraordinary number of instructors, less than two students per instructor are in the military now.\n', 'There is excessive duplication among the different services for the same function. We have got in addition to that, I think, a very costly commitment to duplication of weapons systems.\n', 'I would be very cautious about military cutbacks. I think that we have seen the percentage of our gross national product going into defense drop substantially and I think the percentage there is not excessive.

You struck a theme of justice in your acceptance speech. Would you elaborate on that. Will it be major?\n', 'Governor Carter. It is a theme that exists in the minds of the American people and therefore will be important in the campaign. A lot of people feel that they get cheated in the allocation of government services, in the administration of criminal justice, and in the income tax system, in their access to government, in job availabilities.

I have never met an Israeli leader, President or previous Prime Minister, or any defense leaders or foreign executives who ever advocated under any circumstances the sending of American troops to Israel.\n', ""I think that we should pursue aggressively the general provisions of the United Nations Resolution 242, and I think we ought to use whatever influence we have through the Soviet Union and directly, with Arab nations through our own friendship with them, through trade agreements, and through other means to get them to recognize Israel's right to exist and to be willing to declare a nonbelligerency status against Israel.\n"", 'The resolution calls for the Arab nation to negotiate with Israel directly and I think that would be a matter that we should seek. In the absence of that willingness on the part of the Arab nations, we should offer our services as an equal third party, as was the case in the Sinai agreement, which I thought was a good step forward.\n', ""Ultimately, of course, Israel will have to withdraw from major portions of territory captured by them in the 1967 war. That should be done on a quid pro quo basis. There are some exceptions that I would personally recognize. One is I don't think that Israel is going to relinquish to the Syrians direct control of the Golan Heights overlooking the Sea of Galilee and the valley there. I would not And I think that Israel is going to be reluctant, and I would support their reluctance, to relinquish control again of the Christian and Jewish Holy places in Old Jerusalem.\n"", 'The legitimate interest of Palestinians is probably the most important aspect of the Middle East settlement.

Difficulties in countries dominated by the Soviet Union is something we ought to exploit. We have done that successfully in the case of Egypt.\n"", ""As far as having a secret conclusion, I just don't have it. I would believe that ultimately, if Israel and the surrounding countries would trust us, know about our complete commitment to the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state in peace; if that was a premise on which everyone made decisions, I would like to involve as many nations as I could in the conformation of an ultimate settlement.\n"", 'I have seen from my own personal relationships with some of the leaders that quite often their private willingness to yield on a controversial issue greatly exceeds their public willingness to yield on that same controversy, and that is understandable because they want to keep as many negotiating points as they can.\n', 'We ought to be constantly probing for some mutuality of purpose there. I would not be adverse to a step-by-step approach if it was the only alternative.

Governor, if New York City or any other American city should suffer financial collapse or was approaching that stage during a Carter Administration, what kind of help could they expect from the White House?\n', 'Governor Carter. I spelled out a fairly comprehensive attitude toward the cities of our country both in my speech to the Mayors Conference in Milwaukee this past month, and also in my discussions with Mayor Beame which I believe were highly public.

In the first place, there is no predictability about the degree of participation on the part of the federal government in education, social problems, health, transportation, law enforcement, pollution control, and this would help a great deal.\n', ""As a governor, I know that I can't tell 6 months ahead of time what is. going to be required from my state. As I prepare my budget, it would extend 18 months in the future. I would like to freeze or approximately maintain the constant level, the participation of the state and local governments in the cost of health care and welfare cost, reduce substantially the contribution of local governments and over a period of time reduce also the contribution of state governments on a percentage basis, maybe by holding their present dollar level constant.\n"", 'I personally believe that revenue sharing money should go directly to the cities. That it should be used for programs that would apply to matched federal funds. This would let revenue sharing money to be used for human needs.\n', ""As we have housing programs financed in part or wholly by the federal government, and also law enforcement programs and others, I would like to insure that the federal money goes where the need is the greatest. In the past we haven't had this assurance, and quite often suburban areas that are more articulate and better organized and more influential have taken by default a major portion of the benefit derived from programs that were initiated in downtown urban areas.\n"", 'I think we can learn a great deal from cities like Savannah, Georgia, which has reconstituted the downtown areas of their own communities when they were destined for destruction 15 or 20 years or more. I mentioned earlier the rebuilding or renovation of downtown housing areas.\n', 'Another thing that can be done that would help would be to try to encourage through tax incentives or otherwise, investments in the downtown areas. Now we have got a problem of trying to move the central city unemployed people out in the suburbs to work. I think with the persuasion of the White House and possibly some tax incentives that industry would be encouraged to stay in the downtown area. Transportation allocation would help a great deal also.\n', ""I think there is a lot that city governments can do. It took me about 15 minutes longer to get here from the airport than we had projected earlier because on a five or six lane street, there ordinarily—in downtown New York this morning, one lane was open for traffic. You have got parking on both sides of the street, double parking on both sides, with permanent parking on the outside and temporary parking on the next level. There's a lot that can be done now. Those are some of the things that can help alleviate the problem. I think the long-range policy that can be used by business or industry or labor, is for local or state governments to make their own plans, put forward to show what the federal government was going to do in those necessary elements of human life, would be the greatest single step to be taken. ...\n"", ""I would like to point out to you something that you already observed.

38,Jimmy Carter ,"July 27, 1976","['Governor Carter. I thought we had a very productive session with the advisers on defense policy. The major overall objective of the session yesterday was to see how to coordinate much more clearly the preparation of the overall national budget—our ultimate foreign affairs commitments— with defense policy. Most of the advisers who were here today have been involved either as technicians or as specialists or in some major capacity in the Defense Department. And they expressed their frustration, from their past close working relationship, that a budget for the Defense Department is prepared in the absence of coordination with the foreign policy leaders— the Secretary of State and others.', ""And everyone agrees that this has to be a major responsibility of the President himself. That when you have either the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense attempting to coordinate efforts between the two major department staffs, it is an impossibility. It's been tried in the past and failed. But I am determined that if I should become President that this would be well coordinated in the initial stages of the preparation of the budget for these major departments."", 'There was also an expression of concern that our agriculture policy, our foreign trade, the functions of the Commerce Department, which are heavily involved, as you know, along with many others in the federal government, with foreign affairs, has never been coordinated with the establishment and confirmation of our foreign policy.', ""The second major thing that we discussed yesterday was our commitments of troops overseas. I think there was an unanimous agreement that our commitments to NATO, which have been confirmed repeatedly by Congress, the President and the American people, will have to be sustained. The NATO commitment needs to be reassessed. This has not been done since 1967. And as I mentioned in my last foreign policy address, the advance technologies that have evolved in the last 7 or 8 year period has called for a reassessment of the basic sharing of the responsibilities among the nations involved in NATO, certainly including ourselves. There was unequivocal commitment on everybody's part that the relative strength of the NATO countries has to be maintained vis-a-vis the strength of die Eastern European and Soviet Union forces."", 'The same agreement was unanimous with respect to our present commitment in Japan. We have about 25,000 troops in Japan proper, and 1 think about 35,000 additional troops in Okinawa. As an aftermath of the Second World War, these commitments have been ratified over and over. Our position about maintaining the concept was reconfirmed, I think, unanimously, yesterday that over a period of time, often with careful consultation with the South Korean and Japanese Governments, we could very well reduce our ground forces there over a 4 or 5 year period, withdrawing them completely but maintaining adequate air cover for South Korea. And I think that this, if done within that time schedule, would be a good move. We now have about 42,000 troops in South Korea.', ""The next point that we discussed was the ineffectiveness of our nation's Reserve Forces. As a governor who attended National Guard training sessions every summer, and as one who has had military training on a professional basis, I am quite concerned about the absence of a proper role for the Reserve Forces. Both the regular Reserve Forces and also the National Guard. There was a great deal of concern expressed by Mr. Vance, Mr. Wamke, Mr. Nitze, and others that served in the Defense Department, about a shift toward a much more highly trained, much more effective and much more crucial role to be played by our Reserve Forces. And the political obstacles that have been placed in the path of making changes have been considered by them to be almost insurmountable. My own belief is that the President, the Defense Department leaders, and the governors should be involved in the initial stages of planning for the strengthening and the most helpful coordination of the Reserve Forces. That is to be a major objective of mine, and I think it is something that I will be commenting on throughout the campaign."", ""The next discussion was on manpower. I've mentioned many times about the heavy overburden of excessive rank in the military forces. This so-called grade creep is almost inevitable unless strong leadership is exerted to prevent it and to undo it. We've got a highly excessive percentage of our total Armed Forces in the higher ranks and this must be reversed. We also need to have some attention given as to how manpower can be expended in a more effective way. One example, of many we discussed, was longer assignment times on a particular post for those who serve in the military, and a substantial reduction in the amount of transit time and the amount of time spent in the Armed Forces in training programs. We've now got less than two students per instructor in the military, and a reassessment of these commitments will be a very good project to undertake."", ""The last point that we discussed was arms transfers or the sale of military weapons overseas. We've now become the major supplier of the weapons systems of all kinds to foreign countries—to the so-called neutral countries, those who have relationships between us and the Soviet Union, to our own dose allies and friends, historically speaking, and those, sometimes, who have not publicly expressed animosity toward us. I think that arms sales in the last 10 years have increased from about $1 billion per year to now close to $12 billion per year. And I believe very strongly—I think that belief was shared almost unanimously yesterday—that the next President should move to reduce arms sales abroad. We ought to assess every arms sales policy on an individual nation basis. In other words, if we think the sale of arms can better preserve peace in a portion of the world, and carry out our committed foreign policy, then let the arms sales be made on that basis alone. Not just to try to secure sales of our products or to give us an advantageous balance-of- trade ratio."", 'The most important single impression that all of us got yesterday was the inevitable devastation of any nuclear war. American leaders and private citizens of all kinds tend to forget, as time passes, the unbelievable destruction to human beings that would result from any sort of nuclear war. Even if we could insure that the war would be ""limited in nature,"" it would still face the prospect of approximately 10 million Americans being killed if an attack was made on our country. And an equivalent number, perhaps even a greater number, would be killed if a limited war, so-called, was permitted to occur in Europe. In an all-out war, the 10 million Americans that would be killed Would increase to 200 million. Obviously, these figures are unconscionable and almost unbelievable. But they are true. And when we change the phraseology, talking about 40-megaton capability for our atomic submarines or 800-megaton capability for our fixed-silo ICBM\'s or 800 megatons for our bomber fleet, we forget that in human terms this is an unbelievable degree of death.', ""So the major purpose of our country, obviously, is to continue to be the preservation of peace and the security of our country. But the holocaust that would result from any sort of nuclear weapons use was very vividly impressed on everyone's mind yesterday."", 'Those are some of the points that we discussed. I would like to ask Senator Mondale if there are additional things.', ""Senator Mondale. I might just make one point, and that is the principle of rough equivalence. It would be our hope that the Soviet Union could be persuaded in serious negotiations with the United States to restrain on an agreed basis from deployment both in numbers and in quality of so-called strategic armaments. And that both nations could slowly negotiate downward the outer limits of the numbers of such weapons, the outer limits of new technological deployments of such weapons. It's that way, that together we can reduce our defense budget, increase our security, and increase the prospects of getting along with each other. The Soviet Union should know, and when I spoke to Soviet leaders a few years ago I said as much, that the United States is not going to be in a position where we unilaterally find ourselves in a posture where our defense is not credible. But we will be fully prepared in practical and hardheaded negotiations to reduce those ceilings downward so that both nations may use those resources for human needs and at the same time reduce international tensions."", 'Governor Carter. Does anyone have a question about these matters first?', 'Q. Governor, could I ask you, in your campaign obviously you are going to have to address this, can you tell us whether the defense budget you will be recommending in your campaign will be roughly equivalent to the present budget, somewhat higher, or somewhat lower?', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question yet. My belief, which has not been shaken, is that compared to the present defense budget, as it evolves from one year to another, no matter what the level is, that a savings can be realized of roughly 5 percent through some of the changes that I've advocated over a long period of time. But I can't give you at this point an exact figure for the next year or the following year's defense budget."", 'Q. I take it the savings may be eaten up by the need for development of weapons or other matters?', ""Governor Carter. No matter what the level of the defense budget might be, to give us an adequate security force. The changes in the deployment of our Armed Forces, reduction in troops overseas, a change in the personnel policies of our country, an elimination of unnecessary functions of the Defense Department, all that can still result in the savings that I've outlined—$5 to $7 billion, which would be about 5 percent."", ""So within the framework of what I and Senator Mondale and Congress and our defense and foreign affairs leaders think our needs should be, the changes that I've advocated could make us have a more efficient and singular purpose in the Defense Department and could result in a savings."", ""Q. I'd like to ask you again, if I may, if you think the United States should achieve a first-strike capability, as that term is used by weapons managers today?"", ""Governor Carter. When you say first-strike capability, obviously we now have, and so does the Soviet Union have, the ability to make a first strike and create devastation on the enemy. There is no way to prevent a massive retaliatory strike. Because for all practical purposes, atomic submarines are invulnerable. There is no way for us to detect or destroy the Soviet Union's atomic submarines. And neither is there an ability that the Soviets have to detect or destroy ours. So if they should be successful in destroying every single fixed-silo ICBM in the country, the estimate is that 60 to 70 percent of our bomber fleet would still be in the air with nuclear capability— our B-52's, primarily—and also every one of our submarines, which would be at sea. And I would think the same thing would apply on the other hand, except that the Soviets do not have as many bombers as we do. So there would be no possibility under the sun that a first-strike capability could be adequate in preventing massive destruction on the country that originated the strike."", 'Q. May I follow that up then? Over the opposition of people, I believe like Senator Mondale, in the Senate last year, when the military appropriations bill was voted last June, a series of amendments allowed R. & D. to continue on perfection of accuracy for our land-based missiles, of ""merving"" the ""MIRV"", something I barely understand and I trust you do, of increasing the ability to knock out silos in the Soviet Union which opponents like Senator Mondale argued, it might make the Soviet Union believe that we were aiming at the first-strike capability and cause them to become more trigger happy?', ""Governor Carter. In the analyses that have been done, that have been publicized, and I don't have any secret information about it, there is absolutely no possibility of a successful first strike that would prevent unbelievable destruction on the originator of the attack. Now, the Soviet Union has a much greater dependence on fixed-silo weapons than do we, primarily because of our relative superiority in the air with bombers. But their weapons are much heavier than ours, their throw weight is much greater than ours, and their missiles are large. And they are moving toward the higher accuracy than we have. I think yesterday I tried to draw a distinction between our tactical strategy or commitments or plans, and strategic plans."", 'In our tactical plans, to speak in simplistic terms, means that you try to define combat areas and limit the attack to that area and preclude the enemy from trying to attack your own civilian centers, mainly cities. That still would create a tremendous devastation and death. But I think the first- strike capability which used to be thought of as a possibility is no longer possible at all and this has been the case now for 15 or 20 years since atomic submarines have been available to both sides.', ""Senator Mondale. The question is, how do we continue that basic principle of assured retaliatory destruction, that has, I think, assured sanity in the use of nuclear weapons since their discovery. The balance of terror. It is an eerie concept but you would have to be insane under the present circumstances to commence an attack, because if you did you would be certain of your own destruction. And that has been the key basis for stability. And both sides realize this. And what I was saying for the last few years was that the way to handle that in light of the fact that the Russians are developing, or are trying to develop, a counterforce strategy to more maneuverable counterforce weaponry. So that we continue that fundamental principal of assured retaliatory force and for that reason, for example, last year I voted for the B-l bomber, not because I was for that particular bomber, but because I felt it made a lot more sense to follow on with an advanced sophisticated bomber that was maneuverable than it was to proceed on a publicly acknowledged policy of counterforce which I think inevitably puts a hair trigger on nuclear warfare, and scares the Russians—as does their technology scare us. For the same reason, I have been a strong supporter of submarine forces. A few years ago, I offered an amendment to authorize the Norwal class of submarines, because it is the perfect, stabilizing influence in this era. It can't be found, it can be maneuvered beyond the reach of the Russians, it has long-range missile capacity, and it helps persuade the Russians that it would be foolish to commence an attack against us. So my emphasis has been on a strategy that would continue the present balance that brings us to a situation that only an insane person would commence a nuclear war."", 'Q. So you would suggest to the Governor that you not pursue a manner of force that, am 1 correct, is known as first-strike capability?', ""Senator Mondale. It's a matter of emphasis. The key to our strategy ought to be the maneuverability of our retaliatory force."", 'Q. [Most of question inaudible. Concerns nuclear proliferation and acquisition of nuclear weapons by ""irresponsible"" governments.\']', ""Governor Carter. As you may remember, I made a major speech on nuclear proliferation at the United Nations a couple of months ago. And the major thrust of my speech then, and I think it was a good speech—we put a lot of time and effort into it—was that our country ought to do everything we can to decrease the spread of nuclear weapon capability. This would require the tight control of nuclear waste, particularly plutonium waste. It would encourage the nations who have not yet signed a non-proliferation treaty to do so, it would involve a cessation or an ending of our own inclination to test so-called peaceful nuclear devices, even unilaterally if the Russians don't even agree, but it would encourage them to do so. And this is a very serious problem. As you know, there are a growing number of nations in the world that have a nuclear capability, there may be a few nations who have nuclear capability who haven't yet admitted it, or tested a weapon so that it can be discerned. But this is a matter that is most heavily influenced by the attitudes of the two major forces—that is our own and the Soviet Union. France and China, I would guess, are the two next nations who have nuclear capability and maybe 400 or 500 weapons, and then perhaps England in that category. But we are trying to do everything we can, in the campaign, to project the horrors of nuclear proliferation and obviously the horrors of any use of atomic weapons in a limited fashion. But I do favor strongly our country doing everything it can to discourage the proliferation of nuclear capability."", ""Q. Did you have any discussions, Governor, or have you been turning over in mind the desirability of reassessing the balance between nuclear capability and limited conventional warfare capability? The second question is, you were talking about the NATO commitment, you're not yet married to any particular troop figures abroad, are you?"", 'Governor Carter. No, I\'m not. I think what the Soviet Union and we both would prefer is a general understanding by the world, including us, that any altercation in any region would be settled by non-nuclear forces. Now, that puts on us, as you could very quickly discern, the requirement that our ground forces and air forces, excluding nuclear weaponry, should be sufficient in Europe to discourage the Soviet Union from believing that they can mount a successful non-nuclear attack. There was a general agreement yesterday, and I think it is one that our nation\'s leaders have assumed for a long time, that we do have that sort of combined strength in Western Europe, with our own forces and those of the other NATO nations. So I think if we can keep before us, one, a mutual commitment along with the Soviet Union to avoid using atomic weapons at all. Secondly, to maintain a rough equivalency, and third, to achieve constant ""rough equivalency"" with reduction in weapons or limitations other than a continued arms race, then in capsulated form that would express our purpose.', ""Q. Governor, you were discussing with the advisers the ineffectiveness of Reserve Forces. Did they agree among themselves as to this ineffectiveness? What kind of ineffectiveness does this mean? What can't these forces do?"", 'Governor Carter. There is very little correlation between Reserve Forces, say Army Reserve and National Guard, on the one hand, with each other or with the Regular Forces. There is very little sharing of tactical responsibility within a certain region of our country. The readiness of Reserve Forces is doubtful, there is very little compatibility between promotion, pay, and training on the one hand for the Reserve Forces, and for those in the Regular Forces. There is a sharp distinction between all the peaceful functions within the Reserve Forces and the National Guard which comes under a governor, with the immediate transfer of that responsibility to the President if the Reserve Forces should be needed. And the degree of quality, weapons, is almost completely absent in many of the Reserve Forces. One of the things that is obvious to me is that the Reserve Forces, say, in the state quite often are shot through with politics—promotion procedures, quality of training—are heavily protected by governors and adjutant generals, and other leaders of the National Guard, from encroachment of influence from Washington. I agree that this should be independent, but I think the only way to circumvent that desire for autonomy on the part of the governors and the adjutant generals, is for them to be involved in the initial study of the changes that need to be made. And I believe that if this is done successfully, that these long-needed changes can be consummated.', 'Q. This sounds like there are drastic changes ahead for these local units.', ""Governor Carter. I would guess that's true. And the changes would come in two categories. One is increasing substantially their ability of readiness for defending this country. And second, a much tighter interrelationship, a much greater sharing of responsibility with the Regular Forces. That's where the two problems lie. And I don't believe you will ever have a President who is politically strong enough to run over a governor, or to run over 50 governors and to institute changes unilaterally from Washington. But if the governors as a group, or representatives of the governors, can work with the Defense Department, the President, in evolving preferred changes, I believe that is the avenue for possible success. There was unanimous agreement yesterday among everyone who has ever served as an adviser to the Defense Department that this is a gross need in our country."", 'Q. Could I ask each of you what your present position would be on the B-l bomber?', ""Governor Carter. I think this is one point where we might disagree. I don't favor at this point construction of the B-l bomber. I do favor a continued research and development program on the B-l bomber if it should become necessary in the future. But I don't favor construction at this point."", ""Senator Mondale. I think we agree on that. When I voted for this B-l authorization, it was for research and development. At the time I issued a statement that I thought the B-l could be restructured. We needed a follow-on bomber, and we wanted to get around this counterforce strategy that was then sort of the upfront official policy of the Defense Department. I think we need a follow-on bomber. I think that research and development ought to go forward, and I voted for the Culver amendment just a few weeks ago to do so, but I don't think we should make the decision to go into production until we've decided that that's the best follow-on bomber to have."", 'Q. Senator, how are you going to vote on that this week?', ""Senator Mondale. It depends on what form it is in. If it's research and development I will vote for it. If it's a delay until next year on the question of procurement, I will vote for that."", 'Governor Carter. We have not discussed this with each other, and in fact we agree.', ""I might say this, this is such a complicated question, with the alternative bomber fleet we presently have the FB-111, the B-52, the upcoming increased dependence on cruise missiles, the possible inclusion of Backfire, the Russian bomber in the SALT II talks with the cruise missile. It's a fluid situation. But I think that Senator Mondale has expressed it very well. We ought to keep the B-l bomber as a potential weapon, and not authorize its construction until it is obviously needed. I would personally like to see all weapon systems that are capable of delivering nuclear arms included in the SALT talks, including the Backfire and the cruise missile. I have not discussed with the SALT negotiators opposition or the reasons for avoiding this subject. But I think that if we are going to have SALT talks, including all delivery systems that involve nuclear weapons, [it] would be advantageous for humanity, and I believe in the long run that would benefit our own country as well."", ""One other point, I spent most of this morning working on the postal registration bill. The Senate passed its charter a long time ago; it's been bogged down in the House. And I talked to Congressman Tip O'Neill. I also talked to the Speaker and they talked to Representative Frank Thompson, who is chairman of the committee, and to Representative Madden, who's the chairman of the Rules Committee, and I'm very eager to see the restraints on voter registration removed. In my acceptance speech I called for universal registration, which I favored. As a matter of fact, when I announced for President in 1974, I also called for universal voter registration. I see no reason for the government to put an obstacle in the way of someone who wants to vote. And my assurance this morning was that the postal registration bill would be coming out of the Rules Committee no later than this week, and I'm going to do all I can to encourage the House to pass the bill, and encourage the President to sign it. If the President should veto the bill, removing the right of American people to have the chance to vote, then I'll also do everything I can to encourage an override of that veto. I think it is a very important point, particularly in our 2OOth birthday year, to give the American people, for a change, an easy way, an unrestricted way, to register to vote in the upcoming election. The Republicans have always opposed it, and I think it's time for us to put the issue in the forefront of the consciousness of the American people, and I believe it's a very important one, and I believe it has a good chance this year of finally getting it signed."", 'Q. Are you encouraged with the relationship that you have developed with the congressional leadership? Is it going well so far do you think?', ""Governor Carter. Yes. I think it is going very well. I believe it is accurate to say that my phone calls to the Majority Leader, to the Speaker, were a major factor in their willingness to revive the bill that has been bogged down in committee for a long time, and this is a normal circumstance. Yes, I think the relationship is very good. I don't ever intend though, to be reticent about speaking out on things which I consider to be at fault, even within the Democratic Congress. I think that, for instance, the present consideration of the tax reform bill, which concerns me very much, this is one of the things that I will be talking about after our meeting this afternoon. And I think that this ought to be done in a way to carry out the statement that I made in my acceptance speech that the present tax laws are disgraceful, that they ought not to be considered in secret, that the doors ought to be open and the American people ought to understand these special tax breaks in these bills. In our session this afternoon, that is one of the things that will be covered. We're going to try to get to taxation, budgeting, and economics or finance. And their interrelationship with one another. And this will be a very important learning process for all of us.""]"
39,Jimmy Carter ,"July 28, 1976","[""Governor Carter. This morning, Senator Mondale and I are going to divide up the responsibility on the briefing that we had yesterday on economics. Later, we're going to have a full session on tax reform.\n"", 'I thought we would divide it into three parts and then let you ask us questions on those subjects or others.\n', ""In the first place, the Nixon-Ford Administrations have been responsible, in my opinion, for a major part of the nation's economic woes. Their standard policy is to depend on a small recession to deal with the problem of inflation. And it has been evident on many occasions that their small recessions degenerate into very large recessions. Their response to this has been, under both Nixon and Ford, to assume that a 7 to 8 percent unemployment rate was normal for our country and they presently have that rate of about 7.5 to 7.6 percent with no prospect before the end of next year, according to their projections, to get it below 7 percent.\n"", 'In addition, the inflation rate now is the highest it has been since 1952 and, under present conditions, it is still up around 5 percent and as you know, is increasing.\n', ""Under the Ford-Nixon Administration we've also had the highest peacetime deficits in the history of this country. And had it not been for the Congress, which Senator Mondale will cover in a few minutes, it would be much worse.\n"", 'One of the reasons that they have been so unsuccessful is the lack of purpose or the lack of policy or lack of planning or goals for our country to achieve in the field of energy, agriculture, transportation, economics. There is no certain purpose in our nation\'s growth or tax policies, or any other policies. This has a lot of additional adverse effects. When President Nixon, with a great deal of fanfare, in the fall of 1973, announced ""Operation Independence,"" we were importing about 25 percent of our oil. In March of this year, under Nixon and Ford, we imported over 50 percent of our oil. And so, what they\'ve done is to aggravate potential problems that exist. This has had other very serious, adverse effects in addition to those which fall to every family with inflation and those families that are unemployed because of the problem. The interest rates which are always high in a Republican Administration are now still very high with 9 percent being a good, an optimum interest rate on mortgages. And our balance of trade has now degenerated from a very high surplus to almost a negative figure this year. We do have a slight surplus of goods and services, we have a slight deficit now on goods alone. And of course as I mentioned yesterday, a lot of this surplus is derived from excessive sales of weapons overseas. The last point that I would like to make is this; we have lost confidence in the programs that the administration now has decided to put forward for dealing with unemployment. Including the recent bill that was passed over President Ford\'s veto, we are spending about $7 billion a year just to provide jobs for people. But in many ways, the Nixon-Ford Administrations have made it obvious that they don\'t really believe in these programs. They are not pushing them aggressively and of course this results inevitably in the failure of programs that have been financed by Congress, most often over Ford or Nixon\'s veto. These are some of the problems that have befallen us because of the policies of the present administration.\n', ""Senator Mondale will now comment on how the Congress and the President have worked together in the past and how the Congress has helped to overcome some of these problems. Then I'll come back in a minute and outline some of the additional things that we propose to do in the next administration if we are successful this year. Then we'll open the session to questions.\n"", ""Senator Mondale. Despite the fact that even now, we have the highest inflation in 18 years, the highest unemployment since World War II, except for a few spots in the Eisenhower years, it would have been much worse had not the Congress fought the Nixon-Ford Administration economic policies in the midst of a very, very deep recession. We must recall that it was President Ford's proposal not to decrease taxes on the average American, but in fact to increase them. And we had to resist that policy. Then when we finally persuaded them to reduce that, the proposal was for a very modest tax cut most of which was supposed to go to the very high income Americans—persons with $40,000 or more, and it was to terminate in a single year. We fought that policy and deepened the tax cut, made it progressive, so that the average American got some relief from inflation and was able to buy goods and services that were needed.\n"", ""In the interest and credit field, the Congress has consistently and strongly pressured the Federal Reserve Board to back off its high interest and tight credit policies, and while they're still much higher and less accommodating than they should be, I think there's probably a more forthcoming Federal Reserve policy, almost as surely would have been the case, had it not been for congressional pressure. In addition to that, the Congress rejected the strong and consistent advice of the Nixon-Ford Administration that there should be deep and profound slashes in the federal budget for human programs and particularly for jobs. And most of the vetoes have been in that area, and we've had a strong struggle to try to keep some of those programs going in order to provide employment, in order to provide some relief for persons of average income. And that is an additional source of strength in the economy today. Finally, the administration, over a year ago, and people sometime forget this, proposed the immediate—immediate, I underscore that—deregulation of oil. So that overnight the price of oil was soared to the Arab price levels on U.S. produced oil. That would have added something like $400 to the cost of living for every family in America. We were able to head that off after a long and bitter fight. So that despite the unimpressive performance of today's economy, in which both unemployment and inflation are excessive, it would have been far worse had it not been for the insistence of the Congress in these crucial areas.\n"", ""Governor Carter. The last thing I'd like to do is to establish for you the results of our long discussions yesterday, and outline the goals we hope to achieve, with, I think, a very good chance of success, and then list 10 or 12 things—I haven't counted them—that would lead to the achievement of these goals.\n"", 'Our first goal would be full employment for all those who are able to work in this country. We analyzed in depth how this might be achieved with a minimum adverse impact on inflation, and by targeting the emphasis on job opportunities in certain sectors of the unemployed Americans, we believe and the economists who advised us yesterday believe, that we can reduce unemployment by a full 1 percentage point without having the adverse effect of inflation compared to what would be the case if it was a broad based approach. So unemployment reduction is one goal.\n', 'The next one is to achieve an inflation rate of 4 percent or less. This is by the end of the administration.\n', 'Third, is to have a balanced budget. I believe that this is an achievable goal and is one that would be a good achievement to be sought. And I would be deeply committed to this under normal, economic circumstances. And we believe that our projections, based on studies of the Wharton School of Business, by the conference board, and others, is that the budget can be balanced and any surplus generated can be spent to carry out the promises of the Democratic Party platform.\n', 'Fourth, a steady growth. We project a conceivable growth rate conservatively speaking of 4 to 6 percent per year.\n', ""And the last goal, that we would attain is to stabilize a percentage of the gross national product which is absorbed by the public sector through taxes and is spent by the public sector. It has been growing in recent years and is now about 20 to 21 percent and we would hope to level off the percentage of our gross national product that's collected through taxes and spent by the public sector.\n"", 'Now, how to do these things. One would be to have as a major goal, not just the control of available money supplies, but the stabilization of interest rates. High interest rates are a very serious problem in expansion of industrial capacity, the generation of new job opportunities, particularly important in a field like housing or construction. To have long-range policies on economics, agriculture, energy, transportation and so forth, which we do not have now. Third, is to do everything we can to increase competition within the business sector. By rigid enforcement of the antitrust laws, and by giving as much attention as we can to removing unwarranted regulation to protect industry and emphasizing the advantages to be derived from regulation for the consumer.\n', 'To redefine the purpose of our strategic stockpiling. In the past, we have had strategic stockpiles based exclusively on national defense. But we need to maintain adequate stockpiles in some strategic goods, I can name any one of them, that would be conducive to stabilizing prices on products that fluctuate wildly on the international market. Third, strengthen the Council on Wage and Price Stability and to increase our efforts through jawboning, through persuasion, through involvement of labor and industry, and to hold down voluntarily unwarranted pressure on the economy through rapid rises in prices or wages. The first step would be to strengthen the Council of Wage and Price Stability.\n', 'This is a very important consideration that we discussed at length yesterday and that this is to increase investment by the business community through equity financing as compared to debt financing. There has been a major shift in the past number of years, particularly under the Ford-Nixon Administration toward a dependence on debt financing.\n', 'And the last thing that we discussed was a more accurate and current inventory of jobs that are available to be filled, matched accurately with the output of our vocational and technical schools, other educational institutions, and the job capabilities of those who are chronically unemployed.\n', 'One point that I forgot to mention is the increase again in the impetus in our own country on research development. We have now fallen far behind countries like West Germany and Japan on the amount of research and development that goes into increasing productivity for efficient means erf generating goods and services.\n', 'Most of our research and development now in this country is going into defense and space. But the orientation of more research and development funds into better productivity would be, we believe, a way to pay rich dividends.\n', ""Those are some of the policies of the Ford-Nixon Administration, the goals that we've established, the history of what the Congress has done in the past and their contention over some of these same questions and some of the means that we would use to achieve those goals. And now both Senator Mondale and I will be available to answer questions.\n"", 'Q. Do you as yet have any specific ideas as to how you would deal with the Federal Reserve Board. Whether you would ask for any statutory changes in the present system?\n', ""Governor Carter. I personally favor retaining the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The only request that I would make for statutory change is to let the chairmanship term be coterminate with the term of the President. I might say that I would strengthen the interrelationship between the Federal Reserve Board, the Council of Economic Advisers, the President, perhaps the leaders in Congress—Ways and Means and Finance—of course the Commerce Department and others involved in the inventory of economic strength in this country and long-range planning. But that's the only change that I would advocate for the Federal Reserve Board itself.\n"", ""Q. You wouldn't foresee any problem in getting interest rates to the level that you want them with continued independence of the Board?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, I think not, because there is an adequate flexibility in the President's budget and the congressional budget when it's finally decided, and also the availability of tax changes that might be derived from the Ways and Means Committee in the House that would help to change interest rates. There are also studies going on with which I am not thoroughly familiar about increasing competition in banking facilities. Giving savings and loan institutions the right to maintain demand deposits and pay interest on them, and also to permit commercial banks as they presently exist to pay interest on demand deposits. But there are other matters that can be pursued to stabilize perhaps the lower interest rate level.\n"", ""Senator Mondale. In my acceptance speech, I talked about the deadlock of American democracy, this deep gap which existed between the Executive and the Legislative Branch. Perhaps in no other area has it been more expensive and costly to Americans than in the development of economic policy. Today, the monetary policy is basically the province of the Executive Branch—of the Federal Reserve Board. And fiscal policy, taxing and spending, being the province of the Congress. And they have been operating in a disjointed and even hostile and suspicious environment. And that's one of the key reasons that the economy has worked so poorly. Fiscal and monetary policy have to work together. And they have to be coordinated very carefully. There is a role for taxes and tax reform, and there is a role for government spending or government restraint. There is a role for credit, there is a role for money supplies. It has to be tied together in a balanced and steady— and I emphasize the word steady—policy. One of our problems has been this stop and go, up and down, uncertain environment in which business and workers have to operate. They do not know from day to day what our policies are going to be, because frankly we haven't had a government that could govern. And I think one of the most helpful things about the Carter Administration is that we'll have a single, coherent, coordinated economic policy, which we haven't had for years.\n"", ""Q. Would you then support, as I believe you did last year, correct me if I'm wrong, a bill which would require the Fed to set money supply, M-l and M-2, according to congressional desire.\n"", ""Senator Mondale. That was an expression of the futility of the situation. It makes a lot more sense to have a single, coordinated economic policy, with the Executive and the Legislative Branch cooperating. We said that at the time. But we couldn't get an answer out of the Federal Reserve Board. We knew that their money supply and credit supplies were bringing the American economy to a halt. It had created a depression in the housing industry, and in desperation, the only thing we could reach for was some kind of legislative resolution which if nothing else would embarrass the Federal Reserve Board toward a more accommodative policy. That is a very tough way to try to bring about a coordinated policy. And it didn't work. I think we embarrassed them some. But it is far more preferable— I mean, we did several things. We passed a resolution that tried to effect guidelines and all of it was designed in our frustration to get the Federal Reserve Board to help us get the economy moving again. And it is far preferable to have a single coordinated national economic policy which we would have under a Carter Administration.\n"", 'Q. Has the Federal Reserve Board revealed their policies?\n', 'Senator Mondale. Yes, they started to reveal their projected money supply target But it would not be necessary if you had a cooperative arrangement.\n', 'Governor Carter. I might point out that yesterday Mr. Burns announced he was further tightening the money supply.\n', 'Q. Governor Carter, many economists in the present administration think there is an essential tension, if not a contradiction between your goals 1 and 2—full employment and inflation. I was wondering if you have any reservations at all about supporting the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, as obviously the Republicans do have great reservations about it.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, in my mind, is an expression of a commitment to full employment. Full employment as now being defined by the Congress. I haven't kept up with the day-by-day amendments to the Humphrey-Hawkins bill. I think that the latest amendment that has been introduced in the House is that this is 3 percent unemployment among adults, and adults are defined as a 20 year old or older. The thrust of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill is to have a coordinated approach to unemployment. To reduce it so those who are able to work will be able to find a job. Now, it's hard for me to comment on everyday's version of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill. It's a fact that the Humphrey-Hawkins bill has not cleared either the House or the Senate—it hasn't gotten out of committee yet, and I think the chances for it this year are highly doubtful. But the overall purposes of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, yes, I do support it. I did not support the Humphrey-Hawkins bill when it was originally introduced.\n"", 'Q. I wanted to ask, is your position essentially as it was in April when you announced that you did support it?\n', 'Governor Carter. When I expressed my support for the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, with the unemployment rate at the time as prescribed, and with a minimum of interference of the federal government in the private sector on planning, and with an emphasis on jobs in the private sector, and not in the public sector. I think the amendments, if you want to go into detail, I think the amendments have also been adopted by the House committee that does not require that wages paid to unemployed be equivalent to wages paid to those in the community. I think that was too rigid a requirement I do favor through the payment of the minimum wage, at least, to those who are unemployed.\n', 'Q. Governor, do you accept a definite goal—full employment means different things to different people. Do you use the Humphrey-Hawkins bill definition of 3 percent unemployment for people of 20 years or older?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think that's a reasonable definition. You have to remember that when you are talking about the unemployment rate now, it's 7 1/2 percent or more. To start arguing about the exact definition of unemployment when it gets down to 3 percent is really an ideal exercise, but I think as a goal, that's a good one.\n"", 'Q. You also mentioned strengthening the Wage and Price Stability Board as one of your goals. Conceivably, could that strengthening process ever extend to the reinstitution of wage and price controls?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would favor, as a last resort, if all the other provisions failed, in sequence, the awarding to the President of wage and price control authority. I don't think that I would ever have to use it. But there are many things that can be done with a President that is trusted by business and labor within the present council, if it's strengthened, it would avoid any necessity for the imposition of wage and price controls. But if I considered it necessary, I would not hesitate to call for them.\n"", ""Q. Could you amplify a little bit on the strengthening process? What would you like to see done with the Board as far as the Board's power goes?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Because I don't want to go into detail, I'm not qualified to do that yet. One would be our promise that wage and price increases be announced ahead of time—either 30 days, or 60 days or 90 days. Which would give the President, business and labor leaders, Members of the Congress, a chance to express their displeasure, their concern about those possible increases. In other words, it would be through consultations with labor, and consultations with business perhaps in the same forum, to get them to establish on an industry-wide basis voluntary goals, say no more than a 6 percent increase, for instance, per year. Another thing that could be done is to continue a policy which I personally favored under President Ford, of limiting wage increases for federal employees to a reasonable figure. I think this sets a good example for the private sector, and it's a very good and persuasive argument among the American people who are the ultimate arbitors in a question of this kind. Besides that, there are a series of things that can be done before you impose wage and price controls.\n"", 'Q. You said you could reduce unemployment by 1 percent without realizing any adverse effects—is that correct?\n', 'Governor Carter. No, the economists yesterday had done a study at my request over a period of some months. Dr. Carolyn Bell was the one who had done this work. Their analysis showed that if you can target special groups of Americans who are unemployed, or perhaps special areas of our country where unemployment is greatest, then you can reduce the unemployment rate 1 percent or more without having inflationary pressures. Compared to the inflationary pressures that would result if all efforts on unemployment were blanket throughout the country. The targeting aspect can alleviate pressures of inflation.\n', 'Q. Are you saying that unemployment can be reduced indefinitely in a number of areas without having any inflationary effect?\n', 'Governor Carter. Let me just give you an example. If at a time you reach a 5 1/2 percent unemployment rate, which would be 2 percent less than it is now, you would have a certain degree of inflationary pressure at that level if the unemployment reduction effort was done broad base, nationwide, with no targeting. With targeting, and spending the same amount of money from the federal government which is now $7 billion a year, you could reduce the unemployment rate down to 4 1/2 percent and have the same level of inflationary pressure.\n', ""Q. May I ask you about the Federal Power Commission's decision yesterday on natural gas, Governor? Whether you agree with it and what you would do with it if you don't?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't really know what they decided.\n"", 'Q. It allows the deregulation of natural gas prices immediately.\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't favor that. The only deregulation that I would favor is to leave existing contracts in effect at the present level of price stability, many which go far beyond the year 2000, and deregulate for a limited period of time.\n"", 'Q. About your remarks on federal employees. Because Presidents Ford and Nixon consistently did not accept the recommendations of the board, which is set to recommend comparability pay raises for federal employees. Are you saying that you think a federal employee ought not to get an increase to keep him comparable with the civilian employees for the same job?\n', ""Governor Carter. What I'm saying is, that as an overall part of the example, if the influence of the President is any good, his policy on federal employees can be a guideline to be used to encourage the private sector to restrain wage and price demands.\n"", 'Q. You are saying, then, are you not Governor ...\n', 'Governor Carter. Let me use my language and you use yours.\n', ""Q. I'm not clear on what, at the moment, Senator Mondale can correct me on this, there is a Board which is set, a comparability board, and it comes up with the recommendations. The President then accepts it and sends it to Congress and Congress may try to override the President's request. The last one, where they should have gotten 8.66 percent according to the formula, the President recommends 5 percent, because it was tied in with that congressional business about raising their own salaries. I am trying to find out whether you would accept comparability or whether you would ask federal employees to, in effect, take a cut, an inflationary cut, which you then are saying is an example to private business.\n"", 'Governor Carter. I would leave that option open to set an example with reduced increases for federal employees if it was part of an overall agreement with labor and industry in the private sector to hold down inflationary pressures.\n', ""Q. I don't know if you got into this broad range of subjects, but was there any long-range thinking about equalization of opportunity, what the whole thrust of your economic policy would be, in broad social terms?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, one of the studies that we'll be continuing is continual analysis of the roughly $180 billion that the government now spends on income transfers. And how this can best be used with the existing amount of money through welfare reforms, the elimination of unnecessary programs and other income transfer to provide more equity and opportunity. I would not hesitate to use some aspect of tax reform as a part of this composite approach to the right of people to have an adequate income. My heavy emphasis would be that those who can work ought to work. But among those who cannot work, then I think we have a long way to go to provide equity. So I would look at the whole proposition of tax credit, and of income transfer, that presently comprises roughly $180 billion as a composite amount to be used in an equitable way for income maintenance.""]"
40,Jimmy Carter ,"July 29, 1976","['Governor Carter. This will be the last issues session this week. We intend to schedule others for future learning processes for myself and Senator Mondale.\n', 'Today we had a joint discussion about foreign affairs. We emphasized the point that we are trying to learn as much as we possibly can about the interrelationship between our nation and others so that we can present to the world a foreign policy that is understood by the American people, which is predictable, and which has an acknowledged purpose, which can have bipartisan support, which can regain the trust of other nations in our country and which can accurately represent the character of the American people.\n', ""We had specific discussions about the African nations, and particular emphasis today throughout the discussions on the developing nations of the world. Those who have been most sadly neglected in our own nation's emphasis in the past few years under Presidents Nixon and Ford and Mr. Kissinger. I think this is the first time, certainly, that any Presidential candidate has ever spent so much time studying the particular problems of the developing nations, but there is a very legitimate reason for it because of the past neglect and because of the importance—the crucial nature—for the future. We discussed our relationship on an East-West basis specifically, of course, with the People's Republic of China and with the Soviet Union. We discussed the Middle East and the Mediterranean area, and within the special framework of the developing nations discussion, in addition to Africa we discussed countries in our own hemisphere.\n"", 'We also tried to analyze the proper interrelationship derived from the Monday meeting between correlating defense policy establishment and foreign policy—our political interrelationship with other countries. We discussed some creative approaches to SALT II talks and we were particularly concerned in the Middle East in emphasizing the fact that without a complete confidence in our own government position on the Middle Eastern question, within Israel, that there can be no, or very little, possibility of an ultimate settlement in the Middle East. In other words, we have to have a consistent, unshakable, unchanging commitment of support for Israel, and with that understanding and acceptance within the Israeli nation that we can have a good hope for peace in the Middle East\n', 'We also discussed our relationship with South Africa, and Rhodesia, with an understanding that there would be no yielding on our part on the issue of human rights and majority rule.\n', ""The other point that we did discuss was South America. The fact that we should get away permanently from an attitude of paternalism or punishment or retribution when some of the South Americans didn't yield to our persuasion. There was a great revelation, to me at least, that within the Third World nations, the developing world, the unique leadership role that has been played by Mexico, Venezuela, and other Latin American leaders. I think the Latin American nations must be treated as individuals. They must be recognized as far as their own worldwide leadership capabilities of influence. And to treat them in a paternalistic manner, or just in the hemispheric relationship, would be a mistake. Perhaps Senator Mondale would like to add a point or two, and then we'll answer some questions.\n"", 'Senator Mondale. One of the other matters discussed was the very crucial importance of establishing and maintaining an ongoing high-level consistent relationship with our traditional allies in Western Europe, in Japan, and in Canada. This is the bedrock of American foreign policy, and that the administration ought to have that in mind at the highest level of priorities at all times. I think that is a crucial part of any kind of foreign policy that represents the best interest and ideals of the American people.\n', 'We also talked about the crucial need to put a ceiling, not just on strategic arms where we think much lower ceilings are clearly needed, but also a similar ceiling on the arms transfer of tactical armaments.\n', 'Right now, as you know, the United States is the leading arms sales country in the world. But in order to put that kind of restriction on the transfer of arms, there must be an agreement reached between the Soviet Union, between other countries such as West Germany, England, which sell armaments, but also with the consuming countries, because this is a matter which arms purchasing nations around the world have a direct interest. And it would be our hope that we could move toward some international agreement between those who sell arms and those who buy arms to bring a dramatic reduction in the amount of the tragic, expensive, arms sales that go on in the world today.\n', 'Q. Governor, did you carry forward in any more specific detail today the ideas that you expressed earlier in the foreign policy addresses?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, a lot of these people have helped me in the past in the preparation of those speeches. One that we did talk about quite frequently was my speech in New Jersey on the Middle East and the fact that this was an adequate expression of my concern at this point. We did discuss some failures of the Ford and Nixon Administrations in dealing with the European nations, in dealing with the Latin American nations, and I've expressed some corrective action there. The excessive sales of American arms overseas, the failure in Cambodia, the failure in Angola, and the failure in Cypress. And how to avoid similar mistakes in the future. We are planning— Pm planning, to make additional foreign policy speeches in the future on world food supplies, on East-West relationships (that is our relationship with the Peoples Republic of China and the Soviet Union) and also between ourselves in the Northern Hemisphere and the developing nations in the Southern Hemisphere. There may be other particular subjects that I will choose, but those three speeches are already in preparation.\n"", ""Q. We've heard all week that you've talked about how you desire to establish some kind of predictability in government—in economic policy and foreign policy—you were criticized during your term as governor as being intractable—do you think there is a danger of locking yourself into a policy that may be dictated by events that you can't foresee.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't believe so, I think the best way to be predictable is first of all to have a clearly understood policy that has been worked out through direct bilateral negotiations with individual nations and also which is understood by and hopefully supported by the American public and also the Members of Congress and other leaders. All these elements that I just described to you as prerequisites for predictability are now absent.\n"", ""Q. Why would a country like, for example, Saudi Arabia, which buys arms, because it doesn't manufacture them and thinks it needs them, be interested in signing up for a treaty that would restrict the transfer of tactical arms?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, that's a point that Senator Mondale made, but I don't think that he was talking about the consuming nations agreeing among themselves particularly, to refrain from buying weapons. I think the initiation has got to be from us, hopefully with the joint cooperation of the Soviet Union, the European nations and others who sell arms. That would have to be the first step. And then as we agree to reduce the rate of delivery of arms overseas, then through bilateral relationships, or by decisions based on the furtherance of our own foreign policy, we could decide which nations would have the greatest reduction in arms sales from us to them.\n"", ""Q. You have a China expert here—Professor Oksenberg. And the Chinese Government has seemed to be saying recently that they want closer relationships with the United States but there hasn't been much movement in that direction. Was anything discussed about possibly bringing about closer ties to China?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes. We discussed the fact that since the initial opening up of direct relationships between our nation and China as a result of President Nixon's visits, and Secretary Kissinger's visits, that the relationships have probably become stalemated or even deteriorated to some degree. We did discuss at some length the special problem that derives from the competition between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and how our increase in friendship or sales policy toward the People's Republic would affect our relationship with the Soviet Union, and the fact that we had to be careful and to have this relationship well understood either through private information or through public statements. But I think we do have an opportunity to increase our friendly relationships with the People's Republic of China within that framework.\n"", ""Q. About Southern Africa—since it seems to be one of the problems that demonstrates the limitations not only of American power but even of influence. It's all right to deplore apartheid but after that, what could you do that's useful. There's a great debate as to whether you press too hard or maintain reasonably friendly relations with the Republic of South Africa. Which way is your thinking tending?\n"", ""Governor Carter. We've had a national policy over a span of several administrations that supports the concept of majority rule in all nations of the world, including our own. I think we also have an increasing awareness of a crisis developing in Rhodesia. I think to a lesser extent in South Africa. I think that we ought to recognize as one aspect of the question the multinational interest in the southern part of Africa in dealing with South Africa.' Because there is to a substantial degree, the nations surrounding South Africa are dependent, economically speaking, on the progress made in South Africa—economically. Second, South Africa has unwarranted influence in that region on other countries, in some respects. They have a major role to play in the resolution of the Rhodesian crisis.\n"", ""I don't know the answer to what we ought to do, specifically.\n"", ""We ought to try to shape our own policies in accordance with what is best for the majority of people in individual nations. We should continue to constrain our relationships with South Africa to encourage the move toward majority rule. We should use South Africa's good offices in trying to resolve the Rhodesian question which might be of a more crucial nature in achieving a majority rule, and overall, never forget that in Africa, in particular, we've got the overriding question of human rights which still has a long way to go.\n"", ""I think our country has established through its own experience in race relationships, and particularly in the South, an understanding of this very sensitive issue. How to deal with black and white people within the same community so that both the blacks and whites will be well served. There is no doubt in my mind that in the South, although we feared the elimination of segregation or apartheid here, that the results of this elimination of racism—racial separation—has been good for both black and white people. And with that special knowledge in our own country I think we might be a help in Africa in the resolution of that question. I don't know how to answer your question better than that. I think that in general, is what we want to do.\n"", 'Q. Can you give us some ideas of the innovations you have in mind, the innovative approaches you have for SALT?\n', ""Governor Carter. No. I'm not qualified to give information about specific aspects of the SALT talks. I understand that we have had good progress made in the SALT talks with the major problem being the backfire bomber and the cruise missile. And I think that is generally accepted knowledge—that's not confidential information. Other than that statement I don't know how to give the technical mechanisms by which the SALT II talks might be improved. But I'm not qualified to answer your question—that's my problem.\n"", 'Q. A further question about arms sales. In the absence of an agreement between the purchasing and the selling nations, are arms sales a proper instrument of American foreign policy—can we afford not to sell arms, conventional arms, abroad?\n', 'Governor Carter. We can certainly afford to reduce our sales of arms abroad. I think in the last 10 years we have increased arms sales from about $1 billion a year to about $12 billion per year. And my hope would be that we could get a multinational agreement to limit arms sales to reduce the threat of war. In the absence of that agreement, my next preference would be a series of bilateral agreements, and in the absence of that kind of progress, then I would not hesitate as President to assess unilateral reduction of arms sales overseas, making decisions on individual countries in the way that I thought best, and that the Congress thought best, to effectuate our adopted foreign policy.\n', 'Q. Do you have anything further on the kinds of constraints you were talking about placing on South Africa?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm not qualified to give those statements now. I wish you would let me wait until I make my North-South speech. We are working on some of those things, and I could name two or three but they may not be the most important ones. I'm not trying to avoid your question. I just don't want to list a partial series of actions to be taken.\n"", ""As you know, as Andy Young pointed out inside—and he's made several trips to South Africa—the changes that took place in the South were brought about substantially by the interrelationship of government and the private sector. The South never integrated its schools as long as the pressure came strictly from HEW.\n"", 'But once the business and professional community decided, specifically say in Atlanta, that this was a good thing, economically and socially, for black and white people—when that occurred—there was an alleviation of tension and a movement very rapidly toward the resolution of the racial problem in the South. And obviously the heavy investments that we now have by the private sector in industrial opportunities, and in banking, for instance, is a possible mechanism that we might use jointly with government to help bring about that kind of persuasion. But that would be one of the illustrative points that would be beneficial in my opinion.\n', ""Q. You said in the past that you wanted to establish a relationship with Vietnam to provide a full accounting for MIA's. I understand that Senator [ric] Montgomerys congressional committee that has been set up to look at this problem concluded just this week that our MIA's were probably dead. In other words, they drew a line. Are you prepared to believe that now we ought to proceed on that basis? And how would that effect your thinking?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would insist that there would be an additional accounting. The fact that someone is dead to me is not adequate so long as the Vietnamese government has information about how that person died and where they died and where they might be buried. I think the major concern among those families who have members who are missing in action—and we have many of them in Georgia, as you know, because of our heavy concentration of military bases—is the uncertainty about it. And when I'm satisfied that the Vietnamese Government has made a complete accounting of those who are missing in action, whether they be alive or dead, that would be the prerequisite that I described.\n"", ""Q. Would you expect the Vietnamese to know in every instance? In many cases, they wouldn't know either.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I understand that. I said to the extent that I'm convinced that they have given us the information they have. That would be a subjective judgment that would be required.\n"", 'Q. Are you also interviewing people for possible positions in your administration if you are elected?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I'm not interviewing anybody for possible positions if I'm elected and I don't intend to make that sort of interview at all between now and the election day. Obviously as I meet with people who give me advice on defense, or welfare, or tax reform or foreign affairs, I assess their qualities and their knowledge and their methods of expressing themselves, their compatibility with me and so forth, and that would be one of the mechanisms that I would use to decide ultimately whom I might chose to help me in various positions, but I'm certainly not in a role of trying to choose anyone yet.\n"", ""Q. Four of the last Presidents, including the present one, were all Members of Congress, and while there complained bitterly about excessive use of executive privilege. Once they got into the White House, they defended it. You complained about secretiveness from Secretary of State Kissinger. Is it possible to define the limits of executive privilege, so that Congress would not have to resort to subpena every time there's a contest?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I noticed today that there was in the news a movement toward the passage of a sunshine law. I think the House has now passed a weaker version of the sunshine law compared to what the Senate did. I favor the very strong Senate bill that was passed. In fact, an even stronger one. And by Executive order, early in my administration I will open up as much as I can the Executive Branch of government to public scrutiny. It's a commitment that I've made and I will carry out that commitment enthusiastically.""]"
41,Jimmy Carter ,"August 02, 1976","['Q. How does the coming campaign look to you?\n', ""Governor Carter. I guess President Ford is the most likely Republican nominee, though he is certainly no sure thing. I would guess that with the possible exception of Michigan, I would be ahead now in all the states. Between now and Labor Day, the margin will narrow, but that's to be expected. I think that I will win in November, but only if I don't become overconfident. If I should get arrogant, or start to depend on powerful political intermediaries, that could cost me the election.\n"", 'Q. Where do you consider yourself most vulnerable?\n', ""Governor Carter. My major vulnerability is that people still don't know who I am or what I stand for on specific issues. Although I was in all [but one] of the primaries, I mostly restricted my efforts to just a few states. I still have never campaigned extensively in California, Massachusetts or New York. We organized only three states in depth—Iowa, Florida and New Hampshire—and did a lesser, but effective job in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The major issue used by my primary opponents, particularly Congressman Morris Udall, was that I was fuzzy on the issues. This constant campaign statement had an impact in some of the states, though not the majority. But we have a fairly good public opinion poll and this has paid rich dividends— not in shaping stands on issues, because those can't be modified—but in the orientation of our resources: where I spend my time, where we spend our money, where I could send my wife or one of my children.\n"", 'Q. What will be the overriding issue?\n', 'Governor Carter. Trust of people in government is the No. 1 issue. It transcends unemployment and inflation.\n', 'Q. How much are your religious views going to be a problem?\n', 'Governor Carter. They are much less of a problem now than they were 2 or 3 months ago. The poll results show a strong trend toward acceptance of my religious views. There is a general realization that they are personal and that the Baptist Church, perhaps more strongly than any other denomination, believes in complete separation of church and state.\n', 'Q. Are you willing to engage in debates with your opponent?\n', ""Governor Carter. I have no aversion to them at all. President Ford has announced that he would not participate in any debates, so I don't know if it would be feasible to work them out.\n"", 'Q. How do you reply to the Republicans9 charges that are already being made that yours would be a big-spending administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would have a tough management attitude with the government itself. There are very few programs to which I'm committed that would have a major increase in costs. The only major program that could be possibly expensive is a comprehensive health program, but I've been very conservative about this. I would phase it in very cautiously and without much increase in what we are spending overall now. Historically there's been a high correlation between Democratic Administrations and balanced budgets and between Republican Administrations and gross deficits. I would retain that commitment.\n"", 'Q. Do you think that at the end of your first term, federal spending in real dollars will be lower?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I doubt that. But I think the rate of increase would be carefully controlled, well-considered, and subject to a long-range plan. I don't favor government planning for the private sector, but as President I would start immediately to lay down what I intend to call goals for America. There will be a series of public meetings around the country—much like the ones I held when I became Governor of Georgia—to help plan programs on transportation, energy, health, agriculture, education, welfare, and so forth. Cost figures will be put on those programs for the first 5 years and this would encompass what the government would do under my leadership. Then the private sector—the doctors, the schoolteachers, the railroad managers, and so forth—can make their own plans accordingly. One of the major problems in the private sector now is that there is no way to project what the government is going to do next.\n"", 'Q. How would you reform the U.S. tax system?\n', 'Governor Carter. First, there would be a drastic simplification of the tax code. Second, there would be taxation of income only once. Third, all income would be treated basically the same. My inclination would be to treat capital gains the same as income earned from labor. Finally, I would have a truly progressive tax rate so that persons who have the higher incomes would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\n', 'Q. What do you think government should do to increase employment?\n', ""Governor Carter. One thing is to have government goals that encourage cooperation from the private sector, such as a comprehensive, long-range energy or transportation policy. I also think that we could take the present expenditures on unemployment, welfare, and job training programs and design them much more comprehensively to create jobs in the public sector. We now have about 1.3 million people who are fully able to work but are drawing welfare on a permanent basis. I would like to give them job training and literacy instruction and get them job offers. If they don't take them, I wouldn't pay them any more welfare benefits.\n"", 'Q. What are the most important differences between you and Ford on foreign policy?\n', 'Governor Carter. Most people feel that Kissinger and Ford or Nixon have evolved foreign policy to the exclusion of the people and to the exclusion of their representatives in Congress. There is also a general feeling that we have yielded too much and put too much of an emphasis on negotiations with the Soviet Union, to the detriment of our relationships with South America, Canada, Japan and the European nations. And, there is an issue with our on-again, off-again export policies on agricultural products.\n', 'Q. How soon would you move to full recognition of Communist China?\n', 'Governor Carter. That is an ultimate goal, but the time is undefined. I would like assurances that the people of Taiwan—the Republic of China or whatever it might be called—be free of military persuasion or domination from mainland China. That may not be a possibility; if it is not, then I would be reluctant to give up our relationship with the Republic of China.\n', 'Q. What would be the main objectives of your energy policy?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't see any prospect of national self-sufficiency in energy any time soon. I think that is a false hope. But I would try to shift the nation away from oil to increased use of coal. In addition, we will continue to use atomic power as a last resort, and we also must pursue solar energy as aggressively as possible.\n"", 'Q. You call yourself a Populist and say that you would return government to the people. How would you do it?\n', ""Governor Carter. For one thing, I would open up the deliberations of government as much as possible, so that the public would know what was going on. Second, I would choose as Cabinet members and advisers in the White House people who have knowledge and experience of deprived citizens. And, I would maintain my own commitment to represent in a personal way those who quite often suffer from an inappropriate action that's taken by government.""]"

According to one study, in 1900 in Boston half the households included parents, children, and at least one other relative. Today the comparable figure is four percent.\n', '• One out of seven children, 8.6 million, live with a single parent, and we now have a larger percent of children who live in poverty than we did in 1970.\n', '• About 350,000 children live in foster homes, at an average cost throughout their childhoods of $60,000. At least 10,000 of them could be adopted.\n', '• Fifty-five percent of the arrests for serious crimes are of young people under 18 years of age, and more than 90 percent of the children sent to correctional institutions last year were found guilty of offenses for which adults would not have been punished at all.\n', '• The number of gonorrhea cases has tripled in the last ten years among children less than 14 years old.\n', '• Among young people aged 15 to 19 the second most common cause of death is suicide.\n', '• And alcohol, drug abuse, and emotional problems are steadily increasing among both young people and adults.\n', 'As these statistics, and many others, show, the breakdown of the American family has reached extremely dangerous proportions. There can be no more urgent priority for the next administration than to see that every decision our government makes is designed to honor and support and strengthen the American family.\n', 'The problems of the aged would be reduced if we would all obey the Biblical command to honor our father and mother. As Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel said: ""One father finds it possible to sustain a dozen children, yet a dozen children find it impossible to sustain one father.""\n', 'The family was the first church.\n', 'The family was the first school.\n', 'The family was the first government.\n', 'And for a child, this is still true.\n', 'Our churches, our schools and our state, local and national governments all have major responsibilities to strengthen the American family, and when they fail, they themselves lose strength.\n', 'If we want less government, we must have stronger families, for government steps in by necessity when families have failed.\n', 'It is clear that the national government should have a strong pro-family policy, but the fact is that our government has no family policy, and that is the same thing as an anti-family policy.\n', ""Because of confusion or insensitivity, our government's policies have often actually weakened our families, or even destroyed them.\n"", 'Our present welfare system is both anti-work and anti-family. We have welfare policies in half our states that deny aid to children unless and until their father deserts them. As President, I intend to reform that system so that it encourages work and encourages family life and reflects both the competence and the compassion of the American people.\n', ""We have urban renewal programs that shatter homes and families and entire neighborhoods. You rarely see an interstate highway go through a golf course, but you've seen lots of them blast their way through neighborhoods where people have lived for generations. That's the kind of bureaucratic indifference we must end.\n"", ""We have transfer and assignment policies in our armed services that don't take into account their impact on the families of the servicemen.\n"", 'We have tax policies that often seem to discriminate against families, particularly lower income families. For example, the so-called ""anti-grandmother"" provision that disallows a child care deduction if the family employs a relative closer than a cousin. Also, the present personal tax deduction for dependents in effect provides a greater benefit for wealthy families than to middle income or poor families.\n', 'Some people argue that income tax exemptions for children encourage large families. But I agree with my running mate, Senator Mondale, who says that at his house the tax laws were never discussed at those moments of decision.\n', 'I have pledged to enact tax reform if I become President, and one basic goal of any tax reform must be to help and strengthen our families.\n', 'Nixon-Ford economic policies have been dismal failures. We still have an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent, one of the highest in 30 years. We still have an inflation rate of 5 percent, which is higher than any year from 1952 to 1970. We still have an unprecedented budget deficit. The Ford Administration, in its budgets for fiscal 1975, 1976, and 1977, will have a total deficit of $170 billion—more than the combined total of all budget deficits at the end of the Second World War until 1974. And Mr. Ford and his spokesmen like to say that we Democrats are reckless spenders!\n', 'Not only have the Nixon-Ford policies failed in their stated purpose, they have failed to consider their human consequences.

There is a loss of dignity and pride and self-respect\n', 'Leonard Woodcock, the president erf the auto workers, recently testified that when the unemployment rate in Flint, Michigan, reached 20 percent, it became the city with the highest alcoholism rate in America, and its drug problem doubled, and cases of child abuse soared.\n', 'There are many other areas where our government can do more to support our families.\n', 'At a time when teenage pregnancy and illegitimate births are rising sharply, we need a comprehensive program of family planning, which would include adoption and education and moral leadership, and would do everything possible to prevent the need for abortion.\n', 'In education, as we struggle with such problems as busing, we need to remember that our basic goal is quality education for every child, and that we need individualized instruction for every student, so that he or she can progress at the fastest possible rate, and that whenever possible we want children to attend schools close to their homes.\n', ""In the area of health, we need a comprehensive health care program, with emphasis on children and on the prevention of disease—and we're going to enact such a program when I become President.\n"", 'We need to recognize the special problem of the single-parent family.\n', 'We need a national day care program.\n', 'We need to change the ridiculous Social Security regulation that prevents many elderly men and women from being married.\n', 'In short, we need a government that thinks about the American family and cares about the American family and makes its every decision with the intent of strengthening the family.\n', 'One of the things that has most impressed me about my running mate, Senator Mondale, has been his deep concern about the family and the leadership he has provided, as chairman of the Senate subcommittee on children and youth, on a variety of family-related subjects including child abuse, crib deaths, child health, adoption and foster care. I intend to rely upon him heavily as I chart a pro-family policy in the next administration.\n', ""One idea that Senator Mondale has proposed is that each federal program present a family impact statement, to analyze how it would affect the family, much as federal programs now prepare environmental impact statements. We don't need a new bureaucracy, but the President and Congress should routinely conduct such an analysis when any major decision is made, and when I am President this will be done.\n"", 'As an immediate step toward developing a pro-family policy, I have asked Joseph A. Califano, Jr. to serve as a special advisor to me on how federal programs can aid and support the American family.\n', ""With Mr. Califano's help, and Senator Mondale's, and that of many, many other concerned men and women, I intend to construct an administration that will reverse the trends we have seen toward the breakdown of the family in our country.\n"", 'The job will not be an easy one, but it is worth whatever effort may be required.

43,Jimmy Carter ,"August 03, 1976","['I predict to you, that as soon as the Republican Convention is over, there is going to be an almost unprecedented, vicious, personal attack on me, on Senator Mondale, on other Democratic candidates. The Republicans are going to be desperate because of the success that the voters have had in the last year in learning about the absence of leadership, the suffering that we have experienced from the mistakes in foreign policy, in the management of the White House, in dealing with our problems, and because of their low showing in the polls—the division within their party—they are going to be desperate. And in desperation, they are going to turn to personal attacks— mark my words.\n', ""We need to make sure that we can withstand those attacks by one means only—not by hiding, not even by lashing back. But by being immune to successful attacks because we're wrong, or because we're dishonest, or because we lack courage, or because we're divided, or because we're timid. In other words, in order for Democratic candidates to be successful in the fall, we have got to deserve in every possible aspect of our presentation as candidates, our promise to the people, any legitimate criticism.\n"", ""Tile Democratic Party is my party. I have never voted for a Republican in my life. I believe in our party. But we're not perfect. We've made some serious mistakes. In the last 24 years, you know how long Democrats have been in the White House? Eight years. Eight years. And there's a reason. Because the people of this country on election day felt that they could trust Richard Nixon better than our candidates. And because they felt that the Democrats that we put up against Eisenhower were inferior in some way. So we've got to deserve support. We ought to remember how deeply hurt the American people have been in the last few years. Our basic confidence, our basic trust, our basic faith, in our own country, has been shaken. I think, more than any other time in the last hundred [years] we feel that something precious has slipped out of our hands. And I feel only a tremendous responsibility not to betray the trust of people like you all over the country who have confidence in me. I want to be a little better, a little cleaner, a little more honest, a little harder working, a little closer to you, than I would under ordinary circumstances. Because we are in a time of testing. When the people say, I'll give my government one more chance. I'll give my system of government one more chance. I'll give my candidate one more chance. I don't want to lose that chance, to re-cement relationships between us as people and our government. I want to tear down the wall that's been built around Washington. I want to tear down the wall that's been built between the White House and Congress. I want to tear down the wall that's been built between one kind of person in this country and those who might be different. I want to tear down the wall that's been built between us and the ideals and standards that have made us a great country.\n"", ""At noon, I spoke about the family. Every decision that I make as a candidate, every decision that I.make as a future President, is going to be based on strengthening the family, and interrelationship one to the other. But we've got to earn that support\n"", ""And the last thing I want to say is this. We've got to retain our unity. If we get divided in New Hampshire, if each candidate after your September primary has a tendency to go alone, if there is a breakdown in communications or exchange of ideas between myself and your own candidates locally in New Hampshire, it will be a serious mistake. The unity of our party can be preserved through the campaign. It ought to lay a basis for success in the future. I believe in my country; I know you do too. I have deep feelings of patriotism. I know they are mirrored in New Hampshire. I believe in the right of people to be free, independent, self-reliant. I believe in the work ethic. I believe that the best government is the one closest to our people. I believe in stripping the secrecy away from the processes of government I believe in basic human rights, civil rights. And investment in people, not buildings. So do all of you. But those things have got to be preserved. And if they can be preserved by us, and the future of our country I believe is in the hands of those like us all over the country, I believe we can win in November.

44,Jimmy Carter ,"August 05, 1976","[""Q. If you're elected, at the end of 4 years how do you think the average voter would have had his life changed—or would he?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think so. I believe there would be a restoration of confidence in government. One of the overriding considerations that has been important this year has been the sense of dejection or alienation or embarrassment or shame in the average American's feelings about his own government. With the breakdown in the family structure and the mobility of our society, there has to be something that's there that doesn't change much that we can be proud of. I think the average American after Vietnam and Cambodia and Angola and the CIA didn't have anything to be proud of. It is a loss that is very serious and there is a searching going on for what is lost, and I think so far I've been successful in reviving that trust. I hope I can continue it\n"", 'Q. And this would result in change?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think it would result in a close relationship between our people and our government. I think that would be the same also between the White House and the Congress; and I hope that we could draw together government, business, industry, labor, manufacturing, education, agriculture science, and so forth to a common purpose. That, I think, would change the attitude and the substance of a person's life. The revisions of the income tax structure which I intend to pursue very aggressively throughout my first year in office and a better welfare system and so forth, I think would help people. There would be things concerning welfare, defense attitudes, and interrelationships between labor and management and the organization of the White House staff that would be beneficial, but I don't know exactly how to assess the impact on an individual's life. There would be a feeling among minority groups and women that they would have a strong and legitimate and not a token role to play in the shaping of our national character.\n"", 'Q. Do you think your ability to make substantial changes in such things as tax reform—where people have not been able to make much progress in the past—is dependent on, assuming that you win, on how you win in the fall?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes. I think the forming of mutual trust and compatibility between me and the Members of Congress is a factor and to the extent that our campaigns can be coordinated and mutually successful, that would help. It would be a brilliant demonstration that we share the same constituents and support. Also I think a demonstration of a strong mandate from the people would be very helpful not only in the Congress but also in recruitment of competent people. So in those cases I do think it's important and also it would make me much more bold, I think, in proposing changes that were necessary.\n"", 'Q. How large a victory are you expecting?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know. You've seen the public opinion polls now. I think that there's no possibility of maintaining that sort of lead. There's no doubt in my mind that during the Republican Convention, no matter how disharmonious it might be, when the selection is made of the nominee there's going to be a strong move among the Republicans to pull themselves back together. It's in their own self-interest to do so; it's a legitimate part of the political process to make that attempt after the selection's over. I think that many of the Reagan people, should Ford be the nominee, will express their full support for him, go home and work for him. I think there's going to be an adequate division between the concepts of the Republican nominee and myself that will cause a natural, strong support option for people. I think there will be a healing of their wounds. A lot of people support the underdog—but whether you can make an incumbent President who has a low rating in the polls look like an underdog, I don't know. I'll do everything I can to prevent those deteriorations.\n"", ""Q. Do you think you'll make him an underdog by hanging Richard Nixon around his neck?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, Richard Nixon is around his neck. I don't think that President Ford's done anything to break that relationship. I think because of his weakness as a leader he's inherited what Nixon gave him in a very dormant fashion. I can't think of a single thing that President Ford has proposed on his own initiative which is a substantive departure from what Richard Nixon and his administration was doing.\n"", 'Q. Do you think that the tone and character of his stewardship is the same?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I certainly don't.\n"", 'Q. Do you think that the voters perceive the difference?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I think they do. In personal attitudes toward the White House, in openness and, I think in honesty and integrity obviously President Ford's credentials are very good. I would never state anything otherwise. I have never criticized Ford because of the pardon. I don't know what I would have done had I been there. I think I would have proceeded through the trial and the inevitable conviction and then exercised the right to pardon. But Ford made his own decision and I never have found fault with it even at the time he made that decision.\n"", 'Q. But what does the pardon say about his integrity?\n', ""Governor Carter. I just don't have the feeling at all that it was done as a derogation of integrity or honesty. I just think that President Ford honestly felt that it was the best thing for the country to issue that pardon of Nixon and end the Watergate debates and obsession once and for all. I give him credit for that. That's what he said and I think he's telling the truth.\n"", 'Q. Did you and Senator Mondale work out a position on this?\n', ""Governor Carter. No. Senator Mondale knows how I feel about it. I think it's politically disadvantageous to raise the pardon issue.\n"", 'Q. He raised it at the convention.\n', ""Governor Carter. I know that. But I think, in general, he knows how I feel about it. But there are things I wouldn't try to dominate him on. I don't know whether he intends to raise that issue any more. The issue is there. The American people know who pardoned Nixon, they have their doubts about what Ford did.\n"", 'Q. Is that not an ingredient of the continuity of Ford-Nixon which you have raised as an issue?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't say that it's not an ingredient. But from my assessment of it, purely from a political and selfish viewpoint, I think that die average voter reacts adversely if I raise the pardon, if I try to castigate Ford because he pardoned Nixon. My personal point of view is that I think it's completely fair to criticize Ford for his lack of leadership, for his continuation of policies that Nixon established and never having departed from them. I think that's a legitimate reason to say that the Ford-Nixon Administration is one administration. I think it is.\n"", ""Q. If it's unfair for you to raise the pardon, is it not equally unfair for Senator Mondale to raise it?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, I don\'t want to answer that question. I\'ve not discussed it with Senator Mondale. I know he\'s been questioned about it by the press and he\'s said he reserves the right to disagree with me on some issues. I did not go over his speeches at all. I was surprised when he raised that issue in the speech. I was impressed with the reaction. I was a little taken aback. I have not ever discussed it with him. We\'ve gotten close and my hope is that he might decide on his own—I\'m a little bit reluctant, not because of timidity, to say ""Fritz, don\'t talk about the pardon anymore."" I think he\'s got good enough judgment to make his decision on that. I think he\'s a good man. I don\'t really feel that I have to impose my will on that. He knows how I feel.\n', ""Q. But in the campaign, in Wisconsin, you said you had made the political judgment that people were sick and embarrassed and ashamed of Watergate. But to say that to raise the question is unfair puts it over in the moral, ethical field. It's interesting to hear that you would be so diffident with your running mate that you would not mention it.\n"", ""Governor Carter. That may be a temporary difference. I have never raised it with him. To repeat myself, I think it's not politically an advantage to raise it by me or Senator Mondale. My assessment is that to raise it is unfair but Senator Mondale may have a very strong feeling that Ford did it deliberately or that he traded beforehand with Nixon to do it I have never discussed it with him. It might be legitimate to raise it but I haven't. I have no aversion to talk in tough aggressive campaigns. I have no aversion to attacking my opponent if necessary, if I think it's right It might have been politically expedient to make the pardon a major issue. As I said in one interview, the pardon is just like having an illegitimate child in the family: You know it happened, you might even know who did it but to raise it again is a disquieting sort of thing. It's the same way the South felt about the race issue. We knew it happened, we were kind of ashamed of it but we didn't want to have it rubbed in our face and have to explain it over and over. It's the same thing with the Watergate thing. Everybody knows it happened, they know that the Republicans were in office, everybody knows who pardoned Nixon. But to raise it, it's kind of an embarrassing thing for our country.\n"", 'Q. Are you concerned, politically, that if you raise it that the reservoir of negative feeling will be diminished and it will become a favorable response toward the pardon? Do you see it as an act of political expediency and a choice not to flog that horse?\n', ""Governor Carter. Political expediency is part of it, but I also have a personal feeling that Ford didn't do it as a fulfillment of a commitment to Nixon or in violation of his principles. I think he was a new President who had a tremendous inclination to clean up the Watergate mess and I think that he thought that an abrupt pardon of Nixon would get rid of it in a hurry. I think he also had a genuine feeling of obligation to Nixon that may not ever have been expressed. Nixon made him President. I think this is a good, decent thing, too, as a form of recompense. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and in the process my attitude is that it's also advantageous politically.\n"", ""Q. Do you think you can refer to administration scandals as you did this week without talking about the pardon? Do you think the distinction applies in the voters' eyes?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think so. The Republican Administration was afflicted by the worst scandal we've ever had in our country. I think that it's part of a legitimate political presentation to the public as it makes a choice between me and the Democrats and Ford and his party.\n"", 'Q. What are the issues or postures that you think are most to your advantage going into the general election campaign and those that are the most difficult for you and the most disadvantageous to you?\n', ""Governor Carter. The dissatisfaction with the present administration, the absence of leadership that's been exhibited by President Ford, the continuity of his own administration with that of President Nixon, are major advantages for me, leaving all sort of personal things out of it. The uncertainty about my character, my possible performance as a leader of this country, is a major handicap that we have to overcome. People are not sure what I'll do if I'm President. And they are sure about President Ford. He may not be strong and bold and innovative and dynamic and able to work with the Congress, and so forth, but they know what he'll do. He's predictable. And that's the biggest thing we have to overcome.\n"", 'Q. What about your highly publicized religious beliefs?\n', 'Governor Carter. That difficulty no longer exists. I think the evolutionary learning process that went on in this country as people got interested in me translated one step further to ""What do Southern Baptists believe?"" And as they came to realize that Truman was a Baptist, for instance, that helped. And they got to know that the Baptist church in this country, because of our intense belief in the separation of church and state—perhaps more intensely felt than by any other denomination—has no hierarchical arrangement in the Baptist church, we don\'t need an accessory role to be played by a pastor or a church organization and so forth. I think those kinds of facts, as they have become known, have removed that problem. I think Ford\'s lack of leadership, the belief that anybody new coming into Washington will improve the situation, the dissipation or embarrassment that has been brought on our country with CIA and Watergate and so forth, have helped me most\n', ""Q. Some wonder why you're spending all of this time in Plains rather than going to Montana and to Oregon or whatever.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, my name recognition factor now is up, I guess, above 95 percent, and there's a much sharper awareness of what I am and where I stand on issues than there was before. And the support for me, which was very soft before the convention, has solidified firm and hard, in an almost unbelievably good way. The uncertainty, though, that exists about what I will do in office can't be alleviated by going to Wyoming, or going to New Hampshire, or going campaigning. That uncertainty about somebody who hasn't been proven as President is going to stay, I think, regardless of the degree of campaigning that I carry on.""]"
45,Jimmy Carter ,"August 09, 1976","[""Q. You've indicated recently in a couple of interviews that you thought your so-called religious problem was about over in terms of people being concerned about your religious beliefs. Can you explain why you feel that way?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, in the first place, I believe that the so-called prejudice against me because I am a southerner and because I'm a Baptist was overestimated to begin with. You know, most people in this country, I think, have a remarkable absence of prejudice because of one's own religion.\n"", ""We have seen this demonstrated very vividly in the South. Georgia, for instance, strongly voted for Al Smith. And in 1960, there was a great deal of prediction that John Kennedy could not carry Georgia, but we gave him a bigger margin of victory in our state than he got even in Massachusetts. And although there were a lot of similar predictions that I couldn't carry states outside the South, I had good—and I think almost remarkable—success there. So that's one reason that the innate prejudice of people against me because of my religion was overestimated to begin with.\n"", ""The second thing is that because of my success in the primaries, people began to study the beliefs of Southern Baptists and they detected a very strong inclination to separate church and state on my part, as was expressed very clearly by John Kennedy when he met with the Houston Protestant ministers in 1960; and I think as they have known about what our religious beliefs were, their concerns were alleviated. The awareness that President Truman was also a Baptist tends to give people the sense that there's no conflict between our own beliefs and a proper performance as a possible President.\n"", ""The third thing—and the last point I'd make—is that our public opinion polls have shown since the convention, on a nationwide basis, that I have strong support from all religious groups and that there is no prejudice against me because of my religion.\n"", 'Q. A lot of concern has been not so much prejudice, as a question of what does Jimmy Carter as a Southern Baptist know about life in the inner city of New York or Boston. So to turn the question around a bit, what have you done in the primaries and recently to educate yourself about these cultural areas that you have not been so familiar with as you would have been in the South?\n', 'Governor Carter. To an almost unprecedented degree, I have campaigned throughout the country and have tried to present myself among groups in every part of the nation—not only as a candidate but in a learning process—to answer questions that are put to me in an open forum and to express my views to people who are different in background and experience from myself.\n', ""I have also lived all over the country. I've lived in San Francisco; I've lived in San Diego; I've lived in Maryland; and I've lived in Connecticut— twice—as well as in Georgia. So I've had a background of experience among different kinds of people and in different kinds of communities that have stood me in good stead as well.\n"", ""We've deliberately tried to involve in our campaign knowledgeable people who represent aspects of American life that have not been part of my own experience.\n"", 'Q. One of your aides said that you just met with Senator Eagleton—he would come in that category. And that you have been attempting to learn about life in St. Louis, for example, from him.\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes that was one of the things we discussed. As you probably know there was a referendum in Missouri about support for parochial schools, and this is a matter that I've had to address as the Governor of Georgia. We have a lot of parcohial schools in our own state. The most heavy concentration of them is in the Savannah region and I visited there often—as a matter of fact, all four years that I was governor, I went over and spent all day in the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and always went to Mass early in the morning.\n"", 'I am familiar with the tremendous contribution that has been made in the educational processes of our country by people, particularly Catholics, who send their kids to private parochial schools because they want to combine religious education with secular education. We have faced this question as a state in Georgia. We passed a constitutional amendment and a law, which was passed during my own term of office, for the first time, allotting financial support to individual students who go to private colleges in Georgia. This was readily acceptable. So this is the kind of issue that I have had to face as a governor and, of course, as a candidate and now as a nominee. Senator Eagleton was very helpful to me in explaining the attitudes of his own people in St. Louis.\n', 'Q. One of the concerns is that the Supreme Court has several times backed state aid to students in private colleges but not to students in elementary and secondary schools.\n', 'Governor Carter. I know.\n', 'Q. And now the Democratic Platform talks about seeking constitutionally acceptable ways to do that. Do you favor that?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I would have no objection to that. Obviously, I will have taken an oath before God to honor the laws of my country and I certainly would do it, but the inclination of my own—not just acceptance but active pursuit of aid for students who go to the private colleges—is an indication of my willingness. As long as the public money is not used for religious instruction, then I see no incompatibility there.\n', 'Q. You would approve of secular funding for secular subjects—if they were to be divided that way?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, obviously, if the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution would permit.\n', ""Q. Since we're talking about the Supreme Court and the Constitution, one of the concerns of a number of people—Catholics and others—about the abortion plank in the Democratic Platform opposing an amendment to overturn the court's decision is that many people feel that this is an effort to deny them their constitutional right to seek redress with the system, their right to attempt to amend the Constitution.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, the wording of the Democratic Party plank was, I think, inappropriate and was not in accordance with my own desires. I did not know what the wording was. My statement on the abortion issue has been expressed often and, if you have time, I would like to repeat it. I think abortion is wrong and I think that government ought not ever do anything to encourage abortion.\n', 'Georgia had a very strict law on abortion prior to the Supreme Court ruling in 1973 which I favored. The Supreme Court struck down the Georgia law, that was a test case, which only permitted abortions when the mother s life was considered to be in danger, or if the pregnancy was a result of rape and the rape had been proven in court. And it only permitted abortions under that circumstance in the first trimester of the pregnancy. That was my preference.\n', 'After the Supreme Court ruled that the Georgia law could no longer be effective, then we passed the most strict interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling as the present law in Georgia. I think that the government—and it will under my administration—should do everything possible to minimize abortions under whatever ruling the court might have in effect at that particular time. We need a comprehensive nationwide program for sex education, for better adoptive procedures, for family planning, and this is something that I have pledged myself—ever since becoming a candidate—to pursue.\n', ""It would be inappropriate for any citizen to be deprived of a right to seek an amendment to the Constitution, and I think it's inappropriate for the Democratic Party to seek to obstruct a change in the Constitution. And, as you undoubtedly understand, the President himself has no role to play in the constitutional amendment process. If an amendment is proposed in the House or Senate and passed, it goes directly to the state legislatures for ratification. So my own position on abortion is much more conservative than the opinion expressed in the platform.\n"", ""Q. Would it be fair to say that you're rejecting the platform plank in that sense?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I just don't agree with the wording of the plank. The insinuation of the plank that opposition to citizen effort or legislative effort to amend the Constitution is inappropriate, is what I object to.\n"", 'Q. You said just now that you were not involved with that, and you said at the press conference at which you announced Senator Mondale as your running mate, that neither yourself nor your staff—""so far as I know"", I think you said------\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', ""Q. —were involved with that. One thing I found that both sides on the issue agree with, from the right-to-lifers and the U.S. Catholic Conference to the National Women's Political Caucus, was that Stu Eizenstat and Joe Duffey drafted that language as an attempted compromise between those who wanted silence and those who wanted a stronger pro-abortion position.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think Joe Duffy happens to be a Catholic, I'm not sure.\n"", ""Q. I don't believe so.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I didn't know that. He's not? Well, I didn't know. I wasn't sure. I was not familiar with that. As you know, if you have read my statements on the issue I never opposed the right of people to seek an amendment to the Constitution.\n"", ""Q. In terms of minimizing the needs for abortion—two points—there's been some criticism that emphasis about family planning is in some ways a negative approach and that there should be more emphasis on the life support center approach and other strong social programs in support of women with problem pregnancies—would that he a route that you would follow?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes, it is. I would do everything I could through moral persuasion and through my own actions as President, under the laws which I will be sworn to enforce, to minimize a need for abortion.\n', ""It's obvious to me that human life should be protected. It's obvious to me also that abortions are evidence of a failure to prevent unwanted pregnancies, and whatever one's own religious beliefs might be, that, I think, would be the case. I don't believe anyone would deliberately have sexual intercourse knowing that it was going to result in an unwanted pregnancy and ultimately, as a last resort, in an abortion. So, whatever I could do as President I would do. I have come out openly in opposition, throughout the campaign, against the use of federal money to finance abortions.\n"", 'Q. Thai was my next question—dealing with that in Congress—under tvhat circumstances, if any, would you approve of the use of Medicaid funds, for example, for abortion?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would not approve of it at all. If the courts rule that it must be done, obviously I would have to comply as President to carry out the laws of our country, but I don't favor the use of federal money for abortions.\n"", 'Q. And this—you would oppose the payment for abortions in national health insurance or any program of that kind?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's correct.\n"", 'Q. One of the groups concerned about the abortion issue has been the Catholic hierarchy. Have you had any contacts with the hierarchy or any plans for any meetings?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I have had contacts with them, both directly and indirectly, and hope to continue those discussions, not only on abortion, but other issues as well. It's part of the campaign effort itself and it's certainly part of the instruction, or the learning process, that is an important prerequisite to being a good President\n"", 'Q. Can you be specific about any of those contacts?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think it would be better for the leaders within the church to reveal these conversations. I don't think it's up to me to do it.\n"", ""Q. You talked about the Baptist concern for separation of church and state—in general, what's your attitude toward churches' lobbying on issues like abortion, or hunger, or civil rights? And would you as President look to churches to support your policy?\n"", 'Governor Carter. W$ll, you know the Baptist Church is very vocal in its stand on matters that we think involve a moral question, and I know that the Catholic Church has also been insistent on preserving its right to express its views publicly on matters of importance that involve morality, or that involve questions that are considered to be important to the members of the Church.\n', 'This is something that I think is a legitimate part of our electoral process and I would expect to pay very close attention to views expressed by religious denominations in this country.\n', ""Q. One of the church-st ate issues in some people's minds is prayer in the public schools. Do you have any position on that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes. I don't think that any person should be forced to pray at a certain time or pray in a certain fashion in the public schools. I think private prayer ought to be permitted but to require prayer—I don't approve. And I think that court rulings on that subject are proper.\n"", 'Q. Can you give me one example of a way in which your religious convictions have shaped your political actions, and an example of an instance in which you set aside your own personal religious convictions in following up something?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, even my own religious convictions on the abortion issue are in conflict with the laws that our nation must observe and, as I said, I favored the very strict abortion law that Georgia had originally. But after the Supreme Court ruled, as governor of the state, it was mandatory that I comply with the ruling. That is one instance where my own beliefs were in violation of, rather in conflict with, the laws of our country.\n', ""I try to utilize my own religious beliefs as a constant guide in making my decisions as a private or public citizen. We've had court reform to provide better equity in the court; we've initiated complete prison reform to give more compassionate attention to the needs of Georgia people; we've instituted treatment programs for alcoholics and drug addicts, for our mentally retarded children and all those I consider to be compatible with my own religious beliefs—that those who are poor, deprived, despised, unfortunate, illiterate, afflicted, who belong to a group against which there is discrimination, ought to be the prime responsibility of me as a powerful, influential public servant, and as a governor.\n"", 'I think that if I try to ascribe that completely to religious convictions, that would probably be inappropriate. But my life has been shaped in the church. My deep commitment as a Christian, and my knowledge of the example of the life of Christ, and the observations of my own religious learning of the attitude of Christ toward other human beings has been obviously an example that I followed.\n', 'Q. Vice President Rockefeller said that one thing you are going to have to show during the campaign is how you reconcile your talk of love and compassion with your image as a kind of ruthless, hardball politician—\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't acknowledge the ruthless or hardball characteristic. I have been victorious in some hard-fought campaigns, and I guess it would have been much more thoughtful had I let my opponents win, but I don't recall any evidence of ruthlessness that's even been claimed by Mr. Rockefeller.\n"", ""Q. There have been other, more general charges—for example, when people have worn out their usefulness that you dispose of them, or that you've been known to hold a grudge.\n"", 'Governor Carter. I am not perfect. Like all human beings, I am sinful and I certainly have made mistakes. But I think that if anyone would analyze the permanent status of my staff members, for instance, as contrasted with any other campaigns that I observed this year, we would compare favorably. Most of the people who are now working with me have been with me for a long time. The newcomers to my campaign like Pat Caddell more recently, and Bill VandenHeuval in New York and others, I think, would testify that there is no inclination on my part to discard people once their usefulness has been terminated. If someone did show me an inability of proper performance in an assigned position, or if someone should show me an incapability to serve the public well, or had some discovered moral defect that I thought would destroy the confidence of the people in my campaign or in the government, I would not hesitate to dispose of their services.\n', ""Q. Recently, Michael Novak, who's a Catholic columnist-author, criticized the fact that Pat Caddell's polling firm was selling information to the Saudi Arabian government—he saw a conflict of interest in that. He made the point that you see yourself as a moral man, and that people who have a very strong image of themselves as moral people can become convinced that anything they do is moral, that they're almost incapable of doing wrong. Do you see that as a problem?\n"", ""Governor Carter. You know that completely violates all of the teachings of Christ, to become proud and self-satisfied and to be critical of, or judges of, one's fellow human beings. If there is one thought that permeated the teachings of Christ about man's own weakness and sinfulness, it was self-pride and self-satisfaction, a feeling of superiority and a feeling of strength in the absence of God's guidance.\n"", ""If I should be guilty of that accusation—and Mike Novak doesn't know anything about me—but if I should be guilty of that accusation, then I would be in that respect sinful in the eyes of God. I think that my own attitude, my own demeanor, my own constant searching for better answers to questions, is a matter of public record, and I didn't read the article. The only article I've read that was critical was by William Safire, former staff member of Nixon. I didn't know that Novak had said the same thing. But I hope I don't have that attitude.\n"", ""Q. Novak's point was that if that same sort of apparent conflict of interest had appeared in a Nixon aide, the press would have been all over it, and it would have become a major scandal. And that that sort of things happening with a Carter aide seems to be ignored, almost as though there were a double standard involved.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, the fact that Novak wrote about it shows that it hasn't been completely ignored. There have been articles about it in the Washington Post, and I think there have been two articles about it in The New York Times. I know that Safire has written two articles about it. I've talked to Caddell about his other clients. He had his corporate and foreign clients long before he was retained by me to do the political analysis, and I think he has been open and above board about that relationship with Saudi Arabia. Before he took on Saudi Arabia as one of his routine clients, he went and checked with several of the leaders in the Jewish community in this country to see if they saw any evidence of conflict. He's made, or offered to make available, to at least the one critical columnist, William Safire, answers to the kinds of questions that were asked to show that there was no conflict, and I don't detect any conflict myself. I see nothing wrong with a foreign country knowing the attitude of the American people toward that country. I think that it probably would result in an enhancement of peaceful relationship among the nations of the world. And I'm sure that other countries have commissioned pollsters in this nation to get that kind of result I'm sure those pollsters, on occasion, have had political clients, and the conflict is one that I have an inability to detect.\n"", 'Q. Concerning foreign nations, you have spoken out a number of times in terms of American aid and support for the developing nations. There was a lot of talk; Senator Mansfield said today in effect, ""Jimmy Carter is turning to some of the same old faces and may not really be able to give us a new foreign policy"" Are you concerned about that? Do you anticipate a strong push toward aiding the developing nations as a new push in foreign policy?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, that would not be the only thing I would want to discuss. The first hope is that I might re-cement the strong and continuing relationships that have in the past existed between ourselves and our natural allies and friends, including the European nations, Japan and nations in this hemisphere.\n', ""Secondly, that we might continue to pursue a better understanding with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. And as a corollary to those, we might have a more individualized relationship with mutual respect. I'm searching for common interests with individual developing nations of the world.\n"", ""In the past, almost by default, we have permitted—even encouraged— those nations to turn to the Soviet Union, for instance, or to Cuba, for their friendship simply because we have not paid adequate attention to their needs. So the cumulative change in foreign policy would be encompassed in those three principles. I have made speeches on that subject—I'm going to make two or three additional speeches between now and the general election. One would be on world food supplies and how they might be maintained and distributed in a more equitable way. Another one would be the relationships which ought to exist between ourselves and our potential enemies in the Soviet Union and China. The third speech that I've already begun to prepare is to spell in more definitive terms our relationships with the nations in the southern hemisphere who would be primarily the developing nations. But no other candidate, so far as I know, has made comprehensive speeches on foreign affairs.\n"", ""I've already completed four of them: one general in nature; one on nuclear weapons, nuclear power, the testing of nuclear peaceful devices, the control of atomic wastes; one on the Middle East; and one on the relationships with the Allies and friends in Europe and in Japan. I think this series of seven or eight, or perhaps more speeches on foreign affairs collectively will express my views very clearly.\n"", 'Q. One last question. There\'s a poster, which you may or may not have seen—a likeness of yourself, a sort of ""Jimmy Carter as Jesus"", And the slogan at the bottom says, ""J, C, Can Save America"", How do you react to something like that?\n', 'Governor Carter. With abhorrence. I was embarrassed. The first time I saw the thing was a photograph in either Time or Newsweek magazine. I deplore it very much. I think it borders on the sacrilegious.']"
46,Jimmy Carter ,"August 09, 1976","['In introducing Mr. Carter, Ralph Nader, President of Public Citizens, Inc., chairman of the Forum session, said: ""In January of this year, at the Consumer\'s Federation of America\'s convention, Mr. Jimmy Carter said, ""I would like to be known as the foremost protector of consumers."" This standard that he has set for himself has far-reaching significance because, on thought, I think we must all admit that the ultimate test of our economic system is the economic health, safety and well-being of consumers today and in future generations. And it is the consumer\'s interest, whether in housing or in food or in other major areas affecting his or her life, that must be the touchstone and in the forefront of public policy making. Please welcome Mr. Carter."" [sustained applause]\n', 'Governor Carter. Thank you. First of all let me say that I am very pleased and proud to be here, to be sitting at the head table with such a distinguished group of courageous and effective Americans is an honor in itself. An accumulated talent, an ability and sensitivity and commitment of those who have just been introduced is, indeed, inspiration to us all. The only one about whom I have any concern is our host Ralph Nader. [laughter] I was talking to Jack Brooks a few minutes ago and when Ralph\'s people went out to the audience to collect the question cards, Jack Brooks said, ""I\'m sure, knowing Nader, that he is taking up a collection."" [laughter] I said, ""He is way ahead of that—he takes up a collection before you get in the house; he doesn\'t wait until after you get in."" [laughter] I made the mistake of inviting Mr. Nader down to Plains [laughter] this past weekend. I really wanted to make an impression on him because I have admired him so long and, in order to do so, I took him out to the Plains softball field, and I was very pleased when Ralph and I got out of the car that all the tourists who now fill our tiny town rushed forward with their autograph books. I turned to get my pen [laughter] out of my pocket I then turned around to see all the tourists gathered around Mr. Nader instead of me. He brought me, also, some bad luck. I have a 7-0 record as a pitcher on the softball team on which I play. I lost my first game. In the midst of the game, my brother\'s gas station exploded [laughter]; I wound up with two charley horses—one on each leg. And his performance as an umpire! [laughter] I\'d rather not comment on it [laughter] He said that he was fair because both sides said he was lousy [laughter] and I can\'t disagree with that. [applause]\n', ""I hope that this forum is not one of a series of catastrophes he has brought on me so far. [laughter] I think that this is an unprecedented thing for the nominee of one of our parties to appear in a no-holds-barred talk-interchange of ideas and questioning with the leading consumer advocate of our country. But I come here as one who has spent the last 20 months travelling throughout our nation to try to seek votes, and I have been successful in that—to try to learn. When I began my campaign, as you perhaps know, I didn't have a built-in organization. I was not well known. I didn't have much money; only a small staff. I didn't have command of the news media as I would have here in Washington or I would, perhaps, in New York. But my wife and I, and many others, went from one living room to another; one union hall to another; one high school auditorium to another. Sometimes only three or four people would come, but I would make about a 10 minute speech and answer questions for 45 minutes or so, and I began to form a relationship with individual voters that paid rich dividends as the campaign progressed. And I learned in the process.\n"", 'A lot of news media representatives and sociologists and political science professors have asked: ""Are you a liberal or a conservative?"" I never have tried to answer the question. In some areas I would be quite liberal: in consumer protection, environmental quality, human rights and civil rights. In other areas I would be quite conservative: tight management of government, careful planning, strengthening of local government, good openness of government. One way to categorize my beliefs would be popularism, if you would let me define the word—and I would almost equate it with consumerism. I have been deeply hurt, as have many other Americans in the last few years, with the deterioration and the quality of our governmental processes. They have been demonstrated in many minor ways, but in a few major ways: the Vietnamese and Cambodian wars, the attempt to become involved in Angola, the CIA revelations, the Watergate scandals. There has been a deep sense of alienation of people from our government and a sense of disappointment, a sense of embarrassment—sometimes even a sense of shame. These feelings, perhaps, are justified and legitimate but there is a reservoir of deep commitment that exists in the minds and hearts of the American people that is waiting to be tapped. I have always felt that, to the extent that government in all its forms can equal the character of the American people—to that extent, our wrongs can be redressed, our mistakes can be corrected, the difficult answers can, perhaps, be given to difficult questions and there can be a restoration of confidence of people in government.\n', 'The government must be well-organized, simple, efficient—so that the average person can understand what goes on there. So that there can be some access to the person or persons within government who can meet the need or receive a complaint or to discuss it, perhaps, as a legitimate public criticism or attack. We now have a bureaucratic structure in the federal government and many state governments but—because of its complexity— it is almost impervious to the entering of a human being into the decision making process. That needs to be changed. In many instances, when agencies or departments become obsolescent or obsolete, their usefulness having been performed, then they can try ways to wrap themselves in secrecy when a new, vigorous, badly-needed function of government is originally instituted—there is a strong national motivation to let people know what is going on there! Because there are things being performed which are sources of legitimate prying and a surfacing of ways of letting people know what goes on in my department. But once a department serves its function, there is a strong inclination towards self-perpetuation and for the enshrining of that agency in secrecy. This occurs too often and we need to pursue the legislation of Jack Brooks which opens up deliberations of our government—not only in the Executive Branch but, hopefully, in the Congress as well. The public access to public scrutiny, to public knowledge, to public involvement—to perhaps even public control for a change.\n', 'We must have, also, the involvement of citizens in the preparation of decisions. The budgeting process should be open; revision of major legislation should be open, and there should always be a sense of what government does is for the best interests of those who have no powerful lobbying group, who have no direct access to those who have power in the White House or otherwise, and who quite often have no intense interest because they lack understanding. When the regulatory agencies were being established about 40 years ago, when Franklin Roosevelt was President, he said—an almost humorous remark now—""Regulatory agencies will, indeed, be tribunes for the people."" They have not turned out that way. Because no matter what the hopes have been, the regulatory agencies were first formed to protect the consumer alone against the encroachment of a selfish interest Quite often the average consumer, the average citizen, has no awareness of the procedures, never sees the issues clearly defined and— because of that—has a notable absence of interest And, almost by default, there becomes evolved a ""sweetheart arrangement"" between the regulatory agencies themselves and those in industry who are being regulated. Many Presidents have perpetuated that deterioration by appointments to regulatory agencies—there has been a kind of ""revolving door"" between the industry being regulated and the regulatory agency itself. I would like to stop that if I am elected President.\n', ""First of all, I would like to see Congress pass a law that would make it illegal for the movement of members of regulatory agencies back into the industry from which they have come to the present administration. In the last eight years over half the appointments to the nine most important regulatory agencies have come from the industries being regulated. And, of course, quite often they don't serve the whole term because of the free movement back into the industry from the regulatory agency itself. If it is impossible to pass such a law, then through Executive order and through a firm commitment from those whom I am considering for appointment, I'll prevent that continuous ingress and egress between those two entities in our society. We also need to have within the government structure itself a competent group who can speak for consumers. Senator Magnuson and Congressman Brooks have, thus far, been successful in getting this legislation passed—Consumer Protection Agency or Consumer Agency for Advocacy.\n"", ""I am strongly opposed to the proliferation of new agencies, departments, bureaus, boards and commissions because it adds on to an already confused federal bureaucratic structure. But this agency, in my opinion, is different. If I am elected President, I would look on this group (a very small group, by the way) to help me probe constantly, to discover agencies or functions which ought to be eliminated. To publicly reveal inadequacies, inaccuracies that exist within the people's own government. I believe that every year because of the process of screening out obsolescent aspects of our government, the agency would more than pay for itself. There would also be a very low cost—I think ten, eleven, twelve million dollars per year. This is about the amount of money that HEW spends every hour. So ... I strongly favor this legislation. I hope the conference committee will pass it quickly; that it will be adopted. I hope that President Ford will sign it into law. If he should veto it, I hope that Congress will override his veto. If the veto should be sustained, I will continue to make it a major issue in the campaign this fall. If I am elected President, I hope it will be one of the first bills passed during the next administration. [loud applause]\n"", 'There has to be another means for citizen involvement in our government The President is the major spokesman of our country. Access to the President from groups represented here today is crucial. Too often in the past the White House is surrounded by an impervious obstacle which is open to those who are powerful and influential, but was not open to those who spoke for the average citizen. That ought to be changed and it will be changed if I should be elected President. At the same time we ought to pursue an idea that Georgia initiated while I was governor, called ""tie line."" We set up an in-watch line when anyone in our state at this moment, if they have a problem or a need, or a question or a criticism can call without cost on a nearby telephone (perhaps their own, if they have one) to one number, which is highly publicized through welfare checks, public advertisers on radio and television and ask his question and— while they hold onto the phone—without delay, the answer will be provided. If one\'s welfare check or Social Security check doesn\'t arrive, while the person holds the phone (perhaps an illiterate person) they are connected automatically to their own Congressman\'s office in Washington to give their expression of concern and, perhaps, to receive attention. If they go into a local grocery store to buy a chicken and they pay for 3 pounds of chicken and, when they get home, they find it weighs 2J4 pounds— they can call the same number and say they got cheated in their local grocery store. And, while they hold onto the phone, they can be connected to the person in the Agriculture Department who is responsible for the accuracy of grocery stores scales, and so forth. I think we now have over 26,000 categories of complaints on microfilm, and we keep a record of complaints in addition to answering questions of that kind. A similar occurrence could very well be instituted after the executive bureaucracy is simplified enough so that the experts can find the source of an answer to a question. [applause and laughter]\n', ""In closing, let me say this: I don't claim to know all the answers. Many of you in the audience are experts in the field of special interest to you. One of the reasons I came here was not to teach, or even to promote, but to learn. A lot of legislation has already been passed to help those who look to you for leadership and perhaps because of your own instigation. As that legislation has been passed, quite often it has not received the support and adequate financing from our executive leaders in the White House. Another point I would like to make in closing is this: Next year perhaps there is going to be a different climate in this country. Can you imagine the change that is going to take place in matters that are of great concern to you when the President and Congress work in harmony, with mutual respect, in close consultation—supporting one another, in the open? And when we have a natural inclination to be supportive of suggestions which help the consumers of this country? That in itself can be a tremendous step forward, even if we never pass another consumer protection or advocacy bill. Of course we'll pass them, but think for a moment in the field of poisonous materials, safety, transportation, energy, taxation, access to government, environmental quality and many others. ... If you felt there was a receptive ear to your problems, to your suggestions and to your criticisms in the White House... This is not a partisan speech but I would like to point out that in the last 24 years we have only had Democrats in the White House for eight years. I think in general (and there are, obviously, some exceptions) our Party has stood for a close relationship to the voters themselves—with an emphasis on individual citizens and a minimal emphasis on powerful intermediaries, which has quite often been an obstacle to close and regular access between citizens and the government But that's going to change and I think it will be a good change. As Ralph Nader pointed out when I spoke to the Citizens Forum a few months ago, I hope to challenge him in the future for the title of the top consumer advocate in the country. And now I'd like to answer your questions.\n"", 'Nader. Thank you, Mr. Carter ... for those remarks and sensitivities. We now turn to the panel of six reporters, who will ask questions and, possibly, follow up inquiries to their questions. The panel is composed of Morton Mintz of The Washington Post; Eileen Shanahan of the New York Times; Les Whitten of Les Whitten and Jack Anderson [columnists]; Steve Aug of The Washington Star; Mike Conlan of UPI, and Karen Elliott of the Wall Street Journal. We will start with Mr. Mintz.\n', ""Mintz. Governor, you referred a moment ago to the last few Democratic Administrations; it was during their tenure that a tidal wave of mergers occurred. That tidal wave really strengthened the power of giant corporations over the economy. Those administrations that were in power did nothing, and the fact is that Mr. Nixon's Administration was trying to break the tidal wave. The Antitrust Commission warns now that we are on the brink of a new wave of mergers, and I would like to ask if you are aware of Senator Harfs proposal to try to head it off by giving the Justice Department authority to get an injunction against the mergers that are, in fact, suspected to be illegal, reporting on that resolution and, then, letting you have a position on that proposal?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I do favor the right of the Attorney General to obtain pre-merger injunction and recognize that, during both Republican and Democratic Administrations in the past, there have been derogations of consumer rights. I can't claim, obviously, that all the fault lies with one party or the other. But there has been a growing awareness, as you know, in the last eight years because of actions of those assembled at this head table and others, and I think that the response will be different in the future—certainly, if I am successful in November. So I do favor the legislation.\n"", 'Mintz. Thank you. I have no follow up.\n', 'Nader. If you will just continue in the order designated. Miss Shanahan?\n', ""Shanahan. Governor, you have said that it's going to take a whole year to work out your tax reform program?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Shanahan. If those are the circumstances, why do you think you can succeed in tax reform where other Presidents of both parties have failed?\n', ""Governor Carter. If I can complete my own analysis, of the tax revision, within a shorter period of time, I would certainly proceed aggressively—I would like to be cautious in what I promised since the present tax code comprises roughly 40,000 pages. I believe that it would take approximately a year before a final and comprehensive proposal can be made to the Congress. The thing that concerns me about tax reform is this: When it is done piecemeal, one portion at a time, it's almost impossible to correct the basic defects or inequities in the tax laws themselves. And those special interest groups—some quite benevolent—who are thoroughly aware of an advantage to be derived from one particular part of the tax code can focus their attention and their influence with congressional members very acutely on that one particular aspect of the tax code. The average consumer or voter in this country who can exert tremendous pressure on Members of Congress and the President, if they are educated, have no way, for instance, under the present tax reform bill now in Congress, have no way of understanding exactly what is going on. I don't think we're going to be successful in providing a substantial increase in equity by trying to amend the present tax code—paragraph by paragraph. I think it is going to have to be, first of all, comprehensive; it is going to have to be generic in nature; to basically start from scratch and prepare a comprehensive proposal at once. A great effort to simplify; the removal of vast numbers of the special privileges that have, in the past, been put into the tax code (and are still there); an emphasis on equity and an emphasis on simplicity; a guarantee that there will be a truly progressive tax rate for those who make a higher income, so that those people can pay a higher percent of their income in taxes, and so forth.

The other day, Governor, you apparently received a phone call from Senator Long which he had discussed publicly on the subject of tax reform.

Is that an accurate, correct reflection of what you said to him in the context of perhaps lighter taxes on Capitol Hill?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, we didn't discuss that at all. There was nothing in the conversation at all that referred to business investments or tax credits or anything else.\n"", 'Whitten.

Into separate companies for the oil fields themselves, that is: pipelines, the refineries, the distributors, the retail outlets and so on. And, if you do feel on either hand that it should be done, do you plan to make sure through your appointments to the FTC, the FPC, the FEA and anti-trust this can be carried out in any way?\n', ""Governor Carter. I have been careful about what I said about this subject; not because of any political consequences (because it's a very popular thing to be for total divestiture) but because I want to be sure that what I do is right and best for the consumers ultimately. I don't favor total divestiture, as a commitment of my own. I do favor divestiture in two areas: One is the wholesale and retail distribution level of fuel and in horizontal investments. Unless I am convinced that there is some alternative way to provide intense and adequate competition, the aspect of the influence of oil companies that I, about which I feel most concerned, is the horizontal investment into the coal fields, geothermal supplies and uranium. And that is my basic concern. If I am not convinced, and I have told the oil industry representatives the same thing, that there is an adequate amount of competition (where there is not now, by the way) then I would favor divestiture in these two areas.\n"", 'Whitten.

What steps would you take, if you become President, to reverse that situation?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think that, in the past, there has been an inclination on the part of the oil companies' investments in the coal industry to reduce the supplies of coal. To artificially raise the price of coal above and beyond the rate that would ordinarily accrue because of production costs increases and so forth. In my opinion, that is a violation of, perhaps, antitrust laws and I feel that perhaps the strengthening of anti-trust laws or the enforcement of those presently on the books can correct that situation. That would be an option. But I believe now that there is a need for corrective action.\n"", 'Whitten. Now—about the toothpaste ... [laughter]\n', ""Governor Carter. You've lost your chance at the toothpaste question. [laughter]\n"", 'Aug. Mr. Carter, the Ford Administration—as you are probably aware— has sought to ease the amount of federal control of airlines, trucks and railroads ...\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Aug. In the belief that it would help consumers by lowering prices, I wonder what your view on this is? Would you, for example, specially padlock the doors on the ICC, CAB? How do you feel about regulating our transportation—should it be thrown open to the competitive marketplace?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, as has been pointed out many times, there are two aspects of regulation. I think one aspect of regulation is very vital to the consumer. That is the regulation of things which the consumer cannot adequately assess for oneself: hidden chemicals in food, the amount of damage that might be done to the environment, and so forth. On the other hand, economic regulation which permits, in many instances, an unwarranted increase in the price of products to consumers ought to be drastically minimized. Whether they would padlock, I can't commit myself to that drastic a commitment— but in my own appointments to the regulatory agencies that are involved in economics, I would try to enhance the degree of competition that presently exists and lower the prices that are paid by consumers. One obvious and repeated example that is being used is the relative cost of intrastate airline travel (such as in Texas or California) compared to equivalent distances traveled in interstate airline routes where the cost is almost doubled because of the rulings of federal regulatory agencies on interstate transportation. Another very serious concern would be in the charge for electricity by power companies—say, electric power membership corporations. In some areas, because the power is transported across the state line, the Federal Power Commission has authorized wholesale rates to, say, the electric membership corporations or to cities or to other entities that actually exceed the retail level or power costs or charges approved by state regulatory agencies.\n"", 'This is a great concern to me and I think it is the kind of abuse that should be corrected. So, to summarize: in the economic regulation, I think we need to move very drastically to increase competition and to remove the protection to the industries themselves and the area of protecting human beings against damage from chemicals. Environmental problems ... I think this is an area where regulatory agencies might be strengthened.\n', 'Conlan.

The former Governor of Oregon thinks it worked very well, but, at this time, I would not favor a nationwide law on that subject. But I would reserve the right to change my mind in the future if evidence is presented to me that it might be advisable. So ... that's a question I can't answer.\n"", ""Elliott. You said, Governor, that you oppose opening up of government knowledge of how to enrich uranium to private industries.

Now, if a particular contract between the private companies and the government doesn't reach the White House until January, when you are there, would you veto those contracts?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I hate to say this far ahead of time, when I am still a nominee and not a President-elect, what I will do about specific legislation whose form I don't know and which I have never seen. I don't think it is a matter of the private industries knowing about the process, because quite often they have performed the process themselves under direct contract with the government This was the case at Hampton Works by DuPont; by G.E. in Knolls Atomic Pile Laboratory, for instance, and at Westinghouse and at other places in Pittsburgh. So, it is not a matter of whether or not private industry knows about the process—secrecy is not a part of the problem. I personally believe that, if the federal government is going to turn over to private industry the enrichment responsibility itself and has to guarantee a certain amount of profit as a prerequisite to the industry assuming that responsibility, that this would probably work to the disadvantage of our people. I would rather see the same amount of money expended to expand our present facilities—if expansion is needed.\n"", 'Elliott. Does that mean you would veto a particular contract allowing private companies to enrich uranium?\n', ""Governor Carter. I still can't answer your question, because I don't know if the legislation would call for the President to have the authority to veto a contract.

Mr, Carter, more than thousands of Americans die of cancer every day. The American Cancer Foundation stated 90 percent of the cases were caused by environmental factors including chemicals in the workplace and in the air, drinking water, food and drugs bought. The Senate subcommittee bill would require screening of all widely-used chemicals to determine if they may cause cancers in humans. Do you have a position on this, sir?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, I\'m against cancer. [laughter] I\'ve seen in my travels around the country some of the problems and also some of the results of corrective action. I was in a plant, for instance, I believe, in New Hampshire, that processed asbestos. The manager of the plant was complaining very aggressively about OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] and how OSHA people had come in to ""disturb"" his plant. Later in his conversation, as I went through the plant, some of the employees said that two years ago ""... you couldn\'t see from one end of the plant to the other,"" because of the asbestos in the air; and that was all cleaned up and the plant manager was very proud of this change. I asked him what made him change his mind? He replied, ""The OSHA people required us to do it."" [laughter] So ... I am concerned about this problem; I think this involves a wide range of problems. One of them is insecticides and other chemicals which are sprayed. Obviously, others involve the content of medicines and foods that are consumed by persons; another one would involve the enforcement of air quality standards. Another would be the improper control or testing which would result in some inadvertent poisoning of people. One of the things I do favor, regardless of who does the preliminary test, is the complete revelation of the results of tests—of chemical or medicines before they are put on the market.\n', 'I think this can be done without revealing trade secrets about the exact formulae that would comprise a new product But, at the present time, when this testing is done either in public or private laboratories or by the company itself, there is no requirement that these tests be made public. If they were, I think that interested scientists, maybe scientists who would be involved with the consumer groups who are represented here, could publicize the possible dangers. So ... I do favor corrective action in this field and would do all I could as President to pursue it.\n', 'Mintz. Governor, I asked the question because Congress has been hung up for years on this issue ... that is, how can they pass a toxic substances bill? The Senate has one and the House bill does not contain the provision I talked about. And I wanted to ask again whether you have any views that you would like to convey to the people and to the Congress on this particular issue of screening all widely-used chemicals to determine that they may cause cancer in humans?\n', 'Governor Carter. Did I answer the question? I gave you the best answer I could.\n', 'Mintz. Thank you.\n', ""Shanahan. Governor, there ar a great many proposals for federal legislation to force corporations to be more law abiding, ranging from relatively small changes like giving the outside directors control of the [inaudible] Committee to comprehensive proposals like Ralph Nader's Federal Chartering Bill. Which, if any, of these proposals do you favor?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, I am not sure about the proposal for federal chartering. My own philosophical commitment would be to let the states do it if they can or will. And, as a second alternative, to set miniumum standards for chartering, and then permit the state to comply, mandatorily, unless they want to assume the federal chartering requirements. There are some state chartering provisions that obviously are too low and permissive, like the ones in Delaware. I think it was Mr. Nader who pointed out to me that, for instance, if General Motors wanted to sell their Buick Division, they would not even have to seek the approval of their own stockholders; and that if a major official in a corporation was convicted of a crime and was fined $10,000, the corporation could pay the fine for that individual without approval of the stockholders. So access of the stockholders to have a greater control of the company is something that I would favor very strongly. Secondly, I believe that there ought to be a reduction in the protection for criminals that is not provided within the corporate structure. I see no reason for corporations to give bribes in this country or in other countries. The recent proposal by the administration is that the companies, in effect, can go ahead and bribe in foreign countries. They have to reveal the bribe to the Commerce Department. It is kept secret for a year, and I understand revealed if there is an assessment by the Secretary of Commerce or the President that a foreign law was violated. The concept of confidential disclosure, to me, seems to be a conflict in terms; and the concept of permissive criminality [laughter] also seems to me to be a conflict in terms. I believe it is accurate to say that every nation in the world has bribery defined as a crime, and I see no reason why our own country should contribute to corporate crimes of any kind.\n', 'Shanahan. In talking about a ""Minimum Standards BiU"" or any other approach, do you have some thought as to what you would make a crime, other than bribery, in terms of nonfulfillment of federal laws, or anything else; and how you would, and at what level within the corporation, make anything a crime?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question. Obviously a violation of the state or federal laws is, in itself, defined as a crime. And I think the punishment should be commensurate with the degree of criminality or the harm that has resulted from the commission of the crime. I would prefer to see heavy corporate fines levied or perhaps a criminal penalty including incarceration for leaders of the corporation or business who were peddling and proven to be guilty, and this would include damage to persons' health or lives, or the subversion of the orderly structure of our society through bribery and other means.\n"", 'Whitten. Governor, in view of your forceful words about sweetheart deals between the regulatory agencies and industry, and in view of the way commercial time on TV has gobbled up so much program time, do you favor a drastic cutback in commercial time on TV and will you appoint militant FCC Commissioners to try to cut back that time or propose needed legislative remedies?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer the question about whether the present allocation of time is adequate. I am not sure even what the requirement is—I understand it is about 30 percent. I don't know the answer. But, anyway, I will appoint consumer or citizen advocates on the FCC and in other regulatory agencies as well. One statement that I made about a year ago is that one of the goals that I have for my own appointees is that they would be acceptable to Ralph Nader. That doesn't mean that I am going to get his approval ahead of time or consult him necessarily in every appointment, but the thrust of my own commitment to appointments on regulatory agencies is to fulfill the original concept which was that it would be a forum for the people and the protection of the people themselves.\n"", 'Whitten. I would like to follow up on those questions.\n', 'Governor Carter. Please do.\n', 'Whitten. I would like to ask you—you must watch TV as we do ...\n', 'Governor Carter. As a matter of fact, I do not watch television very much. [laughter and applause]\n', 'Whitten. My question has reference to the family. Do you believe there is too much violence on TV—especially as it affects children?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I do think there is too much violence on television. I think that the President himself has certainly a right, even an obligation, to express to the public displeasure or criticism of programming content. That, I believe as I said, is a right and a privilege and a duty. I believe this would have a great influence to the extent the President was both forceful and trusted to shape the opinion of viewers of television programs. And if I should call on parents of this nation, or viewers, to express their displeasure, or because of that encroachment on the consciences of their children, of extreme violence, I think there would be a beneficial effect there. I believe also that within the framework of the law, it would be appropriate to have members of the regulatory agency prescribe some standards. I personally don't favor censorship as such. I think this offers a very fine and subjective decision to be made between censorship on the one hand and quality of content on the other. But even then I would tend to do things, as I told you, through my own appointments on the regulatory agencies and, within the law, try to improve the quality of programming, and secondly to express my concern from the White House.\n"", 'Aug. Mr. Carter, in connection with the FCC, I would like to ask you briefly about competition in the telephone business. There is legislation, you know, sponsored primarily by the telephone companies, both the Bell System and the independents, which would in effect, drastically cut down, if not eliminate, competition within the telephone industry, which has come about within the past eight years or so. There is a good deal of controversy over this legislation. I wonder, first of all, whether you will favor continued competition in the telephone industry? And secondly, whether you would favor the current approach by the administration to break up the Bell System?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm not qualified to answer your question; I'm not familiar with the legislation that has been proposed. I do favor competition within the telephone industry, I think that there are a couple of instances with which I am personally familiar as a businessman and as a candidate. And that is the right of competitive companies to provide transportation [sic] systems within a motel or hotel or large business or a very rapidly growing political campaign and so forth. I think this is one area which should be preserved. This would involve the within-building exchange system of the telephone sets themselves. I think that this is a legitimate reason for a place for competition. I have not observed myself, nor have I been presented any proof that there is too much competition within the communication industry now. My own inclination now is to think that there is not enough competition. And I believe that the proposal initiated by the President is proper. I don't know the details of it, of course; it's in the hands of the courts or the Justice Department, but I believe that it would be a good move in the right direction. And, at this time, I don't believe that we need any corrective legislation as you have described. But I've made all these statements without having studied the bills; I haven't heard the debate on them and I'm not an attorney. I haven't had anybody brief me on that subject.\n"", ""Conlan. Mr. Carter, the Democratic Platform makes no specific commitment to no-fault insurance, but I wonder if you could tell us if you would favor a nationwide no-fault law, or would you prefer to leave it to the states, which seems to be the current administration's policy?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I pursued aggressively as governor, a comprehensive and effective complete no-fault law. We were not successful. We passed a no-fault law but it was kind of a shell of what we wanted, what I personally wanted. My own inclination would be to delay my full commitment to a federal no-fault law until after I was able to assess the relative efficacy of the 21 state programs that are presently in effect. One of the political circumstances that prevail in our country, which I think is a good one, is that, under the original Constitution, the federal government was only given certain prescribed authority. The states reserved the unassigned authority to themselves and, as new problems have come up historically in our country, they have first been faced at the state level. I believe that this is a good experiment area. This occurred in the field of civil rights; it occurred in the field of no-fault insurance; it occurred in the field of environmental quality, and other ways. And I think the no-fault insurance concept is still in the embryonic stage. I have no aversion to a federal law that sets minimum standards for no-fault, and I think it is going to pass. But, at this point, I think I would need to assess the relative effectiveness of the no-fault bills that have been passed. I have studied this extensively as Governor of Georgia, particularly their bill in Massachusetts, which was the first law, the one in Puerto Rico, and the Maryland bills. And our proposal was based on the Maryland concept. So, ultimately, I think we need a comprehensive and nationwide approach to no-fault I think that federal legislation is inevitably going to come. I would like to reserve my commitment on that until after I have the time and the authority to assess the relative advisability of the different state tests that are now in progress.\n', ""Elliott. Thus far, the country has spent three billion dollars developing fast breeder reactor programs and a demonstration plant. And the demonstration plant still hasn't been built! And the people at ERDA tell me that the cost of that demonstration plant is going up $100,000 per month, if it ir ultimately built, each month that it is delayed. Do you favor speeding up that program? Stopping it? Continuing at the present dragging pace? What would you do?\n"", ""Governor Carter. The liquid metal fast breeder reactor, in my opinion, is a substantial waste of money in the way it is being conducted in our own country now. There are working fast breeder reactors using liquid sodium both in France and in England. And I think the test data that we hope to get from the plant now being built in, I believe, Tennessee is doubtful at best. In the last few years, as you know, the AEC, then, and the Congress, in the present, have allocated a tremendous amount of our total research and development money to the liquid metal fast breeder reactor itself. If atomic power does continue in the future to be a major source of energy, then I think the breeder principles must be pursued and understood. As you know, Canada uses natural uranium only slightly enriched along with heavy water. We used natural or light water along with highly enriched fuels. Another possibility in the future is to use thorium—but then a separate and distinct kind of breeder reaction which does not require, I don't believe, liquid sodium. So, I think that the amount of money that we are presently spending for liquid metal fast breeder reactors should be drastically reduced. I think we should maximize our own benefit to be derived from observing France and England's progress, they are already at least as far along as we will be when we get the liquid metal fast breeder reactor completed, and that atomic power itself be relegated to the last priority as far as energy sources are concerned. That we have an emphasis on conservation, which we have not yet done; basically shift from oil to coal, which I think we must do; and shift research and development funds a great deal stronger toward solar energy. Did I answer? [applause]\n"", 'Nader. Just a few questions from the audience. The time is getting short, as you know. The question is from Beverly Moore, Jr., of the Class Action Reports: ""What is your position regarding expanding class action damage suits by consumer and pollution victims as an alternative or supplement to regulatory solutions?3i\n', 'Governor Carter. One of the proposals that I favor is to let the state attorneys general be authorized to file class action suits for people within their own states. This is presently prohibited. I also would like to see legislation passed to overthrow the Supreme Court rulings that in the past have blocked consumer class action suits. As you know, there have been two very damaging decisions made, both of which I think are not in the best interest of our people. One says that you cannot file a class action suit unless your own losses have been (I think) $10,000 or more! and the other one says that, before you file a suit that is based on a class action principle, you must notify every single person, which may be more than a million, that the suit is being filed on their behalf. So, as a general principle, I favor the concept of the class action suits, and those are three examples that come to mind immediately. I am not an expert on the subject, but as Governor of Georgia, in my own consumer protection proposals, these principles were included in my requests from the legislature.\n', 'Nader. Ray Waits of the Senate Small Business Committee asks:""Present law permits General Motors, for example, one of the two or three largest refrigerator makers in the world, to keep secret its investment, sales, and profit in its refrigerator division. Would you favor changing that law so as to require public disclosure of large operations in particular industries of the multinational conglomerate corporations—that is, where they have several divisions at various economic activities and they don\'t disclose them?""\n', ""Governor Carter. I think you all probably realize that I am not any better qualified to answer these questions than you are, and perhaps there have been questions asked that all of you can provide the answers to. I don't understand exactly the problem of that particular question, since the price of refrigerators is not a matter that is under the purview of regulatory agencies except the anti-trust laws. I think, under the chartering provisions, that we discussed earlier, this might very well be an avenue that could be used to reveal (at least to stockholders) which would then be an avenue for public knowledge, of how the different divisions within a corporation report their profits. I was under the impression that corporations already provided that kind of information. As far as requiring the companies to reveal every aspect of that internal accounting data, I think that is probably going too far; but, in a major division, like the manufacture of all home appliances, or say the Ford or Chrysler or Lincoln profits as a division, I think that this is information that ought to be made available to stockholders themselves. Ralph, you can probably follow up with a question on that since I don't quite understand what the problem is, and am not familiar with that debate.\n"", 'Nader. The League of Women Voters asks you: ""Do you envision any financial aid or help for small farmers or family farms?"" I assume that question is asked in the context of the takeover of farms by large corporations in some parts of the country.\n', ""Governor Carter. I think, as a farmer, the thing that the small family fanner needs most is a long-range and predictable agricultural policy. It is obvious to me that Secretary Butz has as his major background experience and as his major interest the food processors and grain speculators and not the small family farmer and the consumer. [applause] I believe, in the long run, that an agricultural policy that does benefit the small family farmer is almost invariably compatible with what is best for the consumers who don't live on farms: maximum production; adequate reserve retention; price or base supports that are roughly equivalent to production costs and don't guarantee a profit; aggressive sale of American agricultural products overseas when once our country's needs are met; and predictability. These are some aspects of agricultural policy that some of which are presently absent I believe that financing has been a very serious problem. When I was campaigning in Wisconsin, just to give you one quick set of statistics, I did a great deal of research because we don't have very many dairies left in Georgia (they have all closed down). But I discovered, for instance, that the average dairy fanner in Wisconsin has an investment in the farm and equipment and cows of $180,000. The average net profit per family off that dairy farm is less than $7,000 a year. That includes the work that has been performed by the fanner, the wife, and the children. This is a very, very low return on that high an investment. If the farmer sold the farm and put the $180,000 in a savings and loan institution at a 5 percent interest rate, they could make $9,000 a year on interest, without working at all. Well, there are real needs in agriculture, but I think one of the basic additional needs that I would describe in closing my answer is that the facts about farming and what our agricultural industry means to our nation's foreign trade, the special problems of the agricultural community, and emphasis on government programs in support for the family farm itself and not the corporate farms, and emphasis on the family farm and the consumer and not on grain speculators and food processors. These changes, I think, would be advantageous to our country.\n"", 'Nader. Last question, because we are running out of time, from Susan Gross, Counsel for Public Interest Law: ""Do you favor authorizing federal agencies to provide financial assistance to citizen groups such as consumer and environmental groups who wish to participate in agency proceedings, cannot afford to do so, and can be deemed to represent important unrepresented interests?""\n', ""Governor Carter. I hope that question came from the audience and not from ... [laughter] At this time, I don't favor that. I would first like to try the Consumer Protection Agency as an advocacy group for consumers, and see how well that works. And to see that, if that change and an understanding, responsive attitude from the White House, and openness of government wouldn't adequately solve the problem. The regulatory agencies' change in attitude would be another factor. So, I would prefer to hold off on my approval of providing direct financial aid to consumers individually or to private groups, from federal agencies, until after I see how well these other proposals, cumulatively, can benefit the consumers of this country.\n"", ""Let me say this in closing ... Mr. Nader said this was the last question. I will repeat in saying that I don't know all the answers. I have learned a lot from your questions and from the materials that you have been very gracious in submitting to me. I think it is very constructive for the nominee of the major party to come and be subjected to this kind of open interrogation on some very sensitive issues. Not having been a Member of the Congress, and not having been involved in the debates of its committees and not having heard much of the testimony, I am not qualified to answer a lot of the questions. I would like to ask you to do one more thing for me: If I am elected President, then as the President of our country, I hope you will let me come back [applause]\n"", 'Nader.

48,Jimmy Carter ,"August 13, 1976","[""Q. Governor, what do you believe are the nation's top priorities in the areas of economics and finance?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, obviously the priorities that we'll correlate as best we can are reductions in the unemployment rate, the inflation rate and the federal deficit, and restoration of the productivity of our country both as regards individual workers and our society in general. Another obvious need is to reduce the waste of our natural resources; to have long-range planning to conserve what we have for future years. Sometimes these needs are in conflict. But I think in general, if we pursue them collectively and with meticulous planning of long-range commitments, the conflicts between them can be minimized. My own belief is that the best overall effort should be toward reducing unemployment with an emphasis on private employment as contrasted to jobs created specifically and paid for by the government.\n"", 'Q. In outlining economic priorities, you talked about reducing unemployment as a prime goal. Do you think this can be accomplished without setting off another round of inflation?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think so. And my opinion is based on advice given to me by a wide range of economists from all parts of the political spectrum and the economic spectrum. I think that until you get down to the area of, say, 5 percent unemployment, a substantial reduction below what it is now, the inflationary pressures won't be great. Most projections showed that when you get below that point, then you have to assess very carefully on a daily or weekly or monthly basis a trade-off between increased emphasis on employment and increased attention to inflationary pressures. But I think that in the last major inflation explosion, which took place beginning in 1973, there was a peculiar combination of factors that won't be duplicated in the future: scarcity of commodities, devaluation of the dollar, oversale of American grain and wheat to the Soviet Union, a quadrupling in the price of basic energy supplies, followed later by increases in natural gas and coal. So I think, in general, we could get down well below what we are experiencing now in unemployment without inflationary pressures being in control.\n"", 'Q. Arthur Burns made a speech recently in which he suggested that in some senses the government should be the employer of last resort. Do you believe that in any sense the government should be the employer of last resort?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, yes. I don't know if Mr. Bums' definition of last resort and mine would be the same. I would guess they would be fairly compatible. There are some areas where government programs would be needed at the beginning of the next administration. Young people, particularly minority groups, have an unemployment rate of 40 percent—a heavy contributing factor to the crime rate increase. There, I think, an investment in a program similar to the CCC program that we experienced in the Great Depression would be beneficial to our country. Additionally, we have about 10 percent of our welfare recipients who are chronically dependent upon public financing and who are completely able to work. There is nothing wrong with them physically or mentally. I would like to see them taken out of the welfare system altogether, given job training and instruction if they can't read or write; the services of private and public job placement agencies should be matched with the job seeker—perhaps in the public sector setting up work in recreation centers or as teachers' aides, depending on their ability. If they're offered a job of that kind and don't take it, I wouldn't pay them any more benefits. Jobs could be first offered in the private sector, if they're available. Otherwise, I think it would be good to give them a public job. These areas ought to be initiated through government without delay. But in general, much more so than many of the Democratic Members of Congress, I would favor government programs strengthening the private sector in research and development funds, the guarantee of mortgages and so forth.\n"", 'Q. You believe in a balanced budget ...\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I do.\n', 'Q. Do you visualize as President that you could bring this about, and if so, how long do you think it would take?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I think so. Within the 4 year period I believe we could have a balanced budget. Our projections that have been made by leaders in The Conference Board and the Wharton School of Business confirm that. Obviously, if you have completely unforeseen circumstances arise, any national disharmonies or major disruption in the orderly supply of commodities or threat of war, that would make the predictions inaccurate. But our projections are that by the end of the first administration, 1979-80, have a balanced budget and that would be a major goal of mine. I think in normal economic times, within the framework of market fluctuations, that on average there should be a balanced budget.\n', 'Q. Do you visualize that you will have to forego a number of programs or cut existing services in order to do this?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. Not at all?\n', ""Governor Carter. Our projections are based on the fulfillment of my campaign commitments. I think that we can have a complete revision in the welfare system without any special increase in cost. Government reorganization would result in some decreased expenditures compared to what it would have been. I think we can have an equivalent or superior defense capability, and perhaps save, by some restructuring of the grade scales, a reduction in the number of instructors for a given number of students, withdrawing of our Armed Forces from some areas overseas—these kinds of things. I don't mean a reduction below what we've got now, but a reduction below what it would have been from normal growth.\n"", ""In addition to that, you would have some areas where the costs would be increased through government—the field of health care is a most notable example. We now spend about $550 per year for every man, woman and child in this country on health care. We still have an inferior health system. The most remarkable thing—and that concerns me most—is the inequity of access to health care among those who need it most. Now, whether we need more than $550 per person in this country for health care is something that I question. But with a comprehensive approach on prevention of disease, on the use of nonmedical personnel for the delivery of some aspects of health care, and for much tighter control on escalating costs for hospitals, for drugs and for health care itself, I believe that you can have a comprehensive health care system if it is phased in over a period of 3 or 4 years—without any disruption in the government's financial abilities. And even meeting that commitment, the budget can still be balanced.\n"", 'Q. Will you introduce zero-based budgeting on the federal level?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I shall. This is a unilateral decision that the President can make, working with the Office of Management and Budget. It doesn't require congressional approval. So in the preparation of the executive budget for which I will be responsible, I intend to use zero-based budgeting.\n"", ""Q. What is your attitude toward the Humphrey-Hawkins approach in government planning? I know you've said you'd come out for it in a modified version.\n"", ""Governor Carter. The concept is one with which I agree. And as you know', the Humphrey-Hawkins bill has not yet cleared either committee in the House or Senate. I don't even know the latest version because it's been constantly amended. But the amendments that have been made to it have been compatible with my own thinking. I think at first the definition of full employment was too idealistic. It was that we reduce the overall unemployment rate to 3 percent within 18 months. That would have been highly disruptive, I think, and very inflationary in nature. To say that we need a goal of 3 percent adult unemployment at the end of 4 years is reasonable. Adults have now been defined, just within the last week or two, I understand, as 20 years old or older. So by the definition of terms, you can alleviate the inflationary pressures.\n"", 'Also, I felt at first that there was too much emphasis on government jobs. And in my opinion, the ""last resort"" aspect ought to be emphasized much more clearly than it w as to begin with. I also have two more concerns. One is that there was an unwarranted encroachment of the federal government in planning the private economy. My own inclination toward planning is that the government ought to plan what it\'s going to do. Let the impact of government decisions be made obvious to the business and professional world. But then let the business and professional world make their decisions of their own free will, using government plans as one of the factors in the decision making process.\n', 'And the other change that has been made in the Humphrey-Hawkins bill has been the requirement on wage scales. Originally, there was a requirement that anybody hired through a government program had to be paid the prevailing w age in that area. I think that since then that definition has been changed so that you simply have to comply with the minimum wage requirements. So those changes have all been moving in the right direction. But the concept that employment should be a major priority goal of our country is one with which I agree.\n', 'Q. Let me ask you a couple of things about taxes. First, an overall comment about tax reform and what you would like to see. And then more specifically, any changes that you foresee for the capital gains tax and the double taxation of dividends.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I've been cautious about making specific commitments, but I will say this: I intend to completely reform the income tax structure. Not to amend what we have now piecemeal, but to analyze as thoroughly as I'm humanly capable of doing with as much advice and counsel and help as I can recruit to start from scratch and say this is what a fair, equitable, efficient income tax code should be. There will be several factors involved and I'm going to speak in generalities.\n"", ""First of all, there's a tremendous simplification of it. The total tax code now consists of about 40,000 pages, I understand. It should be grossly simplified. Secondly, I would drastically reduce the number of incentives or tax expenditures or, if you want to use the phrase, loopholes that presently exist. They have been contrived in the past, legitimately, to meet changing economic needs. But once that need has passed, speaking in historical terms, they remain, depending upon the power that has been generated among the special interest groups, even though the interest group might have been quite benevolent. So the elimination of loopholes would be another factor.\n"", ""Third, I would continue some of the features of the present tax code. I don't want to be definitive about it, but one would be charitable gifts. I would be very strict, though, on foundations, to be sure that the corpus of the foundation was not used to benefit individual human beings, that salary schedules would be reasonable, that the income derived from foundations should all be spent for charitable purposes as originally planned and so forth.\n"", 'I would have a truly progressive tax rate, so that those who have the higher incomes would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxation which does not apply at this point...\n', 'Q. Why do you say that progressive taxation does not apply?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, for a family that makes over $50,000, the percentage of their income paid in taxes is about the same as one that makes less than $10,000. The larger corporations probably pay a smaller percentage of their total income in taxes than the smaller corporations do. I believe this is an accurate statement. There ought to be a simple and progressive system. I would tend to treat income more nearly the same, and that gets into your capital gains question.\n', 'I see no reason why someone who works 3,000 hours in manual labor at $3 an hour and makes $9,000 should pay twice as much tax as someone who buys the lot next to mine, keeps it a year and resells it and makes a $9,000 profit. I also understand the very serious problem of capital accumulation and retention for investment and in creating new jobs. So I understand there has to be caution expressed in the principle I have just described.\n', ""I don't feel that income should be taxed twice. Now exactly how to deal with the taxation of corporate income, I haven't yet announced. I have some thoughts, and we're doing some studies on that. I don't think that corporate income should be taxed when it's earned and also again when it is distributed. My own inclination would be to tax income based on the tax bracket occupied by the stockholder.\n"", 'The mechanism through which that should be done has been described in many tax reform analyses, and which would be the most efficient, the simplest, the easiest to administer, and the fairest is something that I would like to reserve the right to decide later.\n', ""This entire process of tax reform might take as long as a full year, even with concerted emphasis on the part of the White House. I don't intend to do it piecemeal. I think that any piecemeal reform of the present tax code is doomed to failure because the special groups that benefit from the particular paragraph in the tax code can focus their full attention on protecting their benefits and the general public has no awareness of what's going on. Even Members of the Congress quite often have no awareness. But a comprehensive approach can be highly dramatized, and if I can understand it as President, and through fireside chats or other mechanisms let the American people know what is the present circumstance and what the improvements can be, I think we will have a good chance to accomplish these changes in the code.\n"", 'Q. One of the negatives that you touched on in dealing with the capital gains tax is the need for capital formation in this country to satisfy our needs for the next decade and beyond. Are you thinking in terms of other steps or some steps to foster capital formation in this country?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; as I say, I'm not qualified now to spell out specifically what I am going to decide or recommend a year or a year and a half in the future after I become President. I'm just not qualified to do that yet. But there are obviously many things that can be done concerning investment tax credits if they are continued and in what form they ought to be—the orientation of incentive for private homeownership, a shift away from debt financing to more equity financing, things of that kind. I don't want to be presumptuous and say that I know all the specific answers yet, but the general principles that I've described to you I feel very deeply should be pursued.\n"", 'Q. Are you satisfied with the way monetary policy has been conducted in the country in the last few years? Do you favor any changes in the structure or functioning of the Federal Reserve System?\n', 'Governor Carter. Obviously, in retrospect, as is the case with many Monday morning quarterbacks, I can criticize what has been done. I thought that during the period that I described earlier—when we had the tremendous impact of escalating unemployment and inflationary pressures brought about by external circumstances: grain sales, commodity scarcity, devaluation of the dollar, oil price increases—I thought that the Federal Reserve was much too restrictive when the growth in the supply of money was reduced almost to zero. However, I think we have enough flexibility built into the system now. I would not want to take away the autonomy of the Federal Reserve Board. The way I understand the circumstances, there are three major elements that affect the monetary supply. One is obviously the Federal Reserve Board. Another one is the attitude of the Congress through tax modifications. Tax rebates, changes in tax code and so forth, can very quickly inject large amounts of money into the economy, independently of the Federal Reserve Board decision making process. And the final one is the attitude of the President, and the influence the President can exert on the business community and the consciousness of individual American citizens.\n', 'The only change that I would like to make is that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board have his term coterminous with the President. I think there ought to be that relationship. But I would not want to dominate the Federal Reserve Board, and I think that this minimal change which I favor would be the only one that I would contemplate.\n', 'Q. Do you favor a return to fixed exchange rates?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. Are you happy with floating rates?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Do you favor a return of gold to the monetary system?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. I would like to change the focus of attention to the energy shortage and our dependence on overseas sources. What are your plans to ameliorate those conditions and would they include a splitting up of our oil companies?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think it's misleading for leaders like President Nixon to declare a national commitment to energy independence. We can't be independent of energy imports any more than we can be independent of bauxite imports or zinc or molybdenum or a number of other basic commodities. I think that's an artificially created hope that was done just for political purposes. We have seen since Nixon made his speech on that subject an increase in the percentage of imports from 25 percent up now to more than 40 percent. In some months I think it's even been over 50 percent. So I think we're going to have to continue to import oil.\n"", ""I think we ought to have enough reserve supply or flexibility in our consumption to be able to withstand a possible embargo of oil shipments from the Arab countries. In case a Middle Eastern conflict does recur, I would make it clear to the Arab countries that if they declare another embargo or attempt to blackmail us again, we would consider this a very serious attack on our nation's strength. We would consider it not a military but an economic declaration of war. We would respond accordingly and not ship them any weapons or spare parts for weapons, or oil drilling rigs or oil pipe. I say that not to be contentious or to threaten, but to let them know the seriousness of it in the expectation and hope that it would avoid a recurrence of that very serious problem.\n"", 'I would also work assiduously to bring into being an understandable long-range energy policy and to outline it quickly. I think we would have to continue to use oil. The supplies are going to inevitably drop off as time goes on. I would shift more toward coal as a basic source of stationary heat supply, including the generation of electricity. I personally favor an emphasis on the use of Appalachian coal because of the absence of disruption of labor in those communities and also because of its proximity to the area of need, which is on the eastern seaboard.\n', 'I would greatly increase dependence on solar energy, recognizing the percentage limitation might be fairly small. But I would shift to research and development toward solar energy—in all of its forms: temperature variance, geothermal supplies, wind supplies, direct impact of heat from the sun and so forth. I think the hydroelectric potential has pretty well been realized—3 percent or 4 percent of our total energy supply.\n', 'I would have strict conservation measures instituted, with an emphasis on the economy of automobiles, size of automobile engines, better insulation of homes, changes in the rate structure of electric power companies to discourage waste of electricity, public opinion statements by the President and others encouraging people to conserve. And maybe over a long-range period, encourage a change in our lifestyle to some degree to make sure that we use our energy resources and reserves much more efficiently.\n', ""As a last resort—atomic power. I have been an atomic engineer. That's what I did my graduate work in, and I've had a chance to learn about atomic power plants fairly well. I still understand some basic principles involved. I think I understand to an adequate degree the limitations and capabilities of atomic power. So I think atomic power is going to have to be continued for use in the foreseeable future. Chicago, for instance, gets about 32 percent of all its electricity from atomic power plants. And I think that atomic power plants can be safe. There are some safety precautions that ought to be reinstituted or maintained rigidly. I think the President, working with ERDA and other entities in this society—the government structure—ought to be responsible. I think, for instance, that power plants ought to be built where people don't live and where earthquake faults are not present. In most cases, I think it's feasible to locate the reactive core itself below ground level. The buildings should be tightly sealed and a vacuum maintained so that if there is a meltdown—they can explode, by the way—the gases can be retained within the tightly sealed building until the radioactivity dissipates. There ought to be standardization of design for atomic power plants and there ought to be a full-time atomic energy representative in the control room, independent of the power company, to shut down the plant if an abnormality should develop. Those are the kind of safety precautions that have been maintained, I think, rigidly and without exception in the atomic power plants under the control of Admiral Rickover. And they haven't added extraordinary additional costs.\n"", 'Q. Do you think under the proper controls it can become an important source of energy for this country in the next decade?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think it's going to be an important source. I think now the percentage of power that comes from atomic power is even less than hydroelectric. But it's going to increase to some degree. Overall, I would like to see us cut down our rate of growth in the use of energy to maybe 2 percent a year. I think that's a reasonable expectation. Several independent studies have shown this. A Rockefeller study, maybe it was a Ford study, I've forgotten, The International Assessments under the auspices of the United Nations Trilateral Commission study, The Club of Rome analyses, all show that our own country could prosper and give our people a better quality of life with a 2 percent increase per year in energy consumption. I think that there was a great deal of progress made for a while as a result of the crisis in 1973, when the people just thought about it. Since then there has been a lessening of commitment to eliminate waste. So I think all these things can be done in an overall energy policy.\n"", 'Q. If inflation should intensify again, do you favor some sort of income policy, wage-price control standbys?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I would like us to have as a last resort, and if other economic policies can\'t prevail, some standby wage and price control authority. I don\'t think I would ever have to use it. But I would like that right as a source of persuasion. I think to strengthen the present board would probably be the first step. Then we should reestablish the relationship between industry and labor with private meetings with the President as well as with one another to say, ""Why don\'t we get some voluntary goals for our country?"" I think that would be a good step to take. I would do everything I could to avoid the need for wage-price controls. But if I felt the economy required that strong action, I would not hesitate to ask for it and to use it.\n', 'Q. One final question. You alluded before to national health and to reexamine the whole picture comprehensively. Any national health insurance program would obviously be very expensive. How would you think of financing such a national program?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, as I said earlier in my answer, I am not sure that the total cost of the health program would have to be increased. We now spend more per capita than any other nation in the world. We spend more as a percentage of our gross national product on health care than any other country in the world. There would be some shift toward more federal government participation. I would like to keep the relationship between the private physician and the patient one of mutual choice. I would like to retain the right of a patient to decide whether he goes for treatment. But the financing would come from contributions of a mandatory nature, from employees and employers, and a continuation to some degree now unassessed from the government's general funds. As you know, quite a lot of health care is now financed by general funds. But I would say those three sources: employee, employer and government.""]"

A couple of Sundays ago there were two tourists from Miami who left the church after the service, and one of them turned to the other and said, ""How did I do in the service?"" And the other fellow said, ""Well, you did okay, but the word is hallelujah and not Hialeah.""\n', 'I also feel proud to be here because of your own heritage. West Virginia has a Democratic heritage. All of us were impressed in 1960 when you opened your arms and opened your hearts to John Kennedy. It was the turning point in the nomination of that great man.\n', ""And you've had in Congress a superlative congressional delegation. And I look forward next year to working with that delegation and with your new, great, Democratic Governor, Jay Rockefeller.\n"", 'Shortly after the California, New Jersey and Ohio primaries, when it seemed assured that I would be the nominee, I went to Washington to meet with Senator Byrd and with Jennings Randolph and all the Democratic Senators. And following our meeting, at which they endorsed me unanimously, one of the network television reporters asked Senator Byrd, ""You\'ve been here a long time, you\'ve heard a lot of Presidential candidates promise that the government is going to be completely reorganized and made efficient, economical, and purposeful and manageable. Do you believe that Jimmy Carter, who\'s promised this, can carry out the promise, knowing about the opposition that\'s going to be there from the massive special interest groups in Washington.?"" And I was afraid to hear the answer. But Senator Byrd said, ""Absolutely. It will be done if he is elected, and we\'re going to help him."" I\'ll never forget that And obviously he knows that I am counting on him.\n', ""Last night I wrote Senator Jennings Randolph a thank you note. He sent me a book that expresses very clearly his own concept of what government ought to be. It's a book that relates to ethics—honesty, integrity, openness, purposefulness, in public service. And along with it, he sent me a letter outlining what the Congress had attempted to do under his leadership in the field of energy. That's a remarkable condensation of what he's meant to the country. A man whose reputation is justifiably great A man who's been in the Congress since 1933, I. believe. Who was there during the depression years, working with Franklin Roosevelt. Who was there to help form the REA program that turned on the electric lights in the isolated farm house where I lived. And who's been present as the major decisions have been made that shaped our country. And I'm deeply grateful for his friendship and thank West Viiginia for letting the nation have a leader like Jennings Randolph. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n"", ""I just want to say a few things tonight. Things that are important to me as a Democratic nominee for President Someone told me, I think it was Sharon [Percy Rockefeller], that I'm the first Presidential nominee who's ever come to West Virginia to speak at a Jefferson-Jackson Day banquet I'm glad you honored me by letting me come.\n"", ""I've tried to single out a few things that are important to you uniquely in this state. One I know is the energy problem. As I've traveled and campaigned throughout the country, particularly in New England, I've pointed out that we must have a comprehensive energy policy for our country. That the major thrust of it is inevitably going to be a shift from primary dependence on oil to primary dependence on coal.\n"", ""In 1950, 35 percent of our energy came from coal. We've got about 40 years supply of oil left in the whole world. In our country alone, we've got six hundred years, at least, supply of coal. Three hundred years of which is clean burning and readily accessible. And as you know, major portions of it are in the Appalachian regions. One statement that I've made throughout the country is that as we shift our efforts toward increasing use of coal, the emphasis ought to be on extraction and use of coal from Appalachia and not the far western deposits.\n"", ""Last year, we produced 650 million tons of coal—about 110 million came from your own state. A lot of people say that we haven't got any ability to expand production because in the last few years we've not seen it expand at all. But a study by the American Institute of Engineers says that by 1985 we can be producing 1,250 million tons of coal—about twice as much—that's clean burning, efficient and near the point where the energy must be consumed, that is, the eastern seaboard.\n"", ""So the future of West Virginia, Appalachian coal, is indeed bright if we can have a government policy that recognizes this tremendous resource, has research and development money going into better extraction, better safety, cleaner burning coal supplies. I'm committed to that proposition and you can depend on it\n"", 'As that change takes place we must be very careful to honor and protect the courageous men and families who have for generations gone into the deep mines. About half the coal now is produced from deep mines in this country. The other half from strip mines.\n', ""I was distressed to read in a speech Jay Rockefeller made recently that on the average for the last five years, West Virginia has lost forty men per year in coal mine accidents. Our present laws are not being adequately enforced. Inspection is not rigid enough. And this tragic loss must be reduced or eliminated. I agree with what Jay Rockefeller said, that the goal we set for ourselves must not be 30 deaths, not 25 deaths, not 20 deaths per year, but zero deaths among those who serve us so well, so sacrificially, and so bravely in the coal mines. I want to make it certain that it doesn't have to be an act of bravery to supply our energy needs from your coal mines.\n"", 'Government can be sensitive. Government can be well organized. Government can be honest. Government can be open.\n', ""In recent years, it hasn't been. Our country has suffered from it We've been embarrassed. We've been alienated. We've withdrawn. We've been concerned. We've been ashamed at times. That need not be. Our people's spirit has not been broken. In the last 24 years, we've had Democrats in the White House only eight years—only eight years. There's been a reason for it, and I'll get to that in a few minutes.\n"", ""But what do we want from government? We want to work. We want jobs. We haven't got them. In 1968, when Richard Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent. Today, it's more than twice that high—about 7.8 percent and going up.\n"", 'There has been a philosophy within the Republican Party that the. best way to hold down inflation is to create a buffer supply of unemployed human beings. Any economic concept that thinks that the best way to control inflation is to keep people out of work is bankrupt, and our country cannot tolerate this any longer.\n', 'Even with an emphasis on inflation—let unemployment go where it will— what has been the record under John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson? Do you know what the average inflation rate was per year? 2 percent. Under Nixon and Ford, do you know what the average inflation rate has been per year? 6.9 percent. This is not progress.\n', 'And it shows that an understanding of economics, when the human factor is left out, is not good for our nation in any respect. Recessions hurt those who are weakest, who are already poor, who are rural or isolated, who have marginal educational opportunities, whose family ties are weak, who are timid and inarticulate. Under the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, for eight years, we had zero recessions. Under Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford— five recessions.\n', ""The Republicans have always claimed that in spite of the statistics at least they don't waste money. The Democrats, in their inclination to help human beings with social programs, create enormous deficits. But what's the record? The accumulated deficits for the last two years and under the administration's current budget are $170 billion, more than the last thirty years combined. Under Kennedy and Johnson, the average deficit was less than $7 billion a year. Under Nixon and Ford, the average deficit has been more than $24 billion a year.\n"", ""I don't want to paint a black picture, or a frightful picture of our country. I don't want to criticize those who struggle with these needs. And here's a legitimate question—is anyone trying to do anything about our human needs? The answer is yes. Under Jennings Randolph's leadership, there have been a series of public works bills passed by the Congress to put our people back to work, to provide services for those in communities where the services are actually needed. Not to waste money, but to spend it wisely as a tremendous investment in our own citizens.\n"", 'The last time President Ford vetoed a bill—the next to the last—he let the Senate leadership know, ""I can\'t accept that bill, work out one that\'s more modest."" And that\'s what Senator Randolph did. And the bill passed. And did President Ford sign it? No. It was vetoed. Seven hundred thousand jobs lost to our people.\n', ""Unemployment hurts every family almost. And, particularly, those who are unemployed for a long term. So the Congress passed a bill and said that for a family that is unemployed, let's help them simply make the payments on their own home mortgages until they get another job. The Congress passed this bill. President Ford vetoed it.\n"", ""Children need to eat, even if their fathers and mothers don't work. So the Congress passed a school lunch bill. A program that was started originally by my own Senator, Richard Russell. This was designed to provide school lunch room services for the poorer families. And President Ford vetoed it.\n"", ""My middle son, Chip, his wife's name is Caron. She teaches a pre-first grade class of children who can't quite make it because of their devastating poverty. Almost all those students happen to be black. When they cut off the funds for the school lunch program, my daughter-in-law, without telling me or Rosalynn, took money out of her own pocket and bought food and milk for those children. Later, when she could afford it no longer, she asked her father to contribute money. And he did, to buy milk for those children.\n"", 'But the veto of such needed legislation is not typical of the attitude of our country or public servants.\n', 'There was another bill passed to provide better medical care in rural areas and inner cities, to let doctors go there. It was vetoed. There was another bill passed to give Vietnamese veterans, the most unappreciated heroes in our history, an educational opportunity. It was vetoed by President Ford.\n', ""These vetoes don't help our nation's economy. They don't save money. They cause human suffering. And wisely, the leaders on the platform with me tonight overrode those vetoes. Too long, we've had government by veto. Negative government. That's got to change.\n"", 'I very seldom say anything good about Richard Nixon. But he only vetoed an average of seven bills per year. President Ford has vetoed 27 bills per year.\n', ""I don't want to go into much more detail about governmental problems. But I want to make one point that I made in New Hampshire the other day that causes me deep concern. And that's the impact of inadequate leadership on our families. Forty percent of all marriages today end in divorce. In 1960, children bom of unwed mothers comprised one out of twenty. Last year, one out of eight. There's a tremendous increase in crime brought about primarily by unemployment, a shift toward drug addiction, alcoholism, emotional problems for young people. Among those in our society today, black and white, rich and poor, between 15 and 19 years old, the second most frequent cause of death is suicide. This is coupled with a lowering of moral standards. In the last ten years, the gonorrhea rate has tripled among our children less than 14 years old. This has got to be dealt with.\n"", ""Government leaders—Presidents, majority leaders, committee chairmen, governors, Members of Congress—can't do it alone. There has got to be a surge of commitment and concern among those of us, like the 3,000 to 3,500 assembled here tonight, who care and who've been blessed by God with material wealth, social prominence, leadership capabilities, and community influence. I think you all noticed at the Democratic Convention the remarkable demonstration of unity, of binding together. And that includes you, no matter what your position in life might be. You're an American citizen, and when our kids have gonorrhea, when our young men commit suicide, and drug addiction is with us, when fathers and mothers are unemployed, when families break up, when health care is not there, it's a responsibility of us all\n"", ""There are some things which must be done that I've spelled out very clearly over the last twenty months and in my acceptance speech. Our income tax system in this country is a disgrace to the human race. It's got to be changed. The surest income to be taxed is the income earned from manual labor. There are all kinds of loopholes and special privileges for people that are powerful, and nowadays, the average family that makes a million dollars a year pays a lower percentage of this income in taxes than does the average family that makes less than $10,000 a year. We need basic reform. Not amendments, one section at a time, but a comprehensive analysis of a fair way for our people to be taxed.\n"", 'Health care is a problem. In this country now we spend an average of $550 per year for every man, woman, and child in our nation. There is no other nation on earth that spends as much on health care as a percentage of their gross national product But we still have gross inequities. And sometimes with a poor family, or even one with fairly moderate means, when someone gets sick they are reluctant to go to a doctor. I heard the other day a story that illustrates this point. I don\'t know if it was a coal miner or a peanut farmer, but he went to the doctor and the doctor said, ""Sir, you need an operation. Do you believe that you have enough money to afford it?"" And the fellow thought for awhile, and he said, ""Doctor, I want to ask you a question, if I don\'t have enough money to pay, do you think I still need the operation?""\n', ""Well, the fear of enormous medical costs is bad enough. But we still have a tremendous affliction on our people in unmet preventive care. I grew up on a farm in an isolated area. I got good medical care. But the emphasis was on the prevention of disease. Those of you who are as old as I am remember those diseases: typhus, typhoid, diphtheria, whooping cough, mumps, measles, and polio. But the emphasis was on prevention. We need a comprehensive nationwide mandatory health care system in this country. And if I'm elected, that will be a major goal of mine.\n"", ""In closing, I would like to say one other thing. We need an open government to let our people know what our government leaders are doing, including the President. Every time our nation's made a serious mistake in the managing of foreign affairs—in Watergate, Cambodia, Vietnam—it's been because our people have been excluded from the process. We've [not] known what was going on. We've been held at arm's length and separated from our own government.\n"", ""I grew up on a farm. I never wasted my own money. I saw what good government services did to change my life. My family's lived in Georgia more than 200 years. Nobody in my father's family ever finished high school before me. I had a good chance in life. And I want to be sure that government gives our young people today a good chance in life.\n"", ""I don't believe in giveaway programs. I don't believe in wasted money. I don't believe in confusion in government. I believe in tough, competent management And I also believe in delivering services to people who legitimately need those services in an efficient and economical and sensitive way. This is what the American people want. It's not liberal or conservative. It's just what's right.\n"", 'I want you to help me this fall. To be elected, yes. But also to set a standard of service. To help tear down the wall that exists between our people and our government. To help tear down the wall that exists between the White House and the Congress. To tear down the wall that exists among the regions of our country. To tear down the wall that exists between different races or religions.\n', ""These walls have kept us from one another. They've kept us from sharing the responsibilities for our own future. They've isolated us and weakened us and drained the strength that's there. I know as much about this country, I believe, as any other person because I've campaigned so hard. And I've seen it as an innate strength that hasn't been shaken. Our economical strength is still there. Our system of government is the best on earth. And our people are our most tremendous resource of all. I want to see investments made in people and not just in buildings and atomic weapons. I want to see our country go back to work. I want to see defects eliminated in government delivery of services.\n"", 'If we can put a space vehicle on Mars, I believe that we can four-lane the highway between Charleston and Princeton in less than twenty-five years.\n', ""We've accomplished the most difficult task already. And that is to unify the Democratic Party. I believe that we can go from there to unify our nation. But we Democrats have been bound together, not because of Jimmy Carter, not because of Chairman Bob Strauss, not even because of great senatorial leaders. We've been bound together because we have a common concern and a common purpose and a common hope and a common ideal and a common dream that gives us strength. But we derive our strength from the factory shift lines and the barbershops and beauty parlors, and truck drivers and farmers and miners and carpenters. People who don't want anything selfish out of government, but who want to see us once again have a nation that's strong, and honest, and sensitive, open and of which we can legitimately be proud.\n"", 'We\'ve got to deserve—we Democrats—have got to deserve the trust and the support that we ask the people of this country to give us. We\'ve been wounded deeply, this nation. And many people, I know, particularly the young, say, ""I\'m disgusted but Pm going to give my country and its leaden one more chance.""\n', ""If I should do anything to betray the trust that's been put in me, it would have a devastating impact on this country. The smallest lie, the smallest misleading statement, the smallest betrayal of confidence, would be enormously magnified. I'm not a perfect man. I'm sinful like everyone else. I make my mistakes. But I think I can minimize my mistakes in the future by tying myself, as I have in the past, directly with you. I don't ever want there to be any powerful, big shot political intermediary between me and the average citizen of this country. We've got to be melded together. That's a characteristic of the Democratic Party when it's at its finest. Senator Byrd, Senator Randolph, Jay Rockefeller, your Members of Congress, your state party chairmen, and others see this very clearly.\n"", ""As we went through the convention proceedings in New York, I saw again and again as special interest groups—good groups—came to my apartment at the hotel with all kinds of demands. Some of which were quite selfish. And they were willing to yield to create a commonality of purpose and a mutual resolution of our nation's problems and to search for answers in unity. That's got to be your purpose here in West Virginia. You can turn this state around politically and have a close working relationship between your Democratic governor and your assembly and between your governor and the Congress, between the Congress and the White House.\n"", ""So we can see the greatness of the people of your state mirrored in a better quality of life. I think we are willing to make the sacrifice as Democrats to bring that about and as the nominee of our party I'm going to expect the Republicans to make a sacrifice too. Specifically tonight, in West Virginia, I want them to sacrifice the governor's office and the White House next year.""]"
50,Jimmy Carter ,"August 16, 1976","['Governor Carter. This press conference will be devoted to the subject of our briefing this afternoon in order to save time and let these experts on different subjects stay on their schedule. We had a 4 1/2 hour discussion of subjects generally related to social or human resource issues. They related to income security—Social Security, federal employee retirement, unemployment compensation, aid for families with dependent children, SSI, foodstamps, child nutrition, housing, Medicaid, Medicare. We also discussed subjects concerning education, manpower training, and social services.\n', 'We did several things today that might be of interest to you. First of all, I think there was general agreement that the best way to approach this broad subject is to consider it as an entity and to lay down during the campaign this fall as best we can for the American people to consider, long-range purposes or goals: what we can hope to achieve at the end of a 4 year or 5 year period and which aspects of that achievement we hope to accomplish at the end of each succeeding year; what will be the net cost to the people of this country as we give better services.\n', 'There was also, I think, an almost unanimous agreement that any improvement in the quality of services or level of services had to be combined with the reorganization of the structure of government; that the present bureaucratic mess almost was an insuperable obstacle to the achievement of those better service delivery systems. So reorganization of the structure of government must be done as rapidly as possible.\n', ""Another thing that we discussed was that we would try to maintain my own goal of a balanced budget by the end of the first 4 years, assuming i am elected President, and at the same time hold down the percentage of our gross national product that's spent by the federal government to its present level—roughly 20 to 21 percent—and to use those as parameters for the future. There is also a general agreement that we ought to think about those federal programs in human terms. One example given, of course, was the impact of federal programs on the family structure which I have already pursued in one speech and I've emphasized again and again. A second concern was the impact 6f federal programs on the quality and the maintenance of the standards within communities—particularly the urban communities that have been damaged already and are threatened with further damage in the future.\n"", ""The last point I want to make is this. No matter whether we're talking about young people or aid for families with dependent children or any other aspect of our societal life, there was a general feeling that people are better off if they have fruitful employment for themselves—work. As was the case with the discussion on inflation and employment, everyone agreed that we ought to emphasize the right of people to have a job. It's a good investment for the future, it cuts down on all the ancillary costs of government—welfare, unemployment insurance, and other aspects that are very costly at this time. And we agreed that the first effort should be within the present limits of our federal budget, to make that expenditure much more efficient as a first priority. Between now and the election itself, we will try to present these programs to the people, and if I am elected President, we should be ready with some concrete proposals early in November, so that we can move aggressively on Inauguration Day if I am elected. There are some broad principles. I think I might ask now for some specific questions on these subjects and let those who have given me information this afternoon and who are experts in their fields help me in answering these questions. So if you have a question on these subjects, I'll be glad to take them now.\n"", 'Q. Governor, did you discuss busing at all?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, we did, as a matter of fact. We had quite a spirited debate, coincidentally between two of our black representatives here. Most of the white participants just stayed out of it. We didn't resolve the issues raised and they say they're going to finish their debate on the bus going back to Atlanta. We're going to have to put some people between them.\n"", ""There was a general feeling that our society ought not to back off from our commitment to the integration of our educational system, that this is a very beneficial thing for the students, both black and white and those that represent other minority groups. The laws needs to be applied uniformly throughout the country. The next administration needs to spell out a strong position on the issue of busing and on the issue of transporting students. The first priority ought to be insuring a quality education for every child, and that arbitrary rules or formulas perhaps are an improper way to approach the subject. But we did discuss busing, and education. Commissioner Riles from California has had some special experiences with that subject and I would be glad to have you address specific questions to him on this if you'd like.\n"", 'Q. Governor, what specific proposals do you have now on welfare reform?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would have to limit my specific proposals on welfare reform to what I have already discussed. One is to remove those people who are able to work from the welfare system all together and to provide them with employment assistance rather than the dole. These persons need to be given manpower opportunities, educational opportunities, training opportunities, matched with a job, offered a job, and be treated outside the so-called welfare system itself.\n', 'Second, we need to deal with the working poor—those who presently work full-time but whose incomes fall far below the poverty level should also be outside the welfare system itself, and helped perhaps through the tax structure.\n', 'Third, those who cannot work full-time ought to be treated with respect, with compassion, with understanding, given encouragement to work parttime if they are able. Any program to help these people should always insure that it is never more attractive for someone who can work to stay on the welfare rolls instead of working either part-time or full-time.\n', ""One last point that I have made often, and I haven't changed my mind at all, is to try to place an emphasis on strengthening the family structure— not to ever make it advantageous or mandatory that a father leave the home in order for his own family to have an adequate income for sustaining life.\n"", ""We agree, too, that the welfare laws which are now multitudinous and sometimes overlapping and wasteful and very confusing ought to be greatly simplified. There ought to be one basic payment to meet the necessities of life, varying in amount only enough to accommodate cost of living changes from one community to another. Over a period of time there ought to be a shifting of responsibilities for financing welfare away from the local governments to the federal government. Later on a shifting away from state governments toward the federal government. Those are some of the principles of welfare reform that I think there is a general agreement on but I'm not sure that we're unanimous.\n"", ""Q. Isn't it awfully difficult to take people off the welfare rolls when unemployment is at 7 or 8 percent?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think it's interesting to point out that in manpower training, in placement, counseling and other employment assistance, CETA, and in other social services that now fall within the framework of education that we spend $13.6 billion right now to put people to work. Under the subject of AFDC and SSI, we have $4 billion less spent, so we already have a combination of major expenditures to put people to work on the one hand, and to support them on the welfare rolls on the other. I think we need to combine these two thrusts. We need to take those who can work out of the welfare system. Then we need to give them job training, job placement, education, if they need it, using the services of public and private job placement agencies, match them with a job, offer them a job. But sometimes we lose sight of the fact that the number of people in the so-called welfare categories is relatively small compared to the number of people in other categories. But that's where a lot of the dissatisfaction falls. I believe the emphasis on work opportunities, as contrasted with full-time dependence on the welfare system for those who are able to work, either part-time or full-time, is one of the roots of our problem.\n"", 'Q. The statement that you made, Governor, that you want to hold the percentage of gross product spent on these kinds of programs to the present level—is that a commitment on your part or a statement of desire?\n', ""Governor Carter. It's a statement of a goal. There is some difference of opinion on this. The goal that we have set for ourselves is roughly 20 percent I think the present level is about 21 percent. That's all programs put together in the whole federal government. That's total federal expenditures as a percentage of the gross national product. I would like to keep that same level intact. Now there is one possible major program that might cause a deviation from that. If we take large amounts of presently private expenditure that goes into the health system and administer the health program through federal expenditures, that might cause an increase of maybe 1 or 2 percentage points.\n"", 'But that would be the only exception and we are still looking into that question. I think this is one element of increased federal spending that would be completely acceptable to the American people. This is derived from polls by Pat Caddell and many other polls that have been conducted. The American people are willing to see more money spent through the federal government to have a comprehensive health care system. I might point out that the total amount of money that might be spent on a comprehensive health care system would increase very slightly but there might be a shift away from private financing to the federal government that might increase the figure above the 20 percent or 21 percent level. That would be the only exception that I might be willing to accommodate and I still would like to hold down by the end of my term the percentage of the GNP that goes through the federal government to the 20 or 21 percent level.\n', 'Q. Governor, if there were an increase, such as the one you are speaking of, how would it be financed? Where would the money come from?\n', 'Governor Carter. There are several ways it could be paid for: employer-employee contributions, for example, or an increase in the general tax level. Of course, the question that still has to be addressed is how much of the program would still be financed or administered by the private insurance sector. These questions will have to be answered later on. But that is the way it would be financed if we made that decision.\n', 'Q. [Almost inaudible. Concerning where the money for expansion of federal health insurance programs and other efforts can be obtained.]\n', ""Governor Carter. You have to remember this. The GNP of our country goes up year by year, either in actual dollars or in inflated dollars. So the total amount of federal government expenditures can rise while government as a percentage of GNP remains the same. Are you with me so far? So, we would have an amount that would be spent between the 1977 budget and the 1981 budget of about $60 billion. This figure takes into account the growth through inflation, the extension of presently existing programs, and the increase in new programs. That's the framework within which we all are making our plans. What I intend to do before the election is over this fall is to spell out a rough allocation of these increasing funds within a four year period so that the American people will know general parameters within which we will work financially. It will also give a good indication of the priorities that I think ought to be established for our country. I think this is important for several reasons: one is to get a national commitment or mandate from the people with a successful campaign so that there will be a unanimity of purpose with everybody having to yield somewhat on special or sometimes selfish aspirations. And second, it would tie me much more closely with congressional candidates and with congressional leaders if we spell out ahead of time what we hope to do. People like Senator Russell Long or Congressman Al Ullman, for instance, to the extent they agree with the purposes that I have expressed can help me work to achieve these common purposes. So I think to the degree that I can understand these programs, and present them to the American people as part of a 4 year program laying out our priorities and the funds that will be allocated to them—to that extent we can achieve these goals with a minimum of disharmony if I am elected.\n"", 'Q. Governor, I would like to ask one more thing. The matter of attitude surrounding welfare reform and welfare payments, etc., is probably much more serious a grievance problem than the economics of welfare reform?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, it is.\n', 'Q. What is your feeling about the attitudes in the country, the volatility of the attitudes about welfare payments, etc., and how would you deal with these attitudes before the election?\n', 'Governor Carter. It is hard for me to express to you all the attitudes that cause me concern. I would say that the most prevalent attitude that hurts the welfare system is the belief on the part of the taxpayers that their money is wasted. A belief among welfare recipients that they are not treated fairly. The complexity of the present systems that have accumulated over a long period of time—one program at a time, and the insensitivity of the programs to those that honestly need help. All these factors cumulatively create a great distrust of the fairness or the compassion of the welfare system itself. And, I think, one of the key points is to remove those from the welfare system who are generally acknowledged to be able to work and to treat them under some other category, either as those who are partially employed or those who are under training looking for a job, or those who are actually given jobs in the private or public sector. So, those are some of the adverse attitudes I think could be changed.\n', 'Q. Governor, could you give us any examples of how you might reorganize social programs?\n', ""Governor Carter. One of the examples that I have used in a speech that I made on health is to spell out the multiplicity of programs. There are about 72 different agencies, large and small, that deal with physical health care. There are 10 major agencies that deal with health—Medicaid is in one agency, Medicare is in a different agency. Neither one of those agencies deal with health care directly but they serve the same people and I think this fragmentation of responsibility for adequate health care in our country is one of the problems with which I will have to deal. But exactly which one of those agencies will survive, what the exact placement of those agencies might be in the major departments is something that I'm not yet prepared to spell out. But that's an example of the problem, and I would anticipate cutting down those agencies to a very small number, consolidating responsibility for health care within one major agency or maybe two at the most, and having the number of agencies drastically reduced.\n"", 'I think you all have a list of those who are here and if you have a question that you would like to address to some of the people behind me I would certainly welcome the opportunity to defer to them.\n', 'Q. What are the top priorities you see for your administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. There are two major projects that will take some time to study. One is the comprehensive reform of the income tax structure to which I'm committed and which I will do. That will take a great deal of study. It's now 40,000 pages and I don't want to make a serious mistake that would have an adverse impact on any major portion of our economy or some components of our society. The other one is the comprehensive government reorganization. Now that can be implemented piecemeal. For example, I could change by Executive order any item in the government organizational structure of the Executive Branch of government in a comprehensive way this. If we pass, say a comprehensive bill that relates to welfare reform, then the multitude of individual little agencies that have been established to administer the different welfare programs might be consolidated in that legislation. Another thing is this. I hope to have very early authorization from the Congress, possibly even before I become President, to reorganize the structure of the Executive Branch of government in a comprehensive way subject only to subsequent veto by the Congress. This is similar to legislation that has been on the books in the past. It has recently been terminated because it expired and this is something that I hope to achieve. So, Fil move as expeditiously as I can.\n"", ""In the State of Georgia I did our reorganization effort this way and it was successful, in my opinion. It took us about a year to have the comprehensive reform, but we started piecemeal reform long before that by the arbitrary elimination and consolidation of agencies under my control. And, as you possibly know, the reason we waited a full year in Georgia is that the legislature only meets once a year beginning in January for 45 days, so I had to wait until the legislature convened. In the Congress it would be done much more incrementally. But I'll have to have in my own mind a picture to present to the American people of what the comprehensive organizational structure will be before I think I can be successful.\n"", 'Q. Governor, the Republicans are trying, or are beginning to try to paint you as a big spender, saying that your programs such as those you described today would cost $200 billion or more. How do you respond to that?\n', ""Governor Carter. It's not true. We have people behind me here who, I would say, in general, might be liberal, moderate, conservative, would take a very aggressive attitude toward providing better services for our people. That's their life's work and they have special knowledge in these fields. But I think there was a general agreement today that we can meet the commitments that I have made to the American people. And there was general agreement that under normal economic circumstances, which I think I can anticipate, we can also meet the parameters that I have described to you earlier. That is we can provide these services while maintaining roughly the same percentage of the GNP being expended by the federal government, and with the prospect of a balanced budget by the end of my term in 1981 fiscal year budget.\n"", ""Q. This is the first briefing we've had an opportunity to get anything from the people who participated. I wonder, Mr. Riles, whether you or someone else speaking for your group can tell us a little about your impressions of Governor Carter.\n"", 'Mr. Riles. The Governor, of course, invited us down here to discuss specific issues that he had interest in, and, of course, that we had some expertise in. Mine, of course, being education. I can say that he listened very carefully throughout the discussion of several hours, asked questions, asked for clarification, encouraged debate, differences, and even on some said that they were the kinds of things he would like to implement. It was a very worthwhile session as far as I am concerned and I got the impression that the Governor is sincere in his effort to understand the problems from our viewpoint, and that he will make up his own mind in due time.\n', 'Q. Mr. Riles, what recommendations has the group made to the Governor on the role of the federal government in education and any changes that should be in that role?\n', ""Mr. Riles. Dr. Friday and Dr. Halperin spoke on that principally. I spoke on elementary and secondary education. I think both of us emphasized that the role of the federal government needs to be clarified, that it has grown up in a slipshod way. There are a multiplicity of categorical programs that needs to be looked at, goals set, and then we need to proceed to deal with them. The whole issue of state versus federal commitments in this area need to be clarified. And it's in that way we discussed the problem. We laid out some of the concerns but we think we ought to leave it up to the Governor to determine what that role should be.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Let me introduce to you a few other people, and I hesitate to get involved in this because I don't want anybody to be left out. The person on my left is Robert Ball, he is a former Commissioner of the Social Security Administration and now senior scholar in the National Academy of Sciences. Bob, you might want to just make a brief remark. He is, I would say, one of the foremost experts in this country on Social Security for the past, present, and future and how it relates with other social programs.\n"", ""Robert Ball. The discussion this afternoon was really very impressive to me. I've known the Governor briefly in earlier times, but today his sharp questioning and his ability to get facts and ideas put of us was, I thought, really very remarkable. In my own special field of Social Security, the Governor has taken the position of making a high priority of the restoration of financial integrity to that system which is so important to all the people in the country.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would like to introduce now, Marion Wright. Marion, would you step up here. She is the director of the Children's Defense Fund and is a very strong spokesman for the needs of children in the family as it relates to social programs, educational programs, transportation, housing programs, and almost any aspect of life. She is one of those who will be helping me as we tie together all decisions made in the future with the family itself and how the government programs can be sensitive to strengthening and not weakening the family.\n"", ""Marion Wright. I think it was a good meeting. I am very pleased that somebody has invited us to talk on behalf of families and children and that we now have a voice that is going to be an advocate for families and children who are, in fact, our children—tomorrow's Americans. I think he is sensitive. I think he is committed. And from the conversation today I think that the kinds of themes that he struck in New Hampshire will continue. So, we are delighted to have his attention on this issue.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Ruth, come over here. Ruth Hanft is an expert on the health care system and this will be one of the major problems in the future. She is also now a professor at Dartmouth College and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the Institute of Medicine. Ruth, the rest of you don't say anything good about me, just say a word about your own program.\n"", 'Ruth Hanft. We discussed briefly the problems of the class of medical care and some of the methods being used in some of the states to control the costs. We talked about different ways of phasing in a national health program. The role of different parties—the federal government, private insurance—and we plan to do a lot more work on issues papers and concepts for the Governor.']"
51,Jimmy Carter ,"August 17, 1976","['Governor Carter. I believe that everyone who looked at the list of those who came to advise me this afternoon would be impressed with the diversity of background, experience, and interests that comprise this group. There is a remarkable degree of unanimity among them on some of the basic principles. One is the extreme importance of conservation.\n', ""We had a temporary dip in the consumption of energy in this country in 1973 and 1974 and it's now picking up. We've arrived at our pre-embargo level of consumption in spite of the fact that in fall of 1973, President Nixon said that we were importing 25 percent of our oil. We are now approaching the 50 percent level. And we're getting into a very vulnerable position as far as our nation's security is concerned in overdependence on foreign supplies of oil. I think it is also a general agreement that we can never avoid completely imported oil. As long as oil exists in the world, we are probably going to have to have a policy of importing a substantial portion of it.\n"", ""Leaving the vulnerability factor—one that we can accommodate if there is a temporary embargo—I think we also have agreed that if we can stabilize or reduce the present worldwide consumption of oil—and the United States can contribute a major factor to that—then the OPEC nations' influence will decrease over a period of time. If the worldwide consumption of oil increases substantially, their influence will increase.\n"", ""We also have had quite a long discussion today on the trends in consumption of overall energy. Our present consumption in the country is roughly 70 quads—which I think is 1 and 15 zeros—10 to the 15th power BTU's. According to studies that have been done by the scientific community—and I think this is a very conservative figure—by the end of this century, the year 2000, that will increase to 100 quads. Other estimates have placed it much higher than that. This is a 2 percent or less annual growth rate, compounded. Right now the rate of growth is perhaps more than that but with decreasing estimates of population increases in our country, with an estimated population by the year 2000 of about 250 million, then that relatively low and slow rate of increased energy usage is a possibility even without external constraints like mandatory conservation measures.\n"", ""Another point that was made was that our country does now utilize a great deal of energy per person. We consume about 64 barrels per person per year, or its equivalent, whereas in the Scandinavian countries or West Germany, it's about half that much. And in Canada, next to us, it's considerably less than that. So we do have a long way to go as far as having more efficient use of energy.\n"", ""Another point that I think was agreed to was this. That anything that's done to deregulate the price of energy, and I believe that everybody agrees that over a period of time energy prices are going to go up substantially, that it ought to be done in a carefully phased and predictable way. That the greatest adverse impact on our economy and on peoples' individual lives comes with the shocks of abrupt, unanticipated energy price increases. To the extent that we can do this in a carefully planned, predictable, and phased fashion, those inevitable price increases can be accommodated best in our economy.\n"", 'I think there was also a general agreement that we now have no comprehensive, long-range, understandable energy policy. And this absence of a policy hurts all of us. It makes whatever inevitable problems arise be greatly exaggerated in their adverse impact on our lives.\n', ""Another point that was made was the comparison between present use of major forms of energy and available reserve supplies. These figures are quite interesting to me: 16 percent of our energy now comes from coal. 90 percent of our energy reserves are from coal. So we're underutilizing coal compared to its reserves. Oil—we get 40 percent of our energy now from oil; oil comprises only 3 percent of our reserves. Thirty percent of our energy now comes from natural gas; only 4 percent of our reserve supplies are natural gas. So another inevitability, in addition to conservation, is a shift over a period of time to coal.\n"", ""We had quite a discussion about the relative advisability of continuing to emphasize the use of coal from the Appalachian region or continuing the present apparent Nixon-Ford government policies to shift strongly toward increased use of coal in the far West. We had a very long discussion about how the sulphur—SO—content as a component of the use of coal from the different regions of our country, and it was pointed out that the sulphur content in the coal on the eastern seaboard now is too high. Only about 10 percent of the present eastern coal—that's east of the Mississippi—can comply with present air pollution standards. That's with known technology. But that obviously can and probably will be improved. It's also a factor that's very important that the present concentration of labor and investment is in the Appalachian region primarily, and the move toward the West will create some disruption in labor opportunities and will require the shift of the coal mining profession to the West.\n"", 'Another factor that was raised by Dr. Weinberg, a scientist here, was that after we use 20 percent of our total fossil fuel supplies, the percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would double. And this would create very severe environmental questions. Possibly, problems that could not be accepted by human beings. So in addition to the depletion of our energy supplies, you also have an inevitable buildup in pollution problems with the higher concentration of carbon dioxide.\n', ""Another frequently expressed concern is that we now have 10 or 12 different major agencies in the federal government which are directly responsible for energy policy. And it's almost impossible for a consumer or a state or an environmentalist or even an oil company or a coal company to go anywhere in the federal government and get a definitive answer from any one of those entities in the federal government.\n"", 'I think the general advice to me as a possible President was that I would have a great opportunity to help derive a comprehensive energy policy in the absence of a crisis. We can consider this in a careful methodical way now, and for the first time perhaps, open up the decision making process to involvement by the states in addition to the federal government. And by consumers and environmentalists in addition to the oil companies. And this broad-ranging involvement in the establishment of a national policy, absent a crisis pressure, is a great opportunity for me or for the next President.\n', 'Another question that was discussed, and I think this is very interesting, is that we now in some oil wells leave 60 percent of the oil in the ground. And once that point is reached with 35 or 40 or 50 percent extraction, the environmental consequences have already been felt. So we have a good opportunity there with the new extraction techniques which might be more costly, to get a substantial amount of additional oil and natural gas from the ground without the concurrent environmental degradations of our quality of life.\n', 'Governor Boren of Oklahoma suggested as one of the alternatives perhaps to vertical divestiture, what he calls vertical accountability. So that the oil companies for instance, would be required to file income tax returns for the different levels of oil exploration, extraction, refining, distribution, wholesale and retail sales. So that there could be an analysis made to further insure that there is competition within the oil industry.\n', ""Just a couple of other points. One experimental program that's been described and is quite interesting is, I think, in Seattle, Washington, where the bank, or at least one of the banks there, gives reduced interest rate on loans to purchase a home or to build a new home if that home meets rigid insulation standards. It gives also reduced interest rates on loans to buy an automobile if that automobile will get greater than 25 miles per gallon efficiency. So through the financing structure, which can be extrapolated as you can well and quickly see toward even government guaranteed loans, there can be built in an economic incentive to comply with stricter conservation measures. This is in some ways voluntary and not mandatory, as you can understand.\n"", 'Dr. Weinberg pointed out several times that we need to coordinate in the governmental structure our energy policy with research and development allocations. Quite often these two decision themes work at cross purposes, and we have research and development allocations made which are completely incompatible with an overall energy policy for our country. He also points out that we ought to keep all energy options open and not completely wipe out as a possibility in the future any particular kind of energy until we know much more certainly what a long-range policy would include and which would involve world supplies, the rate of exploration and discovery, the rate of depletion of our present supplies, price pressures over which we have no control. We ought not to close out any particular aspect of energy policy. What he was referring to specifically is not to have a nationwide moratorium, for instance, on the use of atomic power for the production of electricity until we can make sure that we have some alternative to it and I agree with this statement.\n', ""And we had Mr. Harris Arthur here who represents a Navaho tribe of Indians in New Mexico. I think he made a very vivid presentation to us about the human aspect of energy policy. Sometimes we only think about the price of gasoline or we think only about different governmental policies, but as a member of the Navaho tribe in New Mexico, they're facing a complete change in their style of living and perhaps even a termination of the existence of their tribal life as a consequence of insensitive government decisions.\n"", ""So these are some of the things that we discussed this afternoon, just hurriedly. There are a number of them, I didn't try to make the list complete. But I think you can see the kind of exploration of ideas that we covered in the short 4 hour period. The group will be preparing over die next few weeks to put all these factors in a more comprehensive form, four or five of them, and then this will be submitted back to these persons and also to others who are knowledgeable about the energy field, and I'll be deriving from this advice my own attitude as the next President so that I can help to shape, with a major role, a comprehensive and fair and predictable and sensitive energy policy for our country. We don't have an energy policy now that meets any of those criteria. I would like first of all to give the folks standing behind me an opportunity to correct any errors that I made. And don't be reticent about it because I don't want to inadvertently ...\n"", 'James Griffin. I think the level on imported oil has gone from 25 percent to right at 40 percent, instead of 50 percent.\n', ""Governor Carter. I think somebody said almost 50 percent—well, between 40 and 50 percent. I know that in the month of March it did reach 50 percent. So it's between 40 and 50 percent imported oil.\n"", 'Q. The other day, in West Virginia, you said, if I understood you correctly, that you felt coal production should be mainly maintained in Appalachia and that there should not be a major shift out West. Now here today, you seem to be raising that possibility of labor shifts and so forth.\n', ""Governor Carter. You can't freeze production exclusively in the Appalachian region. In my speech the other night I pointed out some figures that I think were confirmed to be accurate today. We now produce about 630 million tons of coal per year. About 110 million of that comes from West Virginia, coincidentally. There is a feasibility study by the American Society of Engineers that shows that by 1985 this can be roughly doubled. The needs following 1985 to the year 2000 call for another doubling. The technology to be used in doubling the production of coal and the environmental quality standards for sulphur dioxide reductions to make that coal possible to be burned, is a very serious question. If there is a choice to be made, my own attitude would be to strengthen the production of coal in the Appalachian regions. You've got some very serious problems in the West. One is that the source of coal is distant from the point at which the energy is consumed. Another one is that you would have to have a substantial shift of an entire industry across our country. Another one is the extreme shortage of water. As you know, with liquifaction and the gasification of coal you have a doubling or a tripling or a quadrupling of the price of either gasoline or liquid fuel or natural gas as compared to the present cost. And we also have the additional problem of the change in the kind of life that is lived in those areas. And m addition to that, of course, you have the policy of protecting the public lands, the Indian lands, grazing lands, farmlands, and natural areas that are in our parkland areas. So as a general proposition I would favor accentuating the production and the use of coal in the Appalachian region.\n"", 'Q. Could you tell us in more detail how vertical responsibility or accountability will lead to greater competition and what if anything was discussed about horizontal divestiture?\n', ""Governor Carter. The position that I've maintained is that I'm not in favor of divestiture of the oil companies in a complete vertical way as long as I'm convinced there's an adequate degree of competition. And that's a very important caveat\n"", ""My own concern has been more in horizontal investment—the oil companies investing in coal and uranium and geothermal—than it has been in the vertical integration. This was a proposal that Governor Boren made and I'll let him answer the question after I briefly respond. One of the allegations that has been the basis of the divestiture proposal is that the oil companies controlling the process all the way from exploration, to extraction, to transporting to the refinery, refinery refining, distributing through the oil pipelines, and wholesale and retail sales, it permits the oil companies to eliminate competition by making a heavy profit at the crude oil level and taking an actual loss at the retail level to freeze out competition. But if you require the oil companies—this is a proposal I never heard about until today, by the way—but if you require the oil companies to reveal their profit in segments so that you could see how much profit they made at the crude oil level, how much in the refining, how much in the piping, how much at the wholesale and retail level, that would tend to maximize competition. I'd like to ask Governor Boren to develop this further since this is his idea.\n"", ""Governor Boren. Governor, I think you've explained it very, very well. I think that what the people of the country want to be assured of is that if they're being asked to make personal sacrifices in terms of higher energy costs in general that they're not bearing this burden alone. That no one's making excessive profits from it. And I think that we've been in a sense putting the cart before the horse in talking about divestiture. When at the present time the oil companies, the large companies, that are in all of these levels, file comprehensive tax returns which don't break down their profits by area. I think if we have accountability at each level—in other words, what profits are they making in production, in marketing, in transportation, and so on— this will give the people of the country much more information than they've had in the past. This of course will be public record so the people would know themselves what levels of profits are being made. If abuses were found at any level then within the system, the antitrust laws could be applied to that particular level effectively. So I think it's really a matter of public accountability is what we're talking about.\n"", ""Q. Governor, do you endorse this idea? Or is it just an idea you're considering?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I think it has interesting possibilities. I would like to go into it further before I make an unequivocal endorsement, but I think it\'s a good one to pursue. I might say that this is a question that came up at the ""Public Citizen Forum"" the other day, not relating to the oil industry, but say relating to General Motors. There is no requirement now that stockholders in General Motors, for instance, be acquainted with the profits that are made from, say, the Frigidaire Division, which manufactures home appliances. And the public disclosure of corporate profits, as it would relate to an easier enforcement of antitrust laws, is a proposal that I favor as a general proposition. Specifically, I would rather look into it a little further, but I can say that it is an attractive thing to me and my inclination would be to support it.\n', 'Q. What about horizontal divestiture, Governor? What was your discussion on that?\n', ""Governor Carter. We didn't discuss that, this afternoon, very much. I think that there—in fact, I don't believe we discussed that at all this afternoon. I can't recall that coming up. But my own position is that horizontal divestiture, in my opinion, is a much more worthy subject of discussion than even vertical divestiture and I, unless I'm convinced that there is an adequate amount of competition there, I would look with favor on horizontal divestiture. By my own first preference would be to insure competition through other means. I have been concerned in recent years that there has been very little increase in the production of coal. Some of that perhaps is because of inadequate competition. But the other part of it is artificially low prices for natural gas and, for a number of years, artificially low prices of imported oil. And, of course, other governmental policies concerning air pollution standards which makes the burning of coal now much less attractive by some power producers. So it's a complicated thing, but if I'm convinced that there is adequate competition I would not favor divestiture. If I'm not convinced, and I'm going to be very strict about that, looking at it from the consumer viewpoint, then I would favor divestiture. Does anyone here feel that you ought to add something to what I've outlined? I've tried to keep notes and do the best I could, but if any of you have a comment that you'd like to make ...\n"", 'Shearon Harris. I could live with my utility colleagues if I just got on record as saying that I urged you to give nuclear equal footing with coal.\n', ""Jerry Decker. I'm Jerry Decker from Dow and I'd just like to make a strong plug for conservation in industry and also the use of coal in industry, getting back to the kind of percentages that we used to use in industry before 1950. I think we can also take care of all the environmental aspects of this from a standpoint of strip mining that you've just mentioned and the transportation and burning.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I might say this, I wish we had more time because Dow Chemical, for instance, which has been a company that suffered severely during the Vietnamese war for other reasons, they pointed out that in the last 5 years they have cut down, I believe 40 percent, their consumption of energy for the production of the same products. And one particular company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I believe he said, has a procedure worked out now so that an additional 30 percent savings in the consumption of energy for the same production might be realized. So there's a tremendous opportunity here for industry, for homeowners, for the transportation sector of our economy, all to conserve greatly in the consumption of energy. And I don't think anybody felt that it wouldn't be best for our whole economy if we could eliminate waste. Even though the sale of coal, the sale of oil, the sale of natural gas would go down every time you saved, everybody thought that in the long run, and the short range, there would be a strong benefit for the economy of our country if we could eliminate waste through strong conservation measures.\n"", ""I want to thank all of you again. I know you have to leave. And you've meant a lot to me already. I think we're going to get more out of you in the future.""]"
52,Jimmy Carter ,"August 18, 1976","[""Governor Carter. I might point out, just as a matter of interest, that when we start our sessions at 1 o'clock or whatever it is, we don't ever stop, we don't take a break or anything else, we just keep going. Everybody who comes generally agrees afterward that even the experts learn a lot from one another because it's a source of a major exchange of ideas. I think that all of them would agree that, as contrasted with congressional hearings, there's a tremendous amount of information exchanged in a short period of time in these unstructured discussions.\n"", ""At the conclusion of our roughly hour discussion, we went around the room and everybody suggested a major point on which there was general agreement. I'm not trying to speak for all these people here and I don't expect them to speak for me later on, but I'll go down these points. I know we have both foreign trade and economic journalists here who've come from major periodicals and we'd like to have your questions. If I can't answer them, which is the likely case, I'll refer them to someone in the back.\n"", 'The first point on which we agreed—and these are not in any particular order—is that there is a very close interrelationship between foreign trade, tariffs, the international monetary system, multinational corporation attitudes and investments, and our domestic and foreign policy. There is no way to separate these factors.\n', 'The second thing on which I think everybody agreed is that in the present government structure, most of these component parts are indeed separated from one another. The decision making process is not coordinated. As someone said, very accurately in my opinion, ""The federal government is in total disarray, as far as evolving and consummating a cohesive foreign or domestic economic policy.""\n', 'This responsibility is spread among multiple major agencies and at least eight departments, including, obviously, Treasury, Agriculture, Defense, State, and Commerce. This is almost an insurmountable obstacle to evolving a coherent, long-range, comprehensive policy within which our private sector, the Congress and the President and foreign nations can function most effectively.\n', ""Another point is that our nation's economic strength is substantially unshaken by recent international and domestic events. And this strength is recognized not only by leading economists and other analysts in our own nation, but also among foreign governments. The rest of the world still looks to the United States to provide leadership. In some instances, in recent years, that leadership has not been forthcoming. There are major negotiations going on now concerning the international monetary system, future modifications in trade, controls over foreign investments, and multinational corporations. These kinds of things must be addressed in the upcoming years, and the United States, because of its economic strength and influence, is going to be the major spokesman or shaper of these events.\n"", 'Another point that was made was that quite often in recent years the selection of leaders to head up major departments and serve in major diplomatic posts, and our preparations for international discussions on population, food, environmental quality, freedom of the seas, and so forth, have been completely inadequate. Quite often leaders or spokesmen have been selected not on the basis of merit or competence but on the basis of political payoff or some other consideration not associated with competence.\n', ""One tremendous recent development has been the increase in agricultural exports. And this has been a major factor in helping to compensate for increased prices of oil. We've had, I think, roughly a tripling of agricultural exports in the last 5 years, from roughly $7 billion to a little over $22 billion. There was also a general consensus that in the long-range future our nation and Canada—North America—plus Europe are likely, almost inevitably, going to be the suppliers or the producers of food. Almost the entire balance of the world is going to depend on us to make up their deficits in food production.\n"", 'This brings up a question about foreign aid. Now we have multiple, sometimes uncoordinated, programs related to foreign aid: our support for the World Bank and regional banks on the one hand; bilateral aid with specific nations on the other; technical assistance; capital investments; reduction of tariffs or quotas to help developing countries strengthen their own economies. These kinds of things are at the present time in a state of confusion. In many crucial areas, like our contribution to the World Bank or regional banks, and so forth, we are far behind in meeting the commitments we have made previously. We have violated our own agreements and are not providing the amount of contributions that are necessary to meet our own agreements. And we have fallen far behind almost every other developed nation in the world in the percentage of our gross national product allocated to foreign aid in a general sense.\n', 'Most of the other participants would, I believe, agree that instead of the continual piecemeal allocation of gifts or surpluses to countries, the best approach is to permit these countries to have capital formation investments and productivity as a first priority, and also we ought to provide some lessening of obstacles to trade, particularly with the less developed countries so that they can sell their products on the open market and have a chance to process their basic raw materials.\n', 'Another point that was made is that the President has a great responsibility in the future not only to be a spokesman for our country and to select qualified people to represent our nation in negotiations in economic and political and military matters relating to foreign countries, but has a great responsibility to educate, to be frank with, to involve the American people in the decision making process. Quite often we have a duality of national policy, one for foreign consumption and the other one for domestic political consumption. Frankness ought to prevail in the relationship between the President, the White House, the Executive Branch on the one hand and the Congress and the American people on the other, as well as our relationship with foreign countries.\n', 'Another point was that in the foreign aid field, the bilateral aid provisions—that is aid from us to one particular country—ought to be designed to reach people who actually need it, not to buy another Cadillac for tinhorn dictators. And in the past, this abuse has been one of the major factors in turning the American people against a natural inclination toward legitimate foreign aid.\n', 'I think an overall conclusion drawn is that to the extent that we can solve problems in the foreign economic field—increased trade, stronger relationships with other countries, less tariffs and quota obstacles, a stable and predictable economic policy, better international monetary stability—those solutions will contribute directly to solving our own domestic problems of inflation and unemployment, and vice versa. To the extent that we can make our own domestic economy strong and viable, it will contribute tremendously to the alleviation of foreign economic problems.\n', ""The initial long conversation that we had was on exchange rates. I think there's a general agreement that floating exchanges rates are a permanent fixture on the economic or foreign scene.\n"", ""And the last point I would like to make before we take questions is that I believe there is a unanimous agreement that I, if I'm the next President, should take a strong stand against international bribery, and against the yielding to boycotts against our own domestic corporations because they happen to have Jewish citizens or others in positions of executive leadership. And I myself find tertiary boycott to be morally obnoxious, and I believe that it would be a serious mistake for us to continue to condone, as our government presently does through quiescence or reticence, the concept of legitimate bribery.\n"", ""Those are a few of the points that we discussed during the 4 1/2-hour period, and now if you have specific questions to ask about these or other matters concerning international economics, I'll call on one of the teachers in the back to help with those points. Does anybody have a question?\n"", 'Q. In foreign aid, you made the point that we ought to give it to people who need it, not to what you called ""tinhorn dictators"" Can you give some examples?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't particularly want to spell out specific examples. Maybe somebody back here would want to volunteer to do that. But there was a general agreement that it has been quite often. We've not monitored in many instances the ultimate consumer or recipient of American aid. Congress, I think, has moved much more aggressively than has the present administration in trying to eliminate those abuses. But to call the name of a national leader who has channeled some of that money into the purchase of additional Cadillacs I think would be inappropriate for me to say.\n"", 'Q. Governor, did you discuss the issue of international commodity agreements? And if so, would you take a more sympathetic view toward them than the present administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, we did discuss that quite at length. I think that we would take a more sympathetic view. We did discuss the existing commodity agreements that relate to coffee, tin, and cocoa, and how those might be extended to other commodities. The general consensus was that although we don't participate directly in the cocoa agreement, it was a successful achievement and in some other areas, for instance I think copper was named, there might be an opportunity for additional commodity agreements. The idea, of course, would be that there would be some stability of pricing, except in extreme shortages of supply where the price is inevitably going to go up. That there would be a moderate investment in reserve stocks, there might be a purchase when the price was low, and then the stocks could be consumed or sold when shortages did occur in the supplying countries. That was one of the discussions. And I think I would be in favor of that general concept and the expansion of it.\n"", 'Q. Governor, on that question of floating exchange rates, did you get down to anything as specific as the suggestions that some people have made that Japan is now fluctuating the rate of the yen to our disadvantage and what we might do about it?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, that was discussed. And we discussed the problem and I specifically asked the question of what would be a legitimate way for us to deal with that problem, and the response was either through diplomatic means or I think there was a quick analysis made that the Japanese have already begun to correct that problem in that the value of the yen has increased 3 percent in recent weeks. The view was expressed that the Japanese have already become aware of the concern about the inclination to buy dollars, to sell yen, to lower the price of the yen, and this trend has already been somewhat reversed because of action by the Japanese government.\n', 'Q. Are you in favor of any more direct or any more specific international control or surveillance of these rates?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think that could best be done through multinational mutual agreements. Of course it can be done through quiet diplomatic channels. But not being the President now, I think it would be improper for me to say what else ought to be done. I think my voice as a nominee would be a significant factor in international understanding and I would be reluctant to go any further than that because of my own unofficial influence. I'm going to be cautious about that.\n"", ""Q. Did you get into any discussion of what the effects would be of these grain agreements we've had with the Soviet Union and their sad result on the American economy?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Indirectly, we didn't specifically discuss the excessive sale of American grain when we had a shortage ourselves. It was devastating, I think, in its inflationary impact on our country, combined with general shortages of commodities and the increase in the price of oil, which came simultaneously in 1973. But there was a discussion and I certainly agree with the fact that we should not use the withholding or the boycott of shipments of food overseas to try to effectuate some sort of international policy as it relates to other countries.\n"", ""Q. That doesn't exactly jibe with the AFL-CIO views.\n"", 'Governor Carter. I realize that.\n', 'Q. Did you discuss the tax benefits that multinational corporations enjoy and what changes ought to be made in the tax laws, if any?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, and my own position on that has been clearly spelled out in the press. I think that we ought not to continue the deferral of payment of multinational profits that are earned overseas. I personally believe that that does work to the disadvantage of employment in this country. But I think that there's a general recognition that the payment of taxes to foreign countries ought to be considered when we collect taxes from the same income. But we did not go into that this afternoon.\n"", 'Q. In connection with this briefing, and others that you’ve had, are you inviting people who you know are in accordance with your candidacy, or have you tried to invite people across the board, and are we to draw any conclusions at all as to whether some of these gentlemen might be in your administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. Most of the people that have met with us down here in Plains I've never known before. Some of them were helpful to me during the primary campaign, the vast majority of them were not. We have tried to invite participants in these discussions based on their own qualifications and their earned reputations in the subjects that they've discussed. We've also made a specific effort to get people to participate who have divergent responsibilities, background, experiences, and political philosophies. There is a fairly heated discussion that developed quite often in these meetings among those who do disagree. So it hasn't been based on who supported me in the past. Unfortunately, the superb judgment that many of the participants show in domestic and foreign affairs was not mirrored in their political judgment in the spring. But I think from these people who do participate I would certainly get advice from, when and if it comes time for me to choose leaders in these fields in government. When I put together a Cabinet and choose major advisers in domestic and foreign affairs, if I don't ask any of these people to serve specifically in government, I would certainly ask their advice on who might be the best qualified people to serve. But it would be improper, and I have never mentioned to a single person in this country any position in the administration, if I should be elected.\n"", 'Q. Do you make notes to yourself as to who might have impressed you and not impressed you? Does this affect any future judgments of yours?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, it certainly does. One of the most immediate responsibilities and perhaps one of the greatest responsibilities that I will have if I win in November is immediately to select people to help me run the government in January. And that would only follow my concept of what the organizational structure of the government ought to be over which I have control before we reorganize the complete government. The interrelationship between domestic and foreign economic policy making. The expansion or contraction or changes in the posture of the National Security Council. How the White House staff would relate to Cabinet members. These kinds of questions will have to be addressed by me even during the campaign itself. I am certainly forming opinions as I meet with these leaders about their compatibility with me personally, their compatibility with me on philosophical or political matters and attitudes, their ability to express themselves, and the submission of magazine articles or books that they've written. I very carefully read them and am therefore forming my own opinion about who would be best qualified.\n"", ""Q. Could I take that question one step further? Some of your opponents have from time to time suggested that you are deficient in various areas of expertise and therefore should not be President, Is it also your intention in these meetings to send out the impression, via a network that seems to be building by geometrical and mathematical jumps, that you are in fact qualified and that you know what you're talking about?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think that my opponents are accurate in saying that there is a great deal about the nation's government with which I am not familiar and where I need help and advice. And I would guess that statement would be accurate even when I complete my service as President. I'm trying as best I can to compensate for that inadequacy by gathering around me people who can supplement my own knowledge and experience. And I feel sure that the people of this country would better trust me to the extent that they believe that I will have good advice in areas where I'm not experienced myself. So, politically speaking, I think it's an advantage, but to my mind it's a mandatory requirement for me if I hope to lead this country. I need to have people to help me who participated in the Kennedy round, who negotiated ever since the Point Four Program, in agricultural interchanges with other countries, who are familiar with international economics and international monetary funds, and I think that's a legitimate part of governmental processes to admit one's own deficiencies or needs and to turn without constraint or hesitation to people who know more about a subject than I will know.\n"", ""Q. A two part question. First of all, why was Senator Mondale not included in these sessions this week? I know he's been out politicking.\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's why.\n"", 'Q. Second, do you plan on any more of these sessions before you start out on Labor Day?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think I've asked Stu to take 8 more hours for these sessions. We'll have at least two more sessions. Senator Mondale has staff members present. I talked to him yesterday about the progress that we were making. He has been gracious enough to fill a lot of invitations that I've had that I could not myself accept. And this has been a mutual decision that we've made. As you probably know, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, he has had a lot of opportunity to participate in public hearings on these matters too, and he has an advantage over me particularly in the one we had Monday on domestic problems—welfare, health, social security, veterans' affairs, and so forth. He and I together just have to decide how best to allot his time and my time. I think my time is best allocated here. I don't particularly want to be highly visible traveling in the nation on a full-time basis. I think I made three speeches last week and we'll be going to California this weekend and so forth, but it's not anything other than he and I have both agreed that his priorities would be higher to go somewhere else right now.\n"", 'Q. Why do you not want to be highly visible?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's not the overriding consideration. The main consideration is that I need to be here learning and putting together the campaign structure. For instance, one of the major responsibilities I have is to learn about proper relationships between me and the congressional leaders. And Congressman Ullman has been nice enough to come down here. I've asked him to spend the night with me tonight. So we will have had a chance to spend 8 or 10 hours discussing the mechanism by which we can improve the relationship between House leadership and the White House, and talking about the practical application of my own commitments in the field of health and welfare, tax reform, Social Security, and so forth. And I just believe that's a higher priority for me. On occasion, maybe two or three occasions every week, I will make appearances to raise money for the Democratic Party or to make a speech on a certain subject or perhaps to help Democratic candidates as was the case the other night in West Virginia. I think that's the proper balancing. There's no particular reason for me not to campaign full-time. I just have to assess the best use of my time.\n"", 'Q. Would you come back for a moment to that question of international bribery and boycotts? What might be the component parts of that?\n', ""Governor Carter. If I am elected President I would make it clear in my initial major speeches, State of the Union address or some other major speech or series of them that I am personally committed against bribery. I would call on the multinational corporations or others to voluntarily police themselves and point out that I would consider it a crime if any evidence of bribery was presented to me as President. And that I would proceed with the prosecution of those who are guilty. That would be a proper thing for me to do. I would also seek legislation to make it illegal for companies or for the national policy to include yielding to the tertiary boycotts against banks or corporations that happen to have Jewish citizens in positions of executive leadership. I know that some states have already done this, like New York State. I don't know of any deleterious consequences that the state has suffered. And I think that if I make my position clear as President, that would go a long way toward resolving those two problems which I consider to be a matter of principle.\n"", 'Q. Are you for full disclosure of companies who bribe officials overseas who seek bribes?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I am; I'm also in favor of punitive action to be pursued by those who voluntarily admit they have bribed or are bribing, and also the prosecution of any one who is convicted of bribery.\n"", 'Q. So if it came to the attention of the U.S. Government that x number of Cabinet officials in Japan, or Norway, or Pakistan, had received bribes from American corporations and there were reasonable indications that they had in fact accepted those bribes, you would be in favor of disclosing those names publicly?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would. That's correct. I would disclose that information to the government involved. I'd have to assess each case, but my inclination would be to make it public. I made a speech on this subject in San Francisco, I think at the largest gathering that I had during the primary campaign. I called for our own government to reveal completely the circumstances around the Lockheed bribery case. I think it would be better for the nation of Japan if that information were made public. I don't see any reason for the President to participate in concealing evidence of a crime. To me, it's just that simple. There may be some other complicating factors that I don't discern, but I could never bring myself to join in the concealing of a crime. Perhaps you have questions to ask of some of those behind me. I'd like to call on these people to correct any mistakes that I've made in my comments.\n"", ""We've got some very fine people here. I think if you'll look down the list of those who have attended you'll be as impressed as I was with the credentials of those who volunteered to come here and help me. I might say, not specifically relating to this afternoon, that we have had remarkable success in having our invitations to Plains accepted, and I want to express my personal thanks again to these people who have given up their valuable time to come down here and help to educate me. I'm not being presumptuous in assuming that I'm already elected. I've got a long, hard, tough campaign to pursue, but if I am elected President, and I intend to be, then I hope that I can be as well qualified as possible. And people like those standing behind me will deserve a great deal of credit to the extent that we can resolve the present problems that afflict our country, and we can reinvolve the American people in the consideration of these complicated but very important matters, and also help to resolve the difficulties. So I want to again express my thanks to them and say that they have responded very unselfishly to my request that they come down and help me prepare for possibly the biggest job in our country. Thank you very much.\n"", 'Q. [For Marina Whitman.] We have observed that you were in the recent Republican Administration, and I was wondering if you see any differences in attitude or approach?\n', ""Marina Whitman. Obviously, there are some disagreements between us about the nature of the conduct of policy in the international economic arena in the last 4 or 5 years. However, I think I can say quite seriously that this area of international economic policy is not an area of great partisan division. Obviously, there are feelings that this has been inadequate, this could be done better, and so forth, and as I say in some of these areas, of course, I would have some disagreement. But basically, I think this is an area where there's a very wide range of consensus on what the problems are, the basic approaches to tackling them, and the very great difficulties involved in tackling some of these problems, some of which have been plaguing us for a long, long time.""]"
53,Jimmy Carter ,"August 23, 1976","['During the past week, when the attention of the political world was focused on the events in Kansas City, I spent most of my time at my home in Plains, Georgia, reading, studying national issues, talking with friends and advisers, and trying to sort out my thoughts as I lode ahead to the Presidential campaign.\n', 'I want to share some of those thoughts with you today, and I want to say at the outset that my mood is one of confidence and optimism. Not simply optimism over my own immediate political prospects, but optimism about the future of this country.\n', 'I think, and I believe the American people agree, that this is one of our most important elections, that this is one of those elections, as in 1932 and 1960, when we have a chance to break with die past and make a fresh start in our national affairs.\n', 'Every election is unique, of course. In 1932 our nation faced an economic disaster, and our people correctly judged that Franklin Roosevelt was the candidate whose personal character and political courage made him best qualified to lead us through that crisis.\n', 'In 1960 we faced not an economic crisis but a state of spiritual malaise, a sense of national drift, and the people correctly judged that John Kennedy, with all his youth and vigor, could keep his promise to get the country moving again, as in fact he did.\n', 'Today, as we face the election of 1976, I think there is a feeling in the land, much like those of 1932 and 1960, that we face an economic crisis, and that we are drifting and need to get moving again. But there is something more than that. After all we have been through in recent years, we need to have our faith in our government restored. We want to believe once again that our national leaders are honorable and competent and deserving of our trust. For if we cannot believe that, little else matters.\n', ""I have thought for some time that this year's campaign was taking place on two distinct levels. At one level, and quite properly, there is policy, and the economy. In many hundreds of public forums I have discussed all these issues with our people for 20 months, and later this month I will make statements on defense and veterans' affairs, agriculture and economics. But today I would like to discuss with you the other level of this year's campaign, the less tangible issue, which is simply the desire of the American people to have faith again in our own government.\n"", 'We have been through too much in too short a time. Our national nightmare began with the assassination of John Kennedy; and went on to include the assassination of Robert Kennedy and of Martin Luther King, Jr., and die wounding of George Wallace. We watched the widespread opposition to the war in Vietnam, and the division and bitterness that was caused, and the violence in Chicago in 1968, and the invasion of Cambodia, and the shootings at Kent State, and revelations of official lying and spying and bugging, the resignations in disgrace of both a [President and Vice President, and the] disclosure that our top security and law enforcement agencies were deliberately and routinely violating the law.\n', 'No other generation in American history has ever been subjected to such a battering as this. Small wonder, then, that the politics of 1976 have turned out to be significantly different from years past. I doubt that four years ago or eight years ago a former Southern governor with no national reputation and no Washington experience would have been able to win the Democratic nomination for President But this year many voters were looking for new leaders, leaders who were not associated with the mistakes of the past\n', ""This is suggested not only by my own campaign, but by the success that Governor Jerry Brown achieved in several of the Democratic primaries. For, however else we may differ, Governors Brown and Reagan and I have in common the fact that we are all outsiders as far as Washington is concerned, and committed to major changes in our nation's government if elected President\n"", 'To want a change, to want a fresh start, to want government that is honest and competent again, is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, all share those fundamental concerns.\n', 'In the last analysis, good government is not a matter of being liberal or conservative. Good government is the art of doing what is right, and that is far more difficult. To be liberal or conservative requires only ideology; to do what is right requires sensitivity and wisdom.\n', 'I think that most Americans are not very ideological. Most Americans share a deep seated desire for two goals that might, to an ideological person, seem contradictory. We want both progress and preservation.\n', 'We want progress because progress is the very essence of our American dream—the belief that each generation, through hard work, can give a better life to its children. And increasingly in this century we have realized that it is a proper function of government to help make that dream come true.\n', 'But we do not want reckless change. We want to preserve what is best in our past—our political traditions, our cultural heritage, our physical resources—as guideposts to our future.\n', 'To walk the line between progress and preservation, between too much change and too little, is no easy task. It cannot be achieved by the extremists of either side, by those who scorn the past or those, who fear the future. It can only be accomplished by leaders who are independent and imaginative and flexible in their thinking, and are guided not by closed minds but by common sense.\n', 'That is the kind of leadership the American people are looking for this year, and that is the kind of leadership that, if elected, I intend to provide.\n', ""As I have observed the political world in recent years, it has seemed to me that there is a process at work, in both political parties and probably in all nations, by which over a period of time the political leadership becomes isolated from, and different from, the people they are supposed to serve. '\n"", 'It seems almost inevitable that if political leaders stay in power too long, and ride in limousines too long, and eat expensive meals in private clubs too long, they are going to become cut off from the lives and concerns of ordinary Americans. It is almost like a law of nature—as Lord Acton said, power tends to corrupt.\n', 'I think this process reached a peak a few years ago, when we had a President who surrounded himself with people who knew everything in the world about merchandising and manipulation and winning elections, and nothing at all about the hopes and fears and dreams of average people.\n', 'When government becomes cut off from its people, when its leaders are talking only to themselves instead of addressing reality, then it is time for a process of national self-renewal, time to look outside the existing governing class for new leaders with new ideas. I think that is what happened in the Democratic Party this year. I think our party was ready for renewal, for new faces, for a changing of the guard. If the candidate had not been myself, I think we would have chosen someone else who was not part of the old order of things.\n', 'My sense is that millions of Americans feel that this is the year in which they will give the system one last chance. They do not want to be disillusioned again. They are going to study the candidates, examine our political records and our personal ability and character, and make a judgment as to which candidate can best restore competence and vision and honesty to our government.\n', 'I welcome their scrutiny, and have confidence in their judgment.\n', 'Obviously there are some outstanding political leaders in Washington— one of the most outstanding, Senator Mondale, is my running mate—and yet I think our people are correct in seeking leadership from outside Washington, new leadership which can approach the Executive Branch of government with fresh eyes and an open mind.\n', 'As a governor, I have been on the receiving end of our federal programs. Members of Congress may see the new programs on the drawing board, or hear about their theories, but governors and local and state officials deal with the realities. I have wrestled with the necessary regulations, and the paperwork and red tape and the overlapping jurisdictions. I know what it is to try to start a state drug-treatment program and have to negotiate with almost a dozen different federal agencies that have separate legal responsibility for the drug problem.\n', 'Let me say that, on the basis of my experience, I have never been more serious or more determined in my life than when I promise to carry out a complete reorganization of the Executive Branch of government.\n', ""Let me say also, in case there is any question in anyone's mind, that I am not anti-government. I am anti-waste in government. I don't believe in giveaway programs. I don't believe in wasting money. I do believe in tough, competent management, and I have tried to practice it as a naval officer, as a farmer, as a businessmen, and as a governor. I also believe in delivering services to those people who need those services in an efficient, economical, and sensitive way. That is not liberal or conservative. It's just good government, and that's what the American people want, and what I intend to provide.\n"", 'I think the basic issue in this campaign is going to be whether we want government that looks confidently to the future, or government that clings fearfully to the past.\n', 'There\'s a song in the musical ""Oklahoma"" called ""Everything\'s Up to Date in Kansas City"". But I didn\'t think everything was up to date in Kansas City last week. We kept hearing the same old tired rhetoric about socialism and reckless spending that we\'ve been hearing every four years since the Roosevelt years. I don\'t think the American people are much impressed by that kind of rhetoric. The American people don\'t believe that Social Security and Medicare were reckless spending, or that TV A and the minimum wage were socialism. The American people consider the source of those charges, and look at the record, and aren\'t deceived by the nay-sayers.\n', ""One of the real issues in this campaign is going to be President Ford's record of vetoes. It is a record that I cite more in sorrow than in anger, for it is a record of political insensitivity, of missed opportunities, of constant conflict with the Congress, and of national neglect.\n"", ""In six years as President, Mr. Ford's predecessor vetoed 41 bills that had been passed by Congress. In only two years, Ford has already vetoed 53 bills, about four times as many bills per year as his predecessor—and to be four times as negative as Mr. Ford's predecessor is a remarkable achievement.\n"", 'What did these vetoes accomplish? Did they save us from wasteful, reckless spending, as the administration would like us to believe. I think not.\n', ""One of the bills President Ford vetoed was the Emergency Employment Act, which would have created nearly two million full and part-time jobs, to help those millions of Americans who have been rendered jobless by Republican economic policies. I think our government has a responsibility to help those people get back to work. When people can't find jobs, we pay the price over and over in increased costs of welfare and unemployment compensation and lost tax revenues.\n"", 'Congress also passed a bill that would have granted those unemployed homeowners temporary help in meeting their mortgage payments. I think that was a responsible action for Congress to take. But Mr. Ford vetoed the bill.\n', 'When people are out of work, they and their children still have to eat, and Congress passed the School Lunch Act, to increase the number of families whose children were eligible for school lunch subsidies. But Mr. Ford vetoed that bill.\n', 'I had occasion, very close to home, to see what that kind of veto could mean to the real people who were on the receiving end of it. I know a young teacher who taught a remedial class for first-graders in the Plains Elementary School. Most of the students in this special class happened to be black, and were having a hard time getting started in school because of the devastating poverty in which they had been raised.\n', 'Free milk was provided twice a day, in the morning and at lunch, for needy students, but then there was a cutback and the morning milk was eliminated. So the young teacher began using her own money to see that all her students had milk. And when she ran out of money she went to her father, and he saw to it that her students had milk every morning.\n', 'That is the sort of thing that happens when our leaders ignore the human factor in government, when they think in terms of statistics and economic theories instead of in terms of real human needs.\n', ""These leaders are so short-sighted. Doesn't it make more sense to spend money on milk and education today, to help children get a fair start in life, than to spend money on police and courts and jails ten years from now, when those children have grown up untrained for a productive life and turned against a society that treated their needs with indifference?\n"", 'It has been my experience in government that the most profitable investment is in people, and that is the rule I will follow if I become your President.\n', ""There were many other vetoes. Mr. Ford vetoed a bill to provide loans and grants to train nurses. He vetoed a bill to send more doctors to rural areas and inner-city slums where there are far too few doctors. He vetoed a bill to provide job training and coPege educations for Vietnam veterans, the most unappreciated heroes in our nation's history.\n"", ""These vetoes haven't helped our economy. They haven't balanced the budget—far from it. They have only contributed to needless human suffering.\n"", 'An occasional veto may be justified, if legislation is poorly drafted or ill-considered, but 53 vetoes in two years demonstrates a negativism, a dormancy, and a fear of action that can only be harmful to this country. There is something seriously wrong when the Members of Congress, all of whom were elected by the people, repeatedly pass legislation the country needs, only to have it vetoed by an appointed President. I believe those men and women, in Congress are a great deal closer to the national mood than Mr. Ford has shown himself to be.\n', 'We have had enough of government by veto. It is time we had a President who will lead our nation, and who will work in harmony with Congress for a change, with mutual respect for a change, out in the open for a change, so the working families of this country can be represented as well as the rich and the powerful and the special interest groups.\n', ""Another major issue this fall is going to be the state of our nation's economy. Republicans have a long tradition of mishandling the economy, one that goes back to Herbert Hoover. Except in election years, when they sometimes manage to make the economy pick up by temporarily adopting Democratic economic programs.\n"", 'During the Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford Administrations, we had five recessions. Under Kennedy and Johnson we had none. And we all know that recessions are hardest on those people who are weakest, who are poor and uneducated and isolated, who are confused and inarticulate, who are often unemployed and chronically dependent—in short, those members of society whom a good government would be trying hardest to help.\n', 'Do you know what the basic Republican anti-inflation policy has been? To put people out of work. Cooling down the economy, they call it, because that sounds nicer. I say to you that any economic policy that sees virtue in unemployment is morally and politically and intellectually bankrupt.\n', ""What's more, those policies have been dismal failures. In 1968, the last year of a Democratic Administration, the unemployment rate was 3.6 percent. Today it's more than twice that—about 7.8 percent and rising. Under Kennedy and Johnson, the average annual rate of inflation was 2 percent. During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, it has been almost 7 percent.\n"", 'With all this human suffering, has the Republican Administration balanced the budget? In the last three years, the accumulated deficits are about $160 billion, more than the previous 30 years combined. Under Kennedy and Johnson, the average deficit was less than $4 billion. Under Nixon and Ford, the average deficit has been more than $24 billion a year.\n', 'In short, the Republican economic policies have not worked, and I believe they have failed to work because they were the creations of people who put economic theories and special interests ahead of the realities of human need in this country.\n', 'There are many other problems and many other issues in this campaign. I have been speaking about the breakdown of the American family, and I mentioned that among young people the second most prevalent cause of death is suicide and that in the past ten yean the gonorrhea rate has tripled among children 14 yean of age or younger.\n', ""I sensed that some people thought I shouldn't use those words, suicide and gonorrhea, because they are ugly words describing unpleasant facts. But there are many unpleasant problems in our society—children who need food, overcrowded jails and mental institutions, inadequate treatment for the young men who were maimed in Vietnam, the heartbreak and family disintegration that unemployment can bring.\n"", 'All these are ugly problems and it is a natural human instinct for us to want to tune them out But we cannot tune them out. We can only succeed in tuning out our own humanity, including those qualities of compassion and concern without which no society, however rich or powerful, can be truly great.\n', '""No man is an island,"" John Donne wrote many years ago; we are all part of the mainland of humanity. That is still true today, and as American citizens, most of us blessed with a good education and influence in society, we cannot ignore the needs and suffering of our less fortunate fellow citizens—not if we want this nation to remain great.\n', '""Ask not for whom the bell tolls,"" Donne went on to say, ""It tolls for thee.""\n', 'I think there is a bell tolling for all of us this year.\n', 'It is asking us what kind of America we want.\n', 'It is asking whether once again an American President can inspire patriotism and pride in all of our people.\n', 'It is asking if we can tear down the walls that have divided different races and different religions and different regions in America, and once more be a united nation.\n', 'It is asking if we are indeed a tired, worn out, cynical nation, or if we can once more be moved by optimism and hope and love for our fellow human beings.\n', 'It is asking if through our democratic system we can once again give this nation a government as competent and as good as our people.\n', 'I believe we can. We have lived through a time of torment, and now we are ready for a time of healing. I believe we are ready for new leadership, leaders who come from the people and who speak to the people and who care about the people, I believe we have reached a turning point in our national history, a time of cleansing and rededication, and I promise you I will do all in my power to bring this nation back to the greatness we deserve and that the world expects of us.']"
54,Jimmy Carter ,"August 23, 1976","['Salinger. It has been often said and written that if you become President, your foreign policy will not differ from the policies of Nixon and Ford, because American diplomacy has no other choices. What do you think of it?', 'Carter. To my knowledge, Henry Kissinger is the only one who would have said this. However, I think that many things could be different. In allowing the American people and the Congress to participate in our decision making in the field of foreign policy, we will have much more freedom of action, and we will have a stronger support for our stand.', 'In the past, the decisions have been often made in the dark without consulting or informing the people. Thus, when Kissinger, Nixon or Ford spoke, their statements appeared shallow.', 'In any case, I would emphasize much more the stable and trusting relations with our friends and natural allies: Europe, Japan and the countries of our hemisphere. If we have to make important changes in our policy—and they are unavoidable in a rapidly changing world—I will take care to better inform our friends and to consult with them more intimately. I will do my best to respect the desire of the Europeans to speak in a united way without forcing them to take a stance individually.', 'I think I will be more decisive in my negotiations with the U.S.S.R., through promoting the exchange of ideas and individuals, trade relations, and a common approach to world problems: peace in the Near East; the reduction of armaments and of nuclear danger and removing the menace that North Korea presents to South Korea.', 'Finally, with regard to the developing countries, I will be more inclined, without any doubt, to deal with them on an individual basis, with more firmness and clarity, namely by sending to them very experienced diplomats.', 'These are the changes that I intend to introduce into the Ford and Nixon foreign policies.', 'Q. Many Europeans have the feeling that the United States experiences a wave of isolationism and protectionism. During your crisscrossing of the country did you get the same impression?', 'Carter. No. The problem is more complicated than this. The majority of people in Georgia, for instance, and even in more isolated states like Iowa and Kansas, are perfectly aware that their personal life is affected by nearly every decision made by the international institutions. The freedom of the seas, the Monetary Fund, the environment, the food reserves, the production of nuclear arms and many other problems are of great interest to the public.', 'Our withdrawal from the institutions that make decisions in these areas would have a harmful effect. On the other hand, the American people are profoundly distrustful of any military involvement in the domestic affairs of other countries, like what we did, with disastrous consequences, in Cambodia and Vietnam and like what we nearly did in Angola.', ""In order to find an equilibrium between these two tendencies, I think we must analyze each case separately on its merits. But I would never get militarily involved in the domestic affairs of other countries, unless our own security is directly threatened. I will play, on the contrary, a very active role within the United Nations, in the Atlantic Alliance and in all the existent agencies. I don't think that this is an isolationism. To my understanding, isolationism would not be accepted by the American people."", 'Q. With regard to Angola, many Europeans felt that in refusing to support the decision of Kissinger to help that country, the Congress has created a vacuum from which the Soviet Union has profited.', ""Carter. No. I think that from the point of view of circumstances, the Congress could not act differently. There was no more vacuum in Angola. The Russians and the Cubans have preceded us. We did not sufficiently prepare the country for the departure of the Portuguese. When President Ford's and Kissinger's support policy to Angola was made public—by inadvertence it seems to me—it caused an unfavorable reaction, because the situation had deteriorated considerably, without the Congress or the country being informed of anything at all."", 'Our policy toward Angola was not thought out, nor logical, nor consistent It had no perspective in the long run, and was not conceived to be beneficial to the Angolan people themselves. It was simply a reaction to a failure and a belated one; the Russians and the Cubans were already on the spot', 'Q. What should the US, policy be toward Rhodesia and South Africa?', 'Carter. You ask me to answer a question which until now nobody was able to answer.', 'Our country, of course, is irrevocably committed to the principle of the majority rule whether it applies to the blacks or the whites. But I must take into account another of our principles which is to assure progress through peaceful means. As regards any direct action, I will rely on countries that have direct responsibility in these matters. For example, on Great Britain in case of Rhodesia. I will not try to replace it.', 'I will try, within the limits of our own efforts of persuasion, to win over the world of business to our point of view. I will define a policy which would be as compatible with the policies of the African regional organization as possible, and I will attempt to use the good offices of such and such country. The countries of South Africa have a legitimate right to express their opinion about trade or diplomatic relations, about the problem of transportation as the things begin to change in South Africa. I think that the first sensible changes will take place in Rhodesia, and I believe that the majority rule is inevitable there.', 'Q, Let us turn to Europe now, A kind of ambiguity has characterized the American policy toward united Europe. What would your stand he toward a politically united Europe?', ""Carter. Of course, this is a decision that concerns the Europeans themselves. I do not have any intention to influence them in that sense. Personally, I am in favor of closer economic and political ties between the European countries. And I am ready—in case the European leaders would ask me—to encourage publicly, by word of mouth, or through economic aid to promote closer cooperation in Europe. This could be one of those changes that we spoke about in the beginning of this interview. I don't see any advantage to forcing the European countries to deal with us on an individual basis in the field of international monetary matters or trade competition."", 'If they choose to speak unanimously, we have to accept them.', 'Briefly, I have nothing against the Europeans making their own decisions and, if they ask me, I will help them as much as possible to achieve this. In principle I think that the United States would gain from a more united Europe.', 'Q. To many protagonists of European unity, this unity can come about only by escaping from the US. domination, or at least by trying to be more independent of the United States. To what degree is U.S. policy compatible with these aspirations?', 'Carter. First of all, there exists such a community of ideals and interests that a complete independence is impossible. We depend on each other for the defense of peace and for maintaining of our security as well as on trade relations. We have common historical ties and similar ways of life. For this reason, I have no fear that the United States or the European nations could really desire a complete independence. I have no desire whatsoever to dominate any European nation or Europe as a whole either in the economic or political sphere.', 'I think that a strong, prosperous and dynamic Europe is an asset to the United States and that there are many areas where the cooperation can be closer; as for example, in dealing with industrial and tariff problems, or in examining with the countries of the Southern Hemisphere the establishment of grain reserves, in better exploiting the resources of the oceans, or coping with the demographic explosion, and in order to reduce arms sales all over the world, that originate mostly in the United States, France and some other countries. These are some of the points that we have to deal with jointly. I think this is an urgent necessity.', 'As regards NATO, I would like to maintain its strength not only through modernization of its armaments but also by a more efficient effort of standardization, followed by a redeployment of the defense forces. This should be accompanied by a constant care to examine relations with those outside of the alliance, with the will not to fall asleep. These relations must be maintained, and they can be maintained without any intention of domination by the United States or without a desire of independence toward this potential domination. The common interest is for me the most essential thing.', 'Q. What should the US. position be toward the participation of the Communists in the governments of Western Europe, especially in Italy and France?', 'Carter. I regret the advance of communism, but I believe that in most cases this is due to the weakness or ineptness of the democratic forces to govern appropriately. In certain cases, corruption was the success factor for the Communist Party, in some others, incompetence or incapacity to maintain close ties between the rulers and the ruled. I think that the best way to avoid the danger of a Communist takeover is to maintain a well-functioning democratic regime.', 'I do not believe that it is appropriate to intervene directly and overtly in the elections. By threatening the citizens of another country to vote in this or that way by economic, political, or military reprisals, we risk producing effects contrary to what we expected. I hope that the countries of the European community will succeed in making it understood to the Italians and the French that the Communists have double loyalties which risk playing in favor of the U.S.S.R. or the East European countries, and this is a threat to their security and their peace.', 'This awareness could be, in my opinion, a decisive factor for the future of the free world. This has been shown, to a certain degree in Portugal, when the European allies told Portugal: ""If your country goes communist, this will reduce or break our trade exchanges, and it will compromise the defense system that exists between the European community and you."" Without applying any useless pressures on the Portuguese people, a complete takeover by the Communists was averted.', 'Thus, I do not regard the Communist tide as a disaster or as a factor for destruction of the Atlantic Alliance, but I see it nevertheless a disquieting problem. It is evident, that the margin between expressing anxiety and direct intervention is extremely narrow. There must be a lot of common sense to maintain it. It is evident, that in order to avoid increasing Communist participation in the government, the best remedy is a better functioning of the democratic regimes, but this is most difficult to achieve.', 'Q. What would he the attitude of your government toward the use of the Concorde in the United States?', 'Carter. I am against the use of supersonic aircraft under the U.S. flag since the Congress and the government of the United States have refused the construction of a supersonic aircraft in the United States.', 'Six or seven years ago, we abandoned the idea of the supersonic aircraft due to the enormous consumption of fuel per passenger, the enormous investments that it required, and the great risks to the environment, especially the noise pollution. If these drawbacks have played against U.S. aircraft, I think that they should be also valid against the Concorde and against any foreign aircraft.', 'At present we are in an experimentation stage, and I am ready to examine the results very carefully. If it becomes evident, after these limited tests, that it is in our interest to maintain the flight of the Concorde, I will take this into account, of course. But I agree entirely with the decision of the Congress 6 years ago, and I think that we should not regard a supersonic aircraft, like the Concorde, differently from our own supersonics, which have not been built for the reason that I gave.', 'Q. France has recently sold to Pakistan a uranium processing plant. Mr. Kissinger was opposed to this deal. What will be your stance toward the sales of nuclear installations?', 'Carter. France should join us in strictly limiting the sales of nuclear installations to non-nuclear countries, even if this should mean a loss in the balance of payments. The menace that the atomic proliferation constitutes is a very important problem. As President of the United States, I would never hesitate to express my opinion if France or Germany, or even the United States, would sell such installations. And I will do all that is in my power either through private negotiations, or through public pronouncements, to reduce such sales.', 'Q. If you are elected President, you said that you will use more firmness in dealing with the U.S.S.R. How do you reconcile this with detente?', 'Carter. The word ""detente"" has been exploited by Nixon, Fend, and Kissinger as a publicity slogan. We certainly have to pursue vigorously our efforts for the establishment of harmonious relations between the Soviet and the American peoples. For example, we have to develop touristic, academic and cultural exchanges.', 'As regards trade relations, we have to impose the rule of ""do ut des"" when we grant to the Soviets something that they need. It is evident that our wheat or grain sales, when the harvest is bad in the U.S.S.R., and our sales of electronic equipment, or machines—all peaceful supplies—are of great value to the U.S.S.R. I would not use them as means to blackmail the Soviets, but I would like to obtain an equal benefit from them for the United States or for world peace.', ""The U.S.S.R. must keep its commitments as regards human rights, as they have been defined in the final document of the Helsinki Conference. The Soviets did not comply so far. It is also necessary that Moscow's attitude be less aggressive during crises in the Near East, and that on the contrary, it join us in the relaxation of tensions, instead of pouring oil into fire, as it did the last time."", 'The U.S.S.R. should show more interest in the limitation of nuclear tests and in changing its tendency to establish its peace proposals on nuclear terror. I expect, from the Soviets, better cooperation in order to obtain a balanced reduction of forces in Europe and a commitment for fighting terrorism.', 'Here are the areas where we can expect beneficial results for us and for the U.S.S.R. and which strengthen world peace.', ""On the other hand, I hope sincerely for a mutual reduction of nuclear armaments within well-defined and carefully controlled limits, the slowdown in the growth of the nuclear arsenal, with the ultimate objective of getting rid of all the nuclear arms one day. This will not be achieved in my lifetime but the fact that our country has such an objective proves its sincerity in the SALT negotiations and constitutes one of the aspects of an appropriate policy toward the U.S.S.R. Should that be considered a hard-line policy or not* I don't know. I would like simply to be sure, that if I make a concession to the Russians, I must get a concession from them in favor of world peace."", 'Q. What should be the attitude of the United States toward the desire of independence of East European countries via-a-vis the U.S.S.R.?', 'Carter. We have to, in my opinion, maintain an open road to such independence. There is no question, for me, to organize clandestine operations in those countries to overthrow their government; but the doors must remain open; and we have to increase trade relations with them in order to improve our image in those countries, and to let our point of view be known by radio or other means. All this is beneficial to us, I think It is a question of a peaceful evolution, not of revolution.', 'We should, for example, let the Soviet Union understand clearly, that we are firmly in favor of an independent Yugoslavia, where the government will change in a few years. I mean independence with regard to die Soviet Union. We have to act in a way to diminish the tensions everywhere they exist.']"
55,Jimmy Carter ,"August 24, 1976","['Mr. Carter was questioned by Harry Bernstein, labor writer; Charles Champlin, arts editor; Russell Chandler, religion writer; John Lawrence, economic affairs editor; Harry Nelson, medical writer; Don Speich, education writer; and Bill Shirley, sports editor.\n', ""Q. As Governor of Georgia and in your campaign, you have called for expansion of career and vocational education. An investigation by this paper shows there has been a massive growth in this country of vocational education over the last 10 years, and there's been a decided shift away from academic subjects to the vocational area. And we have found that perhaps this is one of the causes for the decline in basic achievement skills throughout the nation. How can you justify an expansion of vocational education without knowing whether it may be detracting from the basic skills of students?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, if you'll forgive me for not agreeing with you, Presidents, governors, and Members of Congress can't decide what kind of educational programs a young person is going to choose. The fact is that the young people and their parents in the last number of years—you said 8 or 10—have shifted away from an academic choice to a vocational choice. And this is an inexorable trend which I don't think I could modify. The point is that, recognizing that this is going to take place anyhow, I think it's mandatory that the government leaders prepare to meet the desire on the part of the students to get a more practical education during their formative years.\n"", ""We've had too long in our country—perhaps California is an exception— a sharp division between academic and career education. In our own state, before I became governor, there was a complete separation between the two. At the age of 16 or 17, a person decided, I'm going to be a licensed practical nurse or secretary, or I'm going to be an automobile mechanic or bricklayer, and that was an irrevocable decision almost, and they went away from the academic instruction of civics and English and mathematics, and so forth, into the more practical aspects of life. I try to meld the two together.\n"", ""Also, we found that quite often young people didn't have any idea what they wanted to be, so we tried to move the career education introduction down to the fifth-grade level—although those children are much too young to work. We wanted them to start knowing then what sort of lives they could lead and what the responsibility would be for the different careers. We have an inevitable shift already underway toward more practical or vocational education.\n"", ""I want to make sure it's not completely divorced from learning about one's government and one's life or music, drama, literature.\n"", 'Q. Is that right, [that] all the government should do is follow the desire of the people in terms of education?\n', ""Governor Carter. I didn't exactly say that. That's an oversimplification of what I said. If I, as President, decided we needed to shift away from career education toward more academic instruction, I couldn't influence the decisions that are being made independently of the President's inclination within the families of this country.\n"", ""Q. But don't you think it's the government's responsibility to set the tone? I mean in the past the tone has been set for vocational education from the national to the state level.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I have to admit that my own opinion is that the shift has not been ill-advised. I was a graduation speaker at Georgia Tech ... I think there were 83 doctoral student graduates and only 30 of them had jobs the day that they graduated from Georgia Tech. I asked each one as they came across the stage, and I handed them the diploma. There's been too much of a divorcing within our whole structure of job opportunities on one hand— either very advanced jobs or the manual labor jobs—from the production of students from colleges or universities or from vocational schools.\n"", ""We still have not bridged the gap between the two, and quite often we're turning out students who weren't even needed when they enrolled in the college maybe 4 years ago. And the Labor Department roughly speaking on the erne hand at the federal level and the HEW (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) education component on the other hand—there's no correlation between the two. And this is a very devastating thing for a young person and his parents—to spend a lot of money, to spend a lot of time going through 4 or 5 or 6 years and then graduating and finding that because of the structure of job opportunities in society there's no opportunity at all for them to be employed.\n"", ""So I think that there's almost a quantum jump needed in correlating, at the very low stages, academic and career education. And the second thing is, we need a close correlation between job-need analysis and the counseling of students as they enter courses of study in whatever school they attend.\n"", ""Q. You favor a national health insurance plan, Governor. So does the AMA and so does Senator Edward M. Kennedy. I had a hunch that you'd be more at Senator Kennedy’s end of the spectrum. And yet, in a statement we had last week from Plains, based on the amount of money that you would move from the private sector to the public sector, [ft] doesn't sound like it's enough money to support a Kennedy-type national health plan. Could you explain, in more detail, the kind of a plan you favor?\n"", 'Governor Carter. We now spend about $550 in this country for every man, woman, and child for health care—much more than any other nation in the world, per person or as a percentage of gross national product But the distribution of health care is grossly unfair, inequitable and the emphasis on prevention of diseases is much less than it was 40 or 45 years ago when I was a child. At that time, almost all my health care was to prevent diseases like polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, mumps, measles, typhoid, typhus, and so forth. That is something we need to change.\n', 'I have not wedded myself to the Kennedy-Corman bill. I have my own— my ethic would be to minimize government responsibilities as long as I could guarantee an equitable quality of health care for our people throughout the country. If it took extra money, I would try to provide it through increased tax revenues or from some other mechanism. I think that the net increase in cost of health care would be relatively minor. By that I mean less than $10 billion. But now, how much of that money would come from the federal government I have not yet decided.\n', ""I spent 7 or 8 hours with Congressman Al Ullman the other night in my home discussing this very question. And I've reserved the right to decide how much of the insurance program should be administered by private insurers and also how much of the administrative responsibility for health delivery would be absorbed by the government. But I think that the overall increase in net cost would be much less than has been generally supposed. And the other aspect of my proposal that would be different from the Kennedy-Corman bill is that I'm going to set—in every major aspect of life, including welfare, health, education—what I hope to see this country doing at the end of my term in the fiscal year of 1981 and work back from there. I want to have a comprehensive health care program fully established in this country in 4 years but how much we do each succeeding year will have to be determined by what we have available.\n"", 'Q. This implies a phased program that would cover certain groups the first year, like maybe children.\n', ""Governor Carter. That's not exactly what I have in mind, but phased'—yes. It might take the first year just to make the present health care systems work. We now have an almost uncountable number of agencies in the federal government responsible for health care—I think 72 in physical health care, 37 in mental health care.\n"", ""We have two congressional committees responsible for health care, major ones, five responsible for welfare, Medicare, and Medicaid, and two different agencies, and so forth. Just to make the present delivery system work would be a major goal the first year—this is, Medicare and Medicaid. And then I think the other 3 years would be utilized in expanding our present health services to recipients who don't presently have any.\n"", 'Q. So by the end of 4 years, everybody in the United States would be covered by the same kind of universal plan? Or would we still have these pockets of Medicare and Medicaid?\n', ""Governor Carter. I would like to have it universal, but I also would like to have the option, which I am maintaining, of providing a basic package of health care to be provided to everyone. With the indigents, the cost would primarily come from government revenues which it is now. For those who are working, I would like to have the option of having that financed by employer and employee contributions. And those who decide to have extraordinary health needs met—for instance, plastic surgery and so forth—they would pay for it themselves. But I think that the overall net increase per year would be in the range that I've described at our meeting in Plains.\n"", ""Q. How are you going to control the inflation? Medicare and Medicaid are pretty much responsible for the current spiral. If you're adding more people, how are you going to prevent an additional inflation from occurring from that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there are many ways this can be done. We now have an almost uncontrollable inclination to build health care facilities that are not needed. We've got too many beds for instance in some areas of our country and still building them. [There is] very little correlation, in meeting a community's need, between the private and the public installations.\n"", ""We've got too much emphasis on inpatient care—sometimes almost forced on the patient—by the unwillingness of the insurance companies to pay unless a patient is an inpatient. I think we need to have more emphasis on outpatient care. I think we've gotten too much advanced technology going into medicine when sometimes the return on the investment is very slight. We've got too much emphasis on the treatment of disease once it's become serious and inadequate routine preventive care. We've got too little monitoring of the inclination of doctors and insurance companies to kind of orient the patients into accepting health care beyond their own needs. And these kinds of changes, if initiated, I think, would have a great deal of------\n"", 'Q. Do you see co-payments and deductions as an incentive to people not to seek medical treatments and to------\n', 'Governor Carter. I think that would be a likely prospect for the first few years of the health care program. If we see that we can accommodate no co-payments in the basic health care package at the end of the period, then I would like to see that done.\n', 'Q. If you had been President last March when President Ford announced the swine flu thing would you have done what he did?\n', 'Governor Carter. I doubt it.\n', 'Q. Why?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I'm not convinced yet. I don't have enough information to answer your question completely. I'm not sure that that massive swine flu inoculation program is needed, but I don't have as much information available to me, as I'm sure President Ford has through all his advisers.\n"", ""Q. First, l'd like to ask about the Catholic vote. Some say that the Catholic vote is substantially dead now and Catholics, like those of other religions, will vote their convictions along a broad range of issues. Others say that you have a lack of support among the nation's 49 million Catholics, which is the largest political and religious bloc. Do you feel that there is such a thing as a Catholic vote, and if so, do you think that you do have a problem with wooing that segment of the vote, and what do you propose to do about it?\n"", ""Governor Carter. We've run one comprehensive poll nationwide since the Democratic Convention, and the results of that poll showed that I have a 2 percent higher support among Catholics than I do have among Protestants, which is an indication that we don't have a crisis on our hands. I think among just average Catholic voters, there is no such thing as a Catholic vote. I think among some of the leaders within the Catholic Church and perhaps among some of the ethnic groups in the country who were normally Catholic, they have been concerned about me and my lack of singling them out for special attention and meeting with them, which I'm trying to correct now, seeing that it is a problem which I brought upon myself.\n"", 'This so-called religious vote, in my opinion, has been grossly overestimated.\n', ""The original predictions that we had from public opinion polls ... were much more severe than we experienced. But as people got to know me and to learn more about my own religious faith, the concerns have been alleviated, and this has been particularly true in states where I had a chance to campaign—like Iowa, New Hampshire, and Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and so forth. So I'm going to do all I can during the campaign to meet more specifically with ethnic groups and with Catholic leaders to make sure they know me better. But other than that, I have no particular plans to correct a problem that has been exaggerated.\n"", ""Q. Regarding abortion as a possible campaign issue. Do you see it as such? We understand that you've had some preliminary contacts with officials of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. What did you tell them about your beliefs and proposed plans regarding abortion and legislation regarding abortion?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't look on abortion as a Catholic issue. I'm opposed to abortion; I think abortion is wrong. Georgia had a very strict abortion law while I was governor. And ours was a test case when the Supreme Court struck down the existing laws .... In 1973, I think, it was January, we passed as strict an abortion law as we could pass under the ruling of the Supreme Court.\n"", ""I don't think government ought to do anything to encourage abortions, and I think we ought to have a nationwide effort through my own persuasion as President, if I'm elected, through sex education and access to contraceptives, for those who believe in their use, family planning programs, better adoptive procedures, do everything we can to minimize the need for abortions.\n"", ""I see abortions as evidence of a failure to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And this has been my position all the time. I'm not in favor of a constitutional amendment that would totally prohibit abortion, or that would give states local option. I think that's the wrong approach to it. In fact, I don't think that a constitutional amendment is the best approach to it, but I think the Democratic Party platform wording was unfortunate, and I think improper in insinuating that others who believe very strongly that the court ruling should be changed, ought to have a right to pursue an amendment.\n"", ""I think any citizen ought to have a right to pursue an amendment to the Constitution. That expresses my opinion. That has been so ever since 1973, and it's the same position I've described to Catholic leadership.\n"", 'Q. If elected, how active a part will you play in official religion of Washington, D.C., concerning prayer breakfasts, evangelical meetings? What kind of a posture stance will you take in regard to that, say in relation to evangelists Billy Graham, Bill Bright (of Campus Crusade for Christ), and others?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would guess less than other Presidents have. My own inclination toward worship is to have it as much as possible a private thing. I would probably continue the annual prayer breakfast which has become historically accepted, but I think President Nixon had special services in the White House in a fairly highly publicized way, and so forth. I would expect to worship at a nearby Baptist Church on Sunday morning with as little fanfare as possible and, hopefully, after the first few Sundays I would just be accepted as a member of the church. This is what I did as governor, and I hope that I could pursue the same habit.\n', ""If there's one thing about Baptists that sets us aside from any other denomination, it's our total and complete commitment to the separation of church and state.\n"", 'Q. President Ford was a pretty good football player. President Eisenhower also played football but probably was a better general. President Nixon was a sub in college, and they all said they learned a lot from the game. Can a man be a good President without having a football background?\n', ""Governor Carter. I hope so. I played on the under-140 pound team at the Naval Academy, in intramural football, but I guess my best talent was in crosscountry. I was a high jumper and pole vaulter when I first went to Georgia Tech, but I had a severe stone bruise on my heel and had to stop that so I began to run on the cross-country team. Lately, I've taken up softball.\n"", 'Q. Seriously, we hear a great deal about how team sports—especially football—teach lessons that are helpful in life, that sports prepare a man to be a good ""team player."" Have you learned anything helpful from your sports experiences, or do you believe that sports competition has any real value in life?\n', 'Governor Carter. I do. I believe it does have a real value in life. I was on the varsity basketball team in high school and, when I was in submarines, I was the pitcher on our baseball team. I learned there, obviously, that you have to be mutually dependent to achieve an identifiable goal, and you have to learn how to accept either defeat or victory with some degree of equanimity and look to the next contest with hope and anticipation.\n', 'I think you have to yield sometimes your own selfish aspirations for the common good and be able to deal with one another in an open, sometimes competitive way, but not a personally antagonistic way. I think those are some of the lessons that you learn from team sports, and I hope that I remember them.\n', 'Q. How do you view the government role in the Olympic Games? Should our best athletes be subsidized or should the government spend money to provide facilities and coaching for all citizens who would like to get off their backsides and participate? Or do you see anything wrong with the United States doing the best it can with what it has and finishing second to Socialist countries which might spend millions of dollars to win gold medals?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's a question I haven't been asked before. But it's one about which I have thought a great deal. I think that my own inclination, as President, would be to encourage a much earlier nationwide competitive identification of superlative athletes toward the next Olympics.\n"", 'I would like to minimize the role that the government plays in that process officially, but, as a spokesman for our country, as President, I would like to help athletes complying completely with the Olympic rules, both in spirit and according to the written rules, have a maximum opportunity to participate in sports, to encourage colleges, those in the Armed Forces, those who work in private life, to have a chance to compete and to train.\n', ""I think that if we can maintain the interest in individual Olympic sports throughout the 4 year period, we'll have a much better chance in the future to let those athletes exhibit their own innate superiority. I don't see anything wrong with this, and as President, I intend to pursue that goal within the framework that I've described to you.\n"", 'Q. What teams do you root for?\n', ""Governor Carter. As far as football goes, I went to Georgia Tech and the U.S. Naval Academy, and I root for them when they're not playing each other. When they play each other, I generally root for the underdog. I’ve tried to root for Atlanta professional teams but with abysmal success.\n"", 'Q. Do you plan to call any coaches or athletes after victories?\n', 'Governor Carter. Oh, I might on occasion.\n', ""Q. I understand you did form a task force on arts ... and I've been curious to know what the status of the task force is, and, perhaps in more general terms, your feelings about the arts in your life and about government control in support of the arts?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Before the campaign progresses very far, I intend to make one speech or kind of a comprehensive statement on the arts, as they will be encouraged when I become President. We've got in Georgia, a commission on the arts that is headed by a young pianist, who also happens to be a Rhodes scholar, and we've had a major emphasis on bringing the arts out into the country, into the small towns and cities where, in the past, access to the visual or performing arts has not been adequate. I was asked last night by a group if I would pursue the concept of a much greater support for the arts within the federal government. I would.\n"", ""I think this is the kind of thing that has been neglected perhaps since John Kennedy was President. I would like to reinstitute that thrust. Senator Walter F. Mondale's wife, Joan, has written a book about government and the arts, and I think she's already had some conversations with me and my wife about her role in that. My wife has been very enthusiastic about it, also. But this is something that I think has been neglected in our country.\n"", ""When I've traveled in other nations, I've seen a much heavier emphasis on the performing arts out among people who ordinarily would not have access to them, who are not socially elite or very wealthy, and this I think would be a good thrust for our government to pursue which in the past has been ignored almost completely.\n"", 'Q. Well, I think the National Endowment has about $85 million this year. That sounds less than you would like to see the government have in the future?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, sir.\n', 'Q. Would you change the basis of it all, I mean decentralize?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I would like to see it decentralized. I found that when I was governor, that sometimes a $10,000 allocation to, say, a ballet group or other group in Augusta, Georgia, could be magnified four or five times over with local participation. And I still believe that we have fully tens of thousands of those people around the country who would be willing to make a contribution on a matching basis, either of their own time or a financial contribution to improve the quality of arts in their own communities.\n', 'So I think the federal government could provide the emphasis and the organizational structure for greatly magnifying performing and other arts better than you could by direct grants to a specific artist where the government paid 100 percent of a certain level.\n', 'Q. There9s a lot of talk these days about the amount of sex and violence both in movies and on television. I was wondering how much of a moviegoer you are, and how much television you watch other than the news, and whether you share that concern about some of the contents and what, if anything, that you think ought to be done?\n', ""Governor Carter. I hate to admit that I'm not much of a moviegoer, or television watcher. I am concerned about it It's surprising how many times this question comes up in audiences around the country, what can be done to hold down an overemphasis on sex and violence, particularly during die family watching hours. And I responded to this the other day at a citizens' forum in Washington.\n"", ""I know there's a very narrow dividing line between censorship on the one hand and a minimization of violence and sex on television movies. I think the best thing that I could do is perhaps to express my concern to those who comprise or form those presentations and hope for voluntary—maybe stricter—self-policing in that respect I would not hesitate, as President, to express my concern about it, and I think that the President's voice would have a beneficial impact, perhaps. But I would be cautious about how to do that because I'm really strongly opposed to any sort of censorship.\n"", 'I think that if parents and purchasers of goods, who comprise the viewing audience, say, on television, if they knew that the President was also concerned, that they might very well let their own displeasure be felt in a more vivid and effective way.\n', ""Q. Do you favor federal labor legislation covering farmworkers and, if the answer is yes, do you thing it should be achieved by bringing the farm workers under the present National Labor Relations Act, or should it be patterned after California's farm labor law? Do you know about proposition 14 on the ballot in California in November—the farm labor initiative sponsored by Cesar Chavez?\n"", 'Governor Carter. My own inclination would be hold off on that national farm labor legislation until I see how the California plan works ... on proposition 14, it follows the pattern of established legislation, and I think basically I would have no objection to it.\n', 'Q. Some supporters of Humphrey-Hawkins say additional monies are needed to make the government the employer of last resort and that some of the funds for those programs should come from the military budget. Do you support the concept of government being the employer of last resort and do you think that a military budget cut could be used to provide funds for such employment?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well the answer to your last question would be no, I think that would be a simplistic approach, and I think that would be creating a false hope among people that a substantial amount of money could be cut from the military.\n', 'The Humphrey-Hawkins bill has been drastically amended in the last 2 or 3 months. So far as I know, every one of those amendments has brought it closer and closer into conformance with my own philosophy. I favor first of all that jobs be provided in the private sector, and not the government sector whenever possible, and I also favor a minimal intrusion of the government into the planning process of the private sector.\n', 'I also think that we had in the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, as it was originally formed, an unwarranted constraint on unemployment. The original planning was to provide 3 percent overall unemployment at the end of 18 months, which would have had a profound or inflationary effect on our economy. I think inflation would have gone almost automatically into the double-digit figures again. What has been done now is to set a goal at the end of 4 years to have 3 percent adult unemployment ... I think it is a reasonable goal to establish.\n', 'Q. Would you accept the basic notion of the government as the employer of last resort?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; but I would define ""last resort"" very strictly ... We\'ve got 38 percent unemployment among minority young people. There I think a government program similar to the CCC that I knew during the depression years would be a good investment.\n', 'Q. One of the problems we face is battling unemployment and inflation at the same time. One of the things you favor is efforts to insure adequate supplies to meet the growth. How would you go about doing this?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't believe that our economy is now being constrained by inadequate supplies of steel, copper, even oil. I think that we have cut down so-called strategic reserves perhaps too much and there might be a good opportunity here to build up those reserve supplies.\n"", ""What I intend to do before this year is over is establish what we hope to have as economic and social circumstances at the end of 1980 ... Let that be a government decision that's publicized by me and, hopefully, the Members of Congress will join with me in those commitments. And that will let the private sector make its plans accordingly.\n"", ""Q. Would you use tax incentives as a means of encouraging private industry to do some of the things you'd like it to do?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Possibly. My own general inclination would be to greatly simplify the present tax structure rather than to add on additional incentives.\n', 'I intend to pursue, as an immediate responsibility—and we are beginning it already—a complete analysis of the income tax structure that would start from scratch, not amend incrementally what we have now. I would minimize an addition of additional incentives and try to eliminate some of those programs that we now have.\n', 'Q. Many experts in the country say that the federal government is going to be in a budget crunch at least for several more years and not have much new money for new programs. With that in mind and your promise of a balanced budget on ahead, how would you expect to finance such things as your additional aid to cities and other social problems?\n', ""Governor Carter. Nobody can say for sure what's going to be happening 4 years from now but, based on a 4 percent annual growth in our gross national product based on a 4J4 percent unemployment rate within the 4 years ... I believe the budget can be balanced. That would give us at the end of that period about a $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent for improvement of services and still have the budget balanced.\n"", ""There's another tremendous amount of savings that can be derived in my opinion from better expenditure of existing allotments of money ... There's a great deal that can be done to shift away from dependency on the government\n"", ""Q. On the subject of wage and price controls you said that you're in favor of some kind of standby authority.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Only as a last resort.\n', 'Q. Would you seek such authority early in your administration?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. Where do you stand on divestiture of the oil industry?\n', ""Governor Carter. I wouldn't put divestiture as my first goal. There are two areas of oil company investment that concern me. One is horizontal investment in the coal industry and in uranium and geothermal areas and the other one is at the wholesale and retail level. I don't think there is adequate competition in those areas now. Unless I can provide adequate competition through other mechanisms, I would stay with divestiture. But I would try other means first. I think if we have vertical divestiture where we separate investment and extraction and refining and pipeline distribution and wholesale and retail sales, it would possibly cost us a lot more in the long run.\n"", ""Q. When all is said and done, do you think that in this election year that the overriding issue before the candidates, that's you and Mr. Ford, isn't foreign and domestic issues so much as how you are perceived by voters in terms of character, personal morality, and integrity? Isn't that what they re going to vote for, rather than all these other things?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think you left out two very important characteristics. One is competence. Competence to lead. And the other one is sensitivity to the people's needs. Obviously, character and integrity are important, but leadership capabilities and a closeness to the people and the comprehension of what our people need are two additional component parts of the three I think are most important. I think the major overriding question is, how can we restore the trust of the American people in their own government? And those three characteristics, I think, are all equally important.\n"", 'Q. But you do agree with the basic premise that certain characteristics of the candidates are going to override the issues in deciding the election?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I do. The only thing that I was disagreeing with is that honesty and integrity is the only thing. You can have an honest person of superb integrity, but if he's incompetent, or if he doesn't understand our people, that could be a very serious defect.""]"
56,Jimmy Carter ,"August 24, 1976","['It is a pleasure to appear here today before my fellow Legionnaires and to have this opportunity to discuss matters of common concern to us as veterans and as Americans.\n', 'I am, as you may know, a member of Legion Post 2 in Americus, Georgia, as was my father before me.\n', 'A tradition of military service runs deep in our family. My first ancestor to live in Georgia, James Carter, fought in the Revolutionary War. Almost a hundred years later, others fought in the War between the States, and my father, Earl Carter, served as a first lieutenant in the Army during the First World War.\n', 'Including my time at the U.S. Naval Academy, I spent 11 years in the Navy, most of my sea duty in submarines. I had the good fortune to serve under Admiral Rickover on the development of one of the first atomic submarines, and I have tried to carry over into my business career and my political life the high standards of dedication and competence that I learned from that remarkable military leader.\n', ""My son, Jack, continued our family's tradition in the military, but his service came in an era quite different from my own. Jack left college several years ago and volunteered to serve in Vietnam. He did so because he didn't think it was right for him to escape service simply because he had the money and the educational background to stay in college.\n"", 'During the Second World War, and even during the Korean War, I always wore my uniform with immense pride, and it was a badge of honor among my civilian friends and neighbors.\n', ""That was not the case when Jack came home from Danang in 1969. He and the uniform he wore were all too often greeted with scorn and derision. Many of his friends told him he was a fool to risk his life in a meaningless war that couldn't be won.\n"", 'Hundreds of thousands of Vietnam veterans were meeting that same bitter reception all over America, and I believe very strongly that those scenes, and the national mood they reflected, amount to nothing less than an American tragedy.\n', 'I believe in patriotism. I believe that people should love our country, and be proud of our country, and be willing to fight to defend our country. That is how you and I grew up—never doubting that ours was the greatest nation on earth, and getting, as Senator John Glenn once put it, a warm feeling inside us whenever the American flag passed by.\n', 'I know that your patriotism has been demonstrated not only in your military service, but in your work in community and national affairs, such as your outstanding ""War on Cancer"" fund drive. But we must recognize that for millions of our fellow Americans, patriotism is out of fashion, or is an object of scorn and jokes. That fact is part of the bitter heritage of an unpopular war.\n', ""I do not seek a blind or uncritical patriotism. Obviously, a government's policies must be deserving of public support. But in recent years, disagreement with our nation's policies too often became rejection of our nation itself. There is a great need for the next President to do everything in his power, by word and deed, to restore national pride and patriotism in our country—and if I am elected, that is what I intend to do.\n"", 'I also believe in tradition. I was Governor of Georgia when Congress passed the law that changed the observation of Armistice Day away from the traditional date of November 11. I thought that action was unnecessary, insensitive, and offensive, and we kept November 11 as Armistice Day in Georgia.\n', 'I did not come here just to get your vote or endorsement, nor just to make a good impression on you. I come here as a nominee for President who has spent full-time the last 20 months learning about this country— what it is and what it ought to be.\n', 'I want to talk to you about some tough decisions—as veterans, yes, but also as Americans who are farmers and truckdrivers, doctors and lawyers, fathers and grandfathers, school teachers and civil servants, employed and unemployed, rich and poor.\n', 'We must maintain adequate military strength compared to that of our potential adversaries. This relative strength can be assured:\n', '• by a commitment to necessary military expenditures;\n', '• by elimination of waste, duplication among forces, excessive personnel costs, unnecessary new weapons systems, inefficient contracting procedures;\n', '• and by a mutual search for peace so that armament levels can be reduced among nations, because the most important single factor in avoiding nuclear war is the mutual desire for peace among the superpowers.\n', 'I would never again see our country become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was directly threatened. But it is imperative that the world know that we will meet obligations and commitments to our allies and that we will keep our nation strong.\n', 'We seek friendship with the unaligned and developing nations of the world. Many of them are weak and vulnerable, and they need allies who can contribute to their peace, security and prosperity. Yet we must remember that excessive foreign commitment can overtax our national ability. We must therefore be cautious in making commitments, but firm in honoring them.\n', 'I have spoken recently with many experts in national defense matters, and I believe we have, overall, adequate ability to defend ourselves, to meet obligations to our allies, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy. But we must be constantly vigilant to recognize and correct adverse trends.\n', 'Our total American ground combat forces are less than half those of the Soviet Union, and the number of men under arms in that country has increased by a million while ours have decreased by I/2 million since 1968. During the same period the number of U.S. ships has been cut in half. For every tank we have, the Soviets have at least eight. Because of our greatly improved anti-tank weapons, this heavy Soviet investment in tanks may prove to have been an unwise investment.\n', 'Of course, there are counterbalancing factors of strength such as superior quality of our weapons, the relative security of our own borders, our more ready access to the sea, and the trustworthiness and military capability of our allies.\n', 'There is now, in my opinion, an overall rough equivalency in direct military strength. This balance must be maintained.\n', 'Yet, as we seek an adequate defense, we must face the fact that the very words ""national security"" have fallen into disrepute. I want to hear those words spoken with respect once again. Too often, those words are now viewed with scorn, because they have been misused by political leaders to hide a multitude of sins, and because they have been used to justify inefficiency and waste in our defense establishment\n', 'Whatever the price and whatever the pressures, the President must insist on a national defense posture that is lean and muscular and flexible.\n', 'It is sometimes said that the threat of war has receded. But in Europe, the Middle East, in northeast Asia, potential for conflict still exists, powerful armed forces are deployed, and Americans have recently been brutally killed. To deny that these situations pose a potential danger to peace is to turn away from reality.\n', 'Our military power must be continually reviewed. In Europe, NATO must increase its combat readiness and adapt its forces to new military technology, if it is to offset steady improvements in Warsaw Pact forces. In the eastern Mediterranean, strong U.S. naval power must be maintained. We must also assure a dose and confident defense relationship with South Korea and Japan.\n', 'We must maintain rough equivalency with the Soviet Union in strategic nuclear forces. Equally important, we and our allies must have conventional military capability adequate to reduce dependence on nuclear striking power. In a world where massive mutual devastation is the likely result of any use of nuclear weapons, such strategic forces cannot solely be relied upon to deter a vast range of threats to our interests and the interests of our allies.\n', 'We must always recognize that the best way to meet ideological threats around the world is to make our own democratic system work here at home.\n', ""The strongest defense grows out of a strong home front—out of patriotism. Our defense must come not only from our fighting forces, but from our people's trust in their leaders, from adequate transportation, energy, agriculture, science, employment, and, most of all, from the willingness of our people to make personal sacrifices for the sake of our nation. Not until we restore national unity can we have a truly adequate national defense.\n"", ""Only then can we, in Theodore Roosevelt's phrase, speak softly but carry a big stick.\n"", 'I recognize, of course, as you do, that it is not enough for the President to talk about patriotism and national security. He must take positive, aggressive action to ensure that our defense establishment is worthy of national respect. That calls for leadership, and it calls for management\n', ""In any given annual budget, now or in the future, there is a limited amount of money available for national defense. When any resources are wasted, our nation's security is weakened. We now have an excessive drain on defense funding from waste and unnecessary expenditures.\n"", 'We must better coordinate long-range planning and budgeting among departments responsible for military, foreign, fiscal, economic, transportation and social affairs of our government. A spirit of cooperation must be restored.\n', ""Foreign aid must be consistent with our national purposes, and designed to strengthen our allies and friends and to fulfill humanitarian purposes. I'm tired of our taxing the poor people in our rich country and sending the money to the rich people in poor countries.\n"", 'We must frankly and constantly assess the effectiveness of our present voluntary recruitment program. As unemployment drops and civilian jobs become more plentiful, it will be much more difficult to maintain our present military strength.\n', 'We must ensure that an oversized support establishment does not prevent us from maintaining needed combat force levels.\n', 'We must recognize that our military personnel are transferred too much. At any given moment, about one out of seven of those personnel is in the process of moving, or away from their family on temporary training duty. This year $2.5 billion will go simply to move service personnel, their families, television sets and furniture from one base to another. Such frequent moves not only eat up money, they undermine morale. If we extend the average tour of duty by just two months, we could save $400 million per year.\n', 'We need to reexamine our military training programs. Recent congressional hearings, by the way, revealed that we now have an average of one and a half military students for each instructor. By moving to a ratio of only three students to each instructor, we could save an estimated $1 billion per year.\n', 'Cost overruns have become chronic. The Pentagon itself estimates that the total current cost of overruns on the 45 weapons systems now in the process of development in the three services—exclusive of inflation—is $10.7 billion. Over the next five years, that would approximate the cost of the proposed B-l bomber program over the same period.\n', 'We need sound, tough management of the Pentagon not only to eliminate waste, but to ensure that force structures are correlated with foreign policy objectives. Tough management will mean that overlaps are eliminated between Pentagon programs and similar programs of civilian agencies. It will mean that we cooperate closely with our allies in our mutual defense, that our weapons systems are integrated with each other, technically and strategically, and that we put a stop to the dubious practice of arms giveaway programs for potential adversaries.\n', ""Ever since I was Governor of Georgia, when I attended National Guard training sessions every summer, I have been concerned that our reserve forces, both the regular reserve and the National Guard, do not play a strong enough role in our military preparedness. We need to shift toward a highly trained, combat-worthy reserve, well equipped and closely coordinated with regular forces—always capable of playing a crucial role in the nation's defense.\n"", ""If we can get the flab out of the Pentagon's budget, I believe that the public will evaluate questions about weapons systems and force levels on their merits in a calm and rational manner. Our people will support an adequate defense establishment without complaint, so long as they know that their tax dollars are not being wasted.\n"", 'The threat to our security comes not only from states that might be hostile. International terrorism knows no boundaries, recognizes no law of warfare, accepts no standards of conduct. It is brutality at its worst, the law of the jungle in its most primitive form.\n', 'Recently at Entebbe, the Israelis reaffirmed courageously the old principle that every state has a right to defend its citizens against brutal and arbitrary violence—violence that in this case was even based on collusion between the terrorists and a government.\n', 'The issue of international terrorism must be a priority item for the entire international community. If I become President, I intend to recommend strong multinational sanctions against guilty nations as a necessary and productive means of crushing this intolerable threat to international law and peace. International terrorism must be stopped once and for all!\n', 'In our own country, we must recognize that, in far too many cases, the Vietnam veteran has been a victim of governmental insensitivity and neglect. Large bureaucracies of the federal government have often been incompetent, inefficient, and unresponsive in their fulfillment of responsibilities to veterans. Each month, thousands of veterans are plagued with late delivery of badly needed benefit checks. Hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit payments have been improperly computed. The average VA hospital has only half the doctors and supporting personnel found in the average community hospital.\n', 'The poor record of the government bureaucracy has been especially bad in programs intended to help recent veterans to find jobs. In 1973 and 1974 Congress passed legislation requiring special consideration for veterans in public service jobs, in training programs, for jobs with federal contractors, and for jobs in the federal government. None of these requirements has been fully or effectively carried out\n', 'For example, despite the mandates of the law many federal departments and agencies have few disabled veterans or Vietnam veterans serving within them. It took the Labor Department 18 months to establish administrative guidelines to ensure the hiring of veterans. In 1975, 16 federal agencies failed even to submit required plans for hiring disabled veterans until congressional inquiries were begun.\n', 'The record of placement in private sector jobs and training has been no better. In 1975 more than two thirds of the 153,000 job training slots went unfilled, largely due to inadequate administrative procedures.\n', 'Yet last month, there were still 543,000 Vietnam veterans who had.no jobs.\n', 'The reason for this dismal record is dear:\n', 'It is a failure of leadership.\n', ""Sympathetic leadership would not submit—as did the present administration—a budget recommending cuts of ten percent or more to veterans' programs and denying cost of living protection to disabled veterans.\n"", 'Concerned leadership would not have vetoed a bill overwhelmingly voted by Congress for higher education allowances, better work-study programs, more educational loans, and employment and training preferences for more than two million veterans.\n', 'Only because the Congress overrode this veto do Vietnam veterans enjoy some of the educational benefits they deserve.\n', 'I believe we need to address the needs of veterans, especially of Vietnam veterans, with sympathetic and active leadership rather than with vetoes and passive resistance. Men who have endured so much suffering, so bravely, fighting in a far-off land, should not now suffer anew in their own country at the hands of insensitive bureaucrats and indifferent politicians.\n', ""If I become President, the American veteran, of all ages, of all wars, is going to have a friend, a comrade and a firm ally in the White House. My administration will act to strengthen the competence, the responsiveness, and the independence of the Veterans' Administration. I will appoint the most capable administrators available, and I will insist on fair and sensitive treatment for veterans by every employee of the Executive Branch of government from top to bottom.\n"", ""I would like to speak for a moment about the single hardest decision I have had to make during the campaign. That was on the issue of amnesty. Where I come from, most of the men who went off to fight in Vietnam were poor. They didn't know where Canada was, they didn't know where Sweden was, they didn't have the money to hide from the draft in college. Many of them thought it was a bad war, but they went anyway. A lot of them came back with scarred minds or bodies, or with missing limbs. Some didn't come back at all. They suffered under the threat of death, and they still suffer from the indifference of many of their fellow Americans. The Vietnam veterans are our nation's greatest unsung heroes.\n"", 'I could never equate what they have done with those who left this country to avoid the draft.\n', 'But I think it is time for the damage, hatred and divisiveness of the Vietnam war to be over.\n', 'I do not favor a blanket amnesty, but for those who violated Selective Service laws, I intend to grant a blanket pardon.\n', 'To me, there is a difference. Amnesty means that what you did is right A pardon means that what you did—right or wrong—is forgiven. So, pardon— yes; amnesty—no.\n', ""For deserters, each case should be handled on an individual basis in accordance with our nation's system of military justice.\n"", 'We may not all be able to agree about what was the right course for the nation to take in 1966. But we can now agree to respect those differences and to forget them. We can come together and seek a rebirth of patriotism in which all our citizens can join.\n', 'We must bind up our wounds. We simply cannot afford to let them fester any longer. The world is too dangerous. We cannot remain distracted from what must be our overriding aim. Our attention must turn to rebuilding the military, economic and spiritual foundations of a peaceful world order.\n', 'Those who most want peace, and who best understand the need for strength as a prerequisite for peace, are our past and present servicemen and their families. As a former submarine officer, I know that fact from experience.\n', 'I can still remember hearing Prerident Truman explain to the world that the atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima. I was at sea in an old battleship in the North Atlantic. None of us had ever heard even a rumor of this quantum leap in destructive power. We had no way of comprehending the meaning of this new weapon which had been dropped on Japan. We were mainly relieved at the prospect that the need for invading Japan might be averted, thus saving what would surely have been the loss of hundreds of thousands of American and Japanese lives.\n', 'After we saw the destruction in Japan, for a while we understood the terrible havoc and devastation which would follow any use of nuclear weapons. But now we have a tendency to forget Even if a strategic nuclear war could remain ""limited in nature,"" it would still involve the death of approximately ten million Americans. A so-called ""limited nuclear war"" in Europe could produce an even greater number of deaths. In an all-out nuclear war, 200 million Americans could die—virtually the entire population.\n', 'Obviously, such a holocaust is beyond our capacity even to imagine. Numbers like 10 million dead or 200 million dead seem unbelievable. But they are true.\n', 'The Duke of Wellington said in 1838: ""A great country cannot wage a little war."" In our time that doctrine has acquired new meaning. In a nuclear world, we cannot rely on little wars to prevent big wars. We must maintain our strength and use it to prevent all wars.\n', 'Our people have been shocked and hurt over and over again. Things which we used to take for granted are now subject to widespread doubt. Things like trust in our leaders, confidence in our institutions—even love and respect for the flag and support and appreciation for the men and women who defend the flag. But I believe there is no one in this country— certainly there is no one in this room—who does not want to heal our wounds and restore the precious qualities and the national strengths we seem to have lost.\n', 'I hope to play a role in that noble enterprise.\n', 'I hope you will help.\n', 'Thank you.']"
57,Jimmy Carter ,"August 24, 1976","[""There is no way for me to describe how I feel coming home to Iowa. As Neal [Smith] was talking about change and opposition to change, and agriculture and farmland and historical developments, I thought about two or three weeks ago [when] I went down to our farm with one of the television network correspondents, and we were in the cemetery, there where our ancestors are buried who were born in 1787. We haven't moved very far. And I thought about my own children's great grandfather, who helped to clear that land. He went down into the swamp and he told me, when I first came home from the Navy, that it was so hot down there that he never wore trousers. He had long shirts that came down to about his knees.\n"", 'And he used to plant com, before it was possible just to get a mule and a plow through the new fields, by poking a hole in the ground and dropping in a com grain and then hoeing around the stalk as it came up. ""Mr. Captain,"" we called him. Never did like change either. And I asked ""Mr. Captain"" what was the thing that bothered him most. He said, well, he thought the thing that bothered him most was women\'s styles. He said, when he was a young man, that women wore their dresses very carefully and that you couldn\'t even see their instep. Nowadays, the dresses don\'t even cover up their step-ins.\n', ""All of us are reluctant to make unnecessary changes, but there are some changes that I have to admit that I like and that happens to be one of them. This morning, I was particularly aware of how many things have changed since the first time that I came to Iowa to campaign. This is where my whole effort started. And I'm grateful to be back with you.\n"", ""I'll be speaking tomorrow at the State Fair, I'm sure with several thousand people there, about agriculture and farming. But I remember the first reception we had in Des Moines. We rented a very large hotel ballroom, and we had enough food for several hundred people. And four people came. So I stood around embarrassed for a little while, some of the hosts are here with me this afternoon. I walked over to the courthouse, as Tom Whitney suggested, to shake hands. But my campaign improved from there. We started off with nothing.\n"", 'I come from a little town—683 people. My wife and I and my children and a few volunteers began to go from one living room to another, and from one labor hall to another, and from one shopping center to another, and from one fanners\' market, livestock sales barn to another. And we made friends. Like many of you in this audience. And our campaign grew. And we got known. But it was hard, because in those early days, when I would get into a factory shift line, as I was this morning, I got up at 5:15 in Seattle to go to a Boeing plant. But at the first of the campaign, as the workers came by, I would shake hands with them, and I would say, ""I\'m Jimmy Carter, I\'ve been Governor of Georgia; I\'d like to have your vote; I\'m running for President,"" and by that time they would be almost out of sight. And they\'d stop, and they\'d come back, and they\'d say—President of what?\n', ""So, by that time, I'd lost fifty possible votes. But our campaign grew, and the major contributing factor to my own success was the confidence and the friendship and support that I got in the State of Iowa, and I will never forget it as long as I live. And I thank you for it.\n"", ""[With] Dick Clark and John Culver, Neal Smith and, in the future, our new Congressman from the Third District, we will have I believe the kind of change made in Washington that will benefit not just your own state but also benefit the country and perhaps the world. I think it's time to reassess where we are and face frankly some of our defects, some of our mistakes, some of our failures, some of the unanswered questions. We've had too long the absolute absence of leadership in the White House. We've seen walls built around Washington, and we feel like we can't quite get through to guarantee the people of this country a government that's sensitive to our needs that we can understand and control, that is competent, well managed, efficient, economical, purposeful. And also a government of which we can be proud.\n"", ""Now, a lot of people want to blame the Congress. I don't blame the Congress for it Because time after time after time, in the absence of leadership from the White House, the Congress—535 different people remember—has tried to come up, sometimes in a fumbling way, but always in a courageous way, with answers to questions about agriculture, education, housing, employment, inflation, [and] energy, without success. Because, every time, we've heard the word veto. President Ford has vetoed 53 bills in the last two years. Four times as many per year as Richard Nixon vetoed. And anybody that's four times as negative as Richard Nixon, I think he's stayed there too long.\n"", ""You've got a state in which I feel at home, because I am a farmer, because I believe in the basic commitment of American human beings to preserving the family structure, because I believe in communities that are stable and idealistic and self-governing, and because I believe that people ought to control their own government. And not the other way around. I believe that the government ought to be open, and that those locked doors ought to be broken down. These kinds of changes will accommodate your own inclinations, I know.\n"", ""And you have a Democratic Party here that, over almost insurmountable obstacles, has exerted your own strength without controlling the State House. You've built [it] from scratch. And you now have a superb delegation in Congress that's waiting for a good Democratic President with whom they can work, and you'll have that next January too.\n"", ""There's another thing that I think has changed. And that is the attitude of political analysts and, perhaps newspaper and other news media representatives, about our people's character. Too often, the people of this country have been underestimated. I remember back in 1960 a lot of people said that the South, being conservative, being basically Protestant, would never support a young, liberal Catholic Senator from Boston. But when the returns came in in November of 1960, John Kennedy got a bigger margin of victory in Georgia than he did in Massachusetts. I might add also that in 1928, we did not vote for Herbert Hoover, we voted for Al Smith in Georgia.\n"", ""So we've had a demonstration, I think, in the South, that the reputation for prejudice against someone from a region, or because of a religion, has been overestimated. The American people are better than politicians or leaders quite often recognize. And my own success this year has been a demonstration of that attitude, I believe.\n"", ""Well, I don't want to talk about the past. What I want to talk about just very briefly is the future.\n"", ""We've embarked already in the Democratic Party on a great crusade to register people to vote. This has been a problem throughout our history. To try to match together freedom and liberty on the one hand, and equality on the other. Almost invariably in other countries, down through the years, they were not compatible. When you had a lot of liberty and a lot of freedom, the powerful overran and overcame the rights of the weak. And then when you had equality guaranteed by the government, quite often it was accomplished, as in the Communist nations, by the abolition of freedom.\n"", ""Our country has struggled with this now for two hundred years. We've made a lot of progress. Our country was not perfect when it was formed. We look back on our early founders of our nation almost in a worshipful way. We think that Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington, and John Adams, and others couldn't make mistakes. But that's not exactly true. But it's because our country, when it was originally founded, was founded on the proposition that slavery was okay. It took us a hundred years almost to eliminate slavery. And women couldn't vote; young people couldn't vote. The people couldn't choose their own U.S. Senators. But we've changed those things as we've gone along. And now it's time to make a quantum jump into the future, and bind together as best we can, liberty, and independence, and individuality for our people with equality of opportunity in a fair, open, sensitive, and well managed government.\n"", ""[With] the President and the Congress cooperating with one another, and with the people being represented in every decision that's made, I believe we can do those things, and, if I'm elected President, I'll join with these leaders on this platform and others to bring that about.\n"", ""I want to say a few specific things. We've been hurt lately in our country, and embarrassed, and sometimes ashamed at what we've seen happen in our own government. The Vietnamese War, the invasion of Cambodia, the Watergate tragedy, the CIA revelations, have been an embarrassment to us. And we've said, what could have happened to the United States of America to bring about this circumstance among our leaders? I don't claim to be better than anyone else. I've got a lot to learn. I'm just like you all. I worked almost all my life at manual labor. My folks have been in Georgia two hundred years. Nobody in my daddy's family ever finished high school before me. I grew up on a farm during the depression years. We didn't have electricity or running water, but I had a good life. And I learned that government can be effective. I'm not afraid of government. It's not effective now— it's drifting. We don't have any long-range commitments or predictable policies in agriculture, or energy, or education, or environmental quality, transportation, even foreign affairs. That needs to be done. There's no way for government, industry, manufacturers, labor, agriculture, education, science, and other entities of our society to work together in harmony. We need to have a good agriculture policy. I'm going to talk about that tomorrow, I'll skip over it now.\n"", ""We also need to have a sunshine law passed in Washington to strip away the secrecy that now surrounds government And that's going to come. We're going to have a complete reorganization of the Executive Branch of government to make it efficient, economical, purposeful, and manageable for a change. If I'm elected, it's going to be done. And you can depend on that.\n"", ""We're going to have complete, comprehensive welfare reform. Now the American people are compassionate, and we want to take care of those who are not able to work. But I believe that anybody that's able to work ought to work.\n"", ""And this can only come about, in my opinion, [by having] a simple system. We now have two million welfare workers. We've only got three million adult welfare recipients. That's right. We've got almost a hundred different federal welfare programs in all categories. That system needs to be simplified. I believe the American people, including myself, the Senators and Congressmen on this platform, are intelligent enough to devise a fair, equitable, compassionate welfare system. To divide those who can work and the ones who can't, to educate and train those who are not employable now but can be, and to deal sensitively with those that are subject to being dependent on government.\n"", 'One of the phrases that I always remember that I used in my announcement speech on December of 1974, is a quote from a Chinese philosopher called Kuang Hsu, who lived almost two thousand years before Christ. And Kuang Hsu said, ""You give a man a fish, he has one meal. You teach a man how to fish, he can feed himself for life."" That ought to be the attitude of government.\n', ""There is one other specific thing I want to mention. And that is taxation. I think most Americans don't mind their taxes if we feel that the system is fair, and our neighbors who have the same valued property and who have the same basic income pay the same amount of taxes. I know I don't mind. I don't believe other people mind. But our present income tax system is a disgrace. It's got to be changed. Now the Congress has tried to struggle with this problem and with others, without any beneficial or helpful assistance from the White House. So far, the efforts have not been successful. Quite often, when we hear about tax reform, I kind of shrink up a little bit, because tax reform has meant in the past, quite often, that the special interest groups who are powerful, influential, have high paid lobbyists, good lawyers—in a tax reform bill, they benefit. But the average Americans get cheated. So we need a change in the whole basic structure of the income tax system. Not amendments, but a basic change.\n"", ""Now, I recognize the difficulty of these things. And a lot of people say, well, I've heard it before. I've heard about government reorganization. I've heard about welfare reform. I've heard about tax reform. I don't intend to break my promises to you. I've had a chance to meet with the leaders in the House and Senate, those who head the Democratic Caucuses, and those who head the committees. And I believe they share with me an overwhelming hope that the next administration, working harmoniously with the Congress, can make these long delayed changes come to pass.\n"", ""I believe that it's not only possible, but mandatory. And if I do have difficulty with special interest groups and others, I'm going to come to you for help and present my case to you, and I don't believe you'll let me down.\n"", ""The last thing I want to say is this. We've got a long way to go in this country. And it's not going to be easy. And no President can do it alone. And no 535 Members of Congress working with the President can do it alone. On election day, that's just the beginning of making these changes in our society. And, if there are things that you don't like in your own government, if there are questions that you have not yet found the answer to, if we've made mistakes that you don't want to see made again, or if there are hopes or dreams in your own lives or in the lives of your children that you'd like to see realized, or if there are things that you've learned in the small towns and farms and cities, Iowa and other places in the country, that you have admired, and you'd like to see repeated throughout this country, I hope that you'll join me in a personal commitment to change our government for the better. I see no reason why government should be confused and wasteful when the American people are not confused and don't waste. I see no reason why government should not be honest when the American people are honest. I see no reason why we should divide rural people from urban people, or young people from old people, or black people from white people, or different regions or races from one another, or religions. These divisions have sapped us of strength. And now is the time to correct it.\n"", ""Every now and then there comes along a special time, and this is it. We've suffered, yes. But we're celebrating our two hundredth birthday. It's a time for reassessment, to look back and see what we've done wrong, to encapsulate in our own minds the vision of our country, to bind ourselves together. The Democratic Party demonstrated, I believe, in Madison Square Garden, the most remarkable unity of purpose that I have ever seen in my life. It wasn't unity brought about by me as a candidate, or by Bob Strauss as the Democratic National Chairman. It was unity brought about by common concern, and a common interest, and a common willingness not to be personally selfish for awhile, but to make a small sacrifice for the common good of our nation. The Democrats have a strong position now in the polls—25 points ahead. It would be a serious mistake for us to take a victory for granted. The only fatal mistake that I can see that I could make would be to take a state or a voter for granted. I know how hard it is for the average American citizen in this time to fed proud and self-reliant and worthy. I want to make sure that I as a political leader never underestimate the worth of any human being. I'm not anybody's boss; I don't ever want to be. I want to be everybody's servant And I want to learn from you individually what you think this country ought to be.\n"", 'I\'m going to run a hard campaign. And as I said to the surprise of many people on my first trip to Des Moines, ""I don\'t intend to lose the nomination. I believe I can win on the first ballot."" A lot of people smiled, some laughed out loud. Well, I\'m going to make another prediction to you now. I don\'t intend to lose in November. I intend to be your next President. If you\'ll help me, I\'ll do it.']"
58,Jimmy Carter ,"August 24, 1976","['Q. You were talking recently that a President more attuned to Congress might possibly be able to get more out of Congress than one who is not, such as Gerald Ford. It might be more productive in a legislative way. Are you really talking about a Democratic President might get more out of a Democratic Congress?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes. I think a major portion of the problem has been that the attitude of the Presidents we've had has not been conducive to cooperation with the Congress. I think we could have had Republican Presidents who would have much more consistently cooperated with congressional leaders. I believe that Presidents Nixon and Ford both have perhaps deliberately severed the normal relationships with Congress in the initial stages of preparation of major policies on domestic or foreign affairs. And this is something that I have found as a governor to be very serious as a problem. My own inclination has always been when I had a major proposal to put forward, in the initial, embryonic stages of that proposal to work it out as best I could with the congressional or legislative leaders.\n"", ""Q. Are you really saying though that the difference between yourself and Gerald Ford or Richard Nixon is that you are a Democrat and you'd be able to work better for that reason?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think that's a part of the problem. But I remember when President Truman, for instance, was in office, on foreign affairs he had a very strong Secretary of State. But there was a general feeling around the country, that I think was accurate, that there was strong bi-partisan support within the Congress. And as you know, this revolved around Senator Vandenberg on the Republican side, Senator George on the opposite side. So, I believe, obviously, that having a Democrat in the White House and a Democrat Congress is obviously a helpful circumstance, but it's not the only factor.\n"", ""Q. I'd like to come to that in just a moment. First of all, you yourself have said that the public holds Congress in a low esteem. How do you account for that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Individual members of Congress are held in very high esteem within their own districts, or their own states. Congress as a body suffers in public opinion polls, where I delivered my opinion, because there is no clear voice to defend congressional action. In recent months, with the total absence of leadership in the White House, there's been a constant disharmony or squabbling between the President and the Congress. The President can speak with one single voice. He can explain his position, whether it's right or wrong, and the American people hear it There's not one person in the Congress of 535 members who can express a viewpoint on an argument clearly. So I think this makes Congress look inherently worse in the minds of the public when there is a disagreement or lack of cooperation between the White House and Congress.\n"", ""Historically, when the Congress' reputation has been high in the public opinion polls, it's been during those eras when there's been a maximum amount of cooperation between the White House and Congress.\n"", ""Q. Would you also add that it's been during those eras when there's been strong leadership in Congress, assertive leadership?\n"", ""Governor Carter. That was the case, notably, when Eisenhower was in the White House, a relatively dormant President, and of course you had a remarkable and unprecedented cooperation between Lyndon Johnson in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House. They were compatible with one another. So I think that's a circumstance that's very rare on the American political scene. Our founding fathers had never thought that Congress would lead this nation. Congress is inherently incapable of unified leadership. That leadership has got to come from the White House. And in the absence of that leadership, the country drifts. That's what it's been doing lately. I think that when Congress has come up in recent months with proposals, sometimes faulty, sometimes fumbling, but sincere, to deal with problems like unemployment or inflation, or housing or education, or jobs, or energy; with the total absence of leadership in the White House, they've done a very good job. But if they had cooperation from the White House, which we will have next year if I'm elected, then I think these problems can be resolved and that difficult questions can be answered.\n"", 'Q. Another reason that’s been offered for the poor standing in the public opinion polls is weak leadership on the part of the President and congressional leaders. Do you agree with that and do you think the Congress needs stronger leadership?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I don't agree with that. The attitude of modem politicians, whether they're in governors' offices or state legislatures, or in Congress, is that they don't want to be dominated by other political figures because of seniority or even because of position. And I think the innovative attitude of the new Members of Congress that have come along in recent years, over several election periods, is going to continue. And I think that they never want to go back to a strong, dominant Speaker of the House or strong, dominant committee chairpersons, who wouldn't let the individual members have a major role. But I really believe, I believe this is objective and not just subjective, is that the Congress is looking for strong leadership in the White House to make major comprehensive proposals on welfare reform, tax reform, health care, government reorganization, and so forth, and then let the Congress in its legitimate constitutional authority dispose of those proposals as it sees fit, working harmoniously with the White House. But the leadership has got to come from the White House. That's historically been the situation in our country. I don't believe that the Congressional members want to go back to the kind of leadership in the Congress that can dominate them and subjugate individual members even though they might be relatively junior, as far as seniority goes.\n"", ""Q. How do you specifically answer President Ford's charge in his acceptance speech and elsewhere that the Democratic majority has been vote hungry, free spending, and that his 55 vetoes to that date have been of extravagant and unwarranted legislation and that saved the taxpayers billions and billions of dollars, as he said.\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's ridiculous. Under Nixon, who was a relatively strong President, the Congress cut back his budgets $20 billion. Ford has made no substantive proposals that I remember at all in dealing with acknowledged problems in the country. And in the absence of any leadership at all in the White House, the Congress has tried to move. Under Nixon and Ford, we've had an average of more than $24 billion in deficits every year. Under Johnson and Kennedy, when we had a Democratic Congress there too, the average deficit was less than $4 billion a year. So with gross mismanagement based on an erroneous emphasis on tight constraint on the economy, let unemployment go where it will, we've cut down drastically the revenues for the federal government. I think that's a major origin of our very serious deficits under the Republican Administration. So they've had a combination of inadequate attention to problems, very high inflation, very high unemployment, extremely high deficits, and there's no way legitimately that Ford or Nixon can shift that responsibility to the Congress. Other than that, I think his statement was accurate.\n"", 'Q. I gather that you are aiming for a balanced budget at some point.\n', 'Governor Carter. Exactly.\n', 'Q. Do you have any idea how, when that might come about?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've tried to be very conservative and assess different opinions that I get from my economic advisers, and I would say that before I finish my term, in the year 1980, we will have a balanced budget. And that's based on relatively careful projections of unemployment, inflation, and average increase in our gross national product per year. It also, by the way, meets every commitment that I have made to the American people on services to\n"", ""Q. What I was speaking of was one of your first official contacts with Congress will be the fiscal '78 budget. How much impact do you expect to have on that, and what is your timetable for developing that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. When I'm inaugurated, if I'm elected, I'll be prepared to make my recommendations to the Congress on modifications or proposals in the fiscal year '78 budget.\n"", 'Q. Do you have a specific timetable for developing that?\n', ""Governor Carter. We are now working oh that approach. My staff members have contacted budget leaders in the House and Senate, and we're trying to assess the expected amount of revenue to be coining into the federal treasury over the entire four year period. To begin with a balanced budget, at the timetable that I have described to you, work back from that year by year, to establish priorities, to eliminate unnecessary programs, and this would be done very early after I'm inaugurated, if I'm elected.\n"", 'Q. Do you have any specific ideas of how large the fiscal 1978 deficit might be?\n', 'Governor Carter. Not yet.\n', 'Q. Another of your first contacts with Congress would be your State of the Union message. Will the thrust of that message be toward enacting new programs, a new legislative package, or enlarging the existing programs, or will it be to cut back or reform existing programs?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't say. I don't know yet. It will be quite awhile before I start working on my State of the Union message.\n"", ""Q. That's fair enough. You've indicated elsewhere that you thought you could do better, could have done better with your personal relationships with some of the Georgia State Legislature leaders. What did you learn from that experience with the legislature that you believe you can transfer to Congress and how do you think your personal relationship will develop with the congressional leaders?\n"", ""Governor Carter. When I was elected governor, I had very little support during the campaign from legislative leaders. I think we had over 250 total membership, and over 15 [sic] of them had endorsed my opponents. So I had to start from scratch. But I had a heavy mandate from the Georgia people. And I emphasized those commitments on government reorganization, tax reform, prison reform, mental health programs, judicial reform, and so forth to the Georgia people during the campaign. The legislative leaders accepted that mandate and although we did have a very innovative, aggressive, and I think successful, administration, my relationships with the legislature were compatible. There were people who opposed everything I did all during the four year period, because of political reasons and otherwise. But there was nothing that I accomplished in the four year period that didn't have to be confirmed and supported by a joint, working relationship with the legislature. The fact that Lester Maddox was the Lieutenant Governor overly emphasized in the public's mind the disharmonies. In general, the major changes were made with complete cooperation between me and the legislature.\n"", 'Q. You also gained the reputation in Georgia as being a person who would carry through on your legislative proposals with complete vigor?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I would.\n', ""Q. And friends and critics of yours both characterize you as a stubborn person in some ways. You seem certain to run into some obstacles as you try to get some of the programs you've been talking about through Congress and all the conflicting interests that are in Congress. Just how tough are you prepared to be with Congress when you run into obstacles?\n"", ""Governor Carter. One of the things that I obviously learned while I was in the governor's office, working with the legislature, it was a very, very independent legislature, by the way, was that the best way to avoid confrontations and showdown votes and the necessity for major compromises, is to work with the members of the Legislative Branch in the initial stages of the preparation of major proposals, as I said earlier. Also, to remind the members of the Legislative Branch that, to the extent that my election was successful, the American people join me in those commitments. Also, during the campaign period itself, which is approaching now, I'll be helping, and being helped by, many of the candidates for Congress. The other point that I should make is this. We must be sure that when a proposal is made for a change in our domestic or foreign governmental life, that that proposal can be justified in an open debate, and the stripping away of secrecy that in the past has concealed the selfish influence of special interest groups I consider to be a major factor in the passage of both substantive and advisable legislation. Now, if after all those emphases are consummated and my voice to the American people is heard clearly, if we have a difference of opinion in the Congress that I consider to be important, I would never hesitate to go directly to the American people with my side of the debate, and through that mechanism hope to influence the Congress to accept my position. And I believe that if I'm right, if the position is clear enough to be understood by the American people, that's the best approach to it. But that would only be a last resort after I've exhausted every other means to cooperate quietly and maturely with the members of Congress. '\n"", ""Q. You apparently believe then Lyndon Johnson's advice that Congress should be in on the takeoff if they're going to be in on the landing ...\n"", ""Governor Carter. Absolutely. And I believe we need to have one other factor implemented for a change. And that is to let the Congress, Members, leaders or otherwise, get maximum credit for any improvements that are brought into being. The President is naturally the focus of public attention. There's no way to take away the image of the President as a leader. And I believe it's very helpful to the President himself and to the country to let individual Members of Congress be the ones to announce in their own districts and states as early as possible their support for programs that might be in the process of evolution. I would do this to the maximum degree possible.\n"", 'Q. Do you have any preference as to who will become the next leaders of the 95th Congress?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Who are they?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would never let anyone know what my preferences are.\n', 'Q, But you do have preferences?\n', ""Governor Carter. To some degree. This is something that I will never become involved in. I have private thoughts about it, but I'm perfectly willing to abide by the decisions of the Members of Congress. I'll never ask a Member of Congress to vote for one person or another as the new congressional leaders are chosen.\n"", ""Q. Could you characterize the kinds of persons you'd like to see?\n"", 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. A lot of people on Capitol Hill are certain that you are going to be the next President, and I understand a lot of Members are calling your faff offering help.\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, that's true.\n"", 'Q. Would you say your honeymoon with Congress has already begun?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think so. I would like to hope that my so-called honeymoon with Congress could extend throughout my term. I know from experience that there will be heavy concentration toward the end of the term on the more controversial proposals. Because the ones where there is little controversy are naturally more likely to pass very early. But I would be tenacious, and I would be open in my evocations to the American people of my proposals, and I think that if I retain my respect for Congress, which is a natural part of my being, and express this respect and desire for mutual consultation, that the honeymoon period can be extended for quite a long time.\n', 'Q. Who are you turning to during this period for your advice about Congress?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, of course, the Georgia delegation would naturally be close to me. I've known them all my political life and the existing leaden of Congress, Senator Mansfield, of course, and Robert Byrd in the Senate, and the Speaker, and Tip O'Neill in the House. Some of the committee chairmen have offered their help to me, and I have accepted it with gratitude. But I've not tried to go into the congressional area and single out special persons. I've tried to accept advice from all of them. And if they have a committee staff member, for instance, who's particularly knowledgeable about welfare, or energy, or transportation, I've enmeshed their contribution with that of my own issues analysis staff as best I could. Whether I get elected or not, this is very helpful to me in putting forth to the American people for better understanding the stands on issues that are important to this country.\n"", 'Q. Do you feel that you have any effect on legislation at this point, already?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I haven't tried to. I think that to the extent that I have presented my views to the American people in recent months that there has been an effect, but I've never tried to call up individual members of the House or Senate to influence their vote on legislation. I don't think it's proper for me to act like I'm already President.\n"", ""The one exception has been the voting registration bill. I personally favor universal voter registration without any obstacle at all to somebody becoming registered. But I know it's late, and this is a subject on which I've spoken out quite at length, but with the one exception, there has been no involvement on how the legislation should be voted on.\n"", 'Q. You have, however, passed the word that you would prefer to see a delay in the building of the B-l Bomber?\n', ""Governor Carter. I haven't passed any word to Members of Congress except through my own public statements.\n"", ""Q. Different Presidents have handled their contacts, their regular contacts with Congress in different ways. Woodrow Wilson used an emissary, the Postmaster General, Albert Burleson. Truman had a liaison staff, a fairly small staff, but he preferred to deal face to face with people. And I guess Eisenhower was the first one who established an extensive liaison office. How do you—and then there was the Kennedy-Johnson highly organized, aggressive liaison staff under Lawrence O'Brien. How do you see your liaison?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would like to have a combination of the Kennedy, Johnson and Eisenhower effort, plus much more personal participation of my own. I understand there's a room, for instance, in the national Capitol that's set aside as the President's room. And I would like to go there for the signing of major legislation which was the custom prior to Franklin Roosevelt's term. And my present thinking, which I have not firmed yet, would be for me to go to the Capitol every now and then to spend a day or half-day in that office, within the Capitol itself, and to make myself more accessible to individual Members of Congress. So I don't want to try to dominate the Congress, or to have an undue influence, but I want them to know that we represent the same people. There's no one in any congressional district in the nation that won't be my constituent if I become President. And I want that general sense of cooperation and mutual respect and mutual trust to pervade my whole attitude toward Congress throughout the four years. So I think just personal moves on my part—treating Congress, Members as though they were Presidents themselves, returning their telephone calls, letting my staff members respect them thoroughly, dealing with the problems that they present to me, making my own presence felt in the Capitol building itself on occasion, would be contributions that might alleviate the present disharmony and total separation of the White House on the one hand and the Congress on the other.\n"", ""Q. I guess we're running out of time. One of the main things that the White House liaison staff does, or one of the major causes of their workload, and also the liaison agent in the agencies, each of the departments has a fairly sizeable legislative liaison office, most of their workload consists of doing favors for Members of Congress. Do you see any reason to cut back on Congressional liaison staffs and any reason to cut back on the amount of, you'll pardon the expression, back-scratching that goes on?\n"", ""Governor Carter. The thing I would say in response to that is to repeat what I just said, that the constituents of the Congressman or Congresswoman will also be my constituents. And I want to do a good job for them. I also want to be sure that whenever any action is taken in that respect that the action be of such a nature that it can be made known to the public. I would prohibit any interference on the part of White House staff members in the deliberations of judicial affairs, or regulatory agency deliberations for any particular person. I think those kind of deliberations ought to be all open, they ought to be subject to scrutiny by the press and by the public. So with that one caveat, I would certainly do everything I could to meet the needs of my constituents and the constituents of Congress' Members.""]"

There's a wall that's gone up around Washington between our people and our government. There's a wall that's gone up between the White House and the Congress. There's a wall that's gone up between the regions of this country. There's a wall that's gone up between us and the standards that made us a great nation.\n"", 'I want to tear those walls down. And one I want to talk about today is the wall that separates the producers of foods and fiber from the other consumers in this country—a wall that has been built by Earl Butz and his Department of Agriculture.\n', 'Our people are proud of the American farmers and ranchers. In all the history of our nation, there has been no more dramatic success story than the story of the American farm family. Every person working full-time on a farm now provides the food for about 100 other people, both in this country and abroad.\n', 'Our people respect the American farmer. The family farm has preserved the values—honesty, dependability, hard work and faith—which we need to rediscover as a nation.\n', 'Our city people are natural partners with those of us in rural America. What is best for the family farmer in the long run is exactly what is best for the consumer.\n', 'But in the last eight years, this partnership has been almost destroyed. We have seen conflict where there should be cooperation. The independent producers of America do not want that. The people of America do not want it Our customers overseas do not want it\n', ""I say it's time to take down the wall. It's time to put our partnership back together—one that will enable the farmer and the rancher to make a decent living—especially the family farmer who is the most efficient producer—and ensure the consumer an adequate supply of food and fiber at a reasonable price. We can do both if we have national leadership dedicated to the best interests of all the people.\n"", ""Nobody who's spent as much time on a farm as I have wants the government to manage our farms.\n"", 'Rural families are just looking for an even break.\n', ""That's not much to ask. But it is a lot more than we have been getting these last eight years.\n"", ""It's not my idea of a fair shake when the government encourages all-out production, and then offers the farmer no protection at all against the surpluses his efficiency creates.\n"", ""It's not my idea of a fair shake when the government promotes foreign sales, and then cuts them off for political convenience. Four major embargoes in three years is a record of unparalleled incompetence—and we have really paid the price.\n"", ""It's not my idea of a fair shake when inside speculators with special connections in the Agriculture Department, make windfall profits on grain deals while the producer himself sells at a loss.\n"", ""It's not my idea of a fair shake for the farmers to sell clean grain, and then to see chaff and dirt and rubble added to a shipment, and have a crooked inspector approve it for shipment overseas.\n"", 'It\'s not my idea of a fair shake to have a one-sided market. You know what that means. When prices go down, the ""free market"" means hands off for the family farm. But when prices go up, the Republicans are the first to slap on controls and export embargoes. Their kind of free market means the lowest parity level in decades.\n', 'That kind of market means farm families are going bankrupt trying to produce food that consumers are going broke trying to buy.\n', ""It's not a free market. It's not a partnership. And it's not what we're going to have any more, if we all work together this fall.\n"", ""On the farm, we're all brought up to speak kind words, even of those who have harmed us. And the kindest words you can say about the present Agriculture Department is that it's been true to its own views.\n"", 'Congress tried to give them a chance by setting milk support at 85 percent of parity. But President Ford vetoed that bill.\n', 'Congress tried to give them a chance by sharing conservation costs. But President Ford vetoed that bill.\n', 'The Democratic Congresses of years gone by have tried to give them a chance, with rural electrification which made such a difference in my own youth in Georgia, and with other programs, such as the Farm Storage and Direct Loan program. But the Secretary of Agriculture has tried to kill those programs. He has only been held back by the federal courts.\n', 'What our farmers and ranchers want is simple. We want a stable and dependable farm program. Final decisions on the farm must often be made 15 to 30 months in advance. Those decisions become little more than desperate gambles, which fewer and fewer young people are willing to take, when we cannot understand or predict basic agriculture policy in Washington.\n', 'We want a system of handling carryover stocks which will give our own consumers adequate supplies of food and yet keep control of a good portion of those stocks in the hands of farmers—to prevent dumping to artificially lower farm prices.\n', 'We need to take agricultural leadership in Washington out of the hands of the corporate interests and the grain speculators. We need a President and a Secretary of Agriculture who understand the problems of the family farmer and the American consumer—and if I am elected, we are going to have both.\n', 'We need to close the revolving door between the Agriculture Department and the large special interests. Under its present leadership, six of the very top assistants have swung in and out of the Department, from large trading companies and speculative firms.\n', 'We need to guarantee a decent price for the farmer and a reasonable price for the consumer. Net farm income went down by one-fourth between 1973 and 1975. The costs of production have risen much faster than the prices you can get. Support levels are unreasonably low.\n', 'If I am elected, we will make sure that our support prices are at least equal to the cost of production. That will not guarantee a profit—no real farmer wants that—but it will give the determined farmer a chance to stay in business.\n', 'Our new farm policy will also help us develop a stable and healthy export market. Our vast acres of agricultural land are not only a great natural resource for us, but also for the entire world. Last year our sales to Japan, to Europe, and to our other customers overseas brought more than $22 billion in foreign exchange.\n', 'Agricultural international trade is the gas and oil for the United States. We export the produce of about one out of every three of our acres—60 percent of our wheat—50 percent of rice and soybeans—and 25 percent of our corn.\n', ""Our foreign customers know that we produce the best food in the world. They know we can meet competitive world prices. They know we are the world's last dependable granary. But they've started to think we're undependable—not because of our farmers, but because of our Republican Administration. Every time Nixon, Ford, and Butz have imposed a new export embargo, it has caused permanent damage to foreign markets for farm products. Every time they delay tough and honest grain inspection, the damage is multiplied.\n"", ""It shouldn't be that way. With new leadership in the Agriculture Department, with a new and stable farm policy, we can win back our reputation as a dependable supplier.\n"", 'Farmers are the first and foremost environmentalists. We have to use the same resources, and the same land, over and over again. One of the greatest tragedies of the last eight years is the way the administration has cut back on farm conservation efforts. As a companion to building production and stable prices, we must also have conservation programs to build back the land.\n', ""We are going to take the family farmer off the public enemy list I haven't met a small farmer who wants to be on welfare or guaranteed a profit without work, but we should take away his chains. The general public must understand the farmer's problems. The average family farm represents an investment of $300,000 in land and equipment—much of it on credit, of course. If the farmer could invest all that money in the bank, it would earn at least $15,000 in interest every year. In farming, after the entire family works all year, they earn about $10,000 or $12,000—3 percent or 4 percent a year on this investment.\n"", 'We need a true and continuing partnership between consumers, producers of food and fiber, and our own government.\n', 'Estate taxes on the average lifetime investment of our farm families will come to $65,000—far more than they can afford. If I am elected, we will reduce the estate tax burden, and base the estate tax value of the land on its use for agriculture, rather than its potential value for commercial subdivision.\n', 'Those of us who have spent many years on the farm know the price that an indifferent or incompetent government can make us pay. During the Hoover depression, which happened to be the time I was growing up on the farm, the amount of labor expended for any sort of cash return was almost unbelievable. In 1933 peanuts sold for as little as one cent per pound. A farmer with all manual labor and using a mule and mule-drawn equipment would break an acre of land, harrow at least twice, plow up the peanuts, shake each vine manually, and then place them on a stack pole, let them cure for eight to ten weeks, haul the stack poles to the threshing machine, separate the peanuts from the vine, and carry his entire crop to market.\n', ""In those days, the average yield was 700 pounds, which gave a gross return for all the year's work of only $7 an acre.\n"", ""The farm is the place where we still believe in a day's work for a day's pay. We fanners don't like to be paid not to produce. But when we do produce, we want to be paid a fair price. And we will be, if you join me in this new partnership.\n"", 'The farm has left its mark on me. I believe in my country, and I know you do too. I have deep feelings of patriotism. I know they are mirrored here in Iowa, and everywhere else where independent farmers work the land.\n', 'I believe in hard work. I believe that the best government is the one closest to the people.\n', 'And I believe in a closeknit family.\n', 'These things have got to be preserved. They are the values that have lived on the farm and which our government needs to rediscover. They are the values I will carry with me into the White House, if I am elected.\n', ""I want to improve the quality of life of our rural people. I live on the outskirts of a little town of only 683 people. I don't care if 100 years from now it still has less than 1,000 population. But it's important to me that my children and your children have as good an education and as high an income, and the same right to shape their own destiny as children who live in the largest or wealthiest community in our nation.\n"", ""We have a long way to go. We can restore the precious things we've lost, the things which remain strong in rural America. Then all of us can be sure again that we still live in the greatest country on earth.""]"
60,Jimmy Carter ,"August 26, 1976","['Q. Governor, yesterday when you spoke at the Iowa State Fair you said very clearly that you would go to Washington and end embargoes once and for all.\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, that's right.\n"", ""Q. I had the feeling that because it was in your prepared remarks it wasn't something you got carried away with. Then later on in an interview with a reporter from one of the Des Moines papers, you said that your words were too strong and went too far. Now would you clarify that— would you have embargoes or would you not?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, what the reporter asked me was that if we had a terrible drought or catastrophe and we did not have enough food in this country to eat, would I still ship grain overseas under those circumstances? And I told him no, of course I wouldn't do that, not if it would create hunger in our own nation, but that I analyzed every one of the four embargoes that Presidents Nixon and Ford had imposed, and I would not have imposed any of those four embargoes. Obviously, there are some circumstances where if we had a complete failure of our com or wheat or soybeans we'd have to restrict exports, but I pointed out to the reporters for the Des Moines newspaper that we have an export rate of 60 percent on wheat We would have to come down below a 60 percent reserve or crop harvest before that would be considered. So it would be an extremely unlikely thing; but in the case of an extreme emergency, of course, anybody in his right mind would not rob our own people of food and create hunger in this country to sell food overseas.\n"", 'Q. Governor, during the primary season your Democratic opponents, and some Republicans, as well, accused you of being fuzzy on the issues, saying things that a particular audience wanted to hear, being misleading on certain issues. Would you feel that what you said to that crowd yesterday without any qualification was misleading?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I don't think so. I don't believe there's any farmer in the United States that would want or expect any leader to create a direct hunger in this country with a total crop failure and still ship food overseas. We've never faced that prospect in my lifetime, and as I said, it would be a catastrophe of an almost unimaginable degree before that would be necessary.\n"", 'Q. Governor, could I follow up on that?\n', 'Governor Carter. Mease do.\n', 'Q. Can you reconcile the fact that in your prepared text you made a statement, and within a matter of an hour you were saying the statement you made was too strong. You were speaking to a limited audience the second time, and for a nationwide audience the first time?\n', 'Governor Carter. Had you been there, Don, and heard the question or the supposition that was put to me under that premise that I just described to you, there would be no way to continue to share full supplies of grain overseas. But I pointed out as I said earlier to the Des Moines newspapers that we would have to have more than a 60 percent reduction in our total wheat reserves and production before that would be necessary, and it would be an almost inconceivable circumstance.\n', 'Q. President Ford said at the convention that he would no longer impose an embargo unless there was a true national emergency. Do you see eye to eye on that?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think that in the last 3 years when the embargoes have been imposed, Mr. Butz and his bosses, either Nixon or Ford, have agreed that there was an emergency. As I told the Des Moines Register newspaper reporters yesterday, who are strongly, by the way, opposed to any embargoes, under none of those four circumstances would I have imposed an embargo. So the measurements that have been applied in the past to the Republican Administrations on whether or not an emergency existed, I would not have assumed that they were emergencies severe enough to create an embargo.']"
61,Jimmy Carter ,"August 30, 1976","['...Whenever a government prescribed freedom as a basic premise, inevitably the strong overcame the weak. And whenever a government ruled that equality of opportunity was a part of a societal life structure, it had to do it by domineering and taking away the freedom of people to strive to better themselves. A fumbling, struggling—often mistaken—progress. And I think we are getting closer and closer to the proposition that people can be free and also have a chance for equality. If we do it, and I believe we can, it will be the first time in recorded history.\n', 'I was elected to the Georgia Senate, my first elective office, in 1962. That was the year the Voters Education Project was organized—1962. One of the first bills on which I had to vote—from a very conservative deep southwest Georgia county—was to eliminate the notorious ""thirty questions"" that decided whether or not a Georgian could vote. A white person was given a test on moral character and, of course, very seldom failed. But a black person who came to the same voter registrar was asked 30 questions. And no one in this room could have answered those questions.\n', 'And I remember getting up at the Georgia Senate—afraid of the consequences back home—to make a speech for the elimination of tfiat obstacle to the right to vote. And one of my opponents in the debate got up and said, ""So many of these people who want to vote are ignorant How do they know which is the best candidate in the local elections?"" And my response was that a black man sitting on the curb outside of the Americus, Georgia, Sumter County Courthouse, could perhaps have been pushed off by the local sheriff, would be better able to judge who would be a better sheriff than two college professors at Georgia Southwestern College.\n', ""We still haven't made enough progress. It is true that in 1962 there were no black legislators in the South. Now there are 95. And even 10 years ago, in 1966, there were 200 black elected officials in the South. Now, there are 2,000. But that has not yet been the realization of our citizens' hopes and dreams nor a demonstration of the correction of years and decades and generations of racial discrimination. We've got a long way to go and it can't be done with a dormant, acquiescent acceptance of a change in the law. It's got to be done with an aggressive, fervent commitment through corrective action, through recruitment, through active registration, through education, through welcoming, to get people who have been excluded from the political process to be part of our nation's life. Too often decisions are made by those who are powerful, and educated, and rich, and influential, and articulate, and socially prominent. And even when their hearts are in the right place, and they really want to do a good job of dealing fairly with people, they can't understand the special problems of those who are rural, uneducated, who have some physical or mental defect, who are old, who happen to be black, who can't speak English well, who are timid and inarticulate and who don't know even what their rights might be.\n"", ""So we'll never have justice in this country, which we all would like to see, until we have full participation in the political processes for all our people— rich and poor, educated and ignorant, powerful and weak, articulate and timid. That's a challenge for us. Everyone in this room, without exception, can understand what's best for us. If we're wrong, we speak out. We know where to go. We vote regularly. We had no trouble registering to vote.\n"", ""But there are many who look to us for leadership, who don't yet see a realization of the promise that exists in the heart and mind of our people. I think the nation's consciousness has been stirred by some of the great leaders that have been chosen in this country in die electoral process.\n"", ""Here in the Fifth District, where we are now, with Congressman Andrew Young. In the last election, Harold Ford in Memphis, Tennessee. And Barbara Jordan from Texas, and many others. Mayors, county commissioners, sheriffs. Obviously we've made some progress. And it's given us a new lease on life. We're very proud of it.\n"", ""But we ought not to be satisfied. I might point out that this is not just a black, southern Democratic type of project. There are many people throughout the country who still feel the exclusion that's either deliberate or accepted. We've got 4 million Spanish-speaking Americans who've never registered to vote. And they've seen the high publicity that has accrued to black leaders, civil rights acts; they feel left out. There are many other white ethnic groups who in the past have not felt they were part of our nation's political process. We ought not to be satisfied just to see the great changes made in the South because of these courageous leaders who preceded most of us and who had courage that we sometimes lacked.\n"", ""We look at other countries to see how they vote. In the Communist countries, 100 percent—of course they've only got one candidate for whom to vote. But in West Germany, in the last election, 1972, a free society, 91 percent of all the eligible voters went to the polls. In France, 88 percent; Italy, 80 percent; Great Britain, 80 percent.\n"", ""In our country, in 1876, 80 percent of those who were legally entitled to vote were registered and voted. But then along came a series of registration laws to determine the qualifications of someone who wanted to have a part in shaping one's own government, and having a part in determining one's own future life and the destiny of one's own child. In 1920 this started— state registration laws. And we've dropped from 80 percent to 48 percent. And now, of all those eligible to vote, of all those eligible to even be registered to vote, only 47 percent are registered.\n"", ""I sensed this when I campaigned in 1970 for governor. My wife and I shook hands with about 600,000 Georgians. More than half the total number who actually ever vote. And toward the end of the campaign, after all those handshakes, it became easy for me as I grasped someone's hand and looked in their eyes, to decide whether they were going to vote for me or not. And if I knew they would not, there were options; they were either going to vote for my opponent, or they were not registered to vote.\n"", 'After I was elected with the help of a lot of high school students—even grammar school students, college students—it became obvious to me that Georgia, who had given 18 year-olds voting rights in 1945, had deliberately excluded young people from the registration process.\n', 'So I asked two high school students to travel around Georgia in a quiet and unpublicized way. Now they went to voter registration offices to find out what hours the registrars were available to perform their duties. In several counties the registrars office was opened 1 hour per week. One hour per week. So we passed a law in Georgia, one of the first that was passed after I became governor, deputizing as voter registration officers every high school principal in the state. And now we are just going through our fifth year when young people who reach the age of 17/a years old are registered to vote in the classroom.\n', ""I've worked since 1974 when I was the National Chairman of the Democratic Party Campaign Committee for the whole country, to get postcard registration. Texas, a very conservative state, has had it for 25 years. And it's still bogged down in the Congress with the constant threat of a Presidential veto and it won't pass this year. A lot of people say it's too complicated, a lot of people say it costs too much. A lot of people say it's just not practical.\n"", ""When I came here for the first VEP banquet, I made a brief speech. Nobody paid much attention to it But for the first time I called for universal voter registration, in May of 1974. In December of 1974 I announced that I was candidate for President of the United States. And I made a fairly brief speech to the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. and one of the things I called for was universal voter registration. Last month, I made an acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Madison Square Garden, and one of the things that was right in the heart of my speech was a call for universal voter registration. If I'm elected President, I want to put John Lewis out of business.\n"", 'I\'ve talked to a lot of Members of Congress who have been adamant in their opposition to postcard registration. And they have told me, ""Governor, if we can just pass a law next year that eliminates the red tape, eliminates the cost, eliminates a new bureaucracy, and gets people registered to vote, FH support it."" So one of the commitments I make to you is that whether I\'m elected or not I\'m going to work hard to see that we have a bill passed in Washington, a very simple bill, that says when somebody is 18 years old and a citizen of the United States, that they\'re registered to vote.\n', 'I believe that this single, simple law which could be written in one paragraph could almost transform in a beneficial way the politics of our country. And the goal for which Martin Luther King, Jr., gave his life. And the goal for which Andy Young and John Lewis were beaten and imprisoned, which is often ignored, still many years later, can be realized. I see no reason why a citizen of our country should have to go through a legal process to be given a chance to vote. And I believe this is something we can set for ourselves. In the meantime, let\'s all join John Lewis and others and give our people a chance to answer a question that they began to ask 15 or 20 years ago— ""Would you please let me vote.""']"
62,Jimmy Carter ,"August 30, 1976","['Tom Brokaw. Traditionally in this country the Presidential campaigns begin next week, after Labor Day, but as we all know there has been some preliminary sparring between President Ford, the Republican nominee, and Jimmy Carter, the Democratic nominee. Mr. Carter will be making a series of campaign appearances this week. And this morning he is in Plains, Georgia, in the NBC studios there, which are not exactly weatherproof; they re in a field outside of Plains.\n', ""Mr. Carter, welcome, first of all, we're delighted to have you.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Good morning, Tom, I'm glad to be with you.\n"", ""Brokaw. Thank you. Well, the summer games are over now, the conventions are finished, there'll be a little time for softball there in Plains, and already we're beginning to see the campaign take shape. Right after the GOP convention your lead in the polls dropped 13 points; in your first appearance in the farm belt after the convention you were forced to revise a major policy statement; this all suggests, it seems to me, some shifting moods of the country. Do you expect this to be a close election?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes; I've always thought it would be close. I think immediately after the Democratic Convention when we showed a tremendous unity there, I think my rating in the polls went up to about 62 percent and then, immediately after the Republican Convention, I think President Ford's went up to 39 percent. The jump was expected, but we have always thought it would be a very tough, very hard fought campaign, and we're prepared to start, as you said, next week, campaigning.\n"", 'Q. One of the trademarks of your campaigning during the primaries, of course, was your absolute confidence that you would win the nomination. Do you have that same confidence now about the election?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I think we'll win. We have divided up the nation among myself and Senator Mondale and our families, and I think we'll cover it essentially as well as we can. We have a good organization; I think we have the issues on our side, and we have a unified Democratic Party, and I believe that we have a good chance to win.\n"", 'Q. Is there anytime that you wake up during the night and wonder about something that may happen? What worries you most of all?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't ordinarily wake up in the middle of the night and worry, I sleep well and never had any problem with that confidence during the primary season, even when nobody thought I had a chance. We make our plans very carefully, very methodically and I hope very thoroughly, and I think I've been through enough campaigning during the last 2 years to be very specific about where I stand and to make sure that we have a proper relationship with voters themselves. I never depended on powerful, bigshot political figures to put me in office. I've always stayed in factory shift lines and state fairs and up and down the streets, and in stores and shopping centers, and I think that's the best approach this fall, so with that kind of background, closeness to the people, issues on the right side, good campaign techniques and a good strong family, good running mate, good organization, I don't wake up in the middle of the night and worry.\n"", 'Q. And a fairly expensive advertising campaign as well.\n', ""Governor Carter. That's right, we'll both be very careful about spending money and, of course, I have somewhat of a disadvantage in running against the President, because I think in the primary season a lot of the times the Cabinet members and others would make a long trip, charge a tiny portion of that trip to the campaign, charge a lot of it to the taxpayers, and make speeches and so forth on Mr. Ford's behalf. But I think in the general election it'll be watched much more closely, and the roughly $21, $22 million each one of us has to spend will have to be very carefully budgeted. This is probably less than one-third what President Nixon spent in 1972, so there won't be any money to waste, and roughly half of what we have in all—almost half—will go for advertising.\n"", ""Q. Mr. Carter, the polls show that you're most secure in the South, that once you get out of the South it's pretty much a dead heat as a horserace between you and President Ford; the President's strategists have made it clear that they expect to run strongest in that tier of states between New Jersey and the farm belt, and then they pick out some western states as well, including California of course. Do you expect that to be the most intense battleground, say from New Jersey to Indiana, Ohio and then into the farm belt? That most of the campaigning will come down that belt of states?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, not ours. We have set up a distribution of our total time in all 50 states and we'll proceed with that plan until we can tell by the public opinion polls it needs to be shifted. We still have some flexibility during the month of October, but during September we'll be campaigning throughout the country. We have myself, and Senator Mondale, our two wives are excellent campaigners, and then I have six, my sons plus their wives, six in all, and I think with that sort of spread we can size up the whole country, but I don't think we'll narrow our campaign effort down to just a few states until much later and even then if it's necessary, and I don't think it'll be necessary.\n"", ""Q. Mt. Carter, as you know, President Ford wants a certain number of 90 minute debates, which is one of the subjects now being debated, on specific subjects. Your people have some other ideas, but why isn't President Ford's proposal a good one? After all, much of the criticism of Presidential debates is that they are more cosmetic than substantive, so why not take 90 minutes at a time on just a single subject, say four times during the campaign?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, we've not been too argumentative about that, Tom. We've tried to conduct our discussions in private and not to the news media. The League of Women Voters' proposal, which was made originally and I think which will ultimately be the basis of the debates was acceptable to us and still is. I think, if we do have a couple of debates on specific subjects, the other ones ought to be completely unstructured so that we don't have such a tight definition of what we can talk about at that time, but I think there has been some rough agreement that we should have three debates, they should be about 75 minutes in length and, if we have certain subjects to be defined, they'll be looked at in proper sequence. I think that it's important that we have the debates, too, in kind of neutral territory; I personally don't favor the first debate, for instance, being in the aura of Washington where the Presidency itself, the office can be used for Ford's advantage. We're both running for President the first time, and it puts us on equal basis, but those kinds of details, I think, are best talked about among our representatives without doing it through the news media, even as good a medium as the Today Show.\n"", 'Q. You object to having former Senator McCarthy and former Governor Maddox participate in these debates? As you know, they could possibly throw a monkey wrench into it.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't have any objections about it. I think that that would ruin the debate format. It would be more like a forum. As you may know, during the primary season the Democrats had, I'd say, 20 to 30 of those forum type debates on the public news shows either sponsored by Democratic groups around New Hampshire and Iowa and Florida and so forth, and it changes the whole concept from a debate to just a cross-examination by the news media, and if that should be done, I think it would require a great deal of adjustment in the present concept but I'll let the lawyers, the Federal Elections Commission and others work that out I don't want to try to. decide that myself.\n"", 'Q. Mr. Carter, a strong part of your campaign appeal during the primary was your promise to reorganize the federal bureaucracy and then present a detailed plan for tax reform, I think it was in Wisconsin in the spring of this year that you said that you would have details on tax reform available after the convention. As you well know, in conference committee now there is considerable discussion going on for tax reform during the next year. When are you going to let us know what your specific proposals are on tax reform?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there's no way to have details on tax reform without a great deal of careful, meticulous study, which would take the office of the Presidency, and I'd say at least 5 or 6 months. If I'm elected the Executive Branch of government will be completely reorganized. We'll have comprehensive welfare reform proposals ready on Inauguration Day, the tax reform package will have to be done after I'm in office, but we'll be ready for the plans for what will be done by the time the inauguration date comes, and those are commitments that I've made that I'll stand behind. We have a real need in this country for some leadership; we have a bureaucracy that's horribly confused; we're wasting a lot of money, and we've projected that by the end of the next administration the budget will be balanced with careful management, just assuming a modest growth rate of about 4 percent per year, and if we can get the unemployment rate among adults down 3 percent or less which would be about a 4, 4J4 percent overall unemployment rate, and inflation down around 4 percent, tax reform, welfare reform, government reorganization; all those things will come together. But they have to be carefully meshed, and it's going to take some time to do them, but they'll be done.\n"", ""Q. Those are all very appealing objectives, of course—I don't think anyone would disagree with them—but on the other hand this country has just been through two Presidencies in which the candidates asked the people to take them on their word, to trust them that they would end the war in Vietnam, trust them that there was no corruption before Watergate, Don't you think that the American people deserve in this election more specific proposals from you—for instance, in how you're going to bring unemployment down to 3 percent and balance the budget and do all of these wonderful things in 4 years? A specific program?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, we have the specific programs. I just can't describe to you exactly what the final tax code will be or what the final organizational structure of the government will be, but as far as the overall thrust of what we'll do to bring the unemployment, what we'll do to bring inflation down, how we'll have a balanced budget, these will be spelled out week by week. I'm going to make a speech, for instance, to the labor convention this Tuesday— tomorrow—and some of these points will be made on economics.\n"", ""Q. Mr. Carter, certain patterns have already developed during this campaign. The President has accused you of being an unknown and inexperienced; you've accused him of not providing any leadership to the country, you say that the country is drifting. Do you believe that the President has held this Congress hostage of sorts through his veto power?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, you know, veto is a very useful mechanism. It was spelled out in the Constitution, and I vetoed many bills when I was governor, but die point is that the constant bickering and squabbling and argument and trying to blame one another between White House and the Congress hurts the whole country. I don't know of any substantive proposal that President Ford has put forward at all since he's been in office relating to the cutting down of unemployment, the control of inflation, the reorganization of bureaucracy, on energy or transportation or agriculture; he has stayed there dormant in the White House, fearful of taking any sort of action. The Congress, you know, 535 different people quite often in a fumbling way, quite often in a mistaken way, have tried to come forward with their tentative proposals without any influence in the White House. And President Ford, I think, so far has vetoed four times as many bills per year as President Nixon and, of course, he's had an awful lot of his vetoes overridden. But the point is not who can veto and who can have a veto sustained, but it's how well the President and Congress can work together, to iron out differences ahead of time and in the embryonic stages of developing a program to actually do something about unemployment, and inflation, and welfare mess, and unfair taxes. This is the substance or the essence of leadership. And the leadership just hasn't been there.\n"", 'Q. Do you think that this country is prepared to accept one-party rule which it would have, in effect, if you were to have an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress at this time and if you were to be the Democratic President of the United States? Is that healthy, if there was give and take there between Congress and the administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there's no give or take now, and I think that there have been Republican Presidents who've done well with the Congress. I think even President Nixon had a substantial number of his proposals accepted, when he made proposals, and the same way with President Eisenhower. As you probably know, the last 24 years we've had Republican Presidents 16 years, only 8 years have we had Democratic Presidents in the White House, Johnson and Kennedy, but yes, I think the country's ready for it. Anybody that would accuse the Democrats of being homogeneous in nature, always agree with one another, just doesn't know the Democratic Party. This is a time, I think, for aggressive and hotly debated, open interrelationships between the President and Congress with mutual respect back and forth, mutual consultation and letting the people become involved in deciding the ultimate goals of the country. But government by stalemate, government by timidity, a total absence of leadership from the White House means that the country has no leadership. It's not possible for Congress to lead this country, whether they're Democrats or Republicans.\n"", ""Q. This morning we heard on the news that, say, you and the President have been exchanging charges of flip-flopping on positions. Do you expect that the American people will, in the course of the next several months, see a great many changes between your positions on certain policies and the President's positions on certain policies as you both try to capitalize on the mood of the land?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, they won't see differences in my policies compared to what I have put forth the last few years. I think by the end of the Ohio, California, New Jersey primaries I had made over 2,000 speeches, and they've all been very carefully monitored by the news media, they've been recorded by radio, television, and by the written press, and there's no way that I could change my position without having a devastating political consequence, which I don't intend to do. But I think now President Ford's been in the White House about 2 years and when we've passed bill after bill and make proposal after proposal to do something about the national park system and have President Ford object and block every possible improvement and then here in the midst of the campaign ask about $l 1/2 billion improvement of the park system that's something of a flip-flop. But I think it's a good step forward for him, and if he'll finally exert the leadership even because of the pressures of the campaign I believe it'll be good for the country. So, we'll have a chance to debate, and we'll have a chance to point out one another's positions now and in the past. This is part of the political process. I'm looking forward to it and it's not going to be a pennant campaign on my part, I'm sure it's not on President Ford's part, but we'll let the American people judge and, as I said earlier, I feel confident about the outcome.\n"", 'Brokaw. Mr. Carter, thank you very much for speaking to us from a field in the outskirts of greater downtown Plains, Georgia. We had invited President Ford to be on this week as well on the Today program; he was unable to do so. We hope that he will be able to in the future.']"

64,Jimmy Carter ,"September 01, 1976","[""Q. Sir, you have been reported, at least in Time, May 31, as feeling that the central issue in this year's election is not merely economics, or jobs, or détente, or politics, but the feeling that this country has lost its moral and spiritual underpinnings, its sense of purpose and direction. Would you care to amplify on that?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I think the government has. The American people still have a deep hunger to see, as I said in my speech back there, to see the precious things restored that are very important to them. They want three basic things. One is that they want a government that is able and competent to deliver the services that they need. Second, they want a government that is sensitive to what the people's desires are, that understands people. Third, they want a government that is honest. And the modem societal structure is much more loose than when I was a child. When I was a child, the family unit was always there. If I got in trouble or had a difficult question, my mother and father were always there. Nowadays that's not the case, and every person needs something that doesn't change. Obviously a deep religious faith serves that need. But, in addition to that, in a secular world there ought to be a government whose ethics, morals, whose standards of excellence, whose standard of greatness are a source of inspiration and also reassurance. In the aftermath of Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Watergate, and CIA revelations, our people feel that that stability that has always been in our lives—a deep sense that my government is great— my government's pure—my government's decent—my government's honest—that assurance has been lost.\n"", ""Q. This seems to have appeal to the man on the street, we used to call him the grassroots man who is really unsatisfied with the morality of the past administration. In fact, there was a survey taken by Time magazine about the religious concept where they said 50 percent of the people don't feel one way or the other about it but that 32 percent said that this is a real asset to your campaign and only 8 percent thought it was a detriment or worried about it. How do you feel about this 32 percent—as an asset?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, I would feel better just to know that a person had deep spiritual convictions regardless of his particular faith. I know the reassurance I get from my own religion, and it helps me to take a more objective viewpoint and a calmer approach to crises. I have a great deal of peace with myself and with other people because of my religious convictions. I think that sort of personal attitude—environment—within which I live helps me to do a better job in dealing with the transient and quite often controversial decisions that have to be made in political life, or in business life, or in a family life. I think that has been an asset in some areas. There have been some parts of the country where my widely published deeply religious convictions were not a political help, but they have been few.\n', 'Q. You alluded to the Bible now and then. Christ made a statement one time, ""Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\'s and to God the things that are God\'s."" How would you as President relate this to your personal religious conviction and to politics and, shall we say, maybe to the laws of the land? How would you tie these two together?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, as a Baptist, one of the tenets of our faith is the complete separation of church and state. I'm not a newcomer to politics. I've been a Christian. I've been on the school board during the tough integration years; I've been a state senator two terms; I've been a governor 4 years. I've never seen any incompatibility between those two parts of my life. I've never let my religious convictions orient my decisions on a political matter and never have tried to use the strength of my political office to force my religious convictions on somebody else. But as you also know, Baptists believe that worship or the religious aspects of a person's life are personal interrelationships which are between that person and God. We don't ascribe to our church any authority over our lives and, of course, each individual of that church is autonomous. We don't believe that the Southern Baptist Convention should have any sort of authority over an individual church. So there will be no problem in my life as President in keeping separate religion and government.\n"", 'Q. What do you feel is the basic responsibility of a state under God?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, we have had from the very beginning of our nation a dependence upon religious faith as part of our political framework—the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, our laws, our coins, ""In God We Trust,"" ""One Nation Under God, Indivisible""—and this, I think, caused us, in moments of strife, moments of uncertainty, moments of crisis, to look for a higher authority than man\'s laws far the proper relationship between people in our nation and also between our nation and other nations. And these are ethical principles that are common to many religions: compassion, brotherhood, love, truth, honesty, decency. Those kinds of things are always tenets of religious faith to which our nation can go back in the kind of times I described earlier.\n', ""Q. I'm quite sure myself how you stand on this, but how do you stand i on the First Amendment regulation regarding complete separation of church I and state ... you know, Congress shall make no law, etc.?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, I would be a strong defender of that amendment, and would also interpret it very strictly.\n', 'Q. Parochial schools, another area, would you as President favor federal or state tax moneys for parochial schools, or religious institutions, and how would you feel such action fits into this concept of separation of church and state?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, obviously that's an area that's been the subject of lawsuits that are still going on, and I would have to abide by the decisions of the federal courts. The general premise and one with which I agree, is that there should not be federal money going into any sort of religious institution for instruction in religious matters. This is a subject that's well understood, I think, and generally accepted by our people. There have been tests of this principle even when very strong religious schools were not able to continue because of economic problems. But when faced with that choice, of I actually closing a school, and sending their children back to public schools or giving public funds to the schools, the courts have ruled that federal money should not go to the schools.\n"", ""Q. That's good. As Governor of Georgia, you have established, I think, a very good record for minority group (garbled) conditions for prison inmates, mental hospital patients, the mentally retarded. How about the future, ? when you become President, for religious minorities and their religious convictions, for example, the Amish and Mennonites on education, Jehovah's Witnesses, on shall we say, blood transfusions. Seventh-day Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists, free love, the Jews, a number of areas like this?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would certainly try to honor the religious beliefs of those groups. The only time when there might be a difficulty is if the welfare or the freedom of our people were involved. And that would be an extremely rare occasion. And, as you know, that would undoubtedly go to the courts to interpret I would do everything I could, as I did as Georgia's governor, to honor the religious beliefs of other people.\n"", ""Q. One step further, would you as President strive to improve the plight of the Jews and, shall we say, of the Christians under persecution in Communist countries? How would your view that the establishment of Israel, for example, is the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, affect your dealings with the Mideast? That's really two questions, let's stay with the first one for a minute. Communist countries.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, it's not the best approach for the Congress of our country to pass a law that applies to another country. I think that puts the other country on the defensive, and I think it makes it even more difficult to negotiate through normal diplomatic channels to encourage or induce the Communist countries to provide more freedom for their residents. I think we ought to keep as a major purpose in dealing with the Soviet Union, for instance, to free [garbled] migration of Jewish citizens, who want to go to Israel or other countries. That ought to be pursued in all of our dealings with the Soviet Union, whenever it's appropriate, and I would keep it constantly before me as President in those negotiations. As far as Israel is concerned, I think the finest humanitarian act ever performed by the whole community of nations was the establishment of the State of Israel, and I recognize that the only major dependable ally that Israel has is our own country. I think that a basic cornerstone of our foreign policy should be preservation of the nation of Israel, its right to exist, and its right to exist in peace. And as a Christian, who's visited extensively through Israel, I think that, yes, it was a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy to have Israel established as a nation. Now, that doesn't mean that I would mistreat the Arabs. I would continue to encourage trade, friendship, better understanding between ourselves and the Arab countries. But I would let this commitment to the right of Israel to exist, and to exist in peace, be well known and not have it be an indeterminant and shaky thing.\n"", 'It would be an unequivocal commitment of our country, well understood by the rest of the world.\n', 'Q. Some 40 evangelistic groups, among them the Mennonites and the Seventh-day Adventists and others, have religious scruples against joining labor unions. Would you support a conscience clause that would extend an exemption to all employees having such religious scruples?\n', ""Governor Carter. I did not know about that problem. I never have heard about it before. I never have seen any publicity on it. If it is indeed a part of their religious convictions that is serious to them, I think it ought to be treated in the same category as the problem of conscientious objectors. I don't know how to answer the question, not being familiar with the arguments on both sides, not being familiar with the circumstances. I don't know of anything the government has done to resolve it. Well, I just can't answer that question any better than I have.\n"", ""Q. You mentioned several times, and in fact just today in several campaign speeches about the energy crisis that we are currently facing. You've talked about coal and other things. In a Christianity Today article on May 7, the editor, Lynn Fell, called for a complete closure of all businesses, including gasoline stations, restaurants, shopping centers, and factories on Sundays as an economic social, and energy-saving measure. He feels the only way to accomplish this is by legislative fiat through the duly elected officials of the people. How would you react to such legislation?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would not favor it No, I don't want to get into that right now.\n"", 'Q. Would you concur with the ""Baptist Manifesto on Religious Liberty issued by the Religious Liberty Committee of the Virginia Baptist General Association that states, ""Christians should need no support from the state in observing with reverence, with thanksgiving, and public gathering for worship and Bible study on the first day of the week\'\' Would you concur with that manifesto?\n', ""Governor Carter. Let me ask you a question. I'm not familiar with that manifesto. Does that mean that they object to the nation declaring Thanksgiving as a national holiday?\n"", ""Q. I think that in this case they're talking about the first day of the week. Using the first day of the week, they state that they should need no support of the state to keep Sunday as any kind of a special day of reverence or public gatherings, or even if they want to call it Thanksgiving; they say that there's no need for the state to support this concept.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I've had to answer that question as Governor of Georgia. In general, I've not been in favor of so-called blue laws in Georgia. I have favored the prohibition against the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday, and I don't know if there's any logical way to rationalize that, but I personally see no objection to referendums among the people to decide when to close down and when not to. What I have favored is this: Employees ought to have at least 1 day a week when they can get off and not work. But I wouldn't have any objection to that manifesto, I don't believe.\n"", 'Q. And just one other question on that same topic. If a bill were placed on your desk as President, passed by the House and by the Senate, to close down all industry and businesses, or even part of one of those two, on Sunday, would you as President veto it, or sign it, and why?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't imagine that occurring in our country. I would probably veto it.\n"", 'Q. You have stated recently that, if elected President, that you would probably join the nearest Baptist Church and go there every Sunday, I believe is the way you put it. Does this mean that you would discontinue all religious services in the White House, or at least the Sunday services?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I would not have special services within the White House for different denominations. I'm a Baptist. I would like to have my worship be routine. I would like to have it be unpublicized. I would like to participate in a regular church congregation. When I became Governor of Georgia, I joined the nearest Baptist Church to the governor's mansion in Georgia, the first Sunday I was in Atlanta. I taught Sunday school. I became a deacon. I was a member of the congregation. And after 2 or 3 weeks, it was no longer a publicly noticed event. That's what I would prefer to have as President. I wouldn't want to make a promise that I would never have religious services at the White House. If there should become a problem in going to the public services in the Baptist Church, and, if there were members of my staff or families that wanted to have worship in the White House with me, I would do that just as I would in my own home in Plains, Georgia, on occasion. There might be other times when I would feel the need for a prayer breakfast or some other prayer event, and I would reserve the right to have it. But as a routine matter, my worship would be in the nearest church of my denomination.\n"", 'Q. One of the key newsmen on the plane earlier today told me that in Oregon you attended church, Udall attended church, and Brown attended church, but the other two men were the only ones, as I got the impression, to call on the newsmen and make a splash about it, and you took this low profile which you have just mentioned. How do you feel about that?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I've always done that. As a matter of fact, earlier in the campaign, I very carefully avoided any news participation in my worship services. Lately, as you know, it has gotten almost impossible to do it. But the news people who travel with me know that I don't want any news coverage when I go to church—it's something that is private with me, and this was the case in Oregon. I attended a Baptist Church with my wife and little girl, and we did not make any public announcement about it.\n"", 'Q. You have stated that personally and morally you are against abortion. How would you as President attempt to modify the abortion by demand that is available in America today?\n', 'Governor Carter. Under the Supreme Court ruling which no President can change, I would do everything I could to minimize the need for abortion as I did as Governor of Georgia. I would favor, for instance, a nationwide program established by law, adequately financed, for sex education, for family planning, for access to contraceptives by those who believe in their use and tor better adoptive procedures.\n', 'Q. Could I ask a sideline question? Where do you feel life begins—at what point, I should say? Do you have any personal feelings on that?\n', ""Governor Carter. I hate to have any abortions at all. I don't want to get on the subject of trying to define the initiation of life. You know, this has been a matter of debate for 100 years, and 50 years from now it still is going to be.\n"", 'Q. What do you feel is the most crucial issue between church and state that is facing America today?\n', 'Governor Carter. It is hard to know exactly what that question means. Obviously, the most crucial issue is to implement within government, within the state, within politics, the same quality of ethics and morality that we try to maintain in religion. And to show that there is no incompatibility between the two. There need not be any interference with the church in the state or the state in the church. But I see no reason to set a different standard. I think that that correlation in our national life is the greatest challenge and also the greatest opportunity.\n', 'Q. How do you feel about taxation, be it governmental, or state, on church properties, church physical structures and subsidiary facilities—like publishing houses, church institutions?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would favor the taxation of church property other than the church building itself.\n', 'Q. What do you feel is the way your church religious life will help you become a better President?\n', ""Governor Carter. Within the life of a religious person there is a constant consciousness of the standards set for us. I am a Christian. I learn about the life of Christ. I try to pattern my own life, unsuccessfully, after His life. I've learned from the descriptions of the Bible, different occurrences in ancient times that are similar to those that we face today. I learn from those experiences, I study the Bible—I read a chapter from the Bible every night without exception—and that gives me a constant inclination to study. In addition, I have a feeling of personal assurance of peace and equanimity about crises and challenges that would be a basis for calmness in the face of adversity or in the face of national crises. I also recognize the responsibility on me to demonstrate as a public figure the professions of my own religion, and this I think would elevate my own standards that I would try to maintain for myself.\n"", 'Q. You have said ""I would not be a timid President."" As President how would you act on this in the realm of morality in Washington, D.C., as we have seen it in the past?\n', ""Governor Carter. One of the main things that could be done, I would always remember the admonitions of Christ on humility and absence of pride, a prohibition against judging other people. I would try not to consider myself better than others. At the same time I would like to see more openness in government, an absence of secrecy, an accountability of public officials for their performance, absence of unnecessary influence on any public official that might be detrimental to the best interest of those who don't have strength or power or social prominence or political authority. I would like more emphasis on government's role in enhancing the quality of life and the lives of those who are most dependent on government for correction of some defect or the overcoming of a deprivation. I would also try to make appointments of officials on the basis of merit and not as a political payoff. I would try to tell the American people the truth. Those are the kinds of things that might be brought back to our government which have been there in administrations past, and they would all be associated I think with morality which can obviously be completely independent of religion.\n"", 'Q. Why are the other candidates so afraid to get into religion—kind of take a hands-off position until very recently?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question.""]"
65,Jimmy Carter ,"September 03, 1976","[""Senator Mondale and I have had a chance to be together last night until about midnight and again this morning. We both, since our last meeting, had a chance to travel around the country a good bit. I've been out in California and Iowa and the State of Washington and up in the Washington, D.C. area and New York\n"", 'Senator Mondale has just returned from a 9 day full-time campaign trip. We spent most of our time comparing notes about the reaction of the people of this country toward our own campaign, of course, and about some of the serious problems that affect our nation.\n', ""The overwhelming concern is about the management of our nation's affairs as relates to inflation which is very high, unemployment, which this morning was revealed to be the highest since the Hoover depression, 7.9 percent; it went up again, contrary to the projections of President Ford and his economic advisors.\n"", 'I think the concern is that there is no plan for the future, no vision of what this country can be, no strong leadership and actually making proposals that would cut down on the inflation rate, and would cut down on the unemployment rate, and deal with the crucial family problems that relate to every American with whom we talked.\n', ""We also spent some time going over poll results which confirm these findings, just about people's attitudes, not comparison in voting strength, in making plans for next week.\n"", ""Tomorrow there will be a press briefing in which we'll outline the routes to be followed by myself and Senator Mondale and members of our immediate families during the first week of the campaign, which I think will indicate vividly the broad base of thrust of our determination to reach the people directly. Senator, you might Wknt to add something.\n"", ""Senator Mondale. As the Govemot pointed out, I just completed nearly two weeks of campaigning around the nation, and I've been over much of it. I've talked to many, many Americans, and I think the central theme is they don't think anyone is in charge, and that they're paying the price in several respects.\n"", ""First of all, unemployment. In New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, California, many other states that I've visited, it was not uncommon to find every 10th worker out of work. Of course, the cost to them is tremendous and to the rest of us it is also tremendous, and as is shown this morning, that unemployment figure is continuing to rise despite all their predictions to the contrary.\n"", ""Similarly, they see no firm hand trying to deal with the erosion in the value of the dollar. Inflation is just a tremendous thing in American life today, and it's at a rate 3 times that suffered in the 60's. They don't see their President or the policies leading toward any turnaround in this dreadful situation where the dollars that they saved and the dollars that they're earning mean less and less.\n"", ""I think basically what Americans want to do now is to have a government and have leadership that will take command, will unify this country, and help deal with the real problems that fundamentally and adversely affect Americans; and to provide that kind of trust and confidence—is essential to a vibrant and optimistic country. That's above all the message that I've been hearing as I traveled around this nation.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Any questions.\n', ""Q. I suppose we wonder how you all are going to turn it around.'\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, in the first place, to lay out some specific goals to achieve in control of inflation, which I think is probably the most difficult to understand and also to deal with. In my speech that I made this week, which Senator Mondale and I have gone over, the obvious answer is, number one, to put our people back to work. As long as we've got 7 or 8 million people out of work, we'll never have an end to inflation and [have] a balanced budget, which I intend to achieve.\n"", ""Secondly, we need to make sure there is adequate competition in the market place. We've got too many instances in this country the last few years where as a demand for products goes down, the prices actually go up.\n"", 'Another thing is to break up the sweetheart arrangement that exists between regulatory agencies and industries being regulated to enforce the antitrust laws.\n', 'To have a strict control over spending, there will be no new programs implemented under my administration unless we can be sure that the cost of those programs is compatible with my goal of having a balanced budget before the end of that term. And this will require delay in the implementation of costly programs if they are proposed; the quick phasing out of those which have already served their useful purpose; the phasing in of programs to make the present programs work before new programs that are costly are implemented; top, zero-based management of the budget; and combined with a sunset law to automatically terminate or to reassess for termination those programs that have been initiated and have long past served their usefulness.\n', ""This has got to be done. We don't have any way now to predict what's going to happen next. So I would say the overall thing would be tough management for the White House. What we have now obviously is whenever something goes wrong, with mismanagement in the government, whether it involves the FBI or the CIA or the Medicaid program, nobody's responsible. I think the President ought to be responsible, and, as such, I will be responsible.\n"", 'The American people have got to look some place for leadership, and that leadership, as I said many times, has got to come out of the White House.\n', ""Q. Governor, do you have any advice or complaints about Senator Mondale's campaign style or substance up to now?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think it's just been great. No, I didn't have any complaints. We've both discussed the news reports of our campaign. There was some complaint about the coverage, but as far as the actual campaigning, no.\n"", 'Q. Is there anything you want to hit or have the Senator hit harder than he has?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, we have had this chance to feel out the consciousness of the American people, and I think those themes have become very obvious to us. We will in the future be exchanging basic speech material; we've never tried to look over one another's shoulder as our presentations were in the process of being put together. I trust him; he trusts me. But the speeches that I've made the last 2 weeks are now in Senator Mondale's hands for study, and his speeches are in my hands for study.\n"", ""We want to be sure that we are compatible, and I have learned a lot from Senator Mondale. He's been there; he's seen as a co-sponsor, for instance, of the sunset legislation, how that will tie into zero-based budgeting which I have implemented and used for four years as governor. And this melding of his knowledge of the horrible Washington scene with my fresh approach coming in from outside, I think will correct the defects that are there. So I think we've got a good open relationship between our staffs and him and me personally that will stand us in good stead.\n"", 'Q. [You have a] position on income tax reform and the need for the wealthy to pay their fair share.\n', 'Governor Carter. Right.\n', 'Q. Is there some embarrassment from the fact that your tax returns that you released disclosed that last year you made about $136,000, but paid only about 9 percent in federal income tax?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think that illustrates vividly the need for tax reforms. I personally would like to see investment tax credits, for instance, which was the reason that my taxes were not as high last year as they have been in the past, changed to be predicated almost entirely on the number of people that are put back to work. Right now, a lot of investment tax credits given to businessmen like myself don't relate at all to how many new jobs are provided.\n"", ""But, no, I don't have any embarrassment about it. I think if anyone checks my income tax returns and net worth for the last 10 or 15 years, and they've all been revealed, I believe back to 1965, that you would find out that I paid roughly 25 to 30 percent of my annual income in taxes. Last year was a special case because we had a very large plant that cost almost a million dollars to install ...\n"", 'Q. Governor, do you think FBI director Kelley should be fired?\n', ""Governor Carter. That was beautiful harmony. I don't know whether he should be fired or not. I don't know the details of the case. That's a decision for President Ford to make. I think there again it's an indication of an absence of leadership. I'm not President, and I don't have access to the private reports that should have been a natural stream of information coming into the White House. It's apparent that President Ford has not done anything to prevent that kind of violation of propriety; it's similar to the Medicaid problem. He didn't do anything about it; and outsiders have actually revealed the problem with Mr. Kelley, and also of Medicaid, and I think this also is an indication of a lack of leadership. Again, I'll wait and see the evidence before I decide whether or not he should be removed.\n"", 'Q. Do you regret that your sons have tried pot?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I do. I don't approve of the use of marijuana. I might say I've never tried it myself and don't intend to. I think the medical effects of persistent use of marijuana still concern me very much, and I wish that they never had tried it. None of them use marijuana now. They're very truthful boys, and they've never tried to mislead us, but all three of them in the past have tried it on occasion. In a couple of instances, when we discovered that they had tried marijuana, we talked to them, and it was some time before they quit using it, and I think that their wives have had more of an influence in their abandoning that habit than their parents. But they've always been frank with us about it, and I think it's something that most teenagers go through, and I think we ought to be very strong in eliminating the influx of marijuana to this country, heavy on the pushers, and I don't favor the use of marijuana at all.\n"", 'Q. Do you think [marijuana] has worse effect than alcoholic consumption?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think so. I can't say for sure. Anybody who becomes an alcoholic, of course, can have one's life destroyed by the use of liquor. One of the bad things about marijuana is quite often it's used in an environment, and consistently, with much more habit-forming drugs. I don't think there's any evidence that marijuana use is habit forming, but no adequate study of marijuana's final effects has yet been conducted. I'm more favorable about it than I am liquor, yes. ...\n"", ""Q. [It has been charged] that programs in the Democratic Platform and proposals and programs that you have outlined in your campaign would cost a great deal of money, in the billions of dollars ... Are you going to have a salesmanship job on this, do you feel that it's going to be a [liability]?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't preclude skepticism on the part of people who have derived their opinions from past performance. I think anybody that has watched the horrible mess in Washington the last few years, particularly in the last 8 yean, would be skeptical about a balanced budget. I think though it's fair to say that under Democratic Administrations in the past that the budget has been very carefully handled even with the heavy inflationary pressures of the fullest participation in the Vietnam war.\n"", ""Under Kennedy and Johnson, the average inflation rate was only 2 percent. Under Ford and Nixon, it's been 6 percent; the average deficit has been 600 percent more under Nixon and Ford than it was under Kennedy and Johnson, and I think we've got a fairly accurate projection from very conservative economists about what is likely in the next four years. It's going to require tough management, and it's going to require very careful assessment of the ultimate cost of programs; it's going to require a weeding out and elimination of costly programs that have long past served their purpose; and if it requires a delay, for instance, in implementing welfare reform or health care in order to accomplish the goal that I've set of a balanced budget, then those delays will be there.\n"", ""The goals that we've established in the Democratic Party platform are not completely compatible with my own, but I don't anticipate any great increase in spending to bring about a fulfillment of all the promises that I've made to the American people...\n"", 'Q. The balanced budget concept is more important to you ... than the health care or the welfare reform programs which you [advocate]?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well those promises will be kept But as a matter of initial phasing and timing ... last March, I believe, I made a major speech on health care and spelled out my goals for it. It was very careful, very conservative, and also practical. And I spelled out then that the health care program would be phased in gradually.\n', 'The first thing, is to make Medicaid and Medicare delivery systems work\n', 'The second, compatible with that, is to eliminate the horrible bureaucracy that now gives us 72 different agencies trying to administer health care programs.\n', 'And another one would be to make sure that we understood ahead of time how much the programs are going to cost.\n', 'So what we are doing, as I described to some of you, after our economics briefing out here and budget briefing, which were combined, is to start with fiscal year 1981 and work back from there. Our projections are, with a very modest increase in gross national product with about 4 percent a year, an overall unemployment rate of about 4/2 percent or so, it is about 3 percent adult unemployment and inflation rate of about 4 percent, that we can anticipate by the end of 1980, the end of this term, about a 60 billion dollar increase in expenditures; and within that framework I intend to implement those changes.\n', ""We now spend $550 per person per year on health care. And I don't believe we'll have any overall increase in that cost. There might be some shifting toward different funding sources, but I intend to use as much as possible, the private sector in every instance where there's a choice between private and government in administration of a program. I don't see any benefit to the American people in going to the government; I prefer private.\n"", 'Q. [Question inaudible]\n', ""Governor Carter. We'll carry out the promises that I've made as aggressively and quickly as I can. But it doesn't help any to give people a little more payment for Social Security or welfare or veterans' benefits or for housing programs and then rob them with inflation.\n"", ""Just the interest on the public debt that's been added under the Nixon and Ford Administrations adds $350 per year per family in this country. That's sapped away 350 bucks per year for every family in the United States—just the interest—and that's permanent.\n"", ""So you've got to control the government to make it work. Now when I was Governor of Georgia, we substantially increased the services to the people that needed it most ... health, mental health, education ... and we had a balanced budget because of tough management, careful long-range planning, and zero-based budgeting.\n"", ""And that is an integral part of my character. I couldn't do any different, even if I wanted to. It would have to change my whole character. But we will be careful and methodical. We're going to spell out what the American people can expect and carry out those commitments.\n"", 'Q. [Question on Watergate.]\n', ""Governor Carter. My own feeling, and I think it would be confirmed by public opinion polls, is that nobody holds President Ford responsible for Watergate. And nobody holds President Ford responsible for what Richard Nixon did that disgraced our country. But to the extent that Nixon initiated programs or maladministration or whatever, if President Ford, who's now been in office over two years, continues those programs, I think obviously he has to share the responsibility. He's the President. We've only got one President Somebody's responsible for the Executive Branch of government It's not the Congress. It's not the Cabinet members. It's not the regulatory agencies. It's the President. And I guarantee you it's very difficult now to find any admission or acceptance of responsibility on the part of the President when something goes seriously wrong, like Medicaid, like FBI, like CIA revelations. Most of the investigations, most of the corrective proposals, have come from outside the Executive Branch altogether, and I don't remember a single one that's ever come from the White House. So to that extent, I think President Ford has got to be responsible for the two years he's been in office.\n"", 'Q. [Question on his position on abortion.]\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I've never changed my position on abortion. I'm against abortion. I don't think government ought to do anything to encourage abortions. I'll do everything I can within the framework of the Supreme Court rulings to minimize abortions. I'm not in favor of any constitutional amendment that I have ever seen. The only thing that I have changed is a response to the Democratic Party platform plank that insinuates to many people that church groups or individuals don't have a right to seek an amendment, and I do think they have that right. But that's my position. So far as I can discern, even starting back with the Iowa statement, I've never changed those basic positions. And I can't answer every conjectural question that, if so and so happens five years in the future, what you will or will not do, but that is a concern to me. I haven't read the article but I understand that both The Washington Post and The New York Times expressed some belief that I had changed my position on abortion. I can't detect any change in my position.\n"", 'Q. [Question on balancing the budget.]\n', ""Governor Carter. The projections we gave to you—I think Senator Mondale was with me—when we discussed the budget and the economic briefing results, indicated that we could carry out the promises that I have made and within the framework that I've described to you, the 4 1/2 percent overall unemployment, the 3 percent adult unemployment, the inflation rate, and a moderate growth rate, that the budget could be balanced. That's the best indication from a wide range of economists of all political persuasions, some quite liberal, some quite conservative, and there's no disagreement with those terms among those people who helped me with economics.\n"", 'Q. [Question on delaying the implementation of Carter Administration programs and keying them to the availability of revenues.]\n', ""Governor Carter. I think we had the same statement in my health speech that I made last March, and I believe that we had the same statement when I gave the briefing to which you referred. The amount that we project, as I said earlier, is about $60 billion that we will have under those very conservative estimates, available for new programs. Now that doesn't include the savings that we hope to realize with the zero-based budgeting techniques, government reorganization, and also the sunset laws. But I am quite comfortable with those figures and quite comfortable with the promises that I've made...""]"

It requires a careful balancing of realism and idealism—of our understanding of the world as it is, and our vision of the world as it should be.\n', 'The question, I think, is whether in recent years our highest officials have not been too pragmatic, even cynical, and as a consequence have ignored those moral values that had often distinguished our country from the other great nations of the world.\n', 'We must move away from making policies in secret; without the knowledge and approval of the American people.\n', 'I have called for closer ties with our traditional allies, and stronger ties with the State of Israel. I have stressed the necessity for a strong defense— tough and muscular, and adequate to maintain our freedom under any conceivable circumstances.\n', 'But military strength alone is not enough. Over the years, our greatest source of strength has come from those basic, priceless values which are embodied in our Declaration of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights: our belief in freedom of religion—our belief in freedom of expression—our belief in human dignity.\n', 'These principles have made us great and, unless, our foreign policy reflects them, we make a mockery of all those values that we have celebrated in this bicentennial year.\n', 'We have not always lived up to our ideals, but I know of no great nation in history that has more often conducted itself in a moral, unselfish, generous manner abroad, and provided more freedom and opportunity to its own citizens at home.\n', 'Still, in recent years, we have had reason to be troubled. Often there has been a gap between the values we have proclaimed and the policies we have pursued. We have often been overextended, and deeply entangled in the internal affairs of distant nations. Our government has pursued dubious tactics, and ""national security"" has sometimes been a cover-up for unnecessary secrecy and national scandal.\n', 'We stumbled into the quagmires of Cambodia and Vietnam, and carried out heavy-handed efforts to destroy an elected government in Chile.

Bukovsky, a young scientist, has been imprisoned most of the last 13 yean for criticisms of the Soviet regime. Slepak, a radio engineer in Moscow, applied for an exit visa for Israel in April of 1970. The visa was denied and, since 1972, he has been denied the right to hold a job.\n', 'I ask why such people must be deprived of their basic rights, a year after Helsinki.

There are many cases of political persecution in Chile and reports of brutal torture that are too well documented to be disbelieved.\n', 'There are those regimes, such as South Korea, which openly violate human rights, although they themselves are under threat from Communist regimes which represent an even greater level of repression.\n', 'Even in such cases, however, we should not condone repression or the denial of freedom. On the contrary, we should use our influence to increase freedom in those countries that depend on us for their very survival.\n', 'Denials of human rights occur in many places and many ways.

These bodies are limited in power, but they can serve as the conscience of the world community, and they deserve far more support than our government has given them in recent years.\n', 'Insofar as they comply with our own Constitution and laws, we should move toward Senate ratification of several important treaties drafted in the United Nations for the protection of human rights. These include the Genocide Convention that was prepared more than 25 years ago, the convention against racial discrimination that was signed during (he Johnson Administration, and the covenants on political and civil rights, and on economic and social rights. Until we ratify these covenants we cannot participate with other nations in international discussions of specific cases involving Freedom and human rights.\n', 'We should quit being timid and join Israel and other nations in moving to stamp out international terrorism!\n', 'These are some of the things our nation can do for a change to promote human rights in our imperfect world. The basic question is one of leadership. We have not had that kind of leadership in recent years. In foreign affairs, as in domestic affairs we need leaders who are not only concerned with the interests of the powerful, but who are especially concerned with the powerless, with the weak, with the disenfranchised, and with other victims of oppression.

68,Jimmy Carter ,"September 13, 1976","['Q. Governor Carter, you have described yourself as a populist. Just how do you define ""populist""?\n', ""Governor Carter. I tried to define it when people asked me whether my acceptance speech in New York in July was liberal or conservative. I told them I thought it w'as a mixture of the two: A populist speech designed to show that I derived my political support, my advice and my concern directly from people themselves, not from powerful intermediaries or representatives of specialinterest groups.\n"", '""Populist"" is a word as you know, that comes from populus—people—and I think the people have been the origin of my own political incentives and my political strength.\n', 'Q. Which of out previous Presidents would you call yourself most akin to in philosophy?\n', ""Governor Carter. We've had a lot of great Presidents. My own personal favorite is Harry Truman. He revered the Presidency itself, and he used it in an aggressive fashion. The long-range concepts he had of foreign interrelationships, the courage he showed when he dealt with the firing of General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean war—all these are things that I admire.\n"", 'Q. Do you regard President Truman as a populist?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know, but I do think there was a cohesion within the Populist movement of different kinds of people who in the past had been excluded from having a proper voice in their own government.\n"", 'There was an aversion to inequities that had been built into the government structure by the powerful. In many ways, Truman did represent that concern.\n', 'I lean toward letting people themselves decide their own government and to having a guaranteed equity of treatment—a removal of the undue influence of special-interest groups—openness of government, a closeness between the President and the people themselves.\n', 'Q. Do you mean by that an activist, perhaps even an aggressive Presidency?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think so.\n', 'Q. What do you think will be the single most important issue influencing voters between now and November 2?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think that issue has changed. It is the desire to restore respect for and trust of the government within the consciousness of American people. The damage that has been done to people's atittudes toward government has been severe in the last few' years. We feel that we've lost the confidence in our government, the sensitivity of government to people's needs. The integrity of government, the openness of government have been damaged severely.\n"", ""Vietnam, Cambodia, Angola, CIA revelations, Watergate—all those things have tended to destroy the pride and the respect that has been a natural feeling of people toward our own government. We have been disconcerted, we've been alienated and embarrassed—sometimes have been ashamed of our own government.\n"", 'Our public opinion polls show that concern about government ranks far ahead of unemployment and inflation in voters\' minds. So the campaign may depend on the question: ""Which candidate can I trust to restore to my own government the things that are important to me?""\n', 'Q. Have other issues receded in importance?\n', 'Governor Carter. They are mirrored in many ways, depending on the individuals, as self-assessed needs.\n', ""Some people are intensely concerned about agricultural policy. Others are concerned about unemployment, particularly those that are unemployed. There's a general concern about the creeping tendency toward government intrusion into our private lives. There's a concern about the weakening of local government as contrasted with the federal government. There's concern about the gross, uncontrollable bureaucracy that's built up in Washington, the secrecy in the White House and in the Congress, the unwarranted influence of special-interest groups, the lack of a comprehensive and competent welfare system, inadequate health care, unfair tax structure.\n"", ""But specific issues are just part of it. The other concern of people is whether they can trust this candidate to do something about it. Can they trust this candidate to care about them? Do they have to go through some powerful intermediary to get to the candidate and his consciousness about what their needs and their families' needs are about?\n"", 'Q. Are you suggesting a Jacksonian approach to an open White House? Would you go that far?\n', 'Governor Carter. Not with mud-filled clodhopers—not that kind of concept.\n', 'But I would restore, for instance, the ""fireside chat"" format [used by Franklin D. Roosevelt] for explaining complicated questions to the public. I would restore frequent live press conferences that have now been abandoned.\n', 'I would press for a comprehesive ""sunshine"" law in the federal government—to open decision making meetings to the public. I would act through Executive order, prior to the time a law could be passed, to initiate more openness in government.\n', 'Q. Governor, does the Carter-Mondale ticket have particular vulnerability among Roman Catholic voters?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't believe so. Among the leaders within the Catholic Church there is an open, expressed concern about the abortion issue, about my Baptist beliefs that is not mirrored among the average citizens in the country who happen to be Catholic. It's something that we discern as a potential problem, but the public opinion poll results now show that there's no distinguishable difference between the support for me by Protestants as contrasted with the support from Catholics.\n"", 'Q. What do you feel are the strongest features of the Democratic ticket in terms of voter appeal?\n', ""Governor Carter. For one thing, the disaffection with the present Washington establishment, a feeling that there is a continuity present between Nixon's Administration and Ford's—not the Watergate disgrace, but that Ford is not exerting leadership to correct the deficiencies that existed when Nixon was here.\n"", ""Also, there is an advantage in the youthfulness of our ticket—averaging 50 years old. I'm 51 and Mondale is 48. This gives rise to the feeling that we might be innovative.\n"", 'Q. You have said that you anticipated a very personal, vicious attack against you and Senator Mondale in the campaign. What is your evidence of that?\n', ""Governor Carter. It's just a surmise. We should be ready for a very highly combative and hard-fought campaign.\n"", 'Q. On what points do you expect the attack?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've noticed that there have been statements made that if I were elected, the farmers would have the decisions made for them by the Washington bureaucracy, that we would have a termination of export sales overseas, and other ridiculous things of that kind. I've made just the opposite remarks.\n"", 'There have also been comments made that my promises to the American people would be grossly liberal, that the budget would be unbalanced, and that there would be no tight management of the federal spending policies— all of which I think is unjustified.\n', 'There have been statements made about Senator Mondale\'s liberality on some issues. I think basically his stand on the ""litmus test"" kind of things—concerning busing, for instance—is about the same as mine: I\'m against forced busing; so is he, I\'m not in favor of a constitutional amendment to try to outlaw busing, and neither is he.\n', 'Q. Charges have been made that your policies are going to re-ignite inflation—\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think my policies would contribute to increased inflation.\n"", 'Q. Do you expect the Republicans to zero in on the inflation issue?\n', 'Governor Carter. They are in an indefensible position:\n', ""We have an inflation rate of roughly 5 percent that is going to go up between now and November. I don't think we had that kind of inflation rate for 30 years before Nixon became President.\n"", ""We've got the highest unemployment levels in 25 years.\n"", 'We have had in the last three budgets 160 billion dollars in deficits— greater than all the accumulated deficits that existed from World War II right on up to 1974.\n', 'Q. It sounds as if you re running against Richard Nixon and not Gerald Ford. Is that your strategy?\n', ""Governor Carter. I haven't seen any change in direction or an attempt to change the policies that Nixon established since Ford has been in the White House. I think Ford has been a dormant, inactive President who has just enjoyed his domicile in the White House but has not addressed any of the problems that I see in the management of government.\n"", ""I don't know that Ford has continued the disreputable tragedy of Watergate attitudes that disgraced the White House. I don't attribute that sort of scandal to Ford at all.\n"", ""But as far as just adopting what Nixon's policies were and continuing them, I don't think there's any doubt that there's been almost absolute continuity there.\n"", 'Q. From the point of view of geography, in which regions of the country would you say that you are weakest?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would say New England and the industrial midsection of the country—in the Illinois-Indiana-Michigan area. But I would not write off any state.\n', 'Q. Will you campaign in all 50 states?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think it would be possible to go into all 50 states during this brief period of time.\n"", ""In general, I'll go where I can contribute most to the Democratic ticket, including myself and candidates for Congress or governor, U.S. Senate. And Senator Mondale will go where he can contribute the most.\n"", 'Q. If you win the election, Governor, should the nation expect rapid changes in policies—a quick succession of messages to Congress?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. In some areas, I would be ready for proposals immediately:\n', 'I would like to have complete authorization to reorganize the Executive Branch of government, giving me as much authority as possible.\n', 'I would like to be ready to propose welfare reform.\n', 'I would seek whatever minimal authority is necessary to start a complete assessment of tax reform in a comprehensive way—and, as I\'ve mentioned, the ""sunshine"" law: the openness of government.\n', 'I think I would be ready for the first stage of implementing an adequate health care program for the country. This would take three or four years, and I-would want to be careful to phase it in in a way that would be minimal in extra cost.\n', 'Q. Congress willing------\n', 'Governor Carter. I intend to keep all my promises. It may be that the Congress would not cooperate in some of those areas. If not, I reserve the right to go directly to the people of this country and present my case there.\n', ""There may be a danger, with so many proposals, that they will get in each other's way. But I think a compensating factor would be my inclination to capitalize on whatever mandate I get in November. The longer one waits on a controversial matter, the less chance he has of success. Q. You mentioned a reorganization of the Executive Branch. What do you have in mind?\n"", 'Governor Carter. The elimination of unnecessary agencies and departments, regulations and paperwork. That is going to take a long time. I want to get the authority immediately and have a presumption of congressional support as we initiate a long, detailed study. It would take at least a year.\n', 'But there is no question we will reduce the number of agencies. We now have 100 different programs, for instance, that could come under the generic name of ""welfare."" I don\'t think we need more than one or two. Nor do we need more than one or two agencies responsible for health care.\n', ""We now have had 1,900 categorical grant programs, compared to 150 when President Eisenhower w'ent out of office. The multiplicity of those programs puts an inordinate load on administrative bodies at the state and local levels. That has got to be addressed.\n"", 'Q. Will reduction in the number of agencies reduce the cost of government?\n', ""Governor Carter. As far as the percentage of budget that goes for administrative costs, there w'ould be a substantial savings there.\n"", ""As far as a total budget is concerned, I don't think it would result in any substantial reduction. But the effectiveness of delivery' services would be substantially enhanced.\n"", 'Q. How do you plan to cope with high unemployment if you become President?\n', ""Governor Carter. My strong commitment is to take the necessary action to bring about full employment, if possible, in the private sector of our economy. I don't favor government jobs as the principal way to alleviate the unemployment question. They cost too much at $8,000 to $10,000 per job.\n"", 'The government can help to revive construction. It can allocate research and development funds and establish comprehensive proposals on transportation and energy and agriculture. It can try to persuade both industry and labor to be responsible in their demands for increased prices and wages, involving them in the decision making processes. Those kinds of things would have a cumulative effect in creating jobs within the private sector.\n', ""There are, however, a couple of areas where I would want to have federal jobs available. One is the chronic welfare recipient who is able to work full time. About 1.3 million welfare recipients have nothing wrong with them physically or mentally. I would like to have, perhaps in a welfarereform package, a requirement that they be retained, then offered a job— and if they don't take a job, I w ouldn't want to pay them any more benefits.\n"", 'Another problem is unemployment among young people. We now have about a 20 to 23 percent unemployment rate among young Americans; 40 percent among black young Americans. I would like to pursue the concept of an approach like the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps] program we had during the depression years, this time oriented more to the urban areas than to the woods and rural areas.\n', 'Q. What is your thinking on tax reform?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think we'll ever have comprehensive equity established within the present income tax structure if you do it one section at a time or piecemeal, because the public has no idea what's going on. My premise would be to start from scratch rather than simply revise today's system. Many aspects of the present tax system, of course, would be part of the final result.\n"", 'Q. Can you indicate, at least broadly, your own approach?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would have as a major goal the drastic simplification of the tax structure. It now consists of about 40,000 pages in the Tax Code. I would treat all income basically the same. I would tax income only once. I would have a truly progressive tax structure so that those who have higher incomes would pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\n', ""There are some things in the current system that I would certainly want to preserve; the ability to make legitimate contributions for charitable purposes, for example. But I would want to make sure the foundations that were established for that purpose don't abuse the privilege.\n"", ""I'm concerned about the effect of delayed tax payments on profits overseas. I think it contributes to excessive unemployment in our nation when, for example, one of our corporations overseas makes a million dollars and reinvests it in, say, Italy because that way they don't have to pay any taxes on it If they bring it back to this country to reinvest it—to create new jobs—they have to pay taxes. That bothers me, and my inclination would be to abolish that privilege.\n"", 'On the other hand, the present right of a corporation overseas to deduct income tax payments made to another government is a legitimate thing and ought to be continued.\n', 'Q. When would you expect to present to Congress such a comprehensive tax reform program?\n', ""Governor Carter. The first part of 1978. I would want to let advocacy groups, from consumer advocates to the multinational corporations, be involved in the deliberations—probably in my presence—as well as professional analysts and economists. I don't expect to achieve any unanimity, obviously.\n"", 'I would also want to be very sure that representatives from the Congress, both the House and Senate, were involved in the detailed discussions—hopefully, at the initial stages of the study. I would be the one responsible for selling the proposition or the proposal to the people and to the Congress.\n', 'Q. Are you in favor of federalizing the entire welfare system?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I don't see any possibility of that. The approach that I took as governor was to try to remove from the local governments as much as possible the financing of statewide programs. I would take the same concept to the federal level. I don't think the property tax or the sales tax is a good base for financing the welfare system of our country.\n"", ""But I wouldn't propose to put the full responsibility for welfare payments onto the federal government. It may be that we would freeze the state contribution and let the federal government assume the responsibility for financing any increase in future cost brought about by broader coverage or by inflationary trends.\n"", ""But there needs to be some predictability about it. Mayors and governors and their compatriots of the state governments should be able to predict ahead of time how much they're going to have to pay.\n"", 'Q. In the field of health care, what are your proposals?\n', ""Governor Carter. We need a better health care and delivery system in this country. We're spending for every man, woman and child in our nation $550 a year. There are vast areas where health care is not available at all. We have little emphasis on preventive health care—less now than we had when I was a boy on the farm.\n"", ""The crux of the problem lies in the complete confusion that exists in the delivery of health care now. We have 72 different agencies responsible for physical health care. We have 37 agencies responsible for mental health care. We have 10 different major departments that are involved in health care. To have any sort of good health delivery system, you've got to have some way to have a clear assignment of responsibility for the delivery of health care to our people.\n"", ""Q. Where do you stand on abortion—and on the government's role in the matter?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I think abortion is wrong and that the government ought never do anything to encourage abortion. But I do not favor a constitutional amendment which would prohibit all abortions, nor one that would give states local option to ban abortions.\n', 'Government ought to do everything possible to minimize the need for abortions. We need a comprehensive national program designed to minimize abortions with better adoptive procedures, sex education and family planning.\n', 'Q. On foreign policy, would you press for a summit conference with other leaders soon after you took office?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would like to avoid very much travel myself during the first period of my administration if I am elected.\n', 'I think that a summit conference after the election would be important, but I would prefer that leaders of other countries come here.\n', 'Q. Do you feel that we should adopt a tougher approach nt pursuing détente with the Soviet Union?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I think so. The Soviets would respect that approach. I would also make our commitments much more public.\n', ""I think that the stature of our nation in international councils is darrtayd when the President and the Secretary of State speak just as two people, when there's no bipartisan assessment or support derived from the Congress, and when it's obvious that the American people don't know what is going on. It inherently makes the Secretary of State weak.\n"", 'Q. In what way would you be tougher toward the Soviet Union?\n', 'Governor Carter. We should have been much more aggressive when we attended the Helsinki Conference—or should have been absent in the first place.\n', ""We now have in Eastern Europe at least a tentative endorsement by our country of the domination of that region by the Soviet Union. They didn't have that before the Helsinki accords. It was a very great diplomatic achievement for the Soviets to have our promise not to interfere in their control over Eastern Europe.\n"", ""In response to our yielding on that point, there was an agreement on the Soviet Union's part that they would liberalize their policies toward human rights. They have not fulfilled those commitments.\n"", 'As we sell the Russians things that they must have—food in their drought years, electronics equipment, heavy machinery—we ought to get a quid pro quo from the Soviets.\n', ""I think it was a mistake, personally, to attach the Jewish-migration question to the trade bill: You can't have the legislative body of a sovereign nation requiring publicly that another sovereign nation accede to a certain demand in order to get a very slight favor. But freedom for Jews to leave Russia would be a legitimate and a very strong commitment of mine as President. As we negotiate with the Soviets, they should know that if they could yield on that point, it would greatly improve our relationships.\n"", 'I think we could ask them to help to resolve the Middle Eastern question, not let them stoke the fires; to help us avoid a future oil embargo; to try to give us stronger assurances that they would restrain Northern Korea from any possible attack on South Korea; to yield on controversial points in the SALT II talks.\n', 'There are a lot of things that we need and would like to have from the Soviet Union to insure peace around the world, and there are a lot of materials we have that they would need more of.\n', 'Q. Would you envisage moving quickly io normalize relations with Peking—perhaps involving recognition?\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I don't envision that. It's an ultimate goal that's good for us to maintain.\n"", ""Eventually we're going to have to recognize the existence of the People's Republic of China. But I would want to have an assurance in some way, to my satisfaction, that there would not be a military attack on Taiwan and that the Taiwanese people would be relatively independent and our commitment to them respected.\n"", 'Q. On the Middle East, should the United States underwrite the security of Israel as a way of bringing about a final setlement?\n', 'Governor Carter. Not a commitment to send troops, no. But I would let it be known to the world, and particularly the people of Israel, that our backing for Israel in economic and military aid is absolute, that this would be a national commitment of ours. Most Americans would agree with this: to give the Israelis whatever military or economic aid they need to protect the integrity of their country, their right to exist in peace.\n', 'I would also play a more aggressive role in searching for some degree of compatibility among Middle East nations. The situation there is fluid. The relationship, for instance, among Israel, Lebanon and Syria has changed in the last few months. That fluidity might create an opportunity for success. The Soviet Union may be seeing that their allegiances or alliances in the Middle East could be more advantageous with permanent peace assured.\n', ""The framework of United Nations Resolution 242 is a general one that everybody has adopted. The interpretation of the language is obviously widely diverse, depending on the point of view. But I think the recognition of Israel as a permanent entity in the Middle East—the non-belligerency status or declaration by their potential adversaries—is important; the willingness of Israel to cede back to other countries major portions of land acquired in the '67 war is an inevitable requirement.\n"", 'Some resolution of the Palestinian question is certainly inevitable. There are some very serious problems that would have to be addressed, possibly through secret negotiations and through concerted commitments to preserve the peace. One would be control of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem.\n', 'Q. In Africa, should the United States throw its weight behind the blackmajority rule in Rhodesia and even in South Africa!\n', 'Governor Carter. The historic expressions of our government in favor of majority rule ought to be continued.\n', ""The crisis in Rhodesia is much more acute than it is in South Africa. The principle is the same. There's a difference, obviously, between those two nations in that the South Africans have been there for, I think, 300 or 400 years.\n"", 'Q. On defense, Governor, would you make any fundamental changes in our military structure?\n', 'Governor Carter. Possibly. I do favor the continuation of our three delivery systems for atomic weapons until we can negotiate some overall reduction of weapons with the Soviet Union.\n', ""We are inferior to the Soviets in our land-based intercontinental mmflrs— greatly inferior. We have a rough equivalency at sea, and we are strongly superior in manned bombers. I think in general we have what is called rough equivalency. I certainly want to maintain that. But I don't think we could give up any of those three elements of international strategic defense.\n"", ""As far as redeployment of forces is concerned, I don't think we have had a substantive reassessment of strategic deployment since President Truman's time. In the past, a basic presumption has been that we had to be prepared for a major land war in the Far East and in the Western Pacific. I'm not sure that that's still a good supposition.\n"", ""I don't want to be more specific, but I think a reassessment of our strategic deployment of non-nuclear weapons and delivery systems is needed now.\n"", 'Q. Turning to the organization of your administration: If you win in November, would you change the role of the Cabinet?\n', 'Governor Carter. There would be a much heavier dependence on the Cabinet members to run their departments than we\'ve had in the past. I would not establish a ""palace guard"" in the White House with the authority to run the departments in the federal government. I don\'t say that lightly. A lot of people say, ""Well, I\'ve heard that before.""\n', 'When I was Governor of Georgia, we never tried to run the state government just with my personal staff. I chose the best people I could, the strongest advocates for those who received services from their department, and good managers.\n', ""I would make sure that every person I put in charge of a major department in the Capital would be a good manager. I would lean, I think, toward people who've had experience—maybe as governors, for instance—and who would be compatible with me. They should be able spokesmen for and have a strong belief in the purpose of their department. For example, I would choose someone to head up the Defense Department who believed in a strong defense.\n"", 'Q. Given a strong Cabinet, what role do you have in mind for the White House staff? Will it arbitrate disputes between Cabinet members?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think not, except that when you have a Director, say, of the National Security Council or his successor, that would certainly be a very strong and influential person.\n', 'I would say the appointments secretary would be the one to provide access to me.\n', ""And the relationship that I would establish between the White House and the Office of Management and Budget would be much closer than we've known in the past. I think that would obviate the need for a large White House staff. We would make reductions in the size of the staff.\n"", 'Q. How do you think the style of leadership in a Carter White House would differ from that in the Ford White House?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't detect any leadership emanating from the White House at this point.\n"", ""I would try to find in my own mind what improvements might be made in legislation and government policy. I'd take on myself the responsibility for being the one to present changes to the Congress and to the people and pursue those changes aggressively once I've decided what ought to be done.\n"", 'I would also involve the Congress in an intimate way, as much as they would permit me, in the evolution of new proposals.\n', 'Q. It has been said that one of your faults as Governor of Georgia was an unwillingness to compromise with the state legislature. Would you anticipate similar problems in dealing with Congress?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, sir. But there are several things that can be done. I learned a lot as governor, and t think that's one of the things that I did learn.\n"", 'Q. To compromise more often?\n', 'Governor Carter. When to compromise and when not to compromise. The best way to deal with it is to have engendered within the consciousness of the President and the Congress a feeling of mutual respect, as well as continuing consultation and sharing of ideas.\n', 'Along with that would come an openness to let the public know what we are doing and to restore the concept in the Congress that their constituents are also my constituents. I have just as much right and responsibility to reach to the people for support as a Member of Congress does.']"
69,Jimmy Carter ,"September 13, 1976","[""This morning, I particularly want to talk about a subject that's important to me. And that is the small businessman in our nation. It is an extremely great honor for me to have John Sparkman here with us—a great Senator, a great leader, a candidate of our own party in 1952 for Vice President, and this man has also, as you know, been a leader in the Senate, as a chairman of the Small Business Committee. He's now gone to the Foreign Affairs Committee, but his leadership in this field makes it extremely valuable for me to have him on the platform with me.\n"", ""We haven't had a fanner in the White House since Thomas Jefferson. We haven't had a small businessman in the White House since Hany Truman. And so we're going to bring a lot of good things to the White House after this election.\n"", ""I think it's good to point out my own background—very briefly—to lay the groundwork for my credentials in speaking on this subject\n"", ""I came home from the Navy in the winter of 1953. I moved into the government housing project to live. I started a small business, a continuation of what my father had done selling fertilizer. We reorganized, and my mother and I became partners together. The first year was 1954. Those of you who are farmers remember 1954. It was the worst drought year the South has ever seen in recorded history. We had a crop failure. And although I sold about 3,000 tons of fertilizer, and should have made about $9,000 gross profit, my profit was less than $300. I didn't make enough money to pay my house rent in the government housing project\n"", 'The next year my wife went to work. That made two of us in the business. In the third year, I hired my first employee. But I had to struggle then, as a professional Naval officer, to learn about accounts receivable, to learn about balancing budgets, to learn about payroll, and to learn about government red tape and paperwork which at that time was practically nothing compared to what it is now.\n', 'In a few years, I was still struggling. And I went to the Small Business Administration for a loan to build an office building which I needed, and to build a cotton gin, and to make an investment in better handling equipment for peanuts. And at that time I was proud of the Small Business Administration. It was honest; it was open; it was well oiganized; it had a very close, very intimate relationship with the private lending institutions of our area. I believe that 90 percent of my loan came from the local bank. But the SBA guaranteed the loan and put up 10 percent of the money.\n', 'Later, year by year, top business executives, on a volunteer basis, would come down to Plains, and they would go through Carter\'s warehouse. I opened my books to them. And they said, ""Jimmy, this is something I think you\'d better watch. Here\'s an area where you can save money. This is something that you ought to quit doing.""\n', ""And I felt that I had a partnership between those who knew about business and those who were willing to lend me the money and myself as an embryonic businessman. That's all changed now.\n"", ""We don't have a Small Business Administration of which we can be truly proud. In the last few years we've had I don't know how many indictments and twenty convictions in the Small Business Administration. And the organizational structure of the agency is deteriorated along with a lot of other aspects of government.\n"", ""This Republican Administration has given us a lot of new things. The first $200 billion budget. The first $300 billion budget. The first $400 billion budget. We're now spending over a billion dollars a day, and our deficit is a billion dollars a week.\n"", ""In the last eight years we've seen the number of bankruptcies more than double. From 15,000 in 1969 to over 30,000 this past year. We've seen interest rates go up 50 percent. We've seen unemployment go up more than 100 percent. We've seen the deficits, the unbalanced budgets, increase grossly. Harry Truman for 7 years had an average surplus over $2 billion. Johnson/Kennedy (including the deficit of the Vietnam War) had an average deficit of less than $7 billion. Under Nixon and Ford, this Republican Administration, the average deficit has been more than $24 billion a year. And the last two deficits, recommended by the President, have averaged over $50 billion a year. This, as I said earlier, is a billion dollars every week. We go further in debt. This is the kind of improper management that really grates on the consciousness of a businessman.\n"", ""Now my professional training is in engineering, science, my career training has been in planning, in managing a business, in running a farm. I produce certified seed on my farm—mostly peanuts. And I process peanuts now, starting this past year, for the market. I know what it means to meet a payroll. I know what it means not to waste my own money. I know what it means to have balanced budgets. I know what it means as a governor not to waste the taxpayers' money.\n"", ""I have never known an unbalanced budget—in my business, on my farm, as Governor of Georgia. And I've set a goal for myself, which I intend to meet: that before my administration is over, the budget of the United States will be balanced.\n"", ""I've learned some other things. Whenever there is a choice between government performing functions, and the private sector performing the functions, I believe in the private sector having the responsibility. Whenever there is a choice between the federal government doing something or the state and local governments doing the same function, I believe it's best to place the responsibility and the authority as near as possible to the individual private citizen.\n"", ""I believe in a maximum openness in government My government is your government And whenever it is wrapped in secrecy, and the people are excluded from the process of making decisions, that's when we make our serious mistakes in foreign affairs, as Senator Sparkman so well knows, and in domestic affairs. You can go back the last number of years, whenever we've had a serious mistake, it has been because the American people have not been part of the process of making the decisions and carrying them out So maximum openness in government and a maximum personal privacy of our citizens is a good commitment to which we need to return. We need to have confidence in ourselves. Our nation's strong—economically—strongest nation on earth. Richard Nixon didn't hurt our system of government Watergate didn't hurt our system of government. The Vietnamese-Cambodian war didn't hurt our system of government. The CIA revelations haven't hurt our system of government Even the gross mismanagement of programs like the Medicaid and SBA programs haven't hurt our system erf government It's still a basis on which we can predicate answers to complicated questions, bind ourselves together and face the future with confidence. We ought to remember that The greatest thing which we have and which we can depend on in the future is the American people. We still have within us the same intelligence, the same ability, the same patriotism, the same of brotherhood, the same commitment to the work ethic, the same belief in personal freedom, the same high moral character that we've always had.\n"", ""And that's a tremendous resource that's waiting to be tapped. And next January, it's going to be tapped again. And you can depend on that.\n"", ""Now what can we do specifically to help small businessmen and women? We've got a lot more women in this country who have now decided to go into their own professional careers. In not just education, but in medicine, law, and also in business. So what can we do to help diem? First of all, we need to have more private investment participation in loans for the new starting business. This has gone backwards in recent years. We need to have more equity capital and not debt financing. The trend here has been absolutely terrible. We've gone more and more to a debt financing of business establishments and business expansion instead of letting business finance their own improvements with equity. We need to have more top business executives volunteer to work in government. Now when I was elected governor, we reorganized the structure of government We put in good electronic data processing, good personnel management, good transportation systems. We cut down red tape, eliminated paperwork as much as we could. And the ones on whom I called to help me with that were the top business executives. I have told you already how they came into my own small business in Plains to give me advice. That's an important resource that our country ought to tap.\n"", ""I might add one other thing. It's not fair to blame the business community for the mistakes that government makes. The business community is as honest as any farmer or any preacher, if we can understand that the government treats us fairly. Now if there is an excusing by government of the violation of the law of business, quite often this grows on itself. It ought to be competitive. If business becomes involved in illegalities, and improprieties of government, but business is basically honest, more so than they're given credit for and one thing a President can do is to help restore the stature and the approval and the public support and the confidence in the business community.\n"", ""It's a cheap shot when elected public officials blame the business community for the economic, social and political problems of our country.\n"", ""Another thing that we must do is to increase the chance for small businesses to compete for government contracts. The Republican Administration has paid lip service to small businesses and big service to big businesses, and that's got to be changed too in the next administration.\n"", ""We need to increase the opportunity for sales of products produced in small business. Most very large businesses have their own built-in organization—legal staff, lobbyists, overseas sales mechanisms and outlets. But small businesspersons, like myself—I'm sure most of you are bigger than I am in business—have a very difficult time understanding how to sell our products overseas. It's a tremendous market. We now export, for instance, in agriculture alone, $24 billion of our products every year. When I was Governor of Georgia, I joined in a hot competition with Governor Wallace and Governor West in South Carolina and Governor Askew in Florida because in the Southeast, one of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of a governor is to increase job opportunities by bringing in new industry and by selling the products we produce. While I was governor, we established and we maintained trade offices all over the world. We now have full-time trade offices just for Georgia, in places like Sao Paulo, Brazil; Toronto, Canada; Bonn, Germany; Brussels, Belgium; two in Japan, Great Britain, and so forth. Just to have a focal point in foreign countries so that a business person large or small can make arrangements there to make a trip to Great Britain or a trip to Common Market countries or a trip to South America, or a trip to Japan, and have the arrangements made to meet with the top leaders to sell products there and to get increased investments in our state.\n"", ""When I went to these foreign countries, like for instance Brazil, a tremendous potential market for our products, there would be hot competition. The Japanese, the Germans, the Chinese and small places like Bulgaria, the French and others would be there. And they would have government, business, labor, and agriculture representatives in a trade mission and they would sit down with the leaden in Brazil and say, this is the product we have to offer, this is the delivery date that we can meet, this is the quality of our products, this is the cost of them, this is the interest rate we'll chaige, this is the repayment schedule. And if they could offer a good package, they'd sign a contract right there. I went down with business and labor and agriculture leaders of Georgia. And when I tried to get an answer from Washington, on a specific trade deal, I never could find which department to go to. It's absolutely impossible. Is it Agriculture? Is it Commerce? Is it Treasury? Is it State? Is it Defense? Nobody knows. We need to have the same kind of commitment to overseas trade to put our people back to work on a nationwide basis as the southern states have done in the last number of yean to overcome the aftermath of the war between the states a hundred yean ago.\n"", 'The world is waiting for good, top quality products that our nation can produce. But quite often they wait in vain because of the bureaucratic mess that we have in Washington, and that needs to be straightened out as well.\n', ""I just want to mention a couple of other things that are specific. We need to have tough enforcement of the antitrust laws. Our system of private enterprise must be preserved. And when the government does anything to lessen competition it hurts us all. It hurts the small businessman, it hurts big business, and particularly it hurts consumers. Tough enforcement of the antitrust laws is mandatory. Now the Republican Administration has stood in the way of the enforcement Mr. McLaren, under President Nixon, resigned, and recently the top Assistant Attorney General under this administration has also quit in disgust because of a lack of enforcement or commitment to tighter antitrust policies that have been proposed to the Congress. We need to break up the sweetheart arrangement between regulatory agencies and industries being regulated. Regulation on business is almost unbelievable. In 1975 alone, the 82 regulatory agencies in Washington put out 45,000 pages of regulations. Now a big business organization can take care of that perhaps because they can have a superb full-time CPA staff and secretarial pools and attorneys. But a small businessman can't deal with those regulations, without a great deal of hardship and many obstacles placed in his or her way to success. The tax laws are a disgrace to the human race, and they have got to be reformed completely to give us a fair deal from our own government. Quite often businesses will take an action that's contrary to their long terms best interest just to get a one year's credit under the tax laws. I happen to be mainly a farmer and in the processing of farm products. But a very wealthy dweller—a lawyer, a doctor and so forth— who wants to have a deliberate loss to benefit from tax shelters can come in and buy the farm next to mine, deliberately lose the investment, make a great deal of profit off of it, and provide unwanted competition with the rest of us. As you know, the same thing applies under the tax shelter programs, in the area of oil drilling, or any other aspect of our lives. So the tax program has got to be revised to remove this unwanted intrusion into the business community, and the decision making process.\n"", ""We also need tough, competent, business like management of the government itself. We now have over 2,900 agencies, departments, bureaus, and commissions in Washington. They need to be cut back drastically to make sure we eliminate confusion, overlapping and waste. We need to install also zero-based budgeting which means that every year you reassess every program in the executive budget. You eliminate obsolete programs, you reveal and eliminate overlapping in the agencies, and you establish priorities that spend your next year's money where the money's needed to be spent next year—not where it was supposed to be spent 50 years ago. And we need a sunset law to review every major department, regulatory agencies included, at least every five years—initiated by the Senate and the House. So zero-based budgeting, tough competent management, sunset laws by the Congress, will help weed out those obsolescent agencies that create most of the unnecessary paperwork and red tape. That's going to come next year, as well.\n"", ""The last point I want to mention is this. We need to have more cooperation among the different entities in our society. Between governments at all levels—business, industry, labor, agriculture, education and science, and others. There is no way now to tell what the government is going to do next. I don't favor the government planning for the private sector in our society. But the government ought to let us know what the government is going to do next so that we can make our plans accordingly. Now, I need to know 15 months ahead of time what agriculture policies are going to be in existence—on acreage allotments, target prices, reserve supplies, exports, imports, I don't have the slightest idea what Mr. Butz is going to do next. That's typical of the kind of administration we've got in Washington, and although I've got a lot of priorities when I get to the White House, I think the first one is going to be to send Mr. Butz back where he came from and have a good agriculture policy. So farmers and the business people of our country don't want a handout. We believe in work. We don't believe in welfare. We want to be sure we have a competitive area in which to operate.\n"", ""We don't want special favors. We want some predictability about it. We do not want to have the rug pulled out from under our feet after we make a commitment that can't be reversed. Now cooperation ought to extend between the White House and the Congress. I believe that I can cooperate as President with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders. This has been done in the past. There's a constitutional delineation of responsibility. It's time for the White House and the Congress to cooperate for a change, with mutual respect for a change. I know that the Congress is inherently incapable of leadership. You can't expect 535 different people to lead this country. Our founding fathers never thought that that would happen. No matter how strong the individual Members of Congress are, there's only one person that can speak with a clear voice to the American people. There's only one person that can set a standard of ethics and morality and commitment. There's only one person that can call on the American people to make a sacrifice when necessary and explain the purpose of that sacrifice. There's only one person that can answer complicated questions or propose bold programs to deal with our needs. There's only one person that can insure cooperation and unity within our complicated nation. There's only one person that can harness the tremendous resources of our country to support a strong defense and understandable foreign policy.\n"", ""And that person is the President In our absence of that leadership, there is no leadership. We have no leadership now. Our country is drifting. I can't recall a single thing that our incumbent President has done in the two year period that indicates a capability for leadership.\n"", ""Our nation cries out for clear statements of where we are, and where we hope to be. And this depends upon a close relationship between the White House and Congress, but also between the President and the people. Now I've run my campaign that way all my political life. I started out 21 months ago without any built-in organization, I didn't have very much money; I came from the small town of Plains, not a major media center. Plains was not a major media center at that time—I didn't hold public office, not many people knew who I was. But I and my family and a few other supporters began going from one front living room to another, only 4 or 5 people would come in, and from one labor hall to another. Maybe 10 or 12 people would come. We went to farmers markets, to livestock sale bams, county court houses, city halls, shopping centers, factory shift lines, barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, shaking hands, talking a little bit, listening more. And we built up an organizational structure quite often with people who had never been before involved in politics. It's a close relationship between me and the people of our nation.\n"", ""And I feel secure in my political campaign and even with the prospect of the awesome responsibility of President, because of that relationship with the people. I don't know all the answers. I'm just an average American like you. I got involved in politics almost by accident. But I enjoy the public service.\n"", 'But I believe the fact that I have been an engineer, and a scientist, and a farmer, and a businessman, and a local school board member, state senator, a. governor, and have campaigned throughout the country, will stand me in good stead if I get to the White House.\n', ""But the greatest source of confidence and strength that I have is the fact that the people with their experience and intelligence, with their commitment to our country, with their high moral character, is where I get my support, and my advice, and my counsel, and my criticism. If I can keep that close relationship, and tap that tremendous resource—it's what our nation is—then I think I can have a good administration next year.\n"", ""I owe special interests nothing. I owe the people everything. And I'm going to keep it that way. If you think it's time for a change in Washington, I hope you'll help me. I think it's time for a change for the better.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
70,Jimmy Carter ,"September 13, 1976","[""In an interview aboard his chartered 727 jet as it soared between Seattle and Des Moines, Jimmy Carter sketched an urban policy that reached beyond anything he has said before. He claimed that as President he would: be inclined to favor stretching New York City's current fiscal plan from 3 to 5 or more years, allowing the city more time to balance its budget;\n"", '• favor the eventual assumption by the federal government of the full cost of the ""basic welfare package."" Previously he spoke of eliminating the city\'s share and the ""phased reduction"" of the state\'s contribution;\n', '• support special federal aid to carefully targeted urban areas, much as special assistance was provided Appalachia in the 1960\'s. Previously he favored aid based on some ""national criteria"" such as poverty or unemployment rates;\n', '• seek to forge minimum federal standards to encourage productivity and management improvements by state and local governments. Previously he had spoken of improving the management of just the federal government\n', 'The interview was taped on August 24, as the coatless Carter relaxed in his usual seat in the front row of the first-class compartment.\n', 'Q. You have opposed legislation mandating where people live; yet you are also committed to an integrated society. For the last 20 years our cities have become more racially polarized. What would you do, as President, about cities that are becoming less integrated?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, one of the important aspects of housing as it relates to community evolution is the legal, constitutional right of a family to live where it pleases, not to be excluded by the residents of a particular community because of race or ethnic background. That would be enforced under my administration. I was aggressive in doing this in Georgia, and it was accepted by my own people.\n', 'Second, the provisions of the 1974 Housing Act are adequate; die act provides that when federal money is spent for housing, there has to be an affirmative action program presented by the community—using the term ""community"" in the generic sense—to insure that housing is available for families with different levels of income and different ethnic backgrounds scattered throughout the community. That doesn\'t mean that every block has to have different kinds of races represented, but it does mean, in general sections of a community, that the housing has to be dispersed with affirmative action efforts. I would insist on that also.\n', ""A third aspect of integration would be a deliberate act by a government to change the ethnic character of a neighborhood by encouraging, artificially, different kinds of families to move into a neighborhood that might be different from the ones already there. I would not do that. I think that it's all right in this society, within the bounds of the first two positions that I described to you, to have the ethnic character or history or background of a community preserved.\n"", ""Q. America's older cities are losing their jobs, middle-income taxpayers, and businesses. As they lose their tax base, they lose their ability to pay for the increased services needed for those poor people who remain. You favor the lifting of the cost of welfare from the backs of local government. Would you ask the state to pick up any part of the city's current welfare costs?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Most states have already done this. And in the Constitutional Convention 8 or 10 years ago in New York, it was proposed that over a period of time the city's contribution to welfare be paid by and shifted to the state. I would anticipate, under a comprehensive welfare reform package I intend to propose to Congress, that the contribution of the state and city, combined, be frozen, and that over a period of time, the total levels be absorbed by the federal government\n"", 'Q. Are you not for the immediate removal of the 25 percent of welfare costs New York City now pays?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't see how that could be done abruptly. Obviously, that would be a major goal of mine. But the phasing in of a new welfare system would have to encompass 2 or 3 years, and the first step should be to set up a minimum payment to meet the necessities of life of a family that deserves such assistance, and the alleviating of the payment of this cost by the property tax, and later, over a period of time, the reduction [of the amount] that would be paid by the state.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor the idea of the state and city eventually paying nothing for welfare and the full cost being picked up by the federal government?\n', 'Governor Carter. Of the basic welfare package, yes. But I would never remove the constitutional right of a state or city to vote bonus payments, or additional payments, above and beyond what is established as adequate for the whole nation by the Congress.\n', 'Q. Many people wonder whether we should continue to tinker with welfare reform proposals rather than replace the current system with something very different. How do you feel about a guaranteed annual income?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there are three categories of persons who need and deserve assistance. One is the working poor, those who work full-time but still have an income level below the poverty level as defined at that moment. Here, some supplement to their income would be advisable. Secondly, the parttime employees—those who are physically and mentally able to work, but because of inadequate training, inadequate education, and inadequate motivation, or because of lack of knowledge about job opportunities, don't work full-time—they ought to be cared for with training programs, matched for the job, and offered a job. If they don't take a job, I would cut their payments off.\n"", ""The third category is those who will be permanently on welfare. Those are the ones also who ought to stay under the present framework of the welfare system—the other two would have it removed. [In the third category] are women with, say, two or more dependent children, where an outside job might be more costly than the woman taking care of her own children: or the elderly, or the blind, who are severely handicapped and can't work fulltime.\n"", ""But in all those instances, there ought to be, as I've expressed many times, one basic income level to meet the necessities of life, varying in amount only enough to accommodate the cost-of-living standards as you go from one community to another.\n"", 'Q. New York State and its local governments pay about $3 billion a year for Medicaid. Obviously they want to be relieved of some of that cost. What relief does a Carter Administration promise?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, again, as a general premise, the thing that bothers local and state governments most is the unanticipated and very rapid increase in their contributions to health care. My custom, as governor, in this and other areas of life, was to freeze the amount that the local government paid. I would do the same thing with the state. And in a very carefully planned way over a period of, say, 4 years, projecting to the fiscal year 1981 budget, let them know what anticipated payments they would have to make.\n', 'I would not favor an immediate takeover of welfare or Medicare or Medicaid costs by the federal government. If you did that, you would have an enormous increase in the federal budget with no increase in the quality of services. So a predictable absorption of those increased costs by the federal government would be the best approach.\n', 'Q. You say ""increased costs""; what about current costs?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't promise that. I would guess that over a period of time we might actually reduce the total amount of contribution of the local and state governments to health care.\n"", ""Q. In the Northeast we are in a sort of depression, with unemployment rates 2 percent above the national average and the growth rate lagging behind the nation's. In terms of federal aid formulas, you have talked about having some national criteria, such as poverty or unemployment levels, to give extra aid to areas that need it most. Would you also favor special federal aid to depressed regions, such as the federal government gave to Appalachia during the sixties?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would rather allot special federal aid to much narrower targets than the entire 11 or 12 or 15 state regions of the country, as was the case with Appalachia. We also need, under existing federal programs regarding pollution control, housing, law enforcement, and so forth, to concentrate those allocations of funds where they are most needed, which would fall within the inner-city areas. In the past, when we passed a housing program, quite often it was the Congress' intention that that money go to the people who needed it the most. But because of the intelligence and educational level and the political influence and good organizations, say, in the suburbs, they sapped away a great deal of the available federal assistance for housing and other programs, to the detriment of the inner cities, where the concerted grantsmanship was not so well developed. Those two forces would be what I would pursue: immediately to let existing aid go where it is needed the most, and, secondly, to have regional aid designed but [focused] on much narrower targets than the one you described.\n"", 'Q. Could you define a narrow target?\n', 'Governor Carter. A city, or it might even be a particular industry, or it might be a particular age group. But let me add one thing. My own economic advisers say that if we do this targeting of job opportunities, we can reach at least one-half percent lower unemployment without increasing the inflationary pressures by targeting. If you do something nationwide, you get high inflation pressures. If you target it, the inflation pressures are much less for a given level of unemployment.\n', 'Q. In terms of federal aid formulas, New York and parts of the northeast region have a roughly 20 percent higher cost of living than the rest of the nation. Would you favor federal aid formulas which take into account that higher cost of living?\n', 'Governor Carter. In some categories of assistance, yes. Welfare would be one example.\n', 'Q. A chief cause of the decline of older cities is the real—and perceived— threat of crime. Since the police and criminal justice systems are primarily local functions, what role can a President play in combating crime?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there again I think we've had an inappropriate allocation of Law Enforcement Administration funds. Quite often they've been allotted without regard to the crime rate existing within a certain community. And this was the case with housing which I described earlier. I think that these available federal funds ought to go where the need is greatest. We also can concentrate the services of our national law enforcement agencies—for instance, the Treasury Department and the FBI—in areas where a crime rate is higher. I think that would help. There's another aspect of it and that is that the root of the rapid increase in the crime rate, in my opinion, is high unemployment. To the extent that we can alleviate unemployment by the targeting of job opportunities, that would help reduce the crime rate. The last thing is this: we have inadequate cooperation between poor families and police officers, and an inadequate assignment of police officers within a city or perhaps a state, to the areas where the crime rate is highest. By just using my own expressions of opinion, publicly, I think I can call attention to those facts, still leaving it up to the local and state government to make that ultimate decision. I would also pursue the possibility of having minority groups—low income areas where black citizens or those who speak foreign languages [live]—help police themselves. And I think if we put a major responsibility on the shoulders of leaders within those communities, it would help a great deal. A domestic Peace Corps-type effort, with a heavy concentration of volunteers as policemen's aides, would help.\n"", ""Q. Would you set federal standards, say, for local crime control efficiency or government productivity or regional cooperation? Do you believe in the federal government's setting standards as a way of forcing state and local governments to be more efficient?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, if those standards are reasonable and acceptable to the vast majority of state government officials, yes, I would consider their use.\n', 'Q. As you know, the greatest growth in government is at the local and state government levels. Would you try to set federal standards for better management and productivity at those levels?\n', ""Governor Carter. I have never hesitated to do this as Governor of Georgia. But I've always been very careful to let the local officials have the major voice in establishing those standards. When that's done, there's a much more ready acceptance of them. If there is an adamant opposition to the initiation of those standards, which there inevitably would be if the government in Washington imposed them arbitrarily, then the effort would be doomed to failure.\n"", ""Q. Governor, you said that if elected you plan to meet with Mayor Beame and Governor Carey in order to devise what you call a 5 to 8 year plan for New York City. Does this suggest that you favor stretching the city's current 3 year plan?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't answer that question yet. My hope is that the present schedule can be maintained. I have not monitored the progress that is being made. But I think when I made that statement—I don't back off on it— my guess then was that the 3 year plan was too rigid. My guess is still that it is. If I can see, after meeting with Mayor Beame and Governor Carey and with the economic advisers who would help us all, that the 3 year plan can be met, I will stick with it. If it cannot be met, then I would go along with a longer period of time.\n"", 'Q. And you would ask Congress to stretch the federal loan program beyond the current 3 years?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's correct.\n"", ""Q. The New York State Constitution prohibits the state from making long-term loans for the city of New York. You had previously opposed direct federal guarantees of municipal securities. Because of New York's peculiar situation, does that mean you would favor direct federal guarantees for New York City securities?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Not necessarily. The statement I have always made is that I would never bypass the state and deal with a city unilaterally. I think a lot of the city's problems have originated in Albany, in the state legislature, particularly when Rockefeller was governor. And so I think that it would be a serious mistake for me, as President, working with the Congress, to circumvent the responsibility and the authority of the governor and the State Legislature to deal directly with New York. And if there is a technical prohibition, which, I understand, there is in the New York Constitution, I believe that can be handled as well. New York State has shown a remarkable ability in the past, by the way, to circumvent the bonding restrictions when it chose.\n"", 'Q. The SEC is currently investigating whether federal fraud was involved in the sale of city securities. As President, would you favor pursuing that investigation?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I would. I also favor the SEC or some other entity—maybe the Congress itself—setting the same kind of standards on the revelation of circumstances surrounding the integrity of bonds to be issued as are now required with municipal and privately issued bonds.\n', 'Q. The governors of the northeastern states have proposed a Regional Reconstruction Finance Agency for economic development. Would you favor that or some kind of a federal RFC, patterned after the New Deal?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that question yet. ... It would be a mistake for those who live in New England to assume that local unemployment is a unique problem under the Republic Administration. It's nationwide, with a few pockets of prosperity.\n"", 'Q. The problem in all cities across the country is how to retain—if not attract—income-generating businesses or middle-income taxpayers. A Reconstruction Finance Agency of some kind might create the ability to help capital investments. Would you favor it on a national level, much as was done during the New Deal?\n', ""Governor Carter. I hate to tie myself to the exact framework that was started in the RFC. As I've said, a federal guarantee of local bonds would probably be advisable.\n"", 'Q. You have talked about having a Special Assistant for Urban Affairs if you are elected. Would you go beyond that, with say, a Cabinet office for Urban Affairs?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, my establishing new departments in the federal government would be rare. My own inclination is to reduce the total number of boards, agencies, bureaus, commissions, and departments that we have now and make those that are presently extant workable and efficient There needs to be much greater attention given, as I said earlier in the interview, to assuring that the programs designed to help the most needy people in this country actually go to those who have the greatest needs. That has not been the case in the past with transportation funds, law-enforcement funds, pollution funds, education funds, health funds, welfare funds, housing funds. That ought to be done first. Then if we see that's inadequate to meet the needs in areas such as you describe, I would consider a second step.\n"", 'Q. Whom do you listen to for advice on the cities?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I listen to a lot of people. I have 300 or 400 persons now, from the academic world and from within the structure of the mayor's councils, who volunteered to help me. And I deal directly with leaders who happen to serve in public life. Obviously, one of my good advisers would be [Mayor] Henry Maier from Milwaukee; [also Mayor] Pete Flaherty from Pittsburgh, and Mayor Beame from New York. My inclination is to combine the practical approach from public officials who have the responsibility to administer municipal affairs with the academic and nationally experienced persons who served in the past in agencies in government.""]"
71,Jimmy Carter ,"September 15, 1976","['Over the last eight years, the Republican Administration has given the American people the worst economic record since the Great Depression.\n', ""I have described before the combination of high unemployment, high inflation, and high budget deficits—a combination unprecedented in our history—which has brought layoffs to one-third of our families, imposed the tax of inflation on us all, and lowered the American worker's standard of living for the first time in a generation.\n"", 'Today I would like to discuss the reasons why. I would like to tell you about the nine economic errors of the Nixon-Ford years—nine mistakes that caused our current economic crisis.\n', ""Richard Nixon made the first mistake almost as soon as he took office. He announced in 1969 that the government would take no interest when major companies decided to raise their prices. The result was predictable. Prices rose faster during Nixon's first year in office than at any other time since the Korean War—though not as fast as they would rise later in the administration.\n"", ""Nixon made his second mistake by overreacting to his first. After less than a year in office, he decided it was time to fight inflation by putting people out of work. High interest rates and tight fiscal policies meant that factories slowed down and workers were laid off. Soon the unemployment rate was up, from 3.4 percent in early 1S69, to 5.9 percent just two years later. During Richard Nixon's first two years in office, 2.2 million Americans joined the unemployment rolls. Later, Gerald Ford was to beat this terrible record.\n"", 'Having created a recession, the Republicans overreacted again—and made their third mistake. It was called the New Economic Policy, and it was designed to reduce unemployment, while holding down prices through wage-price controls. But it was a short-sighted and poorly-planned approach.\n', 'The sudden, sporadic freezes and phases only disrupted the economy and paralyzed its growth. Rigid, over-bureaucratic, control schemes created bottlenecks and shortages throughout the economy. Such poorly designed controls could not last forever, and when they were taken off, prices soared. The aftermath of the New Economic Policy was a 13 percent inflation rate—the worst of modem times.\n', ""The fourth mistake came in 1972, when Nixon tried to play the expedient game of election year economics. He tried suddenly to pump up the economy, using massive federal spending and loose monetary policy in an attempt to get people on the job by election day. But this unplanned, careless influx of money did nothing to restore the economy's basic health. It created further bottlenecks and, while unemployment remained high, inflation got even worse.\n"", 'After the election, Nixon made his fifth economic mistake. Poor harvests around the world, and international shortages of certain commodities, had set the stage for inflation. But instead of relieving the problem, the Republican policy quickly made it worse. The massive, clandestine sale of wheat to Russia cheated the American farmer and left the American consumer totally unprotected against inflation. During the year following the grain sale, food prices rose by 20 percent—more than their increase during all of the Kennedy-Johnson years combined.\n', 'Richard Nixon made his sixth economic mistake with a last desperate swing back to fighting inflation. Beginning in the summer of 1973, the Federal Reserve Board tried to cut back the money supply. Interest rates soared. Buying anything on time was expensive, but buying a house was worse. Tight money meant you had to put up a larger down payment than before, and then take a mortgage at 10 percent—if you could get one at all. Between the winter of 1973 and the winter of 1975, the number of new housing units fell by about 60 percent. The unemployment rate in the housing industry is still extremely high, at 17 percent.\n', 'When Richard Nixon resigned, Gerald Ford inherited a difficult situation. But in a few short weeks, he unerringly turned difficulty into disaster.\n', ""In October 1974, Ford made his first economic mistake—the seventh of the Republican Administration. On the verge of the nation's worst postwar recession, Ford put on his WIN button and asked the Congress to raise taxes. Unemployment soared. By the end of his first six months in office, 2.3 million more people were out of work than when he began. No more was heard of the WIN buttons. If Congress had agreed to these disastrous plans, many more millions would have lost their jobs.\n"", ""Congress also refused to join in the eighth, and potentially the most disastrous, of the Nixon-Ford errors—the deliberate attempt to raise energy prices. The nation needs to conserve fuel, but Mr. Ford's crude policies seemed designed to save gasoline by making sure that no one had a job to drive to. Unemployment increased by yet another 800,000 people in the second six months of Ford's term. If Congress had agreed with the mistake to hike energy prices, the recession of 1974 and 1975 would have been even worse.\n"", 'In the last 18 months, Ford has made the ninth, and hopefully his last, economic mistake. His actions have destroyed precisely the programs that could reduce unemployment, and increase productivity, by training and targeting workers for the jobs the nation needs done.\n', ""That's the Republican record. The Republicans have had their innings— no runs, few hits, and nine errors.\n"", ""Mr. Ford says he's proud of that record. Let's look at it more closely. Let's compare the rhetoric with the reality.\n"", ""Unemployment.—Only a few months ago, Mr. Ford's advisors were predicting that unemployment would be below 7 percent sometime this year. Since then, it has only gotten worse. The unemployment rate reached 7.3 percent in May, and 7.9 percent last month. Only once since the Great Depression has the unemployment rate been higher—and that was also under Gerald Ford, who brought the unemployment rate up to 8.9 percent within his first nine months in office.\n"", ""Mr. Ford says there's a recovery. He says he should be elected President because he has turned the economy around. But there are 50 percent more people out of work now than on the day he took office. And there are 500,000 more out of work now than there were three months ago.\n"", 'The reason unemployment remains high is that this administration is willing to tolerate it. Despite all their talk against welfare, they have become the party of welfare rather than work.\n', 'Inflation.—The Republicans say they are the party that can control inflation. Yet the last eight years have brought us the worst inflation in a generation. During the entire period from 1949 to 1969—through war years and peace years, Democratic years and Republican years—the inflation rate averaged only 2.2 percent a year. The Republican Administration produced six percent inflation in 1969—their first year in the White House. We still have that six percent inflation rate today. If we judge them by their record— as they ask—we can only assume that the Republicans will continue to rob our people with six percent inflation as long as they are in office.\n', 'Balanced Budgets.—The Republicans say they are the party of fiscal responsibility. But their record shows the worst fiscal mismanagement in our history. The White House budget alone has increased by over 350 percent during the past eight years. The deficit for the year just ended is $65 billion. That is the largest deficit in our history. It is larger than the deficits of all eight Kennedy-Johnson years combined.\n', 'Housing.—The Republicans say that housing is one of their campaign issues. But they have plunged the construction industry into a depression. The cost of a new house has increased by more than 50 percent, from an average of $30,000 in 1968 to an average of $46,000 in 1976. Interest rates are also up 50 percent. When Lyndon Johnson left office, more than half the families in this country could afford their own homes. Eight years later, less than a third of our families can.\n', ""Economic growth.—The Republicans say they support strong economic growth. But the economy has grown more slowly during the last eight years than at any time since the Great Depression. The real value of the Gross National Product actually declined during each of Mr. Ford's first two years in office. The average worker's weekly pay check buys less than it did in 1968.\n"", 'I understand that my opponent makes his kickoff speech tonight elsewhere in Michigan, and some people are saying that tonight marks the official opening of the campaign of 1976.\n', ""I'm glad to see his emergence, but I think in a larger sense this Presidential campaign began a long time ago. My opponent and I, and the two parties we represent, do not exist in isolation, but are part of the currents of history.\n"", 'In that sense, this campaign was underway in 1932, when his party nominated Herbert Hoover and ours nominated Franklin Roosevelt.\n', 'This campaign continued in 1948, when his party nominated Tom Dewey, and ours nominated Harry Truman.\n', 'This campaign continued in 1952, when his party nominated Dwight Eisenhower, and ours nominated Adlai Stevenson.\n', 'This campaign continued in 1960, when his party nominated Richard Nixon, and ours nominated John Kennedy.\n', 'This campaign continued in 1964, when his party nominated Barry Goldwater, and ours nominated Lyndon Johnson.\n', 'This campaign continued in 1968, when his party nominated Richard Nixon—a second time—and ours nominated Hubert Humphrey.\n', ""This campaign has been joined a hundred times, whenever our party has fought for legislation that would benefit the average American—for Social Security, for the minimum wage, for rural electrification, for voting rights, for Medicare—and our opponent's party fought against that progress.\n"", 'This year the lines are drawn with special clarity, for my opponent, in his long career in Congress, has distinguished himself not by legislation that bears his name, but by his tireless opposition to all the great legislation that bears the names of Democrats who cared for people and were not controlled by special interests.\n', 'There has never been an American election quite like this one. We have had economic problems before. We have had poor leadership before. But never before have we had such widespread lack of trust in our government.\n', 'Because of a war our people did not want, because of scandals our people did not want, because of economic mismanagement our people did not want, millions of Americans have lost faith in our government.\n', ""We feel we have lost control of our own government, that it has become our master instead of our servant, that we are being ruled by special interests, and by politicians who don't care about us. To a tragic extent, that is exactly what has happened.\n"", 'That is what this campaign is all about. We as Democrats must give our people faith in our government again by giving our people control over our government again.\n', 'Government by the people—that is the issue this year.

When we came, we learned very quickly that we could participate in the political process, stand on our own feet, make our own decisions, shape our own destiny, give our children a better life, and contribute to the greatness of our country. All of us who came to America had one common goal: to preserve what is unique within us but also to share our common strength. Our motto became ""E pluribus unum,"" which means ""out of many, one."" We came because we didn\'t believe that individuality had to be the source of bitterness, or conflict, or division, or weakness. We came because we wanted to share the first government in history which has tried to live up to the high, cumulative standards of a wide range of citizens. We came because we knew that a nation didn\'t need to be monolithic to be strong. Our diversity of language, heritage, and religion is the key to the American unity and to the American strength.\n', 'But it\'s not always been that easy. All of us have known the pain associated with discrimination. There\'s been a lot of prejudice and suffering in the South. We haven\'t had a President elected from the deep South since 1848. There\'s also been much discrimination in our society against Italian Americans. Many of you in this room can remember the signs ""No Italians need apply,"" ""No Irish need apply."" The signs may be gone, but many of the memories remain, along with too much of the quiet, unspoken discrimination. It\'s unfair that a group that has produced leaders like the four whom we honor here tonight has never had a Justice of the Supreme Court and only two Cabinet members in history. One of them, John Volpe, is here tonight We must end that quiet discrimination, not by setting quotas but by insuring that all groups in our great nation have an equal chance to participate in American business, American society, and American government.\n', 'We must never pit one group against another. Nearly 40 years ago, Franklin Roosevelt spoke words that are equally true today to me and to you. He said, and I quote: ""\'We are a nation of many nationalities, many races, many religions, bound together by a single unity, the unity of freedom and equality. Whoever seeks to pit one nationality against another, seeks to degrade all nationalities. Whoever seeks to set one race against another, seeks to enslave all races. Whoever seeks to set one religion against another, seeks to destroy all religions."" That was said 40 years ago by President Roosevelt. I\'m proud, as an American, of the contribution of Italian Americans like Senator Pastore, Congressman Rodino, Congressman Daniels, and Judge Sirica, whom we honor here tonight. Like all of you in this audience, they have made great contributions to our country and I\'m proud of the diversity of our nation.\n', ""I doubt that any human being has traveled more in the last 2 years throughout our great country than have I.

I've stood in factory shift lines where nobody knew who I was. I've walked the streets, gone in beauty parlors, barber shops, and restaurants and stood at the swing doors in shopping centers. I've been in farmers' markets and I've also been in livestock sale barns, to listen, mostly, and to talk a little. And I've learned about our country. In the last 2 weeks, since I began my general election campaign, I've been in many of the ethnic neighborhoods of our nation. And I've seen there the truths that we should never forget.

In our concern for the poor and the newcomers is the essence of love.

We've come here to learn, to grow, to stretch our minds, to learn more about God's land and to be able to encompass in our hearts more friends. Our country gives us room to expand our own lives without constraint. It's been very difficult throughout history to put together two sometimes conflicting principles. One is equality. The other is freedom. Sometimes, when you have guaranteed equality, government must step in and hold down the strong and boost up the weak artificially. When you have complete liberty or freedom, the strong tend to dominate the weak. In our country we've always tried for the last 200 years to do both, to have a melding of liberty and equality on one hand and equality of opportunity on the other. That's what brought my people to this country. That's what brought your people to this country. We came because of hope and a dream of freedom and equality of opportunity.

73,Jimmy Carter ,"September 17, 1976","['Q. I would like to start if we could in the area of taxes. You proposed a comprehensive, total overhaul of the tax laws, which is probably the one thing the federal government does that more directly touches more people than any other single action. You said in New York that these laws were a disgrace to the human race. Can you give some idea of some of the specific changes you envision as they would touch the average taxpayer?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can tell you what I intend to do. First of all, we've never had a comprehensive reform of the income tax laws since the constitutional amendment was passed in the 1900's—1913. Any tax reform package has always kept as a base the present multiplicity of rules and regulations, tax incentives, and loopholes that have accumulated over from one period to another. So I intend to take on myself as a President's responsibility at one time, a complete, a comprehensive tax reform effort.\n"", 'Secondly, there would be some specific and very dramatic themes followed. One is, that the tax code would be drastically reformed and simplified, and not consist of more than 40,000 pages. And I would like to make the tax code as simple as possible.\n', ""I would move to treat all income the same, and remove the sharp distinction now drawn depending on where income is derived. There would be a couple of exceptions which I could envision now. One would be the question of local and state properties—including bonds—I don't know what the constitutional provisions are, but I understand that there have been rulings by the court saying that this is property owned by the state and local government, and the federal government has no authority to touch it. Also, I would continue the encouragement of beneficent gifts but would tighten up on the rules or laws relating to foundations to make sure that the overhead expenses of foundations and salaries are paid and purposes of offices in foundations and accumulation of corpus was severely restricted and the income from foundations should have to go the causes for which the foundation was set up.\n"", ""So shifting toward a fitting income basically the same would be a major and a drastic revision. Another thing that I would like to do is to guarantee a truly progressive tax rate, so that the higher income one has, the higher percentage of one's income one pays. This is not the case now. The low income families actually pay a greater proportion of their income or at least the same. In almost every instance we have a flat tax rate now, on the average, independent of what the income is. Another thing would be to tax income only once, instead of twice. The tax expenditures or tax exemptions would be severely curtailed, and this would result in a commensurate reduction in the rate of taxation for a particular income. But I would not try to include an overall increase or decrease in tax revenues along with the tax reform effort. I would try to keep the revenue about the same, and modify the percentage of income. The overall effect would be to shift a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes and reduce income on the lower income and middle income families.\n"", 'Q. Governor, what do you mean when you say ""shift the burden toward those who have a higher income?""\n', 'Governor Carter. That means that people who make a higher income would pay more taxes.\n', 'Q. But, in dollars, what are you thinking of as higher?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know yet. I would say, I would take the mean or median level of income. Anything above that would be higher, anything below that would be lower.\n"", 'Q. Your median family income today is somewhere around $12,000, which is not—somebody these days who is earning $15,000 a year is not what people commonly think of as rich.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, you know, I can't answer that question, because I haven't gone into it. I don't know how to write the tax code now, in specific terms. It's just not possible to do that on the campaign trail. But, I'm committed to do it, and have talked to congressional leaders in the House and Senate about the need, and have found an agreement among them, among the leaders. And as far as telling you specifically what a tax bill would be, there's no way that I could do that.\n"", ""Q. Does that present a problem for your potential supporter, Governor, you're saying you'd like him to make you his President, and yet, you're not able to say what the impact on him or her on a given level might be of this great major change you're talking about. How would you respond to that problem, if a supporter would raise it with you?\n"", ""Governor Carter. It hasn't created a problem, so far as I've been able to detect. I think the principles that I've spelled out to you would in every instance convince the average American family that their taxes are going to be no higher, or perhaps even lower in some instances depending on their income. And that the taxes, as levied, will be fair. I don't think most of them want to see their taxes lowered, but they want to be sure that when they do pay taxes that they're being given the same treatment as those who are more influential and more wealthy and have a wider range of opportunities on tax income.\n"", ""Q. Governor, you mentioned local and state bonds. Do you mean you don't think you can change the federal tax code so as to tax the dividends on those bonds?\n"", ""Governor Carter. That's one of the questions that I have. I don't know if it's possible to do that or not. The federal government should provide some alternatives for this, to reduce its dependence on bonds, but I've had legal advice both ways—there have been rulings that say that this has been state and local property and can't be taxed. It's a constitutional question that I don't know the answer to yet.\n"", ""Q. One area that's been something of a problem for you since back in the Massachusetts primary, is this home mortgage tax deduction. Are you still thinking in terms of eliminating that and substituting legislation to benefit the homeowner in some way outside the tax code?\n"", 'Governor Carter. We now have about $10 or $11 billion set up as tax incentives, or tax expenditures to encourage homeownership, and home construction. I think that level is possibly correct, and I would maintain that level of encouragement for home construction and home ownership. There again, we have in the tax code a heavy reward for those in the higher income brackets and a much lower reward for those in the low income brackets.\n', 'Second, we have authorization now for those tax incentives to apply to second and third homes, vacation homes and so forth. I would like to channel as much of that encouragement as I can to the family who is trying to purchase that first home.\n', 'Q. But, would or would it not be done through the tax code?\n', 'Governor Carter. It may or may not be. The two incentives now given, as you know, are for interest on mortgage payments, and for credit for property taxes paid, and it may be that the tax code is the easiest way to handle that, that incentive. I would guess that it will stay in the tax code.\n', ""Q. You said that you don't think that you do have a problem with people being concerned about your lack of specificity. The latest Harris poll that just came out showed that 49 pmni of the voters fid that youfve ducked steads on the issues, and they think you're wrong. Whether you've done thu or not, it indicates that 49 percent of the people seem to feel that way. Does that bother you at all?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I wish it was zero.\n', 'Q. How do you get to zero?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know what—I haven't seen the Harns polL I don't know whether most of the people in the Hanis poll prefer that I be President or Mr. Ford. You've seen it, I guess you could interpret that. I think one of the questions is that I derived support'from a wide range of public figures and from different kinds of voters. Every time there has been a post-election analysis, I've gotten support from those who call themselves conservative or moderate or liberal, and I've also gotten support as you know of an almost complete group of Democrats ranging from George McGovern to George Wallace, and I think that this broad range of support causes some concern in the voter's mind about exactly where I stand on the political spectrum. I'm a typically complex person. In some areas I would be placed on the liberal end of the spectrum; in other areas I would be on the conservative end. But the fact that Fm not a clearly identifiable political idealogue is possibly one reason for the concern. But as you know, I've been tested against, I think, 12 or 15 other candidates in the Democratic primaries for the Presidential nomination, and have fared rather well. Although I'm not familiar with your quoted poll, and don't know how I came out against President Ford, in general Tve been pleased. But I wish that everybody knew me well enough to trust me.\n"", 'Q. I was just wondering about your attitude, Governor [toward aspects of 1976 tax reform legislation] ... [wording garbled in taping] ... Can you characterize your feelings about that bill ... have you had a chance to study it?\n', ""Governor Carter. No; I haven't. I talked to Congressman Ullman, I guess 8 or 10 hours when he came down to Plains io visit me, and he expressed some of his concerns about some unwarranted tax incentives and loopholes that have been placed in the bill, but I understand from the news media that most of those were removed in conference committee. And I would guess that the tax reform bill passed is a step in the right direction. But I would approach the tax reform effort in a much more generic or comprehensive way than has been done in the Congress this year.\n"", ""Q. What kind of reading do you get from Congressman Ullman and others on the Hill about the feasibility of a total overhaul of the tax code? They tried a few years ago, Wilbur Mills and Mansfield to get through legislation that would have, in effect, been a phase out of loopholes and advantages that were not specifically approved by the Congress, and they couldn't even get that.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I would let Mr. Ullman speak for himself, but I was encouraged by his attitude concerning the intention that I have. There's a great difference between a Congress trying to initiate a comprehensive tax reform in a vacuum, and having the President spearhead the effort. The President is the center of comprehension quite often among the electorate about what is proposed, particularly in a complicated subject like basic tax reform, and I believe that I could speak clearly enough to the American people to arouse their support. I think I could also in the first 6 months of my own administration arouse the attention of the Members of Congress enough to get them to consider this proposal clearly, and if it was attractive to their folks back home, which I'm sure it will be, then I think we could pass it. But to have the Congress initiate, and then try to pass legislation as far-reaching as I envision, would be a very difficult thing, with the withdrawal of the White House from responsibility altogether, or with implied threat to veto it if it should pass.\n"", 'Q. Is what you envision a tax code where everybody in the country would be able to write their tax return, and would not have to have a consultant or a lawyer? How subtle do you think it could be?\n', ""Governor Carter. That would be my goal, and I can't guarantee it will be quite that simple, but it would be much more nearly that simple than it is now.\n"", 'Q. If you were President now, Governor, would you sign the tax reform bill that was passed in Congress this week?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, not having read it, I can't say for sure. My assessment from the news media reports is that that would be one that would be a step in the right direction.\n"", 'Q. Have you read the new estate tax provisions of that bill?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. Maybe we better get on to another subject ... Another area, of course, of enormous interest is employment, which has been the focus of much of your campaigning. As we understand it, you have endorsed Humphrey-Hawkins, correct?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', ""Q. What about the specific terms of the bill? It makes the federal government the employer of last resort. Right now to carry out the terms of that bill would mean the creation of something over 3.2 million jobs. Do you see the federal government fulfilling that role, and how does that fit with the goals you've set down of a leaner, trimmer, more efficient federal establishment?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I'm not sure you're referring to the latest version of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, when you say that the government would provide 3.2 million jobs. That's not my understanding of it. The amendments that have been incorporated into the bill by the education committee of the House recently, would lessen substantially the number of jobs that would be provided directly by the federal government. When the bill was first introduced, it had a heavy emphasis on government planning for the private sector, a very tight definition of unemployment or full employment which was 3 percent overall unemployment at the end of an 18-month period, and some other provisions that were heavily oriented toward public employment rather than private. That's all been changed, and all of the biU hasn't reached a point where it will be considered by the full House or Senate this year, it's my guess. The principles of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill are good— to set for our nation a clear goal for a level of unemployment which is now at the end of 4 years to have 3 percent or less unemployment among those who are 20 years old or older. Another thing about the Humphrey-Hawkins bill that I believe has now been passed is the level of payment for workers who are employed in the public sector or with help in the public sector, with partial payments for salaries in the private sector. Originally it was a requirement that ... [tape garbled] and any employment given had to be at existing wage rates. That's also been eliminated, and the authority for the federal government to plan for the private sector has been completely eliminated.\n"", ""So I see the Humphrey-Hawkins bill as being one that's in the process of being constantly modified toward much more responsible legislation which I spelled out quite a long time ago. And with those modifications that I've described, I do support it, but I don't know if the Humphrey-Hawkins bill will pass this year. I don't know what the latest amendments are. But if they've been included—the ones that I've just described to you—I think it's a good bill.\n"", 'Q. Are you urging your fellow Democrats in Congress to support the bill and pass it?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes. I issued a press release the morning that the House Education Committee considered the bill, spelling out these provisions, which Mr. Hawkins assured me had all been included, and under those provisions expressed my support of the bill.\n', 'Q. You also said you thought that chances for passage this year were highly doubtful. Do you think that Congress should vote on it this year?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't answer that question, Walter. They—the Senate is going to adjourn, you know, very shortly, and I don't think the bill has even moved out of any Senate committee. I don't think it's likely to come to the floor of the Senate.\n"", ""Q. Well, the word around town is that a lot of the Democrats in the House told the leadership they'd just as soon adjourn without having to go on record on this one before the elections.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I'm not inclined to push the passage of the bill for the House or Senate this year.\n"", ""Q. You seem to be saying that you agree with the goals of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, but not necessarily the mechanisms that they've devised in the first place to get there.\n"", ""Governor Carter. As you possibly know, when the Humphrey-Hawkins bill was first introduced, I came out against it. I and my economic advisers spent a lot of time studying the original Humphrey-Hawkins bill, and we delineated a list of the amendments that we thought were necessary before the Humphrey-Hawkins bill should be passed. So far as I know the House Education Committee version of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill has now incorporated all my suggestions, partially because they were suggested by me after the convention and I became the nominee, but I think because they were right, and made that original bill modified into one that was reasonable and not too costly, and would put a heavy emphasis on employment in the private sector, but set goals for unemployment The goals that I've set for my own administration, that I spelled out in a conference to the news media in Plains, are compatible with the goals that are now included in the Humphrey-Hawkins bill\n"", ""Q. Their bottom line is still public employment, isn't it?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, it's not\n"", 'Q. As a last resort?\n', 'Governor Carter. Well, with the emphasis on ""last,"" yes.\n', 'Q. Governor, whether you use public or private employment to get the current unemployment rate, which is 7.9 percent, down to an overall rate of 4.5, you need 3 million jobs. Whether you get them from the public sector, or the private sector, or out of thin air—how do you get 3 million jobs?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, we've had them many times before, and we've jumped to an extraordinary degree of increased unemployment since Mr. Ford's been in office. There are 2l/i million people out of work, more people out of work now than there were when he took office in August of 1974. We have about a 75 percent industrial capacity now being utilized; and as you know, there's no effort being made by the federal government now, except over Mr. Ford's adamant opposition, to encourage employment in the private or the public sector. I think there are actually fewer private jobs now on nonfarm employment than there were when Mr. Ford took office. So in the channeling of research and development funds, and the instigation of the increased activity in the housing industry, and using funds for law enforcement, recreation, better health care, pollution control, in the guaranteeing of local bond issues for public improvements, these kinds of things would all instigate an increase in employment. Also in some areas the federal government might very well supplement salaries in the private sector in areas very high in unemployment, and I would favor a substantial expansion with federal funds combined with private funds for those who are young, and particularly in communities where unemployment is very high.\n"", ""One of the things that we are working on and that will be unique, I think, compared to what we've had in the past is highly targeted employment opportunities where with a countercyclical concept applied, which, by the way, Mr. Ford vetoed. But I think the economy of our country is amenable to improvement. Historically, we've maintained a 4/a percent, 5 percent annual growth in economy, in the last 8 years we've averaged about 2 percent, and that 2 percent growth is well below the growth in other developed nations like our own.\n"", 'Q. Governor, you talk now about research and development, housing, law enforcement, pollution control, as areas where spending might create jobs. How much is that going to cost and where is the money to come from?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think you know the well accepted statistic that every time you reduce the unemployment rate 1 percent, you add $16 billion toward balancing the federal budget—about $2 billion in reduced welfare and unemployment compensation payments, and the other $14 billion in increased tax revenues. We now are paying about $17 billion this year for welfare payments and unemployment compensation for able-bodied adults who are fully able to work, just because of the extraordinarily high unemployment rate. So that's where the money comes from—from increased national growth and increased federal revenues and reduced payments for welfare and unemployment compensation. It's worked historically in this country: it's not a revolutionary innovation at all. This is just to go back to the kind of economy we experienced all the way from when Roosevelt turned the economy around until Nixon went into office.\n"", ""Q. Governor, let's go back over that. Some of us are a little confused by that. Let's take this job creation step by step. In the platform, your party's platform and this morning you've said that every 1 percent of unemployment costs $16 billion in welfare. The Congressional Budget Office says that for about $1 billion in federal spending you can create something in the neighborhood of 350,000 jobs. That means that for about $3 billion you could create enough jobs to lower the unemployment rate by 1 percent. Now if all those figures are right, the government ends up with a $16 billion gain, and 900,000 people have jobs they didn't have before. That seems to be too simple, and if it's that simple, why hasn't it been done, again and again and again? Why is there ever unemployment if it works that neatly and simply?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I don't follow your figures that you quoted, but I think almost any—I've got about 15 or 20 economists who help me, and I think the range of their political philosophy would be quite broad, and they are unanimous in agreeing with that basic figure, that a 1 percent reduction in unemployment is the equivalent of about $16 or $17 billion—I use $16 billion—that would go toward balancing the budget, and what the Congress is trying to do is provide that opportunity for our country. Mr. Ford has vetoed the legislation whenever there has been an attempt made for public jobs, and quite often has impounded funds, he and Mr. Nixon, or reduced the incentive for people to work. I think there's a heavy emphasis in the Republican Administration on high interest rates, tight money in order to hold down and cool the economy off and control inflation in that way, and this has been a devastating choice to us all. But, historically, when we've had high unemployment, at least in the period since Roosevelt became President, we've also had fairly low inflation, and relatively closer balanced budgets. So to put our people back to work is the only mechanism that I know where we can control inflation and have a reasonable growth in our economy, 4 or 5 percent per year, but it's not extraordinary at all, and well below most developed countries. But, I have read Mr. Mears' analysis of my economic statistics. I think that mine are accurate and his are wrong. He might even agree.\n"", ""Q. I don't agree [garbled, laughter].\n"", ""Governor Carter. I didn't mean to make you blush, Mr. Mears. But I think that, I think the statistics are accurate, and I think historically what I have described to you is the case. When Johnson and Kennedy were in office— when Nixon and Ford are in office, we had a dramatic comparison between the difference in our economy, our incomes when people were employed. When Mr. Nixon took office, I think there was a projection of a $3.2 billion surplus. There was a very slight deficit (the next year) that was the year he took over. In the next year, because of high unemployment, we had a dramatic reduction in revenues, and I believe we had about a $20-something billion deficit. But the key to a balanced budget and the key to revenues that can be used to provide services is, in my opinion, employment.\n"", ""Q. Can the government create jobs at a profit—I think that's what Lou was getting to with you. The government by pump-priming, by hiring people who can't find jobs otherwise lowers the rate I percent and thus realizes the $16 billion in benefits. Are they then in the black on that transaction?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, no. Mr. Klein and other economic advisers have computed it. It costs about $10,500 to provide one federal job. The administration of it and the allocation of the funds, as well. And the more that you can use federal money, to be magnified and provide the jobs in the private sector, the more jobs you can provide for any given amount of money, obviously. The guarantee, for instance, of home mortgage loans, which was formerly a flourishing stimulation for the economy under FHA and in the early stages of HUD, worked, and had a greatly magnified beneficial effect. The competent management of the Small Business Administration where you made loans to small businesses and then guaranteed those loans to a local bank, and at the same time provided counseling services for small businessmen, as I experienced, is a very slight cost thing to the taxpayers, but provides large numbers of jobs for every dollar spent. So the more you can channel federal moneys into areas that stimulate private employment, the greater you can cut down that $10,500 per job and shift it down to maybe not more than a couple thousand dollars per job. But, that's where you get your magnification factor, and that's where you get your increased revenues compared to the money that you spent.\n"", ""Q, To go back to my analysis of your figures: granted when Kennedy took office, it was at a time of recession late in the Eisenhower Administration; his first year in office there was a 6.7 percent unemployment problem part of the time. It stayed over 5 percent for several years and the Democratic Administration with all these efforts couldn't get it down quickly, until the war in Vietnam.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I think it's an exaggeration to lay the whole improvement under Kennedy and Johnson on the war in Vietnam. I think when they went out of office the unemployment rate was about 3.4 percent.\n"", 'Q. But when Johnson left office the war in Vietnam was quite a heated------\n', ""Governor Carter. There's no question about it. And I don't deny, obviously, that the war in Vietnam created some jobs. Obviously, we had 500,000 people in Vietnam. We had, I think, maybe 3 million people in the armed services. We now have 2.1 million people in the armed services. So it's obviously a contributive factor. But the point I'm making is that the attitude of the government in money availability, the loan availability for the small businessmen, the ease with which a family can purchase a home—these things require very little tax expenditure, and greatly stimulate the economy to provide a large number of jobs in the private sector. That's a basic Democratic philosophy, sharply contrasted with the Republican philosophy almost historically, of high interest rates, a tight constraint on the economy, let unemployment go where it will.\n"", 'Q. How does the government make it easier for the average person to buy a home without it costing the government money?\n', ""Governor Carter. I didn't say that it didn't cost the government any money. What I said was the cost of the government is very small compared to the benefits derived in tax revenues and in people employed, and ancillarily in letting families own their homes. As you know, we had a very good 202 program, for instance, to build condominiums for older people. We had very aggressive ... functioning of FHA in providing home mortgage guarantees through private and public lending agencies. We had money made available to rehabilitate homes in which a family was already living. These programs have been almost completely voided by the Republican Administration. I think the only program they have ongoing now with any enthusiasm is the Title VIII program which leans heavily on the rental of homes, and which has been a terrible failure so far. But it obviously costs the government some money. I think that under the Democratic Administrations the FHA had very, very few defaulted loans. Last year for the first time there was almost a scandalous loss of money by the FHA because of mismanagement and because of the general Republican policy; I think they've lost about $600 million last year. But when the FHA has been in the past functioning properly, there was practically no net cost to the federal government at all.\n"", 'Q. Governor, do you still envision starting zero-based budgeting early in your administration? At what point do you think you could begin it?\n', ""Governor Carter. When I went in office as governor [in 1971] it had never been done before in any government. We had to devise all the procedures and all the forms from scratch and study the techniques. I went in office in January, and I put zero-based budgeting into effect that same April, 100 percent for every expenditure in the state government. I can't say whether I could do it that rapidly at the federal government level, but my intention would be to prepare my first executive budget using zero-based budgeting in its entirety.\n"", 'Q. The budget year when you take office would begin in October, since they changed the fiscal year. Is that the year you9re talking about?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would like to do that.\n', 'Q. Would you want to amend the Ford budget?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would hope that by January 20, 1977, I would have my major amendment to the Ford-prepared budget ready to present to the Congress. But I could obviously not do that, using zero-based budgeting. We just have to do that in a very hurried way, beginning in November; it would give me about 2 months to see if I wanted to shift emphasis toward other programs to fulfill my promises during the campaign.\n', 'Q. Have you started on that, started putting together the figures that comprise the Carter budget the first year?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I haven't been directly involved in it, but it is being done, yes.\n"", 'Q. Can you give us an idea of what magnitude of a budget it would be?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. You said that the Republicans gave us the first $200, $300, and $400 billion dollar budget, which is true. Is Carter going to give us the next under $400 billion?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't think it would be reasonable to expect that the budget would be reduced.\n"", ""Q. You mentioned that some of the spending programs you've talked about are relatively small in terms of the employment gain, or in terms of the benefit gain. President Ford says that if you fulfill all the promises you've made and the promises in the platform, it'll cost $100 billion a year in spending. You said, I believe, that by 1980 or something that we'll have a $60 billion surplus, more than we have. That doesn't seem to jibe. Ford says a hundred billion; what do you say your programs would cost?\n"", ""Governor Carter. It's hard to say. We will fulfill all the promises I've made to the American people; and we have projected using computer analysis from the Conference Board, from the Wharton School of Business, some help from MIT and others, that by 1981, with a reasonable expectation of economic growth, employment at the encFof the 4 year period we've already discussed, and a reasonable inflation rate, that we will have that year about $60 billion more in income than we have now. Within that framework, assuming a balanced budget for fiscal year 1981, the programs that we have advocated will be implemented. We have not yet decided, obviously, and this will be subject to future experience, whether those increases in available funds would be used for partial tax reductions or implementation of new programs. But as we put into effect welfare reform and health insurance programs, health care program, they'll be phased in to accommodate the increased money available to us.\n"", ""Q. I don't want us to misunderstand what you said there. Your response to the $100 billion figure is that it's too high.\n"", 'Governor Carter. Yes; it is.\n', 'Q. Do you have another figure or not?\n', ""Governor Carter. As I said, we'll fit the rapidity of implementation of these programs in to accommodate the revenues that I've just described to you.\n"", ""Q. Without a tax increase, is that what you're saying?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Yes; that's correct.\n"", ""Q. You mentioned welfare reform, and I'd just like to touch on it briefly because I seem to be a little confused. As I understood it, your position was that the burden should be lifted from the cities and that it should be shared by the federal government and the states.\n"", ""Governor Carter. And the states; yes, that's correct.\n"", 'Q. You said in answer to a question in a New York Magazine interview you were asked ""Do you favor the idea of the state and the city eventuedly paying nothing for welfare, and the full cost being picked up by the federal government?"" They quote you as saying in the answer, on the basis welfare package, ""Yes, but I would never remove the constitutional right of a city or state to vote bonus payments or additional payment\' above and beyond the national welfare standards."" Do you see the federal government ultimately taking over the basic welfare payment that would be required?\n', ""Governor Carter. Ultimately. I would move first of all, though, to remove the responsibility of the local governments to pay for it. The local governments are heavily strapped for a tax base and for funds to finance their mandatory programs. They have no flexibility. The local governments are quite often required to provide services by their state legislators, and also have a heavy restraint on what they can raise in revenue; that also has to be approved by the state legislatures. So the first step would be to relieve the local governments of the responsibility for welfare. Over a period of time, I think the goal ought to be to also freeze and reduce and maybe ultimately to remove the state responsibility for paying any part of the mandatory package of welfare compensation. But if local or state governments want, in addition to an adequate minimum package of welfare payments, to supplement them, then as that statement says, they would certainly have that right. You couldn't prohibit a city or state that wanted to supplement the basic nationwide package of welfare payments from doing so.\n"", 'Q. But ultimately the federal government would be responsible for basic minimum standard welfare?\n', ""Governor Carter. Ultimately. But I don't want to mislead anyone by insinuating that we would be able to absorb the state portion of it. I think the state governments in general are able to pay part of the welfare costs for the foreseeable future.\n"", 'Q. Do you anticipate difficulty in getting the states that are now at the low end of the average welfare payment picture to come up to the levels that some of the higher states are. The difference is on the range of several hundreds dollars a week in some cases. How would you bring one up, or would you bring one up and the other down. Would you raise them by the federal mechanisms to a uniform level? How would you accomplish that?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't understand what you mean by several hundred dollars a week.\n"", 'Q. A month, excuse me, I meant a month. I think it ranges from $50 a month, on the average in Mississippi, to something like $324 in New York City.\n', 'Governor Carter. The basic welfare package which would provide, hopefully, a simple one payment to a person or family, would be guaranteed by the federal government on a fairly uniform basis throughout the country. A percentage of that package that would be paid for by the states would probably be based on the ability of the state to pay. I think there might be some difficulty among the states that pay practically no part of the cost; but still, if you put into the formula, which I think is only fair, the ability of the state to participate, the shock would be minimal. And it might require, it certainly would require a phasing-in period for this purpose.\n', 'We now have a multiplicity of welfare programs that are very confusing, and also create havens for those who commit fraud or who cheat, and provide great inequities in overall payments. But, I think that this is a goal that would be approved by Senator Long from Louisiana, and by Mr. Ullman from Oregon, and others who have been reluctant in the past to change. I have talked this over with them, and I believe that what I propose is acceptable, and also highly necessary.\n', ""Q. Governor, there's some other subjects I think we ought to try to cover. We're running out of time. Your basic speech, which is still evolving, doesn't include foreign policy. Is that because you don't think it's a matter of major concern, I mean that it's not one of the preeminent issues. Dn not suggesting that you don't discuss it, because you answer questions about it in great detail, but it isn't in the basic stump speech.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there's a general feeling among our people that Mr. Kissinger both shapes and carries out our foreign policy and that President Ford is only peripherally involved in the process; and I think that's a major concern among the people of our country. Another concern that was expressed yesterday in the news media which is easily discernable is that our foreign policy has no compatibility with the inclinations of the American people to be open, to be consistent, to be of a high moral nature, to treat other nations with respect, to be compassionate when we deal with countries that are afflicted because of some catastrophe. That we've lost our influence in the United Nations and international councils. All these are concerns that I cover quite frequently. The additional matter of concern is on narrowly focused issues-Cyprus, I issued a statement last night on Cyprus; and on nuclear proliferation; control of atomic wastes, on which I've made, as you know, major speeches; on the Middle East; on the degree of involvement we have in South Korea. So, you know, on occasion, and I think quite frequently, these issues are discussed. But I think there are pool results that show when people are asked to list the things that concern them the most, that you have to go down to about the 13th or 14th thing before you start running into foreign policy questions. But those that I've described to you, and others are important to me and I think also important to the American people when [tape garbled] ...\n"", ""Q. You have said on foreign policy, there should be an understanding with the Soviet Union, that we would settle any dispute without resorting to nuclear force. Doesn't that mean that you would have to increase manpower in NATO substantially since the concept there has been that our nuclear shield offsets their superior manpower on the ground?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, not necessarily. I would hate to think that that's true. I don't know if you've read General Maxwell Taylor's recent book, I think the name of it is Precarious Security. He points out that a better deployment of existing manpower in Western Europe, combined with a better utilization of advanced technology and anti-tank weapons and other weapons would provide us with an adequate defense capability in Europe without dependence on atomic weapons. I agree with that premise. And I would intend to maintain our present level of troop deployment in Europe for the foreseeable future. But I think when we can move with the Soviet Union to reduce atomic weapons; I would even be willing to increase ground forces or conventional forces if necessary—if that was what it took to give us equivalent strength. That would be a good tradeoff, if it was necessary.\n"", ""Q. You said the other day in Billings that you would not shy from having a strong, powerful, I shouldn't say powerful, but a strong Secretary of State. You mentioned Truman's Secretaries of State. How would that work with the Secretary of State, given the structure that now exists between the White House and the State Department, where there has grown up in the White House the National Security Advisor's role as a counterbalance to the Secretary of State—except when Kissinger had both jobs. And when he now still has his stable of people in the White House.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I can only judge by my own inclinations and what I did as governor. I selected the best and most competent and strongest leaders that I could to lead the major departments in the state government I would do the same thing this way. As President, I would not try to run a department of the federal government from the White House staff. I would have the best qualified analysts and technicians to help me in the White House that I could possibly find. But I hope that I could maintain, as I said in Billings, I didn't remember where it was, I've said it many times, the kind of relationship with the Secretary of State that Truman had with Acheson and Marshall. I think that there was a general recognition in this country and around the world that the Secretaries of State were very strong, very capable men, able to shape long-range basic policy, perhaps independently of the President. But it was always a sure feeling in this country that the final decision to evolve or to consummate the foreign policy rested with the President. I'd like to restore that. In addition, the bipartisan support for our foreign policy now has been almost completely destroyed.\n"", ""There has been no consultation on a regular basis with the congressional leaders, I don't think either Democratic or Republican. I would restore that immediately. And there is no open discussion or debate in this country as we shape foreign policy decisions. When we decide to try to intervene, for instance, in Angola, there had not been any analysis in this country, either through public speeches or statements by the President or the Secretary of State about the problems of what they hoped to do when the Portuguese withdrew. It was obviously a potential trouble spot in the world, but Mr. Kissinger laid down an ultimatum to Cuba, which was later forgotten. There was no prior consultation with the key leaders of Congress, Mansfield or others. But I think this weakens us very severely. I would be a spokesman for our country. I would make the final decisions about our nation's foreign policy. I would be responsible for carrying out what decisions were made. I would consult very closely with the Secretary of State. I would not have a higher more officious or influential person within the White House that would dominate the Secretary of State at all. The Secretary of State would be the major Cabinet person including the White House staff to evolve foreign policy along with me, and I would restore the bipartisan nature of foreign policy and also let the people know, as best I could, what was going on. All those are changes.\n"", 'Q. Do you have personnel talent searchers talent scouts, looking for people to fill those roles now?\n', ""Governor Carter. That's not quite an accurate description. I've worked now with a couple of dozen, I think, highly qualified people, in foreign affairs. Some are experts on southern Africa, some are experts on the Middle East, some are experts on the northern part of the Far East and on the southern part of the Far East, some are generalists, some are experts on international economics, and some have been in previous administrations, some of them have not. But as I work with these people personally, when they come to Plains and when I meet with them, quite often in Washington, I'm able to size up their compatibility with my basic philosophy and their ability to express themselves and their ability to analyze the policy decisions that are being made so, ultimately, at least in the foreign affairs field, I think I could make a judgment about whom I would prefer as Secretary of State. I would also, of course, consult with this group of advisors in whom I have confidence on the subject. But we have, I think, a good transition setup, that will be going out of business if I don't get elected, but will be prepared to give me recommendations if I am elected. And they work very closely with our issues staff, and help people help me to analyze our foreign affairs or economics and so forth. This is a good testing ground for future selections to help me if I'm elected.\n"", 'Q. I was thinking more broadly than I spoke. There are hundreds of jobs, literally, that have to be filled by an incoming administration in quite a hurry. I just wondered what you were able to do to get ready for this.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think we'll be as prepared as any previous Presidentelect has ever been, if I am elected. And, of course, we'll have a maximum of a 2 month period at least after the election, before I have to make the final decisions. But I would hope to be prepared to move rapidly. There are about, probably, 200 positions that I would have to consider personally.\n"", ""Q. Do you have an idea, generally, of the kind of Secretary of State you're thinking of?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I have in mind a kind of Secretary of State, I think that's what Mr. Mears referred to.\n"", 'Q. [Tape garbled] ...\n', ""Governor Carter. No, I have not decided on a particular person. I could if I wanted to, which I don't; I could probably list five people who would be the most likely candidates.\n"", ""Q. It was said that John Kennedy never met McNamara until a day or two before he appointed him Secretary of Defense. But you're saying that you won't be in that position when you make your choices?\n"", ""Governor Carter. No, I don't think Kennedy had ever met Dean Rusk before he was chosen Secretary of State.\n"", 'Q. Do you think that was a mistake?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, it's different from what I hope to do. I might very well choose Cabinet members after I'm elected whom I've never met. But my early nomination and the length of time that's been available to us since the Ohio, New Jersey, California primaries when my nomination was fairly well assured, has given me a chance to get to know a lot of these people and then, over a 2 year period before that, before the convention, I've worked very hard with large groups of people on economics and welfare and health and transportation, agriculture and the different aspects of foreign affairs. So I've had a good chance to learn, you know, in that way. It's just my nature to plan far ahead and become involved personally in the evolution of policy. I don't say that in a critical way, I don't think it was a mistake that Kennedy chose either McNamara or Rusk.\n"", 'Q. Governor, Gregg says we have time for one more question. Walter, you wanted to ask about the campaign.\n', ""Q. I simply wanted to ask if you could give us your feelings at this point on where it stands, and what you've been able to accomplish in your first 2 weeks, and what you think the impact of the debates is going to be now?\n"", ""Governor Carter. My overall feeling is one of success the first 2 weeks. We are running an almost unprecedented campaign as far as complexities concerned, and as far as an all-out commitment is concerned to meet as many people as we can, to let as many people get to know me, to cover as wide a range of issues, to make as many different major statements, to subject myself to cross-examination and knowledge among the American people. Not only is this going on in my own case, but my wife, my three sons and their wives are all campaigning full time, and so is Senator Mondale and his wife. There are 13 of us who are constantly scheduled. We have staff people, advance people, whom we are paying ourselves, by the way, and not having the taxpayers pay, as is the case with President Ford. And the complexity of this is challenging, but I think it's fruitful. A couple of times a week I talk to Rosalynn, my wife, late at night, and every weekend we have a chance to talk to my sons and their wives, and I see Senator Mondale and talk to him a couple of times a week. And we've all been pleased so far.\n"", ""The acceptance of our visits has been good; the size of the crowds has been good; the enthusiasm and response has been gratifying. I think our advance people and our issues people and our state coordinators—we have a coordinator in all 50 states—have reached a better compatibility this week than they had last week. Many of these have been brought into our campaign for the first time since the convention, but in general I've been well pleased. I think that the accumulative impact of our repeated visits will pay off. I was in Indiana, a state that doesn't get visited very much, my wife and I and Chip have all been to Indiana already. I was in Alabama, Monday morning.... I'm the first Democratic nominee who ever visited the State of Alabama in the history of the country. My sons have already been there; my wife has been there; I've been there; and this is typical. Last week we visited 37 different states. This week about the same. And we hope to maintain this rate of campaigning, except I am going to take a couple of days off before each debate.\n"", 'I think the debates, unless President Ford or I make a serious mistake, will probably solidify support and naturally, leaning voters—it would make their degree of commitment more solid. I think it would help to alleviate a lot of the concerns about me. President Ford is much better known than I am. He is much more predictable than I am. And I think the juxtaposition of myself with him in the debates will accrue to my own benefit if I do a good job in the debates—which I intend to do.\n', 'So I look forward to the debates with a great deal of anticipation. I think they will show that, contrary to the rhetoric that was constant in the Republican Convention, that I am not a radical, that I am not completely ignorant about defense or foreign affairs, that I am a substantial person. And if I can project that image in the debates, it would be a great asset for me, I think.\n', 'Q. Do you think it will take care of the concerns mentioned in that Harris poll?\n', 'Governor Carter. I wish I had seen the poll. I think that to strike one element out of a poll is a substantial and, I might say, unwarranted distortion. The overall results of our polls show that when you ask, ""Does Jimmy Carter care about people like me?"" and compare it with, ""Does Gerald Ford care about people like me?"" which is an element, a measurement of trust, I came out better than he does.\n', 'Q. I think Harris put you ahead of Ford. But he says there is a problem among your supporters because their perception of you as a handler of issues is more troubled—that was at the time of the convention.\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't deny that. As I say, I wish everybody had complete trust in me, and I believe that the debates will help to alleviate concern that has been pointed out.""]"
74,Jimmy Carter ,"September 17, 1976","[""It's good to be back in Arkansas. This is a state that I have visited often in the last few years. When the returns came in in the primary, you gave me a tremendous victory, and when the returns come in on November 2nd, I believe you are going to do the same thing.\n"", ""As David [Pryor] pointed out, the times have changed. The last time a President was elected to go to the White House from the deep South was in 1848. Monday morning I went to Birmingham to campaign with Senator Sparkman and Governor Wallace, and when I arrived there they told me that I was the first Democratic nominee who had ever come to Alabama in the history of our nation. I just came here from Biloxi, Mississippi, and the two great Senators from Mississippi, Eastland and Stennis, told me that they couldn't remember when a Democratic nominee had been to their state to campaign.\n"", ""And I'm glad to be part of a process that lets me share the tremendous southern political heritage with great men like them and your own great Senator McClellan whom I admire very much and whom I am grateful to for being here. He represents everything that is good and decent, that's strong, honest, that's committed to the Constitution and laws of our nation, as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, playing a major role in guaranteeing our nation a strong defense, there's a sense of reassurance about his presence there.\n"", ""• David Pryor, who was nice enough to introduce me in such glowing terms, represents a great combination of compassion and concern for people who need the legitimate services of government and also the tough managerial experience that he's brought to the governorship of Arkansas.\n"", '• When I was elected governor myself in 1970,1 shared the glory of that new political day in the South with Dale Bumpers, and I think that one of the reasons that I have worked so hard and been challenged so greatly and had to rise to the challenge is because he provided me with the toughest possible competition as a southern governor. But he and I and Reuben Askew, and John West and others shared a common concern, and a common experience, and a common confidence, and a common hope, and dream that we might just measure up, barely, to what the people of our region have always represented.\n', '• Congressman Ray Thornton, who is leading the drive for voter registration, on the Agriculture Committee, important to me and to all those who have been involved in farm life throughout most of our years.\n', '• Bill Alexander, a tough, hard worker, for the rural areas of our country, also on the Appropriations Committee. This helps us throughout the South.\n', ""• Congressman Wilbur Mills, who was a stalwart leader in the Ways and Means Committee, who shaped the policies in veterans' assistance, welfare, health, taxation, for our country.\n"", ""• Jim Guy Tucker, who's going to go to Congress next year, to carry on the great southern tradition.\n"", ""So I'm proud to be part of what the Democratic Party is, and what the southland is. Twenty one months ago, I decided to run actively for President, and I began my campaign.\n"", 'Four years ago, September of 1972, I made a decision to make the contest. When I began running, nobody knew who I was much, very few people cared; I came from a town with 683 people. I didn\'t hold public office, I didn\'t have very much [support]; I didn\'t have a built-m campaign organization, but I and my wife and my three sons and their wives and a few volunteers began going from one home to another, sometimes we\'d invite the community, three or four people would show up in a living room. We\'d go to a labor hall that would hold several hundred people. Maybe ten people would come. So we went to factory shift lines, and spent most of our time explaining to people who I was, and what I was running for. And we\'d go into shopping centers, beauty parlors, barber shops, livestock sale bams, farmers\' markets. When I told my mother that I was going to run for President, what she actually said was, ""President of what?""\n', ""But we have come a long way. And the reason is that we have had to take the kind of approach that has been typical of our party. I've come a long way in the last two weeks. Monday a week ago, I started off in Warm Springs. I've already got to Hot Springs. But I'm going to maintain that kind of progress throughout the campaign.\n"", 'I decided to go to Warm Springs, Georgia, to kick off my campaign because fifty years ago this year Franklin Roosevelt purchased that site. He had been stricken with polio, he was deeply afflicted, and as a handicapped person he went there to regain his strength, his self-confidence, his hope, his purpose in life. He was a rich man, but he saw in his own handicapped state that a lot of other Americans were handicapped because of the debts of the depression brought on by the Hoover Administration. Roosevelt saw how afflicting joblessness is. He saw the need for paying wages to adults who labored with their hands. He saw a need to give people some security in their old age, some sense of dignity and purpose and confidence. As the leader of our party, he proposed the first minimum wage law—25 cents an hour. It finally passed with the help of a Democratic Congress. Ninety-five percent of the Republicans voted against paying 25 cents for an adult man or woman to work with manual labor for an hour. Roosevelt brought, over the objection of the Republican Congress Members, rural electrification. H? proposed the simple concept of Social Security; there were 95 members of the House who were Republicans—94 voted against Social Security. This is typical of what our party has always done.\n', 'And then came along Harry Truman, a common man but an uncommon leader. He made tough decisions when the circumstances required it He never backed off, no matter what it was—Point Four, NATO, the concept oi the Marshall Plan, aid to Turkey and Greece, formed the United Nations, recognized Israel immediately. It was always a sure feeling in our minds that when Truman spoke he told the truth. And there was never any doubt who was the leader of our country. He had a sign on his desk in the oval office— does anyone remember what it said? The buck stops here. Nowadays, things have changed. The buck can run all over Washington now and not find a place to stop.\n', ""Leadership is missing. And when we have no leadership in the White House, the country drifts. So as far as compassion is concerned, understanding closeness to the people, hopes, ideals, dreams, patriotism, self-confidence, dignity, of human beings, the Democratic Party is there, constant, never changing, deeply committed, expressing the purposes first expressed by Thomas Jefferson. But there are other things that are involved too—the change with each generation. And I think it's good to compare the two parties. Unemployment is now 7.9 percent. We have 500,000 more Americans unemployed today than we did three months ago. When Kennedy and Johnson went out of office, the unemployment rate was less than 4 percent When Truman went out of office, unemployment was less than 3 percent\n"", ""Let's talk about inflation, that robs us all. The average inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson, 2.2 precent. When Truman went out of office, the inflation rate was less than 1 percent. Under Nixon and Ford, the average inflation rate is 6.5 percent, three times what it was under Kennedy and Johnson, more than 6 times what it was when Truman went out of office.\n"", ""Let's talk about fiscal integrity, balanced budgets. Last year's deficit [was] $65 billion. More than the whole 8 years, cumulative, of Kennedy and Johnson. Truman was in office 7 years. We didn't have an average deficit. We had an average surplus of $2 billion. So inflation control, jobs for our people, balanced budgets, sound management, [are] also a part of the Democratic Party. How can you combine services for our people, better health care, better job opportunities, insurance in their old age, good farm programs, rural electric membership corporations, a chance in life, with a sound tough competent government? The Democratic Party has been able to do it historically, and that's the issue this year. A choice by each individual American person, what kind of government do I want?\n"", 'Bankruptcies last year, for small businessmen like myself, [were] twice as _ great as they were in 1968. The White House budget itself, completely under the control of the President, in 1969 was $3.6 million. For this next year, $16J4 million, an increase of over 400 percent. Well, this brings us down to questions about what we want in government. I believe we need to decide as leaders the things the government can do, and the things the government cannot do, and should not do. When there is a choice between a government performing a function and private industry or individuals performing that function, I say we ought to go with the private sector and not to the government.\n', 'There need not be a fear of government. We have no fear of government. But I think we ought to have a government the people understand and control, and not the other way around. We need to have a minimum of secrecy in government, a maximum of personal privacy for human beings, who have a choice between the federal, state and local levels of government having the responsibility or authority, the choice ought to be with the government closest to the individual citizen. These are the kinds of concepts that never change in a Democratic Party, and let us tie together good services and sound management.\n', ""As I've said in my acceptance speech in Madison Square Garden, our income tax structure is a disgrace to the human race. It needs to be changed. The American people are not selfish, we don't want to grasp for some advantage for ourselves that our neighbors don't have. We want to be treated fairly. We want it to be done in such a way to restore our confidence in our own government. Now the surest income to be taxed in this country is the income earned from manual labor. A family that makes less than $10,000 per year pays a higher proportion of that income in total taxes than does a family that makes more than $1 million a year. That's not right I don't believe we'll ever solve the difficulty of tax inequity and confusion until we have total comprehensive tax reform and, if I'm elected President this November, and I intend to be, we're going to have that beginning next January.\n"", ""I come from a poor part of the country. And I believe in a good welfare system. We now have about 12 million people who draw welfare benefits on a regular basis. About 1.3 million of those are fully able to work. There is nothing wrong with them mentally or physically, they are not too old, they are not blind. They should be removed from the welfare system altogether and placed under the responsibility of the Labor Department, the Education Department. They should be given job training, literacy instruction if they can't read and write, the services of public and private job placement agencies, and offered a job. If they are offered a job and don't take it, I wouldn't pay them any more benefits. The other 90 percent can't work full-time. We ought to treat them with understanding and with fairness, and concern, and compassion. There ought to be a fairly uniform nationwide payment to meet the basic necessities of life. We ought to have built into those welfare laws an encouragement to work part-time. We ought to remove the elements of the welfare laws that encourage or force a father to leave their home, or pretend to leave their home. The present welfare system is anti-work, and anti-family. And it also ought to be completely revised. I believe the American people are honest enough, fair enough, concerned enough, intelligent enough, to have a fair welfare system. And I believe that everything the government does—in welfare, taxation, in transportation, Social Security, health, education—ought to be designed to keep families together, not to separate them, and to protect our neighborhoods, and I intend to do that too, especially.\n"", ""I served eleven years in the Navy. All of my folks have been in Georgia more than 210 years. Nobody in my father's family ever had a chance to finish high school before me. But I went to the U.S. Naval Academy, and I served in the submarine force. And I learned then that we need to have a strong defense. The most important single responsibility on the shoulders of a President, is to guarantee the security of our country, a freedom from the threat of successful attack or blackmail, and the ability to carry out our obligations to our allies. I believe with tough management we can eliminate the waste and confusion and have a tough, muscular, simple, well-organized, narrowly focused defense capability, the capability to fight And with that capability, that's known by us and known by the world, there comes the best guarantee of peace, and I intend to insist on that, and work for that as President of this country as well.\n"", ""There are just a couple of more things I want to mention. We need to Have a competent government. We don't have a competent government. It's wasteful, it's confused, it overlaps functions, it's not accountable. It's wrapped in secrecy. And the clear delineation of responsibility and authority are just not there. We need to have a total reorganization of the Executive Branch of government. And if I'm elected President in November, I guarantee you that I'm going to put full time on this subject so that we can have for a change an efficient, economical, purposeful and manageable government. If I'm elected, you can depend on that. And I believe the Congress and the people are ready for it. So tax reform, welfare reform, government reorganization, also need to be combined with management principles, zero-based budgeting, sunset laws, and we need to have some interrelationship between the people and the major Cabinet departments.\n"", ""I'd just like to say one word about agriculture. One of the reasons that I get up early every morning—five or six days a week—and put in 16 hours campaigning—is so that January 20, 1977, I can send Earl Butz back where he came from, and have in the Secretary's office someone that will listen and someone that can convince the American people, along with me as President, that what's best for the family farmer in the long run is exactly what's best for the consumer. The day before yesterday, I spoke to about 65 to 70,000 people at the farmfest in Minnesota. Earl Butz was there the day before I was. And he predicted to the crowd, there was only a couple of hundred folks I understand—he couldn't draw that big a crowd in Georgia, I don't believe—but he predicted to them that when I arrived that I was going to announce that, when I was elected President, he would be fired. That's the first accurate prediction that Earl Butz has made in a long time.\n"", 'I made a speech last spring to the Gridiron Club in Washington, and my good friend Earl Butz was there, and he walked up to me and he said, ""Governor, I understand that everywhere you go, you promise that you are going to fire me if you are elected."" I said, ""Yes sir, that\'s right."" ""But why do you have to say it more than once?"" I said, ""Well, that\'s my best applause line, first of all,"" and I said, ""Also, in a lot of places in the country the farmers are very discouraged,"" and it gives them something to look forward to next year.""\n', ""But we need to have a predictable agriculture policy. We need to have uninterrupted and strong export commitments. We need to make sure that carryover stocks, when they do occur, at least half of them are controlled by farmers. We need to have a presentation to the American people about the facts involved in agriculture. We've got now, we who are involved in farming, to be a very small minority. And unless we maintain a strong voice based on an accurate presentation of the facts about our lives, then we are in danger of being destroyed economically because of an insensitive government. It is very important that this be done.\n"", ""One last thing I want to say is this. I don't claim to know all the answers. In the process of campaigning, I've learned a lot about our country. Fve had to, because of an absence of support from powerful people. I've had to go directly to the voters themselves. We've built up a campaign organization as those of you who are familiar with Arkansas politics know, in large measure based on those who had never been actively involved in politics before. It's a good, solid base of support. It represents the essence of the Democratic Party. A closeness with the people themselves. A commitment to their needs. I owe special interest nothing. I owe the people everything. And I'm going to keep it that way.\n"", 'The other night, my opponent, reluctantly emerged from the Rose Garden and finally made his first speech of the campaign. He spoke of his vision of America. And it was a fine vision, and a noble vision. The only trouble was that my opponent has spent his entire life in politics opposing the programs that make that vision come true.\n', 'He seems to have experienced, in the last few weeks, a remarkable conversion at this late date in his political life.\n', ""But I don't think the people will be fooled. Mr. Ford cannot rhapsodize about the future as if he and his party had no past. The Republican Party from Hoover and McKinley and Coolidge to Nixon, has been the party of negativism and opposition.

The Democratic Party, the party of Roosevelt and Truman, and John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson, is a party that has a genuine vision for America and has always fought to make that vision a reality.\n"", ""Let me close by speaking just a few minutes about my vision of our future. My vision as the heir to a great Democratic tradition. It is a vision that has deepened and grown and matured during the 21 months that I have campaigned through this great land.

75,Jimmy Carter ,"September 24, 1976","['One of the biggest issues in this campaign is the Republican mismanagement of the economy. The Republicans have managed for the past eight years to give us both rising unemployment rates and rising inflation—something the economists had always said was impossible.\n', ""Economics is a very complicated business. Not many people understand it. But we'd better all try to understand it, because Republican economic policies are robbing us all, every day, and have been for almost eight years.\n"", ""Let's look at one statistic and what it means. A few days ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that consumer prices rose by 0.5 percent in August—last month. That may not sound like much, but on an annual basis that's 6 percent inflation for a year.\n"", 'The White House press secretary said the administration was ""encouraged"" by the 0.5 percent figure. I suppose he meant he was happy it wasn\'t 10 percent or 20 percent—there isn\'t anything else to be ""encouraged"" about.\n', ""Let's compare that 6 percent figure with some past inflation figures.\n"", 'We had serious inflation during the Korean War—3.8 percent in 1950 and 5.9 percent in 1951—but even that was less than today. Once that war was over the inflation rate settled down, and for the next 14 years, from 1952 through 1965, the annual rate of increase for consumer prices averaged only 1.3 percent—less than one-fourth of the rate that the White House now finds so encouraging.\n', 'Inflation went up during the last three years of the Johnson Administration largely because of the war in Vietnam, but even then it averaged only 3.7 percent.\n', ""Then we come to the Nixon years. Inflation was 8.8 percent in 1973 and 12.2 percent in 1974. Since then it has been up and down, but the overall average has been 6 percent. Last year, Mr. Ford's first full year in office, it was 7 percent. This year it is headed toward being 6 percent. Next year's projection is—once again—6 percent.\n"", ""The Republicans have become six-percenters on inflation. They ask us to accept that rate, to think of 6 percent as normal, to be glad it isn't worse. But the fact is that it is a terrible, unacceptable rate, and that their own mismanagement has caused it. The Republicans have tried to halt inflation by slowing down the economy—by putting people out of work—and that policy has been a dismal failure.\n"", 'What does this 6 percent inflation mean to the average American? It means that if you put your money in the bank and collect 5 percent interest, you are losing money instead of making money on your savings. It means that if you live on fixed income, as many elderly Americans do, our money is worth less and less each day, just as surely as if someone was robbing you.\n', ""And for the average worker, it means that wage increases don't mean anything unless the increase is greater than the inflation rate. And that hasn't been the case during the Ford Administration.\n"", ""Let's translate the percentages into actual wages. During the Kennedy-Johnson years, the average weekly earnings of an American worker with a wife and two children increased from $90.95 to $103.39, and those are adjusted figures that take inflation into account. In other words, in terms of real purchasing power, the average worker was making more than $12 a week more at the end of the Democratic era, an increase of more than $600 over the full eight years, or an average annual increase of more than $75.\n"", ""Now let's look at what happened under the Republicans. In 1969, the Republicans' first year, the average weekly income rose to $104.38. Five years later, in 1974, the year Mr. Ford took office, the average had actually gone down a penny, to $104.37. And now, today, after two years of the Ford Administration, the average wage in real purchasing power has dropped to $102.88. In the last two years, in other words, weekly income has gone down about $1.50, which is a $78 loss for his two years or a loss of $39 per year.\n"", 'In short, Gerald Ford, with the economic policies he lakes such pride in, has managed in two years to set the American worker back more than eight years, back to a lower average wage than he had in 1968, the last Democratic year. Under the Republicans the worker and his family have been on a treadmill, and under Ford the treadmill has accelerated, so that no matter how fast he runs or how hard he works, the average worker keeps losing ground.\n', ""This isn't fair. It isn't right. It reflects economic policies that are inept at best and indifferent at worst. Democratic prosperity has been replaced by Republican stagnation—and yet they ask us to be encouraged by their record and to vote for four more years of the same.\n"", 'Here are some things we should do to lower inflation: (1) decrease federal budget deficits through increased revenues; (2) increase productivity; (3) increase competition through strict anti-trust enforcement and by reform of government regulations which have an inflationary impact (for example, regulation of airline fares and the backhaul rule); (4) increase employment—since only 73 percent of our industrial capacity is being utilized, we can reduce unemployment through selective programs without increasing inflation; (5) ensuring a more adequate supply of basic commodities on a more predictable basis; (6) voluntary wage and price guidelines worked out in close cooperation with labor and industry, with prior notice being afforded of any increases above those voluntary guidelines; (7) through public leadership—jawboning—by the President—such as John Kennedy exercised during the 1962 steel price increases; (8) strengthening the Council on Wage and Price Stability so that it more adequately exercises its subpoena power, with public hearings to focus attention on excessive price and wage increases; (9) reorganization and zero-based budgeting together with such laws.\n', ""I've been talking about inflation today, but the Republican mismanagement has caused high unemployment as well. Every Republican Administration since Hoover has left office with an unemployment rate at least double what it was when they took office. The Nixon-Ford duo has continued this tradition. When Nixon became President in January of 1969, the unemployment rate was 3.4 percent. When Ford leaves office next January, he will leave us at least a 7 percent unemployment rate, and probably worse. The Republicans have proved they can give us high unemployment and high inflation at the same time. We Democrats have shown that we can provide low inflation and low unemployment. That's one of the differences between us.\n"", ""I think America can do better. I think it's time for Democratic leadership that can enact economic policies that put people ahead of the special interests, and return us to the prosperity of the Democratic years. I ask every American who agrees with me to vote for the Carter-Mondale ticket on November 2.""]"
76,Jimmy Carter ,"September 24, 1976","['Bob Strauss [Chairman of the Democratic National Committee] has meant an awful lot to our party, and to our country. Shortly after the beautiful Texas primary in early May and immediately after the primaries in California, New Jersey, and Ohio, I asked Bob to stay on as Chairman of the Democratic Party and Bob agreed although he earlier had indicated he might step down. He is an outstanding chairman.', 'This state is one of greatness, of vision, of understanding and competence. You produced great leaders. I was pleased at the convention in Madison Square Garden that when I went down the list of Roosevelt, Truman. Kennedy, Johnson—that the Democratic delegates from all over this country, as well as myself, recognized the unbelievable contribution of Lyndon Johnson to our country—to the downtrodden and the poor.', 'And as I said in a recent magazine interview, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, no one in the history of our nation in 200 years has done more for basic human rights.', ""We started out our campaign 21 months ago. I didn't hold public office and I didn't have much money. I had $43,000 for a Presidential campaign. I came from a small town—683 people. I didn't have a nationwide campaign organization. And not many people knew who I was. But we began to campaign as a family with a few volunteers, going in living rooms. Four or five people would come to our meetings in labor halls and other places, and then we went to factory shift lines, and shopping centers, and livestock sales bams and farmers' markets, and beauty parlors and barbershops and restaurants to meet people, to talk to people, but mostly to listen."", 'And to absorb in the consciousness of a candidate for President of the United States what our people are, what our nation is, and what we can be. Today I want to talk about two things, leadership and people.', ""Ours is a government, ours is a nation that requires strong leadership in the White House. There's only one person in this country who can speak with a clear voice to the American people. There's only one person who can set a standard of ethics and morality and excellence and greatness. There's only one person that can call on the American people to make that sacrifice and explain the purpose of the sacrifice. Or ask the difficult questions or propose solutions to problems or put forward to the Congress bold programs to meet our needs. Or provide for an adequate defense, or speak for this country in the council of nations. And that person is the President."", ""In the absence of that leadership, there is no leadership. And the country drifts. And lately the country has been drifting. That is not characteristic of the United States to drift. In the last 2 years, we've seen 2J4 million Americans added to the unemployment roles; 2/s million Americans in just 2 years. That's equivalent to the population of Mississippi, South Carolina, Oklahoma—a. lot of people. In the last 3 months, we've seen the unemployment rolls grow 500,000. Last year, we saw the highest deficit this nation has ever seen, $55 billion. More than all the combined deficits of the 8 years that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson served in the White House; $65 billion in 1 year. This is not the America that we've known. That is not the America that we can have. Leadership must be derived not from an imperialistic attitude toward the Presidency, but from a constant realization of the source of thr leader's strength."", 'My political support in the primaries, my strength if I become President, will be derived directly from the people.', ""And this is the kind of leadership that can be maintained in a continuing way and make us all proud that the basic principles are inculcated in the minds and hearts of Texans and Georgians, and Americans all over this ountry. When it's a choice between the government doing something and private sector doing something, we believe that it's best to put the authority and the responsibility as near as possible to the individual human being, and if it's a choice between work and welfare, the American people prefer to go to work. We prefer a minimum of secrecy in government and a maximum of privacy in our own lives—a minimum of government secrecy. And we haven't had that lately. In the last 8 years we've been disillusioned, we've been held at arms length, we've been alienated, we've been discouraged, we've been embarrassed, sometimes we've been ashamed of our own government. That need not be. And politically speaking it draws clear issues in he 1976 campaign. But the thing that concerns me is the other side of the coin. How does this affect people?"", 'Think about a father proud like you are, competent like you are, self-reliant like you are. The head of a household—like many of you, or a mother, eager to work—can\'t find a job. They come home at night, face the children with the authority and the responsibility and the respect that should go to he breadwinner stripped away. Put yourself in that position. Think of going down and drawing your first welfare check. When you\'ve worked all yourlife. It tears a family apart. It destroys their self-respect, it eliminates basic human dignity. And in this last 2 years, 2 1/2 million more Americans have had to accept that circumstance. Let\'s look at inflation. When it was announced that the inflation rate was only 6 percent—President Ford and his press secretary said, ""That\'s great, just 6 percent."" And when Johnson and Kennedy were in office before the Vietnam War, the inflation rate was 3 perrent. When Harry Truman went out of office, it was less than 1 percent. A 6 percent inflation rate comes in and steals the ability of a family to be held together. Older people with fixed incomes fear the day that their lives are squeezed. An elderly person on a fixed retirement check buys inferior food, maybe has to leave one\'s own home, can\'t buy a new dress every year, and when Christmas time comes, if they can give their grandchildren a present, it\'s a cheap present That\'s a debilitating circumstance. Families that have been wise and prudent and worked hard and saved their money and put it in a savings account, [at] 5 percent interest, find that every year they\'ve lost 1 percent on their life\'s savings. This is not the kind of nation that we had. It is not the kind of nation that we must have. I\'ve worked all my life, with my hands mostly, except for the time I was in the Navy and the 4 years I was governor. I grew up on a farm. I balanced my family\'s budget. I balanced my farm\'s budget. I balanced my businessman\'s budget. I met payrolls. I didn\'t go into debt, except when I was sure I could repay the debt on time. I was governor for 4 years. The budget was always balanced. We had a healthy surplus every year.', ""If I'm elected President, one of the major goals of my administration will be to balance the federal budget, and you can depend on it. Now we can meet our needs. Nobody can say that Lyndon Johnson held back in meeting the needs of people and, when Richard Nixon went to the White House, he inherited a balanced budget. Truman was in office 7 years; he didn't have a deficit, he had an average surplus of $2 billion a year. In the last 8 years of the Republican Administration our total deficit—in 8 years—equals all the combined deficits of the preceding 92 years. Is that management? Right It is not management. That's not a characteristic of our nation. So tough, competent management has got to be combined with the meeting of people's needs. You can't have a balanced budget, you can't end inflationary spirals with 7 1/2 or 8 million Americans out of work who are looking for jobs."", 'We need to reorganize the bureaucratic mess in Washington. And if I\'m elected, it\'s going to be done. I give you my word of honor. I don\'t believe anybody who has been bogged down in Washington 25 or 30 years is going to make a change that\'s basic. When I was elected governor, we did it. We had 300 agencies, departments, bureaus, [and] commissions; we eliminated 278 of them. We cut them down to a manageable level. We opened up government so people could understand it and control it. As Briscoe pointed out, we instituted zero budgeting, and I\'ll do it as soon as I get to the White House—strip down the government and start from scratch. We will eliminate unnecessary programs, detect overlapping and duplication, and set priorities for our nation that meet our needs next year, and not what was needed 50 years ago. We need to decrease the influence of lobbyists and special interest groups. We must maintain sustained growth. God\'s blessed us in this country with rich farmland and mineral resources, manufacturing capabilities, and our religious ethic to work. We believe in the Ten Commandments. One of them says that, ""Six days shalt thou labor and the other day you should honor the Lord\'s day."" But most Americans remember the 6 days part as well. This resource that we have, needs to be adequately tapped. We\'ve seen under this Republican Administration the first balance-of-trade deficit since the Great Depression, I think in 100 years, since the War Between the States. That\'s not a characteristic of our country. We need an aggressive sale of American products overseas, we need to put an end to the constant Republican farm embargoes, and we need to put someone in charge of the Agriculture Department that understands that what is best for the family farmer in the long run is exactly what\'s best for the consumer.', ""Those are just some thoughts that came to my mind. Now we've got some other problems. I talked to you about the destruction of the family. We need to protect the neighborhoods; we need to preserve our pride in our ethnic heritage, and past. And we need to be tough and deeply involved in correcting our mistakes, and not fearful about the future. Crime is something that's increased so greatly in the last few years, it's almost inconceivable. The crime rate in this country in the last 8 years has increased 58 percent, in the last 2 years, 29 percent of it. One of the things is that in our federal government in Washington, we have not seen a good example set. I'm not just talking about Watergate, which is bad enough. We've had two Attorneys General convicted of serious crimes."", ""The CIA has spied on our own people. The FBI has committed burglaries. I remember the time up until recently that when you said the three letters FBI, your heart kind of lifted up with pride. There is an institution of professionals who protect my life and who protect my property. And we thought they would never do anything that was shameful. But lately it's changed. And it hurts us all; that attitude comes down throughout our society. The unemployment rate contributes to crime. The overloaded judicial system contributes to crime. The thing that hurts, too, is the realization that if you don't have influence, if you're poor, an average member of a working American family, and you commit a crime, you've got a good chance of going to prison. But if you're rich, you'll never see the inside of a prison in this country."", ""And that's not right. I'm not trying to send rich people to prison, but the point I make is that there ought not to be a double standard."", ""The American people are fair. Our system of justice is not fair. The American people are honest. Our government hasn't been honest. The American people believe in work. We've developed in recent-years a welfare government. The American people believe in tough, competent management. We've seen evolve a bloated, confused, bureaucratic mess. The American people believe that we ought to control our government. On the other hand, we've seen government more and more controlling us. These things are not part of the consciousness of Texans or Americans."", ""And to close my remarks, I intend, with your help to change them. And I'm going to depend on you to help me. We ought to have a clear constant vision of what our country can be. We ought not to lower our standards of excellence and greatness. We ought to be sure that we have cooperation with one another. And at the same time respect the differences among us. There ought to be some inclination between the President and the Congress to cooperate for a change, between a mayor and a governor and a President [to] recognize that they represent exactly the same people. There ought to be some way for our free enterprise system—agriculture, manufacturing, and labor to work with the government, with mutual respect, achieving common goals, independent. Competition ought to be insured, tough competition, to protect the small businessman and not be a favor to the big businessman."", ""I don't believe any other human being in this country has traveled more than I have in the last 2 years. I've been to more places, talked to more people, listened to more questions, answered more questions. I see our country's economic strength solid, our system of government is the best on earth, Richard Nixon hasn't hurt it, Watergate hasn't hurt it, the Vietnam and Cambodian Wars didn't hurt it, the CIA revelations didn't hurt our system of government."", ""It's still as clean and decent, a basic foundation on which we can predicate an answer to complicated questions, correct our mistakes, bind ourselves together, and approach the future with confidence."", 'On one last point I want to say, sharing the program with the law enforcement agencies. Last night when I was commenting on the FBI and the CIA, the sound went off for 25 minutes. And I should have known better this afternoon.', ""So let me say this to you in closing. I've run, I think, with an adequate degree of modesty, an unprecedented kind of campaign. My strength has been derived from people like you. I owe special interests nothing. I owe the people everything. I want to keep it that way."", ""This is a time for change in our country. I don't want the people to change. I want the government to change. I can't win without you. It's going to be a tough, hard fought political contest. I look forward to it. Texas, Dallas are difficult for a Democrat to carry, as you know. But particularly to defeat as an outsider an incumbent President with a unified party. I can't do it without you. You and I in partnership—you can't agree with everything I say—but I think you agree with what I've said this afternoon. I hope that you'll commit yourselves, in spite of the non-political nature of the sponsoring group, to help me in the campaign."", ""How many of you think, in a non-political way, that's it's time for a change in Washington?"", ""If you'll help me between now and November 2, then beginning in January of 1977, with the other elected officials, Democrats and Republicans, 1'11 work with you to bring about those changes just to restore what we've lost and once again have a government as good as you are.""]"
77,Jimmy Carter ,"September 25, 1976","['Last May, I spoke at the United Nations on a subject of deep personal concern to me—the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world. Since that speech, much attention has focused on the non-proliferation issue, both in Congress and, rather belatedly, by a White House study group.\n', 'I am pleased by these developments, but we must not be lulled into thinking that the problem has been solved, for it decidedly has not been.\n', 'The continuing global proliferation of nuclear weapons is a dangerous and unacceptable barrier to world peace. The more countries that possess nuclear weapons, the greater the risk that nuclear warfare can erupt in local conflicts, and that these could trigger a major nuclear war. Terrorism, already a grave international threat, takes on an almost unthinkable dimension in a world where plutonium is widely available and inadequately safeguarded.\n', ""At present, only five countries—the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and the People's Republic of China—are known to possess nuclear weapons. But India has exploded a nuclear device, and many countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan, and Taiwan have taken steps toward the development of such weapons. This week Taiwan pledged not to do so.\n"", 'At least 28 countries are expected to be using atomic power to meet at least some of their civilian energy needs by 1980.\n', 'And we must face the fact that any country possessing a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant can recover the plutonium needed to make an atomic bomb from the spent fuel rods of an atomic power reactor.\n', ""Our country was the world's first nuclear nation, and I believe we have an obligation to ensure that the atom is used for truly peaceful purposes. Unfortunately, over the last two years, our government has failed to provide that kind of leadership.\n"", 'When we look for evidence of our purported policy of support for nonproliferation objectives, we find only the faint footprints of secret diplomacy, and official acquiescence to the nuclear industry and to the cynics who say that proliferation and widespread reprocessing are inevitable.\n', 'We have failed miserably to set an example which would encourage other countries not to seek their own nuclear facilities. We have no firm domestic policy on reprocessing or clear programs to deal with the other elements of the nuclear fuel cycle such as management and storage of radioactive waste and uranium enrichment. A court order was needed to force our own nuclear waterdog agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to begin a systematic study of the economics, the feasibility, and the international implications of developing a domestic commercial reprocessing capability.\n', 'We have failed to come to grips with the security problems which a plutonium-based economy poses, with its need for strict accounting for the plutonium produced. According to a study released in August by the General Accounting Office, our government is now unable to account for some 100,000 pounds of nuclear material, of which 6,000 pounds is weapons grade.\n', 'We have committed two-thirds of all of our federal energy research and development funds to atomic power, primarily for the liquid metal fast breeder reactor (LMFBR). Yet this potential source of energy raises serious economic and environmental problems, and will not be economically feasible until the price of uranium increases several times over.\n', 'We have failed to fulfill our decade-old commitment to place our own peaceful nuclear facilities under international safeguards.\n', ""President Ford has shown us where his priorities lie by holding legislation to strengthen U.S. non-proliferation hostage to his highly controversial proposal for private ownership and operation of nuclear fuel enrichment facilities. That he opposes even modest first steps by Congress toward nonproliferation objectives is at best a surrender to the nuclear industry and at worst, a tragic retreat from our commitment to non-proliferation. Moreover, the delay in moving ahead with enlargement of the government owned uranium enrichment facility caused by the President's proposal for private ownership has raised doubts about our own reliability as a supplier of nuclear fuel.\n"", 'Over the last eight years, our government has failed to explore non-nuclear alternative energy sources, investing more than half our energy research and development budget in nuclear fission. Non-nuclear alternatives such as solar and geothermal power would not only relieve domestic pressure to increase our reliance on atomic power, but would provide other nations which have not yet opted for nuclear energy with a choice.\n', 'On the domestic front alone, the Republican record is one of which no American can be proud. But the bankruptcy of our international record is even worse.\n', 'President Ford has failed to oppose the export of plants for nuclear fuel reprocessing. When West Germany agreed to sell a reprocessing plant to Brazil, the United States did nothing. When France proposed a similar arrangement with Pakistan, Secretary Kissinger began his briefcase diplomacy only after these two countries had completed their negotiations. In 1974, when India exploded its so-called ""peaceful"" nuclear device, the United States made no public expression of disapproval. We have since rewarded India with additional supplies of nuclear materials.\n', ""President Ford has seriously neglected this country's obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NPT, an initiative of the Johnson Administration, has now been ratified by 95 non-weapons states. Under its terms, these countries have agreed not to develop nuclear weapons and to accept international safeguards on all their civilian nuclear activities. Throughout the years of Republican indifference we have done little to encourage the dozen or more non-NPT countries with active nuclear programs to join. In fact, we have given more assistance to those countries who have not signed the treaty than we have to those who have. For example, in recent hearings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on continuation of nuclear aid to India, the State Department has become that country's chief advocate and apologist, even though India, not an NPT party, used our past aid to explode a nuclear device—and even though there are no safeguards to prevent this from happening again.\n"", 'The NPT provides that, in return for nuclear abstinence by non-weapons powers, the nuclear states will make efforts to halt the vertical proliferation of their own weapons. This provision is based on the recognition that we have little right to ask others to deny themselves nuclear weapons until the atomic powers show significant progress toward the control, reduction and ultimate elimination of these weapons. But we and the other superpowers continue nuclear testing, and the SALT agreements with the USSR have done little to halt the race in strategic weapons technology.\n', 'In short, the Ford Administration has only paid lip service to the NPT, and this failure of leadership could have tragic consequences for the entire world. If we will not lead the way toward peace, who will?\n', 'As I said at the United Nations last May, I do not intend to sit by quietly, and accept the timid and cynical arguments that are made about the inevitability of proliferation.\n', 'As President, I will take the following ten steps to control further nuclear proliferation:\n', '1. I will call upon all nations to adopt a voluntary moratorium on the national sale or purchase of enrichment or reprocessing plants—a moratorium which should apply retroactively to the recent German-Brazilian and the French-Pakistan agreements.\n', '2. I will make no new commitments for the sale of nuclear technology or fuel to countries which refuse to forego nuclear explosives, to refrain from national nuclear reprocessing, and to place their nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards.\n', '3. I will seek to withhold authority for domestic commercial reprocessing until the need for, the economics, and the safety of this technology is clearly demonstrated. If we should ever decide to go forward with commercial reprocessing, it should be on a multinational basis.\n', '4. I will call for an international Conference on Energy, to provide a forum in which all nations can focus on the non-proliferation issue. Such a conference must also explore non-nuclear means of meeting eneigy demands of other nations so that no state is forced into a premature commitment to atomic power.\n', '5. I will support a strengthening of the safeguards and inspection authority of the IAEA and place all of our own peaceful domestic nuclear facilities under those safeguards.\n', '6. I will seek to renegotiate our existing agreements as a nuclear supplier, many of which were entered into before we began insisting on reprocessing safeguards and which are now inadequate.\n', '7. I will take steps to ensure that the U.S. is once again a reliable supplier of enriched uranium—the fuel for civilian reactors which is unsuitable for weapons—by supporting enlargement of our government-owned facility.\n', '8. I will explore international initiatives such as multinational enrichment plants and multinational spent fuel storage areas which could provide alternatives to the establishment of enrichment or reprocessing plants on a national basis.\n', '9. I will redirect our own energy research and development efforts to correct the disproportionate emphasis which we have placed on nuclear power at the expense of renewable energy technologies. Our emphasis on the breeder reactor must be converted into a long term, possibly multinational effort.\n', '10. Finally, I will follow through on my belief that the United States can and should negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty with the Soviet Union, and reduce, through the SALT talks, strategic nuclear forces and technology.\n', '11. I will encourage the Soviet Union to join us in a total ban of all nuclear explosions for at least five years. This ban would include so-called ""peaceful nuclear devices"".\n', 'This is the leadership which the American people have every right to expect and to demand of their President. We must not use the difficulty of the nuclear proliferation problem as an excuse to justify timidity on the part of the United States in standing up for the goal of world peace through limitation on the proliferation of nuclear weapons throughout the world.']"

When I came to Indiana my last trip before the primary, standing on a cold factory shift line, early in the morning, I had a good friend standing at my side. He had campaigned around the country for President, and when he withdrew he gave me his support, and I'll never forget the strong friendship and the kindness and support of Birch Bayh. Birch, I really appreciate it.\n"", ""After I leave here tonight I'm going home, and see my wife and see my little girl and visit my farm, and be in my own home, in a little town.

If it ever moves again, which I doubt, I'm sure we're going to try to back it into the future. We need a Democratic President to face forward and to approach the future with confidence, with the people, move our country, restore leadership to the White House, and the integrity and pride of the people of this country in our own nation. If you help me in November, I'll help you in January to get this country moving again. I know that's what you want. [applause]\n"", ""He says he'll try to run on the Republican record. In the last 8 years, we've seen our welfare double. When Richard Nixon went into the White House, we were spending about $2}4 billion on unemployment compensation. $2 1/2 billion! Now we are spending over $19 billion. In the last 3 months, our unemployment rolls have increased 500,000. Since Mr. Richard Nixon left the White House, our unemployment rolls have increased 2 1/2 million. That's 2 1/2 million homes like mine in Plains, where the husband or the wife have no jobs. And when you walk into a home day after day after day, having had pride in your self-reliance all your life and your children or your spouse see you without employment, it can destroy a family. Statistics are bad enough. But the human realization of what the Republican Administration has done to this country is what bothers me.\n"", ""We've seen inflation quietly rob our people. Under Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, the unemployment rate most of the time was about 1/3 percent. It got up to an average of about 2 percent. Under Nixon and Ford, it's averaged over 6 percent. The cost of everything you buy goes up double every 10 years, and if you put your life savings in a saving and loan bank at 5 percent interest, you don't make any money; you lose 1 percent every year. Older people, retired people on a fixed income see the light bills go up, the telephone bills go up, rents go up, property taxes go up, and they have to buy cheaper and cheaper food, do without a new dress, many move out of their own homes. When they buy Christmas presents for their grandchildren, it's just a little bit cheap.\n"", ""The human suffering brought about by inflation is something that is quiet; you can't see it, but it robs everybody. You don't quite know why, but your family gets poorer as time goes on. Richard Nixon was bad enough. It's been worse over the last 2 years. We've had four times as large a deficit average under Gerald Ford as we had under Richard Nixon. Four times more. Last year, the deficit was $55 billion, the highest in the history of our country. And the combined Ford and Nixon deficits are greater than all the other 192 years of our nation's history combined.\n"", ""Is that good management, is that good leadership, is that good businesslike operation of our government? No it isn't. And we'll not have an end to the inflationary spiral, we'll never be able to meet our people's legitimate needs until we put our people back to work.\n"", ""I grew up on a farm. I worked all my life. My people have been in Georgia over 200 years. Nobody in my family ever had a chance to finish high school before I did. I know what it means to struggle and struggle successfully and I appreciate my background. When I ran my farm, I balanced the budget. My wife runs our home accounts, she balanced our budget. I run my business with the budget balanced. I was Governor of Georgia. Four years. We had a balanced budget every year and a surplus. And if you elect me President, before this next term is over, we're going to have a balanced budget in Washington and you can depend on that. [applause]\n"", ""Richard Nixon had a Democratic Congress. Gerald Ford has vetoed four time as many bills per year as Richard Nixon. And the bill vetoes have not been designed to save money, they've been designed to keep people out of work, to cut down on veterans' benefits, to keep us from educating and training nurses, to prevent an opening up of the secrets of our government, to stop veterans from training and to keep from having adequate prices for farm products. Those are the kinds of vetoes we've had. And a lot of them have been overridden. Eisenhower only had two vetoes overridden. That affected the American people while he was President. Ford had eleven. In one instance, when he vetoed a bill to help handicapped people; every U.S. Senator except one voted to override the veto. We've had a breakdown in the relationship that ought to exist between the President who's supposed to represent us, and the Congress, who's also supposed to represent us. This hurts the consciousness of our nation. It divides us from one another. It destroys the unity of purpose. It's imperative if we're going to correct our mistakes and ask the difficult questions and bind ourselves together and approach the future with confidence. We've set new records in crime. The nation's crime rate has gone up 58 percent in the last 8 years, 29 percent in the last 2 years. And one of the reasons for it is because our young people can't get jobs. Unemployment is not an excuse for crime, but unemployment causes crime. We've seen an attitude in Washington where the big shots are excused for serious crimes, but the average working people don't get that same excuse and that same treatment in our system of justice and that ought to be changed too.

There are not any hidden, secret loopholes for someone who works with his or her hands, and draws a paycheck every week or every two weeks, or a retirement check every two weeks. But there are hidden secret loopholes for everyone else. The Democratic Congress has struggled in trying to pass a tax reform bill with no help from the administration.

It also broadens the Justice Department's right to investigate antitrust charges. And it requires major corporations to reveal their plans to consolidate and to swallow up smaller companies. The small businessman in this country, the small businesswoman in this country, the consumer in this country, don't have the legal ability to fight every battle in the courts; it's too expensive. But this legislation would help. It would give us a stronger private enterprise system. And restore competition. It's needed. This is not always the case in Washington.

79,Jimmy Carter ,"September 27, 1976","['Q. Governor Carter, when we concluded our regular convention last Friday, we endorsed the Carter-Mondale ticket. We did have some preliminary discussion on the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, and also on 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act. Our people would like to see you push those two items harder than you have. And take a more firm position than you have today.\n', 'Governor Carter. I did not support the Humphrey-Hawkins bill in its original form. But now the bill passed by the House Education [and Labor] Committee has incorporated changes which Congress agreed, and which I agree, have made the bill a very good one. It calls for, first of all, an emphasis on jobs in the private sector. Earlier the emphasis was too much on jobs in the government.\n', 'Secondly, the bill concentrates on a wide range of means by which low unemployment can be achieved. And it sets, I think, a very good goal of 3 percent adult unemployment in four years which would be a tremendous improvement over what we now have. It also gets the government out of the business of trying to plan specific economic steps for the private enterprise system, of which you are the most important part.\n', ""But before the vote, I sent to the chairman of the Education Committee, my complete endorsement of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill in its present form, and I think it's going to be a good bill.\n"", 'On 14(b) I take the same position now, that I took as governor, that although I would not take it on as a crusade, I would be very glad to sign a repeal of right to work or 14(b) when it passes.\n', ""Q. Governor, I've listened to some of your speeches on nuclear energy and I want to tell you now that we have ... [most of question inaudible] ... [labor has come out against nuclear energy]?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Let me tell you about my position on nuclear energy. As I have said many times to audiences around the country, before I did, nobody in my family in more than two hundred years, ever had a chance to finish high school. I went to the U.S. Naval Academy and got an education at government expense, I did my graduate work in nuclear energy and worked under Admiral Rickover in the development of the second atomic submarine. We have 22 referenda around the country that I know about on nuclear power plants. I'm not in favor of any moratorium on any atomic power plants. I think it's not right for a President to leave so much doubt in the minds of our people about safety, that 22 different states have initiated referenda in different states to do away with atomic power plants. For the foreseeable future, we'll have to continue to operate and to build atomic power plants. When I was Governor of Georgia, I worked very closely with a Georgia Power Company to locate and to build and to put down some prescriptions on the design of a major atomic power plant near Baxley, Georgia. And we hope that we'll get another one just south of Augusta in the future. But there are some things that ought to be done. It ought not to be done on an individual state basis. It ought to be done by the federal government And the essence of it is to let the American people know that, when an atomic power plant is built, it can be safe.\n"", ""Let me mention a few things to you, if you've got the time to hear, and I'll be very quick. First of all, the atomic power plant should not be located where people live and where the earthquake fault zones exist, just to guarantee that 20, 30, 40, 50 years from now that plant is likely to be safe.\n"", ""Secondly, we need to have the reactor core located below ground level. The building that houses the entire plant should be tightly sealed and a heavy vacuum maintained. It is physically impossible for an atomic power plant such as we use in this country to explode. But it can melt down and radioactive gases can be released. If they are released, they ought to be held within the building, maybe two, three, four or five years, until the radioactivity goes down. The personnel who are in the building can exit through a standard design escape hatch, which is in place in many places around the country—I've seen them—they might be heavily contaminated, but they would not contaminate the neighborhood. There ought to be a standard design so that every power plant doesn't have to be an experimental model. We ought to have a full-time atomic power representative in the control room 24 hours a day to shut the plant down, independent of orders of the power company, if an abnormality does develop. In the last 25 years, we've only had to do that twice. We've never had a fatality in an atomic power plant in the United States.\n"", ""Another thing that we must do is to have the assurance from the federal government, working closely with the state and local government, that there's an adequate evacuation procedure for people who do live within a certain area around the community so they can understand ahead of time that if something does happen they know what to do to protect themselves. There ought to also be adequate insurance provided for those who might have property that would be damaged if there is a nuclear disaster. Now in my own experience in the atomic power field, I've known but one plant to melt down to go out of control. That was in Short River, Canada. It was in this country; it was a heavy water plant, which we very seldom use in this country, but it melted down and I was one of those who had to go in and clean up the plant after it melted down. But that is a very, very rare occasion. So that's my position on atomic power. We've got to shift from oil to coal, we've got to protect what valuable energy resources we have by strict conservation measures, we've got to increase our research and development program for solar power, continue to use atomic power to make up the difference between those steps and what we need, but the shift should come from the federal level and not from the fifty different states. I think atomic power plants can be safe. We must have though the strict set of precautions that I've outlined to you. Is that clear enough?\n"", ""Q. Governor Carter, I'd like to ask you a campaign question, rather than a political question. I was wondering, within the campaign structure, the Carter-Mondale campaign structure, whether or not guidelines have been established within, among your own staff, at all levels, to make direct contact with and work closely particularly with our local central bodies and some of the major organizations. I can say to you now that in many areas, at least in the West, at this point it is quite loose, and it is to our mutual concern and benefit that something be done to speed this up in the next five weeks?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would hope that our local state coordinators have already contacted you and are working intimately with you. If they aren't, then they will be shortly. And if they haven't been, it's my loss, not yours. I have tried to do this at the national level and our people throughout the country have been told that one of the major supportive forces we have is in the labor movement. And I would hope that in voter registration, in getting out the vote, and in presenting the issues to our people that we could work in very close harmony.\n"", ""There's one point that must be remembered. In the new election laws, concerning financing, we can't participate directly in voter registration. That's a Democratic National Committee function that's separated from my campaign by law. But on getting out the vote, following registration, we can work as a team. But in order to divide the financial responsibility and not charge that much money to my own campaign, the registration part is through the Democratic National Committee, the get out the vote drive will be coordinated between us and you. But make sure that you check with the folks and let them know what we are doing. You here in Oregon, the nine states, well we'll be sure—I'll let one of my people contact you.\n"", 'Q. If you had to do it again, would you change anything about the Playboy interview?\n', 'Governor Carter. The question is about the Playboy interview. I try to run an accessible campaign. I\'ve given interviews to people that would probably be better for me not to talk to. But Playboy has a wide readership, and I think it\'s good for their readers to know about me. The editors particularly wanted to know about my Christian beliefs. And I think that\'s a group of Americans who may not hear enough about Christianity and moral and ethical beliefs, from myself and any other source. So I decided to answer the questions. The basic question that was so controversial, and I wish all of you would read the entire article, I think you would say that it was a good interview, but the particular thing that had so much publicity was when the question was asked, ""As a Baptist, as a Christian, do you condemn other people who don\'t share your religious faith?"" And I said that my religious beliefs are that we are not in a position of condemning others. That we are not supposed to say I\'m not very guilty, another person is very guilty, therefore I condemn another person. God says, ""Judge not that ye be not judged"". And I made the point that as President, I would certainly not condemn those who were different from me, but I would try to work to end the afflictions on our society. That would be my legal responsibility. And I also made the point that Baptists, perhaps as strong as any other denomination, believe in complete separation of church and state. But the one example that I used was about adultery. And it was possibly not a very fortunate choice, but as you know at the Sermon on the Mount, it said that if you even look with lust on a woman you have in your own heart committed adultery, therefore, don\'t condemn people, who may have done even worse. And that was the illustration that I used. And it perhaps was an unfortunate illustration. But I don\'t have any apology to make for it. I thought it was a good way to let the American people, particularly Playboy readers, know about my religious beliefs. I think it was perhaps typical of my campaign. I might say this. I would rather run that kind of campaign and even make a mistake now and then, and let the American people have a contact with me, than to hide in the Rose Garden for eight weeks and ignore the real needs of this campaign, and to isolate myself from the American people. I made the right choice.\n', 'Q. Governor, taxes are near and dear to the hearts of every American, including labor union representatives. The press has had a field day recently trying to make your position misunderstood.\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't know if any of you saw my wife on Meet the Press yesterday. Did anybody see it? I thought she did a superb job, and I don't think I'm prejudiced on that point, but as she pointed out I would never increase taxes on Americans who work for a living, or who report all their tax, all their income on a tax form. We have unbelievable loopholes in the tax laws that make the tax laws disgraceful, that favor those who have very high incomes. Those loopholes only are applicable, in almost every instance, to those who have incomes of $50,000 or more, who have a very large estate and can generate tremendous amounts of income. Last year, 1974 tax returns, there were 3,200 people who made over $50,000 a year and paid not a nickel of income tax. There were over 800 that made over $100,000, and 244 who made over $200,000 income that year and didn't pay a nickel in income tax. And when they don't pay their taxes, you know who pays it for them. You and the other working people of America who don't have lobbyists constantly in Washington trying to carve out a special privilege for their own constituents. As I said in the debate the other night, you can't have a lobbyist with the proceeds from an unemployment check. And so we do need comprehensive tax reform. But I want to repeat again, I will never raise taxes on someone who gets their income from working or who reports all their income on an income tax return.\n"", 'Thank you very much.

We've now got 6 1/2 percent inflation—average for the last 8 years. Under Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, the inflation rate was about 2 percent. This is not just a figure; it's a constant daily robbing of those who are retired, who have fixed incomes, who have a savings account at 5 percent interest, who see their earnings shrink one percent a year 6 percent inflation minus 5 percent interest, is a 1 percent loss.

82,Jimmy Carter ,"October 01, 1976","['Q. You have criticized the Ford Administration for allowing farm income to slip in the last year. What would you do to increase farm income?', 'Governor Carter. ""Allowing"" is the wrong word. ""Slip"" is the wrong word, too. I criticize the Nixon/Ford-Butz Administration for CAUSING farm income to DROP. Nixon was President when some of the causative decisions were made—those which disrupted grain and livestock producers\' plans and operations through price freezes in 1971 and 1973, mismanagement of massive grain sales to Russia in 1972, and the embargo on exports of soybeans and cottonseed in 1973. Ford was President when three more were imposed. Farm income dropped one fourth between 1973 and 1975.', 'Without being able to predict the future, nobody can give a pat formula for increasing farm income. One need is to bring inflation under control; another, put competent people in charge of trade policy.', 'Q. What do you propose for the Farm Act of 1977? You have said you favor target price levels high enough to give farmers ""at least the cost of production "" In calculating production costs, would you figure land at its acquisition cost, at its agricultural value or at its current market value?', 'Governor Carter. In the public interest, we must develop a farm program which will help keep the risks of full-scale agricultural protection within acceptable limits and afford family-type farms the opportunity to continue to compete in an economy dominated by giant conglomerates. We must develop a system of handling carryover stocks which will assure our own consumers adequate supplies of food and yet keep control of a good portion of those stocks in the hands of farmers so as to prevent dumping. Unlike President Ford, who has repeatedly vetoed the actions of the elected Congress although he was not elected to his office, I would cooperate with and rely upon the Congress.', 'I have stated that support prices, in my opinion, should be at least equal to the cost of production but should not guarantee a profit. By keeping this principle in mind, we can arrive at a common sense answer to the long debated question of how to calculate cost of production. Permanent farm land should be valued for estate taxes at its productive value and not for its value to land speculators.', 'Q. You propose creating a 60 day reserve of grain. Who would hold title to the reserve? How would you release it so as not to break prices for farmers?', 'Governor Carter. It is important that we establish a national grain reserve and distinguish between that reserve and a mere surplus. We need it as a ""shock absorber"" to meet dire emergency situations and to avoid any necessity or excuse for embargoes such as those imposed by the Nixon/Ford-Butz Administration. Indeed, the establishment of an appropriate national grain reserve would be the first step I would take to minimize any possible need for embargoes in the future. The reserve would be held largely in the hands of farmers. Price stability would be maintained by establishing definite rules for building up, maintaining, and releasing stocks and making the rules well known in advance and fair to both producers and consumers.', 'Q. You have said you would never embargo grain exports. What would you do if consumers demanded action to cool off food prices? Can you foresee a situation where you might put price controls on food?', 'Governor Carter. I am committed to a coherent, coordinated economic policy for the nation as a whole that will avoid the shocks and surprises, the on-again, off-again programs and rapid policy changes which have characterized the last 8 years. I am committed, moreover, to remove the wedge that the Nixon/ Ford-Butz Administration has driven between farmers and consumers. I foresee no need for price controls on food.', 'Q. The administration says we must reform disaster relief programs. What would you do, if anything, to correct or improve disaster relief?', 'Governor Carter. I understood that Secretary Butz recommended abolishing, not just reforming, disaster relief programs. Judging by reports that come to me from drought areas, the main trouble with the disaster relief program is that it is slowly and badly administered. It seems to me that farmers are so constantly threatened by natural disasters which could quickly put them out of business that the public should continue to offer some protection. We should make sure that programs do not overlap.', 'Q. Do you favor tightening or loosening requirements for food stamps? Do you favor stamps for strikers?', 'Governor Carter. I believe that eligibility requirements for food stamps need to be tightened, and I think Congress is moving in this direction, but I do not belittle the Food Stamp Program as does the administration. Of all our current welfare programs, only the Food Stamp Program gives universal coverage to all Americans in financial need. The Food Stamp Program, however, needs to be considered as part of a fundamental reform of our welfare system. The system should be streamlined and simplified with less paperwork, fewer regulations, improved coordination and reduced local disparities. Equally important, the program should be designed to encourage employment. It should never be more profitable to stay on welfare than to work.', 'Q. Do you favor continuing the use of the parity formula? At what level would you set dairy price supports, and how often would you adjust them?', 'Governor Carter. The parity formula still has some utility as a measure of the purchasing power of a bushel of grain, pound of cotton, hundredweight of milk and so on. (On the average, such purchasing power is now less than three-fourths as high as in 1967.) While we should continue to calculate parity, cost of production would be a better guide for determining price support levels, including those of milk. I endorse the concept of quarterly review of milk support prices. A Carter Administration would ensure that support prices were always at a level which would enable the United States, to support a vigorous domestic dairy industry.', 'Q. You say you are in favor of the Humphrey-Hawkins bill. How many jobs do you expect it would create? How much would it add to the federal deficit?', 'Governor Carter. Under the depressed economic conditions imposed by the policies of the Nixon/Ford Administration, too many of those who should be working and paying taxes are collecting unemployment compensation or other welfare payments in order to survive. This year alone the federal government will spend nearly $20 billion on unemployment compensation. In contrast, spending on job development is only $2 billion. The goal of a Carter Administration will be to reduce adult unemployment to 3 percent within 4 years. I support the commitment to full employment made by the Humphrey-Hawkins bill. But the bill can be improved. It is not flexible, does not give enough emphasis to private sector jobs nor to reducing inflation.', 'Q. What level of inflation do you consider tolerable in this country? How do you propose to keep inflation from going above that level?', 'Governor Carter. The inflation rate of the Nixon/Ford Administration has been intolerable. It has averaged more than 6 percent since 1970 and is projected by the administration to continue at an unprecedented rate of 6 to 7 percent until 1978. By contrast, the inflation rate of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations was tolerable. Inflation increased at an average annual rate of only 2 percent, and the purchasing power of the average family steadily increased. The Democratic Party has thus met the goals of full employment with stable prices in the past, and it can do it again.', ""Q. Oil companies say they can't afford to drill more wells at todays prices, and Congress refuses to decontrol oil and gas. How would you resolve this?"", 'Governor Carter. There is no need to deregulate the price of old oil. The price of all domestic oil should be kept below that of OPEC oil. However, our natural gas supply is rapidly approaching critically low levels. Under the present regulated price structure, producers who attempt to exploit these deeper wells are forced to take a loss on every cubic foot of gas they pump. We need to deregulate the price of gas for five years, with presently existing contracts remaining in force. At the end of that time, the programs should be evaluated and new actions taken.']"
83,Jimmy Carter ,"October 01, 1976","[""Q. If the nation's private health insurance industry has been unwilling to adopt effective cost containment mechanisms, unsuccessful in assuring significant consumer policy input, and slow to incorporate coverage for innovative elements of comprehensive care, what role, if any, would you encourage the industry to perform in any governmental national health insurance scheme?"", 'Governor Carter. I support the enactment of a phased-in, comprehensive national health insurance program. I think the public wants such a program and I intend to work vigorously to get it.', 'I have also repeatedly said that financing reform alone is not enough. We must bring about basic changes in the way health care is provided to our people. We must emphasize the value of personal preventive care. We must work to make our environment more health-promoting, and less healthdamaging.', 'While I have proposed reforms in several areas of our health care system, I have also repeatedly pointed out that there is much that is very good and of which we can be proud about that system. We must preserve that part and build for the future.', 'As we set out to improve the system, I urgently want the cooperation of health professionals and health workers. Similarly, I want the cooperation and assistance of the private health insurance industry. I have not finished my analysis of the precise role the industry should play. I think we must establish a framework for their participation in a reasonable manner.', 'What our goal must be is what is best for the people of this country. Our people have a right to expect high quality medical care that is readily available and affordable. If the private insurance companies can help achieve that goal, then I want their help.', ""Q. Both the geographic maldistribution of health personnel and varying stale licensure practice contribute to serious inequities within the nation's health care system. To what extent would you encourage national certification or institutional licensure as alternatives to the traditional model of state licensure in health occupations?"", 'Governor Carter. The problems of health personnel maldistribution are very serious, and I am not prepared to decide on a single approach to this problem. I am studying the problems and various proposed solutions, and with the advice and assistance of the health community and others I am attempting to find a sound approach that is related to our needs for health care financing reform and delivery system reform.', 'I believe we can develop incentives, rather than coercive measures, to attract manpower to underserved areas and to make reform possible in related areas.', 'Q. How would you modify the Food Stamp Program to assure its manageability and cost effectiveness?', 'Governor Carter. Like other categorical programs for the poor, the Food Stamp Program has become a morass of waste, fraud, and mismanagement GAO reports have found that college students with average incomes as high as $500 per month have been receiving stamps, and that waste and fraud may be costing the government $23 million per month or more. A study in California found that as much as half or more of food stamp expenditures go for administrative overhead.', 'Obviously, we need to reform and tighten the system to insure that food stamps are only available to those who truly need them. This reform, however, should not consist of broad, blind cutbacks eliminating many of the elderly and poor from the rolls. More importantly, we need to consider food stamps as part of our overall program for welfare reform. A single national program providing a basic level of benefits will be far more efficient and manageable than the current multiplicity of programs, each with separate standards, administrative machinery, and clientele.', 'Q. Increasingly, U.S. policies concerning international health have been linked to political goals. Are there political considerations which would lead you to advocate withholding available food, medical assistance, or disaster relief from the needy of certain countries?', 'Governor Carter. What is important is to redirect international aid to meet the human needs of the greatest number of people. This means an emphasis on food, jobs, education, and public health—including access to family planning.', 'We must insure that our aid gets to where it does the most good.', 'For years our policies have either ignored the developing countries or treated them as pawns in the big power chess game.', 'The emphasis in aid should be on those countries with a proven ability to help themselves, instead of those that continue to allow enormous discrepancies in living standards among their people.', 'Q. Should manufacturers be required to prove the nontoxicity of substances before releasing them into the environment and marketing them for public use?', 'Governor Carter. I have long supported, and if elected would vigorously enforce, legislation requiring that new chemicals be screened prior to their introduction on the market. Chemical manufacturers should be responsible for testing their products to ensure that they do not pose unreasonable risks to human health or to the environment We have too long permitted our workers and our environment to be used as the testing ground for potentially toxic chemicals, and the Toxic Substances Control Act approved by Congress on September 28 deserves the full support and commitment of the President.', 'By waiting until after release to determine toxicity, we increase the difficulty and the costs of correcting the problem—costs which are ultimately borne by both the industry and consumers.']"

Can you suggest some specific examples of what programs you would cut or efficiencies you would bring about to provide a cut of $4 to $8 billion in Defense spending?', 'Governor Carter.

In response to a question on July 21,1 said I would spend whatever was necessary for an adequate defense.', 'Q. Do you have any specific suggestions for cleaning up the shipbuilding mess in the Navy? Is Admiral Rickover part of the problem, or part of the solution?', 'Governor Carter. Specific examples where cost efficiencies can be made include cost overruns, personnel practices such as excessive rotation, duplication of weapons systems, training ratios, and the failure to standardize and modernize NATO weaponry.', ""Q. What needs to be done to make the Navy one Navy, instead of six or seven? (Or don't you subscribe to the thesis that the Navy is often fractured by the well-intentioned parochialism of the carrier Navy versus the submarine Navy versus the materiel Navy?)"", ""Governor Carter. We have not reassessed our naval strategy since 1950. I think we're still superior to Russia, although in the last 8 years our number of ships has decreased 50 percent, and theirs has doubled."", 'For too long we have been building expensive surface ships which were more appropriate to past wars of intervention than to modem strategic realities. We must shift toward more mobile, faster, smaller surface ships with greater firepower, and more attack submarines.', 'I support a nuclear-powered Navy in certain areas, particularly submarines such as the Poseidon and Trident. However, there is serious question whether we should continue to emphasize nuclear-powered surface ships in view of their cost, size, and vulnerability.', 'Q. Senator Mondale has criticized our foreign military sales program. Can you suggest specific policy changes which are needed? How much of the foreign sales market and foreign policy ""leverage"" which accompany such transactions {according to current administration rationale) do you foresee yielding to the French, British, Germans, and Soviets if such policy changes are put into effect?', 'Governor Carter. I hope that my normal, careful, methodical, scientific planning approach to longer-range policies would serve to remove those disharmonies.', ""My own method of conducting affairs of state has been to have as broad a range of opinions as possible presented to me, let me assimilate the information that I don't have through my own experience, and then make a judgment from my own position as I thought was best and act decisively."", 'We sold, pushed, or gave away billions of dollars of arms last year, mostly to developing nations. For example, we are now beginning to export advanced arms to Kenya and Zaire, thereby fueling the East-West arms race in Africa even while supplanting our own allies—Britain and France—in their relations with those African States.', ""We can certainly afford to reduce these sales, I think. In the last 10 years we've increased arms sales from about $1 billion dollars a year to about $12 billion per year. And my hope would be that we could get a multinational agreement to limit arms sales to reduce the threat of war."", 'We ought to assess all [sales] on an individual nation basis. In other words, if we think the sale of arms can better preserve peace in a portion of the world, and carry out our committed foreign policy, then let the arms sales be made on that basis alone, not just to try to secure sales of our products or to give us an advantageous balance of trade.', 'Q. Are you satisfied with the mechanisms now used by the President for ""crisis management""—as in the case of the Korean DMZ murders—or do you foresee a significant change in the national security decision making process in crisis situations?', 'Governor Carter. I am not familiar with the way the present administration attempts to deal with crises, but judging by the results I am sure improvements can be made.', 'Q. What is your position on recomputation of retired pay for pre-1958 retirees?', 'Governor Carter. I am aware of this problem and I have ordered a thorough study of it.', 'Q. Are you concerned about the perceived erosion of benefits for military personnel, both active and retired—and if so, how would you propose to keep service careers attractive?', 'Governor Carter. Military benefits must be at least commensurate with those of an alternative civilian career, to insure adequate compensation for the added hardships and round-the-clock availability imposed by military service. People are the essential elements of defense. We must keep morale as high as we can, to keep our defense strong.', 'Q. What is your perspective on high technology East-West trade? Specifically, how would you couple that trade with ""détente"" and mutual arms reductions—and do you believe the United States has used its sale of high technology and grain to extract enough leverage toward progress in ""détente"" and arms reductions?', 'Governor Carter. Naturally, I would oppose the sale of technology or information that would weaken our military position as compared to the Soviet Union. I believe the excessive sale of wheat to Russia in 1972 was harmful to our economy.', 'I would be a much tougher negotiator and make sure that whenever the Soviet Union gets an advantage, we get an equivalent advantage.', 'Leverage is not ""extracted,"" it is applied; it must first be gained.', 'I support the objectives of détente but I cannot go along with the way it has been handled by Presidents Nixon and Ford. The Secretary of State has tied its success too closely to his personal reputation.', ""We've been so eager for some sign of agreement that we've yielded without commensurate gain.

Governor, the publisher of La Luz Magazine, Dr. Valdes, who I'm also very proud to say is my father, sends his regards and has asked me to assure you of his continuing support. He couldn't be here because of lecture commitments. He wants to thank you for this unique opportunity to discuss with you the role, status and problems of the Hispanic Americans."", 'Q. Governor, Hispanic Americans constitute the largest minority west of the Mississippi and the second largest in the nation, accounting for about 8 percent of the population. But they are drastically underrepresented in middle and high level federal government positions, boards, commissions and regulatory agencies, with less than 1 percent Hispanics in these positions. Would you, for example, favor establishment of a skills or resource file that would include full data on highly qualified Hispanos that could be used by your administration? What would you as President, do about getting these Americans into the mainstream of American government?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I would [set up a resource file]; I've met with several groups around the country, who are from Spanish-speaking families and communities, and I promised them that if I am elected President, that I would have an aggressive recruitment program for positions of major importance at top levels, in administration and in the Executive Branch of government, also within the White House itself. I never forget the special problems of Spanish speaking Americans and would place them also in areas that are not directly within the Executive Branch. For instance, federal judgeships and diplomatic appointments. I think we have a tremendous reservoir of talent within the Hispano Americans who are waiting to be called upon to help in the government. But this has been a neglected element within our nation, and I am very eager to recognize them. Primarily, I'm interested in having them help me do a good job as President."", ""Q. We've been called the forgotten Americans. It wasn't until the Johnson Administration that our existence was really recognized. In an effort to help the Hispano, a Cabinet committee on the Spanish-speaking was created. This was gradually abandoned and President Nixon had only an Hispanic advisor and Ford now has only an Hispanic advisor. The Badillo House Resolution 997 would establish a much more effective and far-reaching process that would enable Hispanos to have effective input into policy making, and would provide them programming and monitoring responsibilities in affairs dealing with or affecting Hispanic Americans. This would be done by setting up Hispanic affairs offices in each of the major executive agencies. Would you support this resolution?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I can't promise that I would set up a commission in every one of the executive agencies. I think it would probably be too much to expect me to do this, there are so many agencies now. But I intend to go back to what President Johnson did and at least equal it in commitments of the federal government to the Spanish-speaking Americans. Also I want to be sure that we recognize the special problems of all foreign language speaking groups, and I want to improve the educational system and strengthen, throughout our country, the housing program, the welfare system, and expand job opportunities and have highly qualified Hispanic Americans help me in those agencies, directly. The other thing that comes to my mind is that the Hispano American communities have a great deal to offer to our country."", ""One of the themes that will be pursued throughout my own Fall campaign is how to strengthen American family ties, and this is something that is very strong within communities where Spanish is spoken, and that is the close knit nature of the family structure itself, and I'd like to know more about this aspect of the Hispano American family."", 'Q. I noticed that you spoke a little Spanish, do you speak the language?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I can speak some Spanish and so can my wife. I asked Rosalynn what was the major thing she wanted to do if I were elected President, and she said, well I'd like to take another course in Spanish so I can work among Spanish-speaking Americans and also make frequent trips to Latin America to re-cement our ties of friendship with our neighbors in the South."", 'Q. Governor, the U.S. Immigration Service now says there are between 6 to 8 million illegal aliens in this country. It is estimated that 2 or 3 million are Mexican aliens, nobody really knows. This whole problem of aliens and the Hispanos, especially the Mexican Americans, is a confused, complicated and serious problem. It involves human rights, the protection of American citizens, abuse of Mexican citizens, exploitation of Mexican aliens by American business, etcetera. There are now at least 3 bills in Congress designed to deal with the problem, none of which is satisfactory to the major Hispanic organizations. Would you favor establishing a special commission to study, and make recommendations to the Legislative and Executive Branches to deal effectively, humanely, and intelligently with this problem?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I would, I've already begun to study these problems and one of the things I've done is to turn to Spanish-speaking leaders for their advice, Governor Castro from Arizona, and Governor Apodaca from New Mexico, have a special viewpoint that has been very helpful to me. Past methods of dealing with this problem, going into communities and rooting out families that have been there a long time, but still don't have citizenship rights, and sending them back to Mexico or elsewhere, have not been the right ones. I think the best approach would be a combination of putting a responsibility on employers not to cheat their employees who happen not to have certification and also make them responsible for assuring, that their employees do either have working papers or are American citizens. We must also recognize the right of those persons, who meet certain prescribed standards, to live here, although they may have come here illegally at the outset."", ""Q. The Civil Rights Unit of the U.S. Justice Department has effectively intervened for the protection of blacks in the South, but it consistently refuses to intervene to protect the civil rights of Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. Would you, as President, press vigorously for this intervention where properly called for? '"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I would. I would try to assure that the civil rights laws are applied equitably to Spanish-speaking citizens and other foreign language speaking groups as it has been applied to the protection of black citizens' rights, yes, I would."", 'Q. The most serious problem for Hispanics is lack of jobs and full employment. Overall programs dealing with unemployment will help, but a restructured and revitalized Community Services Administration is needed, with, for example, less authority over programs and funds by local mayors who can and have ignored Hispano needs in some major cities because of the lack of local political sophistication of Hispanics. Would you favor a more effective Community Services Administration.', ""Governor Carter. We've seen in recent years Republican Administrations, who thought the best way to control inflation was to keep people out of work, and when we do have a high unemployment rate, which we have now, 7.8 percent, the unemployment rate among young people is about twice as high and among young people of minority groups (minority because of their race or they speak foreign languages) is more than five times as high, about 38 percent, so job opportunities to be provided in communities where minority groups live would be a top priority in my own administration. I believe that would create, not only a better life for those who are presently unemployed, but it would also reduce the constant burden for the taxpayers for the cost of welfare, unemployment compensation, etcetera. And I think this can best be done working through community structures, where the local habits and the local work opportunities are better known."", 'Q. There are approximately three American Hispanics that are presently U.S. Ambassadors. Would you entertain increasing the number of US. Hispanic Ambassadors with persons, for example, of the caliber and experience of Dr. Valdes, Publisher of La Luz Magazine?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I would, I intend to do this. One of the great advantages our country has is a wide range of national background. I think this is a great opportunity for our country to have qualified Spanish-speaking leaders serve in a diplomatic corps, not just sending them to countries in Latin America, but also sending them to other countries around the world to demonstrate the broad ranging characteristics of our national population.', 'Q. In an unprecedented move, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees have increased the appropriations for bilingual education, Title VII. In view of your public statements that you will try to reduce or hold the line of public expenditures, do you foresee the executive office advocating a reduction in the appropriations for this program?', ""Governor Carter. I don't know the exact figures that I would propose, but my inclination would be to strengthen the present bilingual education program. I'm familiar with how this has been needed, for instance, in the Miami area where I've had an interest for a time, and I would not cut back on the quality of the bilingual education program, under any circumstances."", 'Q. During the Johnson-Nixon Administration, there was a Cabinet Committee on the Opportunity for Spanish-speaking supported by funds from the executive budget. As you may be aware, the Hispanic community has the lowest education attainment rate, the highest unemployment, and the lowest economic development growth rate in proportion to the population of this country. In view of this, do you feel that an entity similar to the Cabinet committee, which played an advocacy role within the administrations agencies, should be renewed?', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I do.', 'Q. What would be your position with regard to relationships with Castro1s regime in Cuba?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I would be reluctant to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. I was hoping a few years ago that. Castro might show his eagerness to have peace restored in the world. I think Cuba's intervention in Angola, and Castro's inclination to interfere in the internal affairs of Puerto Rico, and the fact that he has never proposed any restoration of normal diplomatic relations are some of the obstacles that would need to be overcome before we reestablish relations with Cuba."", 'Q. At the present time, the Small Business Administration default rate has an unusually high ratio for loans that are guaranteed or granted. These loans are made to small businessmen and that category includes some Hispanic businesses. The default rate indicates that something is missing in the efficiency of this agency. Do you feel, on the basis of these facts, that you would contemplate an overhaul in its structure and goals?', ""Governor Carter. Well, there's no doubt about it. I got my start in business when I extended my own effort with a small business loan, and at that time, in 1961, we had a Democratic Administration that really cared about the small businessman. They provided, not only the loan itself, but consultation service, to make sure that I operated my business properly. They gave me advice and counsel at no extra cost to me. Nowadays, quite often the Small Business Administration just lends enough money for a new business person to go broke, and they don't have any continuing service for that business person who may not know the details of management, how to handle accounts receivable, how to deal with interest rates, etcetera. So I think there ought to be a long term commitment on the part of the Small Business Administration to service the loan and to give advice to the new business leader when that loan is originally approved."", 'Q. Recently, in the April 18th issue of the New York Times, a spokesman for the US. Department of Justice Community Relations Division, stated there are approximately 20 million Hispanics in this country and that they are the youngest and fastest growing segment of our population. In view of this, you may be aware that this population is mainly in the urban areas of this country, and that education and job training programs have been substantially curtailed. Naturally, this adversely affects the economics of our people. Now, more than ever, in our society employers require better skilled and educated employees. Do you contemplate that you would have a program during your administration to help our population overcome these obstacles, especially in light of your proposed reduction of government agencies?', ""Governor Carter. What I want to do first of all is to make sure that the present agencies work properly ... the Labor Department with manpower training, the housing program to give our people adequate homes, the educational program with emphasis on career education, bilingual education, the establishment of adequate health programs. These kind of commitments that I've mentioned, have already been made; they're just not functioning properly. And so I would move to improve the quality of life, particularly in those communities that are most heavily afflicted or damaged by the insensitivity of the Nixon-Ford Administration That would obviously include areas that you've just described, who have a high concentration of minority groups."", 'Q. When President Kennedy was alive, he had contemplated a White House Conference on the Spanish-speaking. Due to his death, this was not possible. ...Johnson was sidetracked by Vietnam. Would you be the first President in this country to recognize a need for a White House conference on the Spanish-speaking?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I would have a similar conference. I haven't worked out the details about the White House Conference, but I would certainly have one on minority affairs, and I would make sure that the minority groups that have been most neglected in the past have a concentration of effort, and I think that the Spanish-speaking group would be of major importance. Now whether I could have one just on Spanish-speaking and exclude other foreign language speaking groups who might also need help, I think that would be something that I would be hesitant about. But obviously, the largest foreign language group in the nation that has been neglected is Spanish-speaking, and I think that would warrant particular attention given to their needs. So as President, I would have such a conference, but I would try to make sure that the major effort is on the Spanish-speaking, but I would also include other foreign language groups who might also feel the problems in our country."", 'Laura C. Valdes Damron. Thank you, Governor Carter, for this interview, and it was very nice meeting you.', ""Governor Carter. You're welcome, I enjoyed it.""]"
86,Jimmy Carter ,"October 01, 1976","[""[On successive days, editors of The Reader's Digest interviewed the two Presidential candidates: Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter, in his home in Plains, Ga.; and then the Republican nominee, President Gerald Ford, in the Oval Office of the White House. Each man was asked the same questions, in the same sequence. The questions were selected to probe those areas, both domestic and international, which most directly concern U.S. voters. On the pages that follow, the responses of the two candidates may be readily compared. Through this comprehensive debate-in-print, each reader will be able to evaluate the positions of the two nominees on a wide variety of issues, a process that should help in making an informed choice in the voting booth on November 2.]\n"", 'Q. There is today in the American people a certain distrust of government. What would you do, concretely, to try to restore that trust?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would do everything I could to open up the government to the people. I would hold frequent cross-examination type press conferences. I would minimize the ""palace guard"" orientation of the White House staff. As we evolve major policy decisions, I would do everything I could to involve Congress and the public in a bipartisan way. I would also make all appointments on the basis of merit and not as a political payoff.\n', 'President Ford. I think there has been a tremendous improvement in trust since I became President. In October 1974, a Gallup poll showed that the public considered lack of trust in the government number two on their problem list. Early in 1976 another poll did not rate that problem even in the first 10. Trust in the White House has been restored, I think, because of the openness and candor of this administration, which I would intend to continue for the next 4 years.\n', 'Q. Polls tells us that by a wide margin inflation is the prime concern of the people of the United States. Who or what, in your view, is responsible for the inflation that has plagued us?\n', ""President Ford. Primarily, today's inflation has been the result of improvident fiscal policies of the federal government. We have been trying to correct that and are headed in the right direction. My administration has reduced the rate of growth in federal spending, and, as a result, there has been a sizable reduction in the rate of inflation in the last 15 to 18 months.\n"", 'But inflation is not a simple matter. The horrendous inflation that began in 1973 and ran through 1974 was also prompted by the oil embargo and the increase in oil prices. In addition, shortages of agricultural products throughout the world added to the inflationary pressures. Excessive creation of money, and wage increases beyond productivity gains, have also contributed to inflationary pressures in the past, and we are continuing to keep them under close watch.\n', 'But the basic problem lies in the fiscal difficulties of the federal government. We are on the road to correcting them. With the improvement in our economy, we are able to look forward to a balanced budget by fiscal year 1979.\n', 'Governor Carter. In 1973 and 1974, some extraordinary events beyond normal inflationary pressures occurred. One was a change in the gold standard that made people search for commodities in which to invest, which resulted in exceptional price increases in all these products. Another was an excessive sale of American wheat to the Russians. Of course, the oil embargo and price increase were major causes of inflation and also created unemployment by draining dollars from our domestic economy. I also think that there has been a very poor correlation between government income and expenditures under the Republicans—they spend more money than they take in year after year. I consider this a major factor in inflation.\n', 'Q. Is it really possible to reduce inflation and unemployment simultaneously?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I think so. The rough cost of welfare and unemployment compensation is about $20 billion. I think that we should encourage increased employment, primarily through the private sector, but with some government instigation—using part of that $20 billion in expanding housing starts and in transportation and energy research and development. This will result in lower unemployment and in both a relatively constant inflation rate—no higher than 4 percent yearly—and an annual increase in the gross national product of 4 to 6 percent.\n', ""President Ford. We have reduced the rate of inflation since I have been President from over 12 percent to under 6 percent. In May 1975, the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent. As of this July, it was 7.8 percent, and we expect it to drop under 7 percent by year's end. Today there are more than 88 million Americans at work, an all-time record.\n"", 'So, we have been able to reduce the rate of inflation—by better than 50 percent—and the unemployment rate, and at the same time create new jobs for an expanding work force. Seven percent unemployment is still too high, but we are proving that you can fight inflation and unemployment at the same time.\n', 'Q. Federal spending has been increasing at enormous rates in recent years, and will pass $400 billion this year. What chance of a balanced budget do you see?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've consulted with economists representing a broad range of opinion. We project a balanced budget by 1979. This is a reasonable, and very conservative projection, and I feel we can do that.\n"", ""I would never approve a new program, put forth either by Congress or by my own administration, unless there had been a long range analysis of its ultimate cost and unless we had adequate financial assurance for covering that cost. I'm committed to striving for a balanced budget in times of economic normality.\n"", 'Q. Mr. President, you said earlier that you hoped for a balanced budget by fiscal 1979. How will you curb federal spending to achieve that?\n', 'President Ford. Last January, I recommended to Congress a 50 percent cut in the growth of federal spending. For the previous 10 years, the average rate of growth had been about 11 percent. I proposed a cut to 5J4 percent. At that rate, we could have a balanced budget in fiscal 1979.\n', 'Unfortunately, Congress, instead of holding the line at $395 billion for spending in fiscal 1977, has added about $18 billion in anticipated spending. These additions could set back the prospects for a balanced budget. Yet I am optimistic because the American people now perceive the seriousness of the rate of growth of federal spending and have made known their wishes for a more responsible spending attitude to Congress. In addition, the Congressional Budget Act puts more limitations on the extravagance of Congress than in the past.\n', 'So, between the pressure that I as President have exerted and the support of the American people and the Budget Act, we can get a better handle on federal spending.\n', 'Q. Are you going to propose a national health insurance plan?\n', 'President Ford. I do not intend to, at this time. About 90 or 95 percent of our population is covered by either private plans or some version of federal assistance to citizens who need health coverage. The only health area, in my judgment, where there is an immediate need for additional federal help is in catastrophic illness. I have made a proposal to help people pay bills resulting from a catastrophic illness. This program would be integrated with Medicare and Medicaid.\n', ""Governor Carter. Health care is a subject where I'll be very careful. I intend to implement a comprehensive health care system for the country, but to do it sequentially over a period of, say, 3 to 4 years. We now spend, on health care, far more than any other nation in the world per capita—$550 for every American. My belief is that the net cost above that figure would be very minimal.\n"", ""Q. Welfare reform is in everybody's platform. What do you mean when you talk about it?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Like other governors, I have had the responsibility of administering the present welfare system. It is a conglomerate mess. There is absolutely no way to ensure that the money goes where it's needed most. About 12 million people chronically draw welfare payments, with about 2 million welfare workers at the local, state and federal levels administering the program—one worker for every six recipients. About 1.3 million of the 12 million welfare recipients can work full-time and should. Once they get job training and are offered a job, if they don't take it, I would not pay them any more benefits. It should never be financially advantageous to draw welfare instead of working. The other 10.7 million can't work full time and they ought to be treated with understanding and compassion—but with one basic payment varying only by regional cost of living differences to meet the necessities of life, instead of a multiplicity of payments as presently exists. We now have about 100 different federal welfare programs under the broad generic sense of the word welfare. I think maybe two or three would be adequate.\n"", 'I would favor joint federal and state financing, with the combined state and local level frozen and then gradually absorbed by the federal government. We ought to phase out very rapidly any local financing for the welfare system.\n', ""President Ford. I think we can consolidate the present hodgepodge of welfare programs and make them a better delivery system to those who need help—and at the same time eliminate those who are not deserving or don't require federal assistance. I have submitted to Congress legislation which would achieve that objective. I have also asked for an analysis of more comprehensive welfare reform alternatives.\n"", 'Welfare should not be exclusively a federal matter, I think a strong local role is important. For example, in many cases, where determinations are made as to how much a person needs—and need is a real criterion—the people at the local level are far better able to make that determination than some rulemaking federal employee in Washington, D.C.\n', 'Q. What kind of tax reform would you favor? What about eliminating all deductions and lowering rates?\n', 'President Ford. I favor giving greater tax relief to the so-called middle-income taxpayers—those in the earning brackets of $8,000 to $30,000 a year. To achieve that, there are certain specifics that I have recommended to Congress. For example, an increase in the personal exemptions from $750 a person to $1,000 is highly desirable. Moreover, to permit one generation to pass on the labor of a lifetime to the next generation, I have proposed increasing the exemption on the estate tax from $60,000 to $150,000 or more, and not taxing transfer of property, on death, between husbands and wives. I would allow a longer time for payment of estate taxes on family businesses.\n', ""I believe we need to simplify the system, but I don't think eliminating all deductions is the way to achieve reform. If we want to stimulate home building, the right to deduct mortgage interest payments is a proper use of tax legislation. Charitable contributions are also highly desirable as a tax deduction.\n"", ""Governor Carter. If elected, I intend to devote a full year of study to comprehensive tax reform. Therefore I can't describe the final result in detail. However, I can give you the basic principles I would incorporate in that reform.\n"", 'First, I think all income ought to be taxed basically the same. I see no reason to tax capital gains income, for instance, at half the rate of income earned from manual labor. The entire tax system—some 40,000 pages of regulations—ought to be greatly simplified. I would retain deductions for charitable gifts, but the number of deductions overall ought to be drastically reduced—and any reduction in present tax incentives ought to be combined with a reduction in the rate of taxation.\n', ""Finally, I think that there ought to be a truly progressive tax rate, that people with higher incomes ought to pay a higher portion of their income in taxes. The reformed system would benefit low and middle income taxpayers who presently pay too much. Under today's system, people who make $1 million a year before taxes on average actually pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes than people who make less than $10,000.\n"", 'Q. Polls show that an overwhelming majority of Americans, black and white, oppose forced busing to achieve racial balance. Realistically, can anything be done to end this problem?\n', ""Governor Carter. I'm strongly opposed to forced busing. The only kids that ever get bused are poor children. Rich parents either move or put their kids in private schools. My own preference is a plan whereby any child who wants to be bused can be bused at public expense—but that busing must not contribute to resegregation; you wouldn't be able to be bused away from a school just because it's integrated. Second, black leadership must be adequately represented in the administration of the school system all the way from the school board down to the classroom, so that black parents feel that it is their school system as well as white folks'. Third, no child should ever be bused against his or her wish.\n"", 'I think that if a President took a responsible position on busing and encouraged full integration of the schools guaranteed through federal allotment of funds, leading to compensatory educational opportunities for kids who live in ghetto areas, whether they are black or white, such an approach would greatly alleviate the need and demand for busing.\n', 'President Ford. Whatever the courts decide in school desegregation cases, this administration has upheld and will uphold. But some courts, I think, have gone beyond protecting constitutional rights and have, in effect, taken over and run a whole school system. I think that is wrong. In those school districts where there are violations of constitutional rights because of illegal segregation the problem ought to be corrected. But that does not justify the court taking over the whole system.\n', 'If Congress would pass the legislation I have recommended limiting the use of busing in school desegregation cases to acts of unlawful discrimination, we could minimize court-ordered forced busing on a major scale and still protect constitutional rights.\n', 'Q. What can a President do to reduce crime in the United States?\n', ""President Ford. First, I would like to point out that in 1975, compared to 1974, the crime rate went from a 17 percent increase to a 9 percent increase, so we have made some progress. But I am not satisfied. To reduce the rate of increase in crime further, we ought to have more severe penalties and more certain confinement for those convicted. We should penalize those who use guns in the commission of a crime. We should also take Saturday-night specials off the market. But I don't think we ought to take from the gunowner who uses his gun for legitimate purposes, his right to possess that gun.\n"", 'Governor Carter. The major contributing factor to the increase in the crime rate in recent years has been unemployment. This is not an excuse; it is a fact. Reduction of unemployment in poor areas, particularly among young people, would help a great deal. I would favor a volunteer effort similar to the domestic Peace Corps, with young leaders who are looking for jobs to be used as interns with police officers. I started such a program in Georgia.\n', ""Another very obvious thing is to have quicker and surer arrests, trials, and convictions. I personally favor briefer periods of punishment that are surer rather than long and indeterminant sentences. We have a gross double standard of justice now where quite often poor people feel that they are not being treated fairly, and sometimes they aren't. I think a complete revision in the federal court system to expedite trials will help a great deal. We have done this in Georgia's State courts, and we prescribe merit selection of judges without any political aspect, review commissions to remove unqualified judges, and have a unified court system to apportion cases so no one particular court is overburdened.\n"", ""I don't favor any restraint on people who own rifles and shotguns, but I do think that we ought to have some restraints on the cheap, commonly used Saturday-night specials and on importation of their component parts. I favor registration but not confiscation of handguns.\n"", 'Q. The presidential veto may become an issue in this campaign. What are your views about the veto?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've never hesitated to use the veto as governor, either to correct obvious mistakes or when the legislature and I had a violent disagreement. I guess that I vetoed about 50 or 60 bills a year. But with the Congress there would be a more organic interrelationship. I would much rather alleviate any problem with a proposed piece of legislation before it's sent to me, than use the veto as a frequent mechanism. But I would never hesitate to use it if I thought it was advisable. It's a legitimate part of the legislative process.\n"", ""President Ford. The veto is a President's constitutional right, given to him by the drafters of the Constitution because they wanted it as a check against irresponsible congressional action. The veto forces Congress to take another look at legislation that has been passed. I think this is a responsible tool for a President of the United States, and I have sought to use it responsibly.\n"", 'I have vetoed more than 50 bills, and the large majority have been sustained by Congress. The result is that we have saved more than $13 billion in unnecessary expenditures.\n', 'Q. Organized labor would like to strike down section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act, which allows states to pass right-to-work laws that say people cannot be forced to join a union to hold a job. What is your position on that?\n', 'President Ford. I am completely against the repeal of section 14(b). I am today, always have been and always will be. This is a matter which each state should be able to decide for itself.\n', ""Governor Carter. This is one subject on which I have no strong feelings. I told labor leaders when I was running for governor that if the legislature passed a repeal of Georgia's right-to-work law, I would sign the repeal. I've told the public since I've been a candidate for President that, although I would not take it on as a crusade and had no objection to the right-to-work law, if Congress repealed section 14(b) I would sign the repeal.\n"", 'Q. If the OPEC nations were to institute another oil embargo, as they did in 1973, what should the United States do?\n', 'Governor Carter. I have already, in public statements, let the OPEC nations know that if they should impose such an embargo on us again, we would consider it not a military but an economic declaration of war, and we would institute a total embargo against them. We would not ship them any food, weapons, parts of weapons, oil-drilling rigs, oil pipes, or anything else.\n', ""President Ford. We are prepared in many ways for another embargo, but I don't anticipate that there will be one. This administration has taken major steps to develop good relations between the United States and the various nations in the Middle East, including the moderate Arab States, as well as Israel. We have been successful, as a result of these good relations, in helping the negotiations that resulted in the Sinai II agreements, and in strengthening our economic cooperation. The prospects for continued progress in these areas are grounds for confidence that there won't be another oil embargo. But while we work for progress in the Middle East, we must also work to regain our independence from foreign sources of energy.\n"", 'Q. The Communist victory in Angola underlines a new threat to the West: the Kremlin9s use of third parties, such as Cubans, as proxies. How can the West deal with that problem?\n', 'Governor Carter. We waited until we got into an extreme state in Angola before we tried to exert our influence. We clung to the Portuguese until the last minute, and had no working relationship with the Angolan people. We let the Soviet Union and Cuba preempt us in the minds of the natives who were concerned. We have, I think, a real need to work harmoniously with the democratic forces in a country threatened because of internal disruption.\n', ""In addition, our positions have to be compatible with the basic inclinations of the American people, and include, hopefully, bipartisan support from Congress. When Secretary of State Henry Kissinger makes a unilateral statement, without consulting Congress, that we're going to thwart a Cuban takeover by sending arms into Angola, and then is unable to follow through, it makes us look foolish in the minds of other nations. The American people must know what our policy toward each nation is, and that policy must be based on mutual respect for the democratic forces within the nations involved. Americans are no longer content to allow foreign policy to be made in secret by a small, sometimes isolated group of experts.\n"", 'President Ford. Taking the southern African problem overall, I think that we have regained the trust of the moderate nations in that area and blunted to some extent the radical push. We have made it clear we will not stand for further Cuban or Soviet military intervention. We are working with Great Britain in trying to find a fair, negotiated solution in Rhodesia, and we hope to see a solution as well in Namibia.\n', 'As to the specific question of Angola, it was tragic that Congress precluded the U.S. Government from helping Angolans to resist intervention and to settle their own problems by compromise. The net result was that Cuba came in, and the Soviet Union supplied very substantial military hardware, and we allowed this to determine the outcome of a local conflict.\n', 'Q. What can we do about the continuing, and perhaps growing, threat of international terrorism?\n', 'President Ford. There is no easy solution. We have been working to try to get a U.N. plan to handle terrorism. Progress there has been less than I would like. We have worked with other powers to try and get cooperation; we are making headway in that area. But it would be better if it was on an international basis. This is what we are seeking.\n', 'Governor Carter. We have an official policy, which I approve, of not negotiating with terrorists. We have been successful in alleviating the problem of airplane hijackings to Cuba by indirect negotiations with Fidel Castro. I think similar efforts on our own, plus actions through multinational organizations, including the United Nations, would help. I would like to encourage all the nations of the world to join with us in not honoring the demands of terrorists and to guarantee quick punishment for those guilty of terrorist acts. I think economic sanctions can be exerted against nations, even ones as powerful as the Soviet Union, that train and support terrorists.\n', 'Q. Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger has said that no nation in history has ever engaged in a military buildup comparable to that of the Soviet Union today. What do the Soviets have in mind, and should we reduce any of our troops abroad?\n', ""President Ford. This administration has no plans for reduction of our troops or military capability. Some suggest cutting back our forces in South Korea and reducing our military bases. I can't see that now. Nor do we expect to cut back in Western Europe unless there is an agreement on mutual balanced reduction of forces between us and the Warsaw Pact nations. We should recognize that the Soviets have increased their military commitment They have modernized their weapons systems and expanded their navy. I cannot speculate on their motives for doing this. They see threats on a very lengthy border with China and its 800 million people in the East, and a problem with NATO's strong and growing defense. In some respects, they are building up from a position of inferiority; in some areas, they are building more than they need for their own defense.\n"", ""But whatever their motive in this buildup, we will take the necessary precautionary action. That is, of course, why I have submitted the two largest defense budgets in the history of the United States—the most recent, for fiscal 1977, was $115 billion. I don't see how this can be cut now. The United States has to maintain its capability and credibility in military affairs if we are going to maintain the peace.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I would not pull back troops in Western Europe except in an evolutionary way and only as I was sure that NATO defense was equal to or better than what it is now. Over a 4 to 5 year period our troops in South Korea should be withdrawn, while maintaining the nation's strength to withstand ground action and providing U.S. air cover. I would guess our overall military strength is equivalent to, or superior to, the Soviet Union's still—particularly when you add in our economic strength. The Soviets have made an extraordinary increase in naval strength in order to extend their influence throughout the world. But I don't think it necessarily means a commitment toward belligerency. It may be that they have decided that, in the absence of war, their emphasis should be on influence through peaceful means and the assertion of military strength. I am very concerned about it. I consider it the President's number one priority to gaurantee our nation's security—but I am not overly fearful of the Soviets, and I don't think that they are making their naval buildup with plans to start a war.\n"", 'Q. Why would voters be making a mistake if they vote for your opponent?\n', ""President Ford. Since Mr. Carter has embraced the Democratic Platform approved in New York, and since he has embraced the record of the 94th Congress, which is controlled by the Democratic Party, he obviously believes that the role of the federal government and spending by the federal government should be dominant in solving this country's domestic problems, I do not agree with that approach. I believe the federal government should reduce its impact and influence, and that more decision making and more responsibility should be made available to state and local units of government. That is a very fundamental difference between Mr. Carter and myself.\n"", ""Governor Carter. I think that President Ford has shown a remarkable absence of leadership capabilities. He seems to have little concept of administrative procedures or management techniques; he has done nothing about the wasteful and confused organizational structure of the federal government; he has let the relationship between the White House and Congress deteriorate grossly; he has perpetuated a secret evolution of the nation's foreign policies; he has not taken the leadership in proposing a single program as far as I know to alleviate our problems. As a result, the country is drifting.\n"", 'Q. Finally, what do you personally consider would be your strongest qualities as President?\n', 'Governor Carter. I believe my strongest quality would be my natural inclination to treat each person as an important individual and to derive my political support and basic attitudes directly from the people rather than through powerful intermediaries. I also think it is helpful to have a President who knows what it is to work for a living, who understands the frustration and fears and hopes and dreams of the average citizen. I believe I do.\n', ""President Ford. My strongest qualities are the experience that I have had in working with problems of this country—as a Congressman, as a leader of one of the two major parties in the House for 9 years, as Vice President for almost a year, and as President for more than 2 years. This background—a familiarity with domestic economic and social problems and intimate knowledge of international problems—is invaluable for the solving of future problems. In addition, I think my political convictions are in tune with the views of a majority of the American people. I have a proven record that the people know they can trust. My greater asset is the fact that I have done things, and haven't promised more than I can produce.""]"
87,Jimmy Carter ,"October 02, 1976","['First of all, let me say that I am greatly pleased to be here and indebted to you for letting me come. I am very proud of what you are doing, completely in sympathy with you, and wish you well. I hope you will be as tough and militant and aggressive and as eloquent as you can humanly be, because the country is waiting for a strong voice from you as a group.\n', 'The country is waiting for an adequate response from the political leaders who are listening to you, and I think not just in this country, but in other countries of the world. There is great, devastating discrimination against women throughout the globe, and, unless in our own country—where our lives are built around the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, equality of opportunity, and individual liberty—unless we take the leadership, that leadership will be absent.\n', ""I am grateful to come here, the only presidential candidate to address this conference. I was proud to have been the first presidential candidate to endorse the Women's Agenda in its entirety, and I will be proud, beginning in January, to be the President who will implement your agenda. With your help, we will do it.\n"", ""The unfulfilled elements of the Women's Agenda are a terrible indictment of the Ford and Nixon Administrations. Your demands and your legitimate aspirations have been blocked and circumvented by vetoes, indifference, and on occasions of intense pressure from you, empty rhetoric.\n"", ""We lack leadership in this country today. That's what this election is all about, and there are few areas where the absence of leadership is more dramatic than this administration's failure to work for equality for women. We need to restore the faith and trust to our people in our own government, but we cannot expect America's women to have faith in a government that ignores your legitimate wants and needs and your aspirations, and excludes you from the decision making processes of your country's government.\n"", 'That must be changed. If I become President, I am determined to tear down the walls that have kept you out of decision making and policy making participation in our government. You can depend on that.\n', 'I have long recognized the need for strong action to guarantee total equality of women in the areas of politics, education, employment, health care, housing, and justice. As one who comes from a family and a region where almost all the women work, at least in one job, I understand the special discrimination that has hurt women for sd long in this country.\n', 'I particularly recognize the special economic forces that face women who work outside the home. My mother began working as a teenager in the Post Office and later worked as a registered nurse. She worked as a nurse until past her seventieth birthday, both in this country and in India in the Peace Corps.\n', ""My own wife's father died when she was thirteen, and she began to work washing hair in a beauty parlor and helping her mother who was a seamstress. Rosalynn has always been a partner in our business and is a full partner in our farm operation. As you know, we are equal partners in my political life.1\n"", ""I've seen the burdens on wage-earning women first hand, in an economic setting which discriminates in economic opportunity and in a part of the country that has known racial discrimination and is trying to overcome it. We are particularly conversant with a special aspect of economic deprivation and sex discrimination that is still prevalent, not just in one region, but throughout our country. That must be changed in the future and without delay.\n"", 'The first Step in providing economic equality for women is to insure a stable national economy in which every person who wants to work can have a job, and in which the wages derived from that labor are not ravaged by quiet, undetected, insidious inflation. Furthermore, within that stable economy, it is necessary to eliminate all forms of sexual discrimination and to provide women, for the first time in history, with economic opportunities equal to those of men.\n', ""A spokesman for the Ford Administration made an amazing comment before a group of businessmen in Colorado in August of this year. In attempting to rationalize away the rising unemployment rates which have now reached 7.9 percent (with 500,000 more Americans, going on the unemployment rolls in the last three months alone), this man argued that unemployment was not really an issue because the rate for male heads of households was only 5.5 percent. The official rate was unimportant, he said, because it included so many women who really didn't need to be in the labor force at all.\n"", ""The President's advisor obviously had his facts wrong. The majority of women who work do so for exactly the same reason the majority of men work: because they need the money to survive and. hold their families together. I understand that thirteen million of the women who work today are single, widowed, divorced or separated, and eight million of them are the sole support of their families. Another seven million of them are women whose husbands earn less than $7,000 a year and an additional one and a half million have husbands who are either not in the labor force at all or who are presently unemployed.\n"", ""It is these working women who have been hardest hit by sexual discrimination and by the inflation and unemployment that the Nixon-Ford Administration has inflicted upon us all. I know who the last Americans are to be hired. I know who the first ones are to be discharged. I know who has the hardest time accommodating changes in income to meet rising inflationary pressures, and that's the women of our country.\n"", ""Let's look at the facts. Almost half of all families that are below the poverty line—and there are two and a half million more today than there were 12 months ago—are headed by women. And most of them are not satisfied with unemployment compensation or welfare. They are actively looking for jobs.\n"", 'Under the Republican Administration, the gap between wages paid to women who are working and wages paid to men who are working is increasing. Now women earn only 58 percent as much as men for full-time year round work.\n', 'We must understand that, bad as they are, these are not just dry statistics. These are men and women and children who are in need, who deserve national attention and leaders who will take action to help them. We do not have that leadership now and we have not had it for eight long years. The policy of our government has been one of neglect.\n', 'Economic recovery will not come overnight, but there are several steps that as President I will take immediately to assist women who work outside the home. First, I am committed to join in developing a comprehensive child care program which will help to fund state and local programs and provide subsidies or scaled fees for employed mothers from low and moderate income families. This will help restore the dignity of work to present welfare families and the right of gainful employment to all parents.\n', ""As you know', Richard Nixon vetoed comprehensive child care services and President Ford has equivocated on the issue. He vetoed one bill and signed another Very weak bill because it is an election year. These Republican Presidents failed to realize that adequate child care services are just as essential to the children of mothers who work as food, shelter, and clothing. I chose as my running mate Fritz Mondale. You know what his position has been. I'm proud of him. He's my friend, we are partners, and we will work together with you.\n"", 'The second thing I want to mention is this: there are federal agencies which now have responsibility for enforcing federal anti-discrimination regulations, but there is no coordination among them. Kennedy, Johnson and the federal courts put on their books many programs and commitments to eliminate discrimination. But the enforcement of these laws has been lax at best.\n', 'On occasion Nixon and Ford and their administrations have deliberately subverted or blocked implementation of those laws. I will work to assure that the existing guidelines are strengthened and vigorously enforced to insure that women are hired, paid and promoted on the basis of fairness and equality for a change.\n', 'Cases before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are hopelessly backlogged, literally for years, with thousands now awaiting settlement. With this delay justice is blocked because the original complainants, of the witnesses who might have testified, slowly dissipate in a rapidly changing, mobile society. I will see that the EEOC staff is adequate to carry out its mandate and I will also appoint additional women as EEOC Commissioners. Presently, only one out of five members is female. We are going to change that very quickly when I become President.\n', 'Fourth, I will direct the Office of the Federal Contract Compliance Programs in the Department of Labor to enforce the Executive order forbidding discrimination by federal contractors or subcontractors. This will help women as employees and as business owners to have a fair share of government contracting.\n', ""Fifth, women continue to be underrepresented in the federal government, especially in the supergrades, where you hold only three percent of the jobs. I will insist on hiring policies that will bring far more women into top grades and throughout the entire government. This administration has only paid lip service to women's rights and it has been argued—always by men—that qualified women'do not exist. They do exist, and I intend to find them and put them to work.\n"", 'I want to tell you how. We have a Committee of 51.3%. Many of you serve on that committee. We are now working with the members of the committee to find several hundred, perhaps thousands, of women all over the country, qualified women to serve in different positions in government, law, justice, health, education, welfare, housing, diplomatic posts, and administration of all programs.\n', 'I hope that you will participate with us in giving your recommendations, including recommending yourselves, or those who ought to be considered for appointment to major posts. There is no way that a President or Cabinet or White House staff can constantly be aware of the special problems of women unless women are part of the decision making process. I want to do this and make you a part of it.\n', ""The sixth point I want to make is this: flexible hours and part-time work are important to the parents of school age children who need additional income but just can't be gone from home eight or nine hours a day. They are also crucial to help retired people and some disabled people who are not physically able to work full time.\n"", 'Therefore, I will encourage—actively and aggressively—the adoption in the federal government and in the private business sector, of flexible working hours for men and women, and I will take action to increase the availability of part-time jobs, with proper provision for fringe benefits and for job security.\n', 'The seventh area is this: I will act to curb unfair economic practices such as discrimination against women in obtaining credit and insurance. Business women in particular have been held back by these unfair practices, and they must be halted.\n', ""I went home from the Navy with my wife and three little children in the winter of 1953.1 didn't have any money. We lived in a government housing project and paid $31 a month rent. The first year of our business was 1954. We didn't have enough total net income to pay our rent.\n"", 'A little later, I got a loan from the Small Business Administration and because my family was prominent in the community and because I was so eager, they gave me a loan which they guaranteed, I think 10 percent of what we needed. The local bank did the rest, but the $BA gave me advice and counsel constantly from retired businessmen and women who knew more about government and business than I did.\n', 'They would come in and lode at my accounts receivable and they would look at my inventory and they would look at my bookkeeping system and if I was making a mistake, they would say, Jimmy, you ought to do this to make your business successful.\n', ""It has become successful because of them. That's the kind of business assistance, with loan guarantees, financial advice and constant support that is now absent from the life of the woman entrepreneur that will be a part of the Small Business Administration when I become President. You can count on that.\n"", ""Eighth, I want to comment on a group that quite often is not mentioned, perhaps even among women's groups. I will act to support the American homemaker in every possible way. The American homemaker is the foundation of the structure of our society. More women still work in their homes than outside the home. But the rising divorce rate and early widowhood quite often leave them highly vulnerable to economic deprivation and adversity.\n"", 'I will take action to help homemakers achieve equity in Social Security and divorce proceedings, and in tax laws, and in the probate of estates, and to provide counseling to women who enter the job market for the first time without the experience they need. This is the very least we can do, a first small step, to ease a painful transition that too many women must make each year.\n', ""Ninth, I will work toward equality in education. Education itself leads to self sufficiency, as you know, and women must have equal access to it. Yet the statistics on financial aid tell us that 80 percent of the nation's most prestigious fellowships and awards go to men. Men dominate supervisory positions in our school systems and still far outnumber women in our graduate schools. Inequity in federal aid to women will be eliminated during my own administration.\n"", 'As you know, the Committee of 51.3% is advising me on issues of special concern to women, and at my request the committee has established several task forces to recommend action in specific areas of need.\n', ""In closing, let me say this. It's been a pleasure and an honor to be here. This is indeed a historic occasion because since women's suffrage was finally granted we have not had a nationwide, coordinated, and concerned commitment of different women's groups toward common purposes and goals.\n"", 'There have been few political developments in America in recent years that have impressed me more than the movement of women toward equal rights. In the face of opposition and misunderstandings you have gotten your message across to millions of women, and to millions of men as welL\n', ""I've often said that the Voting Rights Act was the best thing that ever happened to the South. It not only liberated the blacks, but it liberated the whites as well and permitted the South and our region to move into the. mainstream of economic, social and political life. In the same way I agree with you that the women's movement can do just as much for men as for women.\n"", 'I hope that all of us can work together inpassing the Equal Rights Amendment. As President and with Fritz Mondale as Vice President, the members of our family and you, must induce those last four states to finally ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to give women a chance in life.\n', ""I have to add, parenthetically, that it's still not going to be easy. Because we haven't yet penetrated the consciousness of America with the patent continuing discrimination against women. But American people are fair and once they are convinced that women who work in factories and stores and businesses only get 87 percent as much pay as do men; when they are convinced that women are the last ones hired and the first ones fired; when they are convinced that women's jobs are as important to them andtheir families as are the jobs of men; when we can convince the American people that discrimination against women now is just as severe and crippling to our national strength and consciousness as was religious or racial discrimination in the past; when we convince the American people of these facts, then the legislators will not be reluctant any more, and the John Birch Society will not prevail any more, and we will get ERA passed. I believe we are going to do it in the next four years without any problems.\n"", ""Change doesn't come easily and my own campaign for President has not always been easy. But it hasn't been an ordeal or sacrifice for me. I've learned how to translate the impact of statistics into their impact on human beings' lives. I never had the support of powerful special interest groups in the primaries. Nobody thought I had a chance to win, so powerful political figures quite often supported my opponents. My strength has been derived from within homes and factory shift lines, from beauty parlors and barber shops, from livestock sale bams and shopping centers. And that is where my strength still lies.\n"", ""I have confidence in our country. I believe the average American is fair and just, wants to be treated fairly. I believe the average American is patriotic and still loves our country. In spite of its past mistakes, I believe our country's people are still idealistic and filled with a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood, and compassion and of love. I believe, too, that this is a nation which is looking for a chance to redeem itself from past mistakes, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a common purpose.\n"", 'As I said at the end of my acceptance speech, as brothers and sisters we can move into the future with confidence. I want to be sure that your effort is successful: that your agenda is met.\n', ""I have, as you know, an eight year old daughter, Amy. I love her very much and I don't get to see her often. I hope when Amy becomes an adult that she can be just as sure of becoming a doctor as she can of becoming a nurse, that she can be just as sure of being a lawyer as a secretary, and she can be just as sure of being President as a President's daughter.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
88,Jimmy Carter ,"October 02, 1976","[""There was a great change in our country in 1969 when the Kennedy-Johnson Administration ended and the Nixon-Ford Administration began. The Congress did not change; the 200 or more million Americans did not change; but the President changed. And the attitude and the consciousness of our government changed, and our country. There was a forgetting of human rights and civil rights, basic human dignity, and a pride in one's own self-respect.\n"", 'We saw an abandonment of the commitment to better housing, better education, and fair tax structures, and an end to power of special interest group influence that had robbed poor people and working people of this, country so long.\n', ""I think part of it is the difference between the two parties ... the party of Harding, Hoover, Nixon and Ford on the one hand; and the party of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson and Carter on the other hand. Part of it is the party; part of it, too, is the attitude of the leaders. I believe it is time now for us to restore what we have lost. I'm part of the South, and as I have said many times, in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Tennessee, the best thing that ever happened, to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act. The granting of the black people of an equal opportunity. It not only liberated the blacks, but it also liberated the whites of our region. But now we still have the quiet, not so highly publicized discrimination, against the poor, against the average working American family who have lost their jobs, who are robbed by inflation, who have an insensitive government, who see their rights not protected any further.\n"", ""Even though the laws call for this protection—the administration of them—the administration of them has blocked the purpose of the law. I want to restore those things.'\n"", 'One of the great reasons formy success in the primaries was the confidence of the black voters of this country. I think they very carefully scrutinized—either directly or through other leaders—my performance as governor. My attitude for along number of years before I become President and my obligation to the black citizens of this country is unshakeable and permanent.\n', 'I do not claim to know all the answers, but I think if you look at the platforms of the two parties, and look at my own campaign commitments which are public and which will be carried out, there is a dramatic difference between the two of us.\n', 'I am eager this afternoon to answer your questions. I wanted to point out the personal commitment difference and the party commitment difference that has existed and some of the historical facts that we sometimes tend to forget. But I want to restore the same attitude and atmosphere of our government that existed when Kennedy and Johnson were in there fighting for the rights of the poor and the deprived and the minority groups of this country. I would like to go out of office at the end of my term with your appreciation and with the appreciation of those who have felt most vividly, and most personally, the adverse impact of both insensitivity and deliberate discrimination.\n', 'Q. Governor Carter, your statement—something about the restructing of the welfare system—the employable and those excused from work. This would involve a rather radical restructing of the welfare system. Have you considered any alternative reforms or increment approaches that would bring more immediate relief while the details of your programs are being worked out?\n', 'Governor Carter. I think I will be prepared prior to inauguration date to make a comprehensive proposal on welfare reform to Congress and to the people of our nation. I do not know if all of you are familiar with the distinction that has been questioned. We now have about 12 million people in our country who are chronically on welfare. About 1.3 million of those are fully able to work—physically and mentally—they are not old, they are not blind and do not have any afflictions. I would like to remove them from the welfare system altogether; put them under the category of employable people; give them the services of the Labor Department, Education Department, job training, literacy instruction if they cannot read or write, the services of private and public job placement agencies; find them a job, offer them a job in the private or public sector. If they are offered a job and do not take it, I would not pay them any more benefits. I would hope they would take the job and go ahead and join the ranks of those who are employed. The other 90 percent of the welfare recipients cannot work full-time. They ought to be treated with compassion and with respect, with love and attention. There ought to be a fair and uniform nationwide payment to meet the basic necessities of life varying in amount only enough to accommodate the cost of living changes from one community to another. We ought to have a work incentive aspect to the program. So if a mother, for instance, has two little children and her husband is dead, if she can leave those kids with grandmother 15 hours a week and get a part-time job, she ought to be encouraged to do it—not made to but encouraged to—and not lose her welfare payments; We ought to also remove the aspects of the law that now force or encourage a father to leave the home—or pretend to leave the home—in order for the family to have a higher income. Instead of having 100 different welfare programs that are very complicated and are subject for cheating, we ought to have one basic program—maybe two at the most. These changes ought to be made. But they will be implemented very rapidly and following that, I would begin to take over the responsibility of the local taxpayers to finance the welfare system which falls most heavily on sales taxes and property taxes ... then later on start shifting the state governments onto the federal government. That would come much later.\n', 'Q. Governor Carter, it has been said that you have not done very much campaigning in the black community and that your campaign strategists have not been dealing very effectively with black elected officials in major cities. It seems that it is particularly important in states with large electoral votes that this would be a vital part of your campaign. Would you care to comment on how this is going to be worked out in the next couple of weeks of your campaign?\n', ""Governor Carter. I really believe it has been worked out—I don't agree with your basic premise that we have ignored that tremendous political opportunity. I have met several times with the Black Caucus leaders, for instance, in some primaries I did have delegates who opposed the delegates that were chosen by congressional candidates but I did this without regard to race ... I just felt it was the right thing to do. In most cases, by the way, I won. The leaders for the Black Congressional Caucus are helping me throughout the country with voter registration mostly this coming week and also with get out to vote efforts. I believe we have successfully resolved those questions that did arrive from some degree of competition during the primary months. I have campaigned—I would guess equally—within the black communities and in the predominately white community. Certainly commensurate with the makeup of the electorate. I could not name the dozens—even hundreds of speeches and appearances I've made within the black communities themselves. I would guess though there would be some areas that might feel neglected where if I went into a city with a very hurried visit and I couldn't make enough different kinds of visits to accommodate all the needs, but I have done the best I could to present myself to all the people. I realize a political fact, that if I had no other motivation except selfishness, that it is a devastating blow to me politically to discourage black participation in the electoral process. The statistics show that I have a very heavy and good support among the black people. But where there have been difficulties, I have met with the people involved and have tried to resolve those difficulties. I think among the black elected officials of the nation I would have a very heavy—I would not say unanimous—but heavy political support and I hope that it is because I have earned it.\n"", 'Q. Governor, one of the major excuses involved with unemployment is jobs for the underemployed ... just a minute ago you said that you would reform welfare to provide some additional jobs. Just what kind of program would you suggest or propose to take care of the present unemployment rate, plus the additional jobs that you plan to provide for those that might come off welfare?\n', ""Governor Carter. In the first place, we have to remember that unemployment and inflation goes hand-in-hand. I think if you will remember back historically when Truman went out of office, the unemployment rate was under 3 percent and the inflation rate was below 1 percent. The budget was balanced. When the Kennedy and Johnson Administration was over and Richard Nixon came into office, he had a balanced budget; the unemployment rate was under 4 percent—I think the average inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent. Under this administration we have had extremely high unemployment—it is now 7.9 percent—at least twice that among minority groups—sometimes as much as five times that in young minority groups. At the same time, we have had unprecedented inflation. We haven't had this high inflation rate since the War Between the States. We have not had this high of a deficit in the history of our country. Those things go together. I would address this as a combination because they go hand-in-hand. One is to restore the integrity of some of the federal programs—like housing, we have about 20 percent unemployment rate in the construction industry. Nixon impounded the housing funds that had been set up under the Democratic Administration. Ford has never restored the strength of the housing program. I remember when FHA was a notable and successful federal entity. Last year, it lost $600 million. HUD, which is Housing and Urban Development Department, has had 500 indictments and 200 convictions and it has now become the world's greatest slum landlord. Here effective housing programs, unemployment in housing and construction industry go hand-in-hand. Another very important point is this. We need to orient the services of federal programs that are on the books as the Congress originally intended for the people who need them the most. When you have programs involving pollution control, health care, education, recreation, transportation, law enforcement, the Congress intended for those monies to go to people who needed them the most. But because of the Republican Administration and because of the good campaign or political organization of more influential people—because they have more influence and are more articulate—those monies that ought to be going to the ghetto areas of downtown cities or the devastated families in isolated rural communities—have been going into the more affluent parts of our country and also into the more affluent suburban areas who needed the help least. That is a responsibility of administration only.\n"", 'Another thing we need to do is to channel research and development money where the needs are greatest; where jobs can be of more a result. We also must do two other things: One of them is to have an emphasis on job opportunities. The presently constituted Humphrey-Hawkins bill spells out specific goals that I have adopted to get the adult unemployment rate down to 3 percent or less, to get the inflation rate down in the neighborhood of 4 percent, to have a 5 to 5J4 percent growth rate in our economy which would lead to adequate service for our people and also to restore the concept of a balanced budget that was there under Kennedy, Johnson, Truman and Roosevelt. This can be done. The last thing is this ... there ought to be special programs that target job opportunities. The word that has been used recently by Congress is ""countercyclical"" which means that the federal aid is greatest where the need is greatest. As a community works its way out of high unemployment circumstances, then the federal funds decrease and go to areas where unemployment is the highest. The Ford Administration has blocked this concept so far. I would also provide direct jobs. President Ford in the last two years has vetoed congressional bills that would have provided 2 million public type jobs, and has blocked any effort to give employment— particularly to the young people and minority groups. I would favor a CCC type program, not just in the rural areas but in the urban areas, for young people where the unemployment rate as you know sometimes exceeds 40 percent. This would help redress social problems that are not directly related, in the public\'s mind, to unemployment. I think the number one contributing factor to the increase in the crime rate is unemployment among young people.\n', ""I live among poor people and I'm not poor any more, but my people used to be fairly poor and I've seen the devastating impact of the breakup of a home on young people's lives. If a family is dependent on Social Security or welfare, or unemployment compensation to meet the family's financial needs. When a young person gets to be 18 years old, they are a complete drain on the family budget because welfare, unemployment compensation, Social Security, and so forth, don't go to pay the living expenses of an 18 year old. That young man or woman is forced out of the home—sometimes abruptly and sometimes in a nice way. It might be the [most] law abiding and deeply religious young person you ever saw, but you put that kid on the street for a week, two weeks, three weeks and they cannot get a job, they are naturally inclined to go toward some way to pay for food and housing. They might become shoplifters, break into houses or cars, start the numbers racket or pushing drugs or become a prostitute—so unemployment is not an excuse for crime—it is a cause of crime. I believe this would be a very good investment of our country to provide job opportunities for young people. They could be teachers aides, work on construction projects on public facilities, they could work in recreation programs, they could work in pollution control efforts, or different areas of public or private life. I would put the first emphasis on jobs in the private sector because they are more permanent. You get a lot more magnification of investment of federal funds ... like in the housing area where I've already mentioned. But those would outline very briefly some of the things I would do to control unemployment, none of which are being done now under this administration.\n"", 'Q. Governor Carter, when you began your campaign one sensed the beginning of a new political enthusiasm in the country. I think you symbolize to blacks not only an alter native to insensitive Republican conservatives but also to a certain brand of liberalism which has not been beneficial to us in the long run. Some of us share your concern as was reported in the New York Times today about the bogging down of your campaign. The article expressed some things that you are going to change in terms of style. But what do you plan to do in terms of substance to regain your critical imagination and confidence in blacks who are becoming more and more lethargic toward your campaign?\n', 'Governor Carter. I do not agree that the blacks are becoming more lethargic toward the campaign. It is not a matter of style. I have not read the article to which you refer but the style and substance are one and the same. It would be a very artificial thing and I think counterproductive if I had an artificiality about my campaign that was dependent on style and did not support it or combine it with substance. What I have been doing recently is to become much more aggressive in pointing out the sharp distinction between this administration and what our country ought to be and between my own commitments in human rights, employment, jobs, inflation, etcetera, compared to what the Ford commitment is. There was a time following the Republican Convention and maybe the first couple of questions of the debate when I deferred too much to Ford simply because he was in the White House. Now I look on him as a man who is running for President for the first time like I am—a hand picked successor to Richard Nixon, a personification of the Republican Party ideas, an equal nominee of his party compared to me. I think that the change that has taken place is my much more avid espousal of the principles of the Democratic Party and contrasting them vividly with what the Republican Party has done and not to be reticent any more in pointing out the great failures of the Nixon-Ford Administration. So that stylistically is a change because I am much more aggressive and much more specific than I have been and I think the substance of the chance is there commensurate with the style.\n', ""I might say one other thing—in the last week, the news media who have traveled with me have seen the response of crowds and even individual people alongside the road, etcetera, in Houston and Dallas and Orange County, San Diego and Los Angeles, Portland, Evansville, Indiana, Buffalo, New York, Portland, Maine, Hartford, Connecticut; in Pittsburgh, and Nashville, and wherever I've been the last few days—I think all of them would say the spirit of the campaign has picked up tremendously. The enthusiasm of people has picked up. This [is] probably enviable. We have about 5 more weeks to go in which we have to campaign; I believe there is a growing realization among the American people of the sharp distinction between me and Gerald Ford, what we stand for and what our parties are. I think there is a sharp realization now that is growing with intensity df the great failures within our country. I might add one other thing that you did not ask for ... that is in foreign affairs. Our nation has been deeply wounded just in the realization of what our government is. We have in the past stood for what was right, decent and fair in foreign relations. We have been committed in the past to the probing for human dignity and human rights, civil rights; we have foregone the opportunity to tie ourselves to dictators and to minority government rule. I think that for too long now we have had a Kissinger espousal of constant flexibility, secrecy, and an amoral foreign policy, only right now before the election has he. ever endorsed a longstanding proposal to Great Britain for majority rule in Africa. I think there is a build up in our country of interest in the campaign which is inevitable in the last few weeks prior to a Presidential election. I'm trying to do all I can to inspire the American people to have an intense interest in the campaign itself and I would certainly like for them to have an intensity of commitment to me but to realize the sharp distinctions that do exist.\n"", ""Q. Governor, as publishers and individual representatives of 114 black newspapers and magazines, we want to thank you for at least showing there is a need for the black press by coming here today; however, we are gravely concerned over the fact that there is no black representation in your first debate and it is my understanding that is going to be worked out in the ensuing debates... one who articulates the needs of black persons. We found that there was a gulf. Number one, the government is the tenth largest advertiser, actually in the nation. One of the voids, as far as black newspapers are concerned is the blatant racism as far as advertising is concerned in black newspapers. If you are elected President, what would you do in order to eradicate that? The government is supposed to be an equal opportunity employer but is doing unequal opportunity advertising. Number two, we as black publishers take an affront to the statement that was made by Secretary Butz. In the'event you were President, and if you had as a member of your Cabinet that espoused that kind of philosophy, what would you do to that individual?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I was asked that question this morning. I answered that I would not permit that kind of blatant racism to be expressed by anyone who serves in my administration. I think that Mr. Butz should have been fired a long time ago. I don't think he should have ever been Secretary of Agriculture. As you know, about 2 years ago he made a similar statement about Catholics and Italians in his comment about the Pope in an off-colored joke. The thing he was alleged to have said yesterday is even worse. I don't think there could be a more obvious racial slur than what Mr. Butz said yesterday. It was so bad, as you know, that the newspapers have been reluctant to publish it. This would never be permitted under my administration. I hope that we have arrived at the point in our country where the American people will be disgusted with that kind of racial slur. As far as advertising in black newspapers is concerned. I would guess—I have never analyzed the federal needs for advertising—I'm not on sound ground in making this statement But I would guess one of the major purposes of advertising is to explain our federal programs concerning housing, the guarantee of equal opportunity, job opportunities, and programs concerning health, welfare; and it seems to me that the best place to present these difficult federal regulations and policies would be through the advertising in newspapers and radio and television'stations where the viewers consist of those who need to be helped, and where the viewers quite often are those who have been deprived for a long time, who are the ones out of jobs, who are the ones who quite often are not very literate, and who have suffered in this decade the discrimination that existed more intensely in the past generations and decades. So I would guess there would be a natural shift under my administration toward advertising in those kinds of periodicals of all kinds for the readership comprised of those who need the federal program—explanations among themselves. So I think that would be my position, although I have to say that I have not analyzed exactly what kind of advertising is prescribed. That would be one opportunity that would come naturally to me and you can depend on that.\n"", 'Q. Governor Carter, referring to international affairs, do you feel it is necessary for us to continue our current situation with South Africa in order to be effective in bringing about majority rule in that area and would you foresee any circumstance in the government under your leadership to provide military assistance to guard the principles which they are fighting for?\n', 'Governor Carter. My commitment to the American people is that I will never again get militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security is directly threatened. I would doubt that would require military involvement in South Africa. There are a lot of things that we can do that we are not now doing. One is the use of public forums— the United Nations, the Organization of African States, the public commitments of the President himself, the Secretary of State—influence that can be exerted on the. minority governments through business interests that obviously have a great influence there. The arousal of public opinion in all its forms, the universal insistence on human rights and economic sanctions, if necessary to expedite the purposes that we have espoused, and the full support for United Nations decisions of which we in the past have been a part but which we have not enforced. So I would hope that we could achieve early majority rule in all the nations of Africa using those means that I have described to you without the use of military force. I think that it is best, to try to deal with that change without the loss of life and through peaceful means? I hope that I have answered your questions.']"

I believe that if there's a choice between work and welfare, the choice ought to be work. And I believe that we ought to meet the legitimate needs of our people in every possible way. We ought to have a minimum government secrecy, a maximum of respect for personal privacy, this has not been the case in our government in the past, and as I pointed out in the debate last night, I believe our foreign policy ought to be one to make us proud and not ashamed; it ought to be predictable; it ought to be honorable; it ought to be truthful; it ought to be compassionate; it ought to be strong.\n"", ""Let me just say one more thing in closing. I don't claim to know all the answers. I'm just an average American citizen like you. I've had a good education because I was lucky. My people have lived in Georgia 200 years, two hundred and 10 years now. No one in my family ever had a chance to finish high school before I did. But I had a chance to go to the Naval Academy at public expense, and to learn. Twenty-one months ago, I began to campaign for President. I didn't hold public office, I didn't have very much money—I had $43,000 to run a Presidential campaign. I didn't have a nationwide campaign organization. Not many people knew who I was. I doubt if one percent of the people in this auditorium had ever heard my name before last January, 1975.1 come from a small town, 683 population. But I and my wife and my children and a few volunteers began to go from one home to another. We would invite everybody from the neighborhood to come in. Maybe three or four people would show up. We'd go to a labor hall that would hold 200 or 300 folks, maybe 12 people would come. So we began to stand in factory shift lines, and go to farmers' markets, to livestock sale barns, to walk up and down the street, to go into barber shops and beauty parlors, and restaurants, to stand in front of revolving doors and shopping centers, to meet people, to talk a little, to learn a lot. I'm proud of this country. I believe in its future. I believe we have a strength that hasn't been permanently damaged. Our economic strength is the greatest on earth. Our system of government is still clean, decent, a basis on which we can predicate answers to complicated questions, and bind ourselves together, correct our mistakes, face the future with confidence, [and] stand on our own feet, not ever deviating from the principles in which we believe. So our country's strong. But the strength must come from you.\n"", ""I'm running for President; I believe I'll be elected. But it's just as much your country as it is mine.

And I hope you will join with me in the next 4 weeks, hopefully in the next 4 years, to tap the tremendous resources of our great nation and to try once again, as I said often in the primary years, to have a government that's as good and honest and as decent and truthful and fair [and] as compassionate and as filled with love as are the American people.

It's a pleasure to be here with Alan Cranston and John Tunney and Senator Bennett Johnston, and with Jim Coleman and with all the great leaders who represent us in the Congress. I'm going to speak very briefly. But I wanted to say just a few things that we ought to remember. We're in it together.\n"", ""Sometimes we Democrats are inclined to want to fight each other. And in the process we lose what we stand for. And we mark time for four more years, and we lose again. In the last 24 years, we've had Republicans in the White House 16. And the country's suffered from it. I, like Jim Coleman, didn't know what was going to happen in 1924, in 1928, in 1932.\n"", ""As I said in my acceptance speech, I've never met a Democratic President.\n"", ""But I've met a lot of people in this country who remember them.

We in this room, almost without exception, don't have to worry about unemployment in our own families. We don't know what it means to be out of a job. Having worked 15 or 20 years, and all of a sudden drawing unemployment compensation for 6 months or a little longer. And then going home and having to cash the first welfare check.\n"", ""But that happens to a lot of families. In the last three months, 500,000 more American families don't have anyone in them with a job.\n"", ""The personal aspect of it can only be felt in a campaign, when you leave the cocoon of privilege and pleasure and security and influence and meet those who don't have those advantages.\n"", ""There is another aspect of our country that has concerned me, and it's become vivid in my knowledge of the last two years. And that is that those of us who do make the decisions in government very seldom suffer when we make a mistake. We have good health care; millions of Americans don't. We have our children go to good schools; if we don't like the public schools, put them in the private schools. A lot of people can't do that. We very seldom suffer from an unfair tax structure. A lot of people feel they get cheated, and they do.\n"", 'These kind of things are a responsibility of all politicians.

There are three hundred thousand Soviet troops in Eastern Europe; there are two divisions in Poland. There are three or four divisions in Czechoslovakia. Eight years after the Soviet Union had promised to remove them. There are 15 divisions in Eastern Germany. They are now building an even stronger Berlin Wall.

Mr. Ford said he's in favor of an end to the disgraceful boycott, but his administration has moved to stop the revelation of this disgraceful pressure on American businesses who do business with Israel, who have American Jews on their board of directors, or as owners of the companies. These kinds of truths ought to come out in the election, and they change the consciousness of our country.\n"", ""Another point I'd like to make is this. We have a tremendous responsibility on us. Sure this is the 200th anniversary of our country; it's the aftermath of some horrible, disgraceful action in Washington; we need to tear down the wall that separates us from our own government. We also need to remember what our country is and what it stands for.

92,Jimmy Carter ,"October 07, 1976","[""First of all, I want to say that I've enjoyed this visit to California very much. The debate last night was delightful. As a matter of fact, I've enjoyed the last 21 months. I've had the chance to learn a lot about this country. And as I said at an airport rally a few minutes ago, after coming in from Salt Lake City, Utah, there's one thing that concerns me very deeply above all others, I believe. And that is that American people—men and women, North and South, rich and poor—have been deeply wounded in the last eight years. There have been hammer blows falling on us that have been disillusioning. And it's caused us to be alienated and excluded, and embarrassed, and sometimes ashamed of our own country.\n"", 'When I began to campaign for President 21 months ago, I didn\'t hold public office.

But I and my wife and my family members and a few volunteers began going from one home to another, one factory shift line to another, one labor hall to another, one meeting to another, with only 10 to 15 people, that\'s all that would come. So we went into die shopping centers, and the beauty parlors and barber shops, we talked some and listened more. And in the aftermath of Vietnam, and Cambodia, and Chile and Pakistan and Angola, and Watergate, and CIA and FBI and the Medicaid scandals and unemployment and inflation, there\'s a natural inclination on the part of our people to say, ""Nothing can be done.""\n', ""But I don't feel that way.

[applause] In the first year of my term, 1977, we've got to get ERA passed. That's all there is to it. I said today to about 16,000 people in the Salt Auditorium in Salt Lake City, and I've said many times in Alabama, and Mississippi, and Georgia, and Louisiana, that the best thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act. And that granting the black people a chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, or to go to school, and to participate on an equal basis in politics, this not only liberated blacks, it liberated whites. And when women achieve equality, it will not only liberate women, it will liberate men, too from a lifetime of prejudice [applause].\n"", ""We've got four states to go.

But we've got to exert a concerted effort in 1977 so that the time won't end on us with a lifetime of discrimination still there.\n"", ""The second question is concerning employment opportunity for women in public jobs. We've now got 21 agencies of the federal government that are supposed to be responsible for equal opportunity of employment of women. But there are years of backlogs, because although Presidents Kennedy and Johnson put those laws on the books, in the last eight years they've not been enforced. And as you know, when a complaint is filed under the Equal Employment Opportunity statutes, if the delay is 2, 2 1/2, 3 years, the original complainants lose their enthusiasm, the original witnesses are gone, the case bogs down, nothing is done. As I committed myself in a meeting to the Women's National Agenda group this past week, Bella Abzug was there, I intend to enforce those statutes, cut down on the delay, and I will give the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission adequate women on the commission, adequate staff to enforce the laws—and you can depend on that, too.

There already is an Executive Order, Number 11246, which I intend to enforce, which prohibits sex discrimination in employment, including training for the higher jobs. In addition, the Civil Service Commission presently provides training for upper and middle level employment. Several other government training programs are already set up in the law. The staffs are there. The law requires that women have equal treatment. I pledge to you that I will ensure, as President, you need not look any further than the White House; I will be sure that we have an active recruitment program. Long time discrimination against women in those top jobs will be eliminated.\n', ""Do you favor federal financial assistance to women-owned business? I went home from the Navy in 1953 in the winter.

I have memorized it. I know every word [laughter] and you probably won't even like it. I think abortion is wrong, I don't think the government should do anything to encourage abortion. I favor a nationwide, comprehensive program—sex education, family planning, access to contraceptives for those who believe in their use, better adoption procedures, to minimize the need for abortions. I believe that abortions are evidence of a.failure to prevent unwanted pregnancies. It's obvious. I am not in favor of a constitutional amendment on the abortion issues.

I've made a comprehensive statement on ensuring that America will have a nationwide, comprehensive health care program. It will have to be phased in sequentially. We cannot afford the total cost of that the first year. The establishment of new programs will come as they are most needed. In the first place, we need to straighten out the horrible bureaucratic mess that presently exists. We've got about 75 different agencies of the federal government that now are responsible for adequate health care. Medicaid is in one agency; Medicare is in a different agency; neither one of those have anything to do with health by the way. The assurance of quality is in a different agency. It doesn't have anything to do with health.\n"", ""We need to put all those programs together to make sure that what we do accomplish at the federal level is well coordinated. Another thing we need to do is to make sure that we have some means to hold down excessive costs. You've just seen, for instance, a measurement of increasing hospital costs, with the 19 percent addition to Medicare charges that was announced last week by the Ford Administration. A 19 percent increase in the cost of medical care in hospitals in one year. That needs to be addressed. We also need to make sure that we have prospective health cost assured by hospitals and doctors. Legislation exists in the Congress now; it hasn't yet passed, but I'll help to get it passed. Catastrophic coverage would come very quickly. Also coverage for prenatal and postnatal care for pregnant women and for small babies would come next. By the time we get through with the entire process, the coverage for health care will be comprehensive. And I would like to have your help in phasing in those programs. The basic question that you asked me was about cutting down costs, and about comprehensive health care, and how it would relate in a priority scale to the care for prospective mothers and young children.\n"", ""Another question that was asked, that I can't answer: what specific changes would you propose in the current Social Security laws to guarantee the participation of homemakers.

If you have specific suggestions, I would like to have them from you.\n"", ""Another question about the Democratic National Convention. Delegates to this year's national convention were comprised of about two-thirds men and one-third women. A drop in participation of women from our previous convention of 1972.

What would you do to ensure that in the next convention that women would have adequate representation.\n"", ""This was one of those times when I met again with Congresswoman Bella Abzug, and others, perhaps many of you, to work out this language. My commitment is to make sure that I work harmoniously with you, the Chairman of the Democratic Party, and as President and titular head of the Democratic Party, to ensure we go back to an adequate representation of women. The one thing that I did not want was a specific quota. The proposal was that all states would have to elect on separate ballots, men and women, with 50 percent being men, 50 percent being women. I did not agree with that. But short of that specific quota, I'll do everything I can to assure that we exceed the ratio of women that we had in 1972, as we go to the 1980 Convention.

In the last two years we've had 2 1/2 million additional Americans become unemployed. In the last three months, we've added 500,000 Americans to the unemployed lists. An announcement this morning about the wholesale price index showed that the inflation rate now is approximately 11 percent per year. We've had secrecy surrounding government; we've had a lack of accountability of government to our people; we've had an exclusion of those who suffer most from the decision making processes.\n"", 'I believe that our country can be strong. I believe that we can have a comprehensive national health cate system. I believe that we can have revisions of the tax laws so the income tax structure can be fair.\n', ""I believe that we can have a welfare system that's compassionate, that will keep families together, and that will encourage part-time or full-time work. I believe that we can have a change in work schedules to permit part-time employment and more flexible work schedules to accommodate parents who have children and who can't leave eight hours at a time every day.\n"", ""I believe that we can have a government that's open and not secret, and I believe that we can have a government that's well organized, efficient, economical, purposeful, and manageable. I believe that we can reduce drastically the unemployment rate, which hurts primarily those who are hired last, and fired first. You know who they are. And I believe that we can control the inflation rate which falls most heavily on those who live on fixed incomes, retirement checks, Social Security, and again, you know who they are. So the broad scale of government, if corrected and managed property, and if it becomes again sensitive to our needs, can help women, perhaps even more than the specific questions that you asked me about this afternoon.\n"", ""As I said before, I don't claim to know all the answers; I would like for you to be part of the electoral process, and part of the next administration.\n"", ""I haven't given up on this country.

It's difficult for someone like me to know the special problems of those who are women, who don't speak good English, who may be black, who don't have a good home, whose families may be divided, and who don't have a strong voice. On the White House staff I will have representatives to make sure that I never forget the special problems of those who speak Spanish, of those who are women, of those who are elderly. I want to be sure that whenever I make a decision, about housing, taxation, Social Security, pollution control, about welfare, education, health, transportation, that a major factor in my decision is how to deal with the special problems of those who suffer most One thing in serving in government is this.

Between 1960 and 1970 we increased the percentage of families able to own a home to more than 50 percent. In the last eight years,.we've seen the percentage of families able to own a home drop to less than one third. This needs to be restored. Mortgage guarantee, private and public mortgage guarantors.

Last year, we only built 1.2 million homes. It's been 35 years since we had that few built in the United States. Another very devastating thing is this. With a shortage of homes being constructed, with an inflation rate that doubles the price of everything every 6 to 10 years under the Republicans, property taxes skyrocket. It doesn't help a family who lives in a home permanently to have the value of the property double every 6 to 7 years, property taxes double every 6 to 7 years, and that robs the family of their substance.

I think the time's come for it. I made my kick-off speech for the whole campaign in Warm Springs. I went there deliberately. Fifty years ago this year, Roosevelt bought Warm Springs. He had been rich and strong and powerful. He was stricken by polio. He went down there to heal himself, physically and mentally, and he acquired in his physical state a sense of compassion for those who were handicapped because they didn't have jobs. He was the guy that first thought that a man and woman ought to be paid a fair wage for work. And he put forward a 25 cents an hour minimum wage law. He had a hard time getting it passed. Over 90 percent of all the Republicans in Congress voted against paying a man or woman adult 25 cents an hour for manual labor.

There were 95 Republicans in the House of Representative; 94 of them voted against Social Security.\n"", 'Later, Harry Truman came along, bethought we needed some kind of health care. And it was not until Johnson in 1965 that we got Medicare. Gerald Ford voted against Medicare. Ford has voted against a minimum wage seven different times. The Congress last year, 1975, passed a bill to help i handicapped people be trained and provided with job opportunities. Gerald Ford vetoed that bill.

The fact is that your congressman, your senators, your gubernatorial candidate, your candidate for lieutenant governor, attorney general and others are very important and tied together.\n"", ""I don't want to make another long, kind of a crowd-rallying speech, but I think it's good to set up a few things, very soberly.\n"", ""And you're going to be surprised by my speech.

It's the highest deficit we've ever had in the history of our country. And greater than all 8 years put together when Johnson and Kennedy were in office. Now, it's not an accident that it happened. When Harry Truman was President, he was in office 7 years, we had an average of a $2 billion surplus, not a deficit. But it was because our people were at work, our economy was strong, our people had confidence, and there was some ability in our nation for government, industry, labor, agriculture, the professions, education, science, to work together toward the future.\n"", ""Our country is so strong that if we don't have an obstacle in our way, in an incompetent administration, we naturally tend to correct our mistakes, and to heal our wounds, and to tap the tremendous economic strength of our country.\n"", 'So we do need competence. With incompetence comes a tendency toward secrecy.\n', ""Now, Gerald Ford has not had a full scale White House press conference since last February. Since he was the nominee of his party, he has not had an open press conference of any kind.

Or health care. Or perhaps in dealing with Eastern Europe, as they struggle to get freedom.\n"", ""But that, combined with a press conference with tough cross-examination from the knowledgeable White House Press Corps every few weeks, would ensure that the people always know what I do as President.

It ought to be instituted in government.\n', ""You can't deliver good health care, you can't have a fair tax structure, you can't have a competent and compassionate welfare program, you can't have a good relationship between the federal, state and local levels of government and private industry, with an incompetent government.\n"", ""But that's what we've had.\n"", ""I think Republican business leaden, who are very wealthy, quite often do tend to support someone like Gerald Ford, but if they look back in history, when they've prospered most is when the economy has been growing, when people are at work, when people are happy, when people are competent, and when the Democrats, by the way, were in the White House.\n"", ""Now, I'm a businessman myself, and I know what's happened to me, with red tape, paperwork, intrusion of government in my business, and a general feeling that I don't know what is going to happen next.

That kind of thing needs to be changed.\n"", ""And the other aspect of government—I'm not giving you a lecture; Fm just explaining something that's been on my mind a long time—the other thing about government is compassion. Now compassion, in my opinion, is not a characteristic of weakness. If somebody is weak and unsure of himself or herself, they don't have much time or inclination to treat others with concern. For somebody that's strong in spirit, strong physically, strong in influence, secure financially, that's the kind of person that quite often you can see has a genuine concern for others.\n"", ""And that's the way government ought to be. Quite often in our country, as you well know, local, state and federal levels, the people that make decisions in government are exactly the kind of citizens that don't suffer when there's a mistake.\n"", ""My family doesn't draw welfare checks. And whether there's a maladministration of a welfare program in Georgia, my family didn't suffer.

To meet with, to talk to, to try to understand those who were in prison. There are black people, white people, young people, old people. They are well educated people. Thirty-five percent of our prison inmates are retarded in Georgia. They're poor people. But there are not any rich people in the prisons in Georgia. It's a different standard in our justice system. It's just not right.\n"", ""And the pardon of Richard Nixon is just one example of how there is a different standard of treating crime. If somebody steals a 30-cent loaf of bread and gets caught, he's gone to prison. If somebody embezzles $50,000 from a bank, I guarantee you that they won't go to prison, unless it's extraordinary circumstances. That ought to be changed. And we have a responsibility, those of us who are influential, or successful in government, or Democrats, to be both competent and compassionate in dealing with other people.\n"", ""I've grown up among poor people. I would say 10 percent of us in the community where I grew up were white, 90 percent black. And we need a good welfare system.

But nowadays there's not any thrust to prevent disease.\n"", ""The last thing I want to say is this, to illustrate my last point.

We've found that black women in rural counties had 22 times more cervical cancer than white women in urban counties, simply because they never see a doctor until they know that they are desperately sick. We found also that it only costs three dollars to detect a potential stroke victim with simple cholesterol analysis and a blood pressure test. You can tell someone you might have a stroke, go to your local physician, your family doctor, and get some simple medication. But most people who are poor never have access to medical care until after they're sick. And as taxpayers you know how much it costs to take care of someone who is poor or indigent who has had a stroke. Thousands of dollars a year. Yet three dollars could prevent that kind of an affliction.\n"", ""So, what I want to bring to the White House, if I'm elected, and I think I have a good chance to be elected, is a competent government, and one that is concerned about people who need the services of government.\n"", ""We've got a good Democratic ticket in this state.

94,Jimmy Carter ,"October 09, 1976","['Q. Mr. Carter, Christians believe that a personal commitment to Jesus Christ has to be an integral part of their faith. In the light of that, can you tell us what Jesus Christ means to you, and to what extent you have dedicated your life to Him?\n', 'Governor Carter. The most important thing in my life is Jesus Christ. I was baptized and became a Christian when I was 11 yean old and have always been active in the church. I taught Sunday School when I was a midshipman at Annapolis at the age of 17 or 18 yean old, and conducted religious services on a submarine. When I retired from the Navy and went back home in 1953,1 taught Sunday School, became a deacon in the church, later became the Georgia Brotherhood Commissioner in our own association and have been an active witness.\n', ""I had my deepest and most personal turning to Christ about 10 years ago. 1966 or 1967, when I realized that in spite of the achievement within my church circle, as chairman of the board of deacons, superintendent of the Sunday School, and so forth, that there was an absence of a deep, constant personal relationship with Christ I went to some other states to witness among those who had no church affiliation. During the trips, I felt very personally present to the Holy Spirit and began to be able to testify for the first time with complete sincerity about what Christ meant to me. I found it easy to pray without a special extra effort; it became part erf my consciousness, and I felt a sense of peace and security that I had never felt before. I felt that Christ was a constant part of my daily life and recognized much more clearly my own failures, fallibilities, and sinfulness. I didn't feel embarrassed when I prayed about them. I was able to face them with a lot more relaxed and perhaps more courageous way without reticence. I felt that when I asked God for forgiveness that it was there. So, the personal relationship with my Savior really began to evolve in a forceful manner about 10 years ago, although I've been a Christian and baptized believer since I was 11 years old.\n"", ""The intimacy with which I have accepted Christ in my own heart and the realization of the presence of the Holy Spirit, of my own need and how my need can be filled by Christ, the fact that I'm not better than other people but just have received the special blessing of God because He loves me through Jesus Christ; those personal realizations came much more forcefully to me later on in my life\n"", 'Q. Many Presidents have testified that Bible reading and prayer have been essential to them in times of crises. Do you find this to be true in your experience?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I pray many times during the day: when I'm approaching a new encounter with people or when someone asks me for a special thought or consideration, or when I hear about someone who is afflicted or-who is troubled, or when I've made a mistake and I want to avoid that mistake again, or when I'm faced with a responsibility that might affect others' lives. I pray as a routine thing many times during the day.\n"", ""For a long time, I've had a habit of reading a chapter in the Bible every day. For a number of months I've read a chapter every night in Spanish just to review my Spanish language. I started at the beginning of this year with the first chapter of Matthew, and I've read it all the way through Revelations and back to the first chapter of Matthew again. I just finished last night the last chapter in the book of John, and I'll be starting in the first chapter of Acts tonight.\n"", 'What I often do is to read the next chapter in English and this chapter in Spanish. It helps me refresh my mind about Spanish. I learned my Spanish originally in the Navy. It was a slightly different vocabulary than the one I use in my evening Bible readings.\n', ""It's been a help to me and became a part of my life. It's a very good way in the hectic world of politics to close the evening with a quiet prayer and reading the Bible.\n"", ""I haven't missed a day this year. It's something to which I look forward during the day and my wife, by the way, does the same thing. I think she still reads the Bible in English. When we're together, we both read the Bible at the same time. This is something that is very important to me. It's a stabilizing effect on my life and it gives me a sense of having completed a day in a good way. When it occurs in a distant hotel room, or in a friend's house in California, or Maine, or sometimes in Hawaii, or last year in Japan, wherever I am, this experience is meaningful to close each day.\n"", 'Q. How does your Christian commitment affect political decisions you have made and will make in the future?\n', 'Governor Carter. As a Baptist I believe very strongly in the principle of separation of church and state. As you know, the origin of our church in this country was associated with the founding of the State of Rhode Island. I think among the first 13 colonies, 11 of them had state churches. Roger Williams and others thought the church and the state ought to be separated. I believe very deeply in that.\n', ""As far as my decisions as a political leader, they are affected very heavily by my Christian beliefs. I spent more time on my knees as governor of Georgia than I had spent all the rest of my life put together because I felt the responsibility of many other people's lives. I cling to the principles of the Judeo-Christian ethic. Honesty, integrity, compassion, love, hope, charity, humility are integral parts of any person's life, no matter what his position in life may be. But when someone is elected and trusted by others to help determine one's own life quality, it puts an additional responsibility on the pastor or the schoolteacher or someone who has a public life. So, the Christian or the religious commitment is one that's especially useful tome.\n"", ""I never had to tackle any conflict between my beliefs learned in church and reading the Bible compared to what I learned in the governor's office or in the laws of the state or country. This is, I think, compatible with the teachings of the Bible. Not too long ago, I taught a Sunday school lesson about how Paul and Peter reacted to the laws or government of that day. Their admonition was to obey the law and to obey the chosen rulers.\n"", ""If there was a violation of God's laws by the civil law, to obey God's law is to be willing to accept the punishment administered by the civil law and to try to work to make sure the civil law was compatible with God's law.\n"", 'Q. In the past, much has been discussed concerning prayer and Bible reading in public schools. In the event you become the President of the United States, what proposals or plans would you have concerning this particular area?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't favor the state, through the public schools, requiring a certain kind of prayer or worship. I believe that ought to be a decision made by the individual student. There ought not to be any prohibition against any self-initiated worship. But the requirement of conformity of worship is something that is contrary to my own beliefs.\n"", 'Q. You have already stated your opposition to abortion on demand. What action do you propose to take to reduce the number of such abortions, especially those performed at governmental expense?\n', ""Governor Carter. Abortion in my opinion is wrong. I don't think the government ought to do anything to encourage it. We need a comprehensive, nationwide program to minimize the need for abortions, with sex education, family planning, better adoptive procedures, and an enhancement of moral standards. Abortion is patent evidence of a failure to prevent an unwanted pregnancy. It ought not to be used as a crutch to correct improper, unwarranted sex experiences.\n"", ""I don't think the government ought to pay for abortions. This is a belief that I've had for a long time. Georgia happened to have had the law that was stricken down by the Supreme Court in a test case early in 1973 known as Doyle vs. Bolton, Bolton was Georgia's Attorney General. We had a very strict law against abortion in Georgia then. When that law was stricken down by the Supreme Court, we passed the most conservative law on abortion that the law would permit.\n"", ""I don't favor the passage of a constitutional amendment on the abortion issue. To give states a local option right in abortion would mean that some states would have extremely liberal abortion laws. This would slowly tear down the moral standard against violating God's law and man's law. It would just mean that rich women would fly from one state to another and have abortions in an unrestrained way and the poor working woman would not be treated the same. I'll do everything I can as President under the Supreme Court ruling, whatever it might be, to minimize the need for abortions.\n"", 'Q. You have already spoken of the subject of immorality in other interviews, What do you feel a Christian President can do to maintain high moral standards?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think the Biblical moral standards are compatible with the laws of our country. In most instances in a nation like ours, the original concepts of the law have been derived from our ancestors and they are compatible with the Ten Commandments and the interpretation of the Ten Commandments as expressed by Christ. This is something that a President can do, by a rigid insistence on adherence to the law and by one's own personal example. I think to the extent that a President or anyone else claims to be perfect and asks other people to emulate one's own holiness that's possibly counterproductive. I know that Christ teaches and the Bible teaches throughout that all of us are sinful, that we come short of the glory of God, that the wages of sin are death, that God loves us, that He sent His Son to be our Savior, if we believe in Christ we can have eternal life. Christ in many ways admonishes us against self-pride, against the condemnation of others, when we have within ourselves sinfulness as well. This is the kind of attitude that I would try to adopt as President.\n"", ""Along with the belief in Christ comes an obligation to abide by God's laws, recognizing that we can't be perfect, but we ought to strive for perfection. One of the things that Paul Tillich says is that religion is a search for the truth and the relationship between God and man and man and fellow man. When we lose the inclination to search for a closer relationship with God, or better relationship with our fellow human beings, we lose a major portion of our religious commitment. That constant searching to be better as a nation, as a human being, as a political leader is part of my hope for the future.\n"", 'Q. Many Christians are more interested in freedom to operate their religious and non-public schools without influence by and interference from governmental agencies than they are in subsidies. Are you concerned to safeguard this freedom?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes; I am. Again, many denominations, certainly the Baptists, have always felt that we didn't want the government interfering in our religious worship or teaching in religious schools. Where colleges, for instance, do accept government financial aid for the secular courses then there must be a fairly sharp distinction between religious instruction and the teaching of mathematics, or physics, or medicine. That is a judgment for each individual institution to make.\n"", ""When I was Governor of Georgia, I was active in initiating a scholarship program wherein we allotted to each student in the State of Georgia who went to college, $400 a year. That allocation of funds went to the college where the student attended, whether it was public or private. This helped greatly to strengthen the financial status of the church-affiliated colleges. I don't think there's any evidence at all that it ever was used as a mechanism to interfere in the autonomy or the independence of the colleges. This was a constitutional amendment that was cast in the State of Georgia.\n"", 'I would certainly insist on no interference in the teaching of religious subjects in religious colleges. The college itself ought to be the one to judge how much federal money to take. When funds are made available to students for scholarships and loans or to help the financial structure of the college through research grants that should be done with a minimum of interference in the college itself.\n', 'Q. If any alleged abuses by the FBI and the CIA are proven true what do you think should be done?\n', 'Governor Carter. We\'ve had a terrible experience in this country in recent years with two Attorneys General convicted of serious crimes, felonies, and with allegations made against the CIA that they had indeed violated the laws of our country and interfered with the human privacy of American citizens which is contrary to the law. Directors of the FBI had been guilty of various improprieties, in some instances even crime had also been alleged. This is I think the particular responsibility of the President. I remember the sign that Harry Truman had on his desk, ""The buck stops here."" I intend to put that sign back on the desk if I am elected President.\n', ""Somewhere in this country there ought to be a person responsible for the proper administration of government. Now you can't tell who's responsible for what. I would guarantee to the American people first of all that my appointees to those positions of major responsibility were instructed to abide by the law rigidly. I would remove political interference from the administration of justice, of the tax laws, of our intelligence agencies and others, to make sure that they could perform in a professional way. If any of the top officials did violate the law, they would be brought to justice just like the average American citizen. We've had too much of a double standard in the application of justice. This is contrary to the laws of God and man: to have a poor person who commits a crime convicted and go to jail, to have a rich person who commits an even more serious crime go scot free. I'll make sure that doesn't happen when I'm President.\n"", 'Q. Mr. Carter, do you think that world communism is a threat to freedom in this world today?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes. There's no doubt about it In the Soviet Union for instance, we have about 5 million Baptists. I think it's the laigest single denomination. I've heard of many instances where those citizens have been persecuted because of their religious beliefs. I know that the Jews who want to leave Russia have been restrained from doing so. Their families have been divided and not allowed to be reconciled or brought together again in Eastern Europe. Many countries like Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany have been deprived of religious freedom both in the Catholic church hierachy and in the worship lives of the private citizens who are not so well known.\n"", ""We've seen other countries, and our own for the last few years, affiliate itself with dictatorships contrary to the principles of democracy. We've seen foreign aid channeled to nations whose own system of government was completely contrary to our own. We're forgotten in many instances our own commitment to human rights, to freedom, equality of opportunity, liberty.\n"", 'Our nation, in relationship with other countries, ought to be adhering on the international scene to the same kind of commitments of morality and justice and freedom as we espouse in our own Constitution. To the extent that we depart from those commitments on an international basis it hurts us here at home and vice versa. Religious freedom is obviously one of the most important aspects that we should try to protect.\n', ""I don't mean to say that I would go to war to overthrow a government different from ours, but whenever we have a voice to be expressed in international discussions or councils, when the President makes a visit or when the President makes a public statement that ought to be an integral part of his responsibility.\n"", 'One specific example has occurred recently in the boycotts against American businesses who trade with Israel, or who happen to have American Jews as owners or directors of those companies. To me this blackmail of American businesses is contrary to the basic commitments of our own Bill of Rights. For the President to condone that kind of pressure on American citizens is one illustration of the kind of thing I would stop.\n', 'Q. Does the current state of crime and punishment in this nation call for any reform in the American judicial system? And if so, what would you recommend?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes; it does. In the first place appointments of Supreme Court justices, of district judges, district attorneys and others ought to be strictly on the basis of merit and not as a result of a cheap political payoff for past support in a Presidential election. The same thing, by the way, ought to apply to diplomatic officials representing us in countries overseas.\n', 'Secondly, we need to reform our judicial system to expedite trials. We need to have better administrative officers. We also must have a means by which the guilty can be given a quick hearing and a sure (and I would even say a briefer) sentence. I think the certainty of punishment is a much more effective deterrent to crime than is an uncertain threat of much longer incarceration. We need to improve the quality of rehabilitation efforts in our prisons. We need to use a lot of voluntary assistance among churchgoers, pastors, and others in caring for those who are on probation or parole; So that a person who has violated the law who might very well be poor or destitute, or from a broken family, can feel, \'Tve got at least one strong, staunch friend in my life that can help me over a difficult position, try to get me a job, work with me, visit my family, and let me feel that I\'m part of society and that I have a right to be here and a worthy place to spend my life.""\n', 'Another thing that would be very important is for all of us in our society to back our police officers. Those who suffer most from crimes are the poor. Most crimes are committed in poor neighborhoods. A lot of effort is made by police officers to penetrate the consciousness of people whom they try to protect But when a TV announcer or a mayor, or a governor, or a President makes any comment that might tear down the respect of those citizens who are being protected for the police officers who are endangering their lives to protect them, it really hurts our system of justice in this country.\n', ""We ought to have adequate educational opportunities, and emphasis on better housing and a more effective welfare system that encourages work instead of dependence on people who are able to work. We also need to have a realization that the extremely high unemployment rate (maybe 40 percent of our young black people for example) is a major contributor to crime. It's not an excuse for crime, but it's a cause for crime. There needs to be much more heavy responsibility placed on the citizens within a ghetto area to help police keep down crime. This can be a great help to us.\n"", ""The last thing I'll mention very briefly. Public officials, the President, die Vice President, Members of Congress, Attorneys General, federal judges, the head of the CIA, the head of the FBI and otherwise, ought to set a standard that is absolutely exemplary. We ought to be like Caesar's wife. We ought to be free of any criticism or allegation. We ought to be open about mistakes that we make, not try to hide from the public what is done. It's erroneous. In that way, mistakes can be more quickly corrected. But the distinctions in the system of justice have been embarrassing to us. We've seen very serious crimes forgiven or ignored. We've seen white collar crimes almost accepted as a normal part of our societal life.\n"", ""The President has condoned corporate bribery of officials overseas and has said you can go ahead and bribe. But when you do, you have to make a secret report to the Secretary of Commerce who then won't reveal the fact that you've committed bribery. This is the kind of thing that tears down respect for law. All these factors that I've just described would be helpful in giving us a much more sure sense that we have simple justice prevailing in our nation.\n"", 'Q. Some political observers feel that for the first time in over a decade religion has become an issue in a Presidential campaign. Some of your critics say you should have kept strictly on the political issues. Would you do the same thing all over again, speak the same way you have spoken?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think so. From the very beginning of my campaign, particularly in the southern states, an almost inevitable question when the audience had access to me was: What is your religious faith? I always answered the questions very frankly. There was only a moment's hesitation a couple of years ago, and I finally decided I'd just tell the truth.\n"", 'Later, there was an article written in New York magazine by Richard Reeves who pointed out that the country was looking for some spiritual commitment and that one of the reasons that I had been successful in my early primary campaigns was because some people looked on me as a realization of their spiritual hopes. I never claimed that myself, but Reeves wrote the article. It became a very interesting effort then on the part of every political writer to assess my political beliefs. After I started going back home with a large entourage of newspeople, I still taught my Sunday school lesson, I still went to church, and they began to see that it was such a very important part of my life that this perhaps increased their attention to it.\n', 'I\'ve been criticized for giving an interview to Playboy magazine. I think that it was the proper thing to do. I know that many other people have been interviewed by this magazine which has a readership different from the ones who read the church bulletins. Albert Schweitzer, Arnold Toynbee, Walter Cronkite, William Buckley, Governor Jerry Brown, and many other people have been interviewed by Playboy. I don\'t want to make excuses for myself, but I do feel that it might even be part of Christ\'s commission. He said, ""Go throughout the world and witness."" There are many people who read Playboy magazine who may not ever go to church and may not know what Christians believe. I think that I would be much more stringent in assessing the language that was used, but anyone who reads the whole interview wouldn\'t be offended by it.\n', 'I think it was an opportunity to witness. I have a free and open relationship with the press of all kinds as part of my political nature and attitude. The agreement with Playboy was that they were to submit the text to me for approval. It was quite an extensive interview. Toward the end of the interview (actually when the interview was over, and the reporter was standing at the front door) he said, ""How can you go into the White House as a Christian without condemning all those who have a different religious belief from you? Do you consider yourself to be perfect? How can you forgive or work with or understand those who are not perfect?"" I pointed out to him that I don\'t consider myself perfect. I described to him some of the teachings of Christ, particularly using the Sennon on the Mount and the admonitions that we ought not to consider ourselves above reproach. We are sinful. We have standards that even exceed the Old Testament interpretation of the Ten Commandments. That was the way that particular part of the interview originated.\n', 'Q. Mr. Carter, when your life is over, for what do you want to be remembered?\n', 'Governor Carter. I would like to have my frequent prayer answered that God let my life be meaningful in the enhancement of His Kingdom and that my life might be meaningful in the enhancement of the lives of my fellow human beings. That I might help translate the natural love that exists in this world and do simple justice through government. I believe that the almost accidental choice of politics as part of my life\'s career will have been a very gratifying part of realizing that prayer. I\'ve never asked God to let me win an election or to let me have success in politics. I\'ve just said ""Lord, let my actions be meaningful to you and let my life that you\'ve given me not be wasted. Let it be of benefit to your Kingdom and to my fellow human beings."" If I had that prayer answered, I think I would be very gratified.']"
95,Jimmy Carter ,"October 09, 1976","['[A few days after an exclusive interview with President Gerald Ford, TV GUIDE editors conducted a similar interview with the Democratic Presidential candidate, Jimmy Carter. It took place in the back seat of a moving sedan, on the way from downtown Washington, to Dulles airport, where a plane was waiting to fly Governor Carter to his next stop on the campaign trail, shortly before the first Presidential debate. During the 50 minute drive, two TV GUIDE interviewers, Roger J. Youman and Neil Hickey, questioned the candidate about various aspects of television. Here are the highlights.—Ed.]', 'TV Guide. Television is, obviously, a very powerful force, Tm wondering whether you think it has played a role in peoples distrust of government in institutions and the decline in voting.', 'Governor Carter. I think that the distrust that has been brought on government has been the responsibility of politicians who have not been trustworthy. One of the most dramatic contributions that I recall early in my television viewing life was in the McCarthy hearings, and I think this reestablished the confidence of the American people in their government. A second example was obviously the Watergate hearings a couple of years ago, which in a time of great national crisis had the effect of restoring the confidence of our people in our basic institutions.', 'Q. Governor, you were quoted as saying a few weeks ago that you would use the powers of the Presidency to reduce violence on television. You said:', '""I do think there\'s too much violence on TV. I think the President has a right or obligation to express to the public, displeasure or criticism of programming content. I believe that it would have a great influence to the extent that the President was both forceful and trusted to shape the opinion of viewers of TV programs."" Could you tell us how you would implement that intention.', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think you ought to be fair now and go on to completely quote that I don't favor censorship, that I think there is a sharp line to be drawn between censorship and the influencing of public opinion through the statements of political leaders. I believe that here is a legitimate role to be played by national leaders, certainly including the President, to express concern about elements in our society. And although I would new attempt through my appointments to the FCC, nor through my own actions, to censor the television, news or other information media, I would not hesitate as President to speak out as a leader of our country to deplore excessive violence in programming."", 'Q. Around the same time, you said that the FCC was, I think yon called it, a dumping ground for political has-beens. And also you were quoted as saying that you would appoint FCC commissioners who would in general be acceptable to Ralph Nader and consumer groups. Could you elaborate on that for us?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think the question was about appointments that had been made to all regulatory agencies in the last 5 years. Over 50 percent of the members that have been appointed to all regulatory agencies in our country have come from the industries that are being regulated. And my concept of the regulatory agencies is to be responsible primarily to the consumers who are served by the industries being regulated. There's too much of a sweetheart arrangement now between the industries being regulated and the regulatory agencies themselves. And in the particular case of the FCC, you have a major responsibility to protect the constitutional right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression of dissenting viewpoints. I think a longer licensing period for radio and television stations would also be beneficial. ,"", 'Q. Governor, the government also plays an important role in public television. The present system fpr financing public television depends largely on government financing or going to large corporations or begging viewers for contributions. The Carnegie Foundation some years ago suggested a tax on the initial sale of television sets. Would you favor such a tax, or an income-tax checkoff system, or some other solution?', ""Governor Carter. No, I never have favored, as a local official or state legislator or governor, the designation of specific tax funds for a particular purpose. There are a few exceptions, like game and fish licenses, and wildgame preserves, but I would not want to have a special tax placed on television sets for that purpose. I believe that our country is strong enough and that the President and the Congress, if they are working together, are able enough to allot adequate funds to support public television to a substantial degree from tax revenues. And, obviously, state governments also help to finance public television, and, as you say, private corporations and public contributions. But I would do what I could to strengthen the autonomy of public television. I think this is one of the fine opportunities in our country that hasn't been adequately realized. I watch public television a great deal and have always been very impressed with the educational contributions, at the classroom level and also for the general public."", 'Q. Since you do watch some television, would you comment on the quality of television in general, particularly commercial television?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I have to be frank and tell you that the last 2 years it has been a rare occasion when I watched television. I campaign 16 hours a day almost every day of the week. I now have the capability of recording news commentaries about issues that are important to our people and then, in times of leisure, I can play those back and review the week's happenings. But I'm not qualified to judge the quality of programs and I would not put myself in the posture of a television program monitor as President."", 'Q. Sir, you say that you tape the news broadcasts and you can see them at your leisure. Is that done in Atlanta?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, that's done by my staff and then they put them on a cassette and I watch them on weekends."", 'Q. That being the case, do you have any general opinion about how television has treated you during this campaign? Has the coverage been fair enough and complete enough?', ""Governor Carter. It's been fair enough. It's obviously not possible to cover a full day's events when I make a hundred different statements about housing or agriculture, transportation, tax reform, government bureaucratic confusion, in a minute and 26 seconds on the evening news. But throughout the last 21 months since I've been campaigning, I've been treated fairly. And I think the coverage of the campaign in its totality has been adequate."", 'Q. Governor, with regard to the debates, could you tell us what the political considerations were behind your agreeing to debate?', 'Governor Carter. My style of campaigning, ever since the beginning, has been a maximum amount of contact with the American people. To let them know about me, cross-examine me, and study who I am, and what I stand for, my position on issues. And I see the debates as a wonderful opportunity to reach several tens of millions of American people in a 90 minute period on three different occasions. And I think it would alleviate the handicap that I do have now, in that President Ford is obviously better known than I am. And the false images that are deliberately created by political opponents I think are corrected very quickly when the home viewer can see a penetrating cross-examination of the person who might be President of his country. And I believe that in the balance, that if neither of us makes a serious mistake, that I will benefit because of that.', 'Q. Governor, there have been accusations from the left and from the right about news bias. Do you feel that television has presented the news in a biased manner in the past? Do you believe that it is doing so today?', 'Governor Carter. Well, my own personal experience—having been involved in some of the major news events of recent years—has been that the coverage has been accurate. Obviously, there are instances where an individual news analyst or reporter would distort the news because of a different perspective from one who was involved in it. But I think that over a period of time that infrequent aberration is corrected. I think the American people were given the facts, undistorted facts, about the Vietnamese War, for instance, much more clearly than they were getting from political leaders at that time. I think the American people got the facts about the Watergate scandals from the news media. I think the American people have derived a factual analysis of the primary campaign in which I have been involved this year and the same, so far, in the general election campaign.', 'Q. Governor, have you given any thought to how you might use television in the White House if you9re elected? Are you considering ""fireside chats""? And how frequently would you want to hold news conference?', 'Governor Carter. I intend to hold news conferences every 2 weeks, with a minimum of 20 full-scale news conferences per year. I intend to restore die format of the fireside chat, using television or radio or both, depending on the importance of the subject. I would like to have them fairly frequently, maybe once a month on a subject of major interest to the American people. It may be that a combination of public television and radio would be appropriate in some instances. In other cases, of course, full media coverage would be appropriate.', 'I also would like to make the members of the Cabinet available, through joint sessions of the Congress, to be cross-examined in public, hopefully with live coverage, so that issues of importance discussed by the Secretary of State or Defense or Agriculture or Commerce or Treasury could be presented to the American people in an unimpeded way.', 'Q. Governor, would you also support live television coverage of congressional debates in the Senate and the House?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I would like to see that done. When I was Governor of Georgia we had a procedure where every day's legislative sessions were recorded on television tape, including the key committee meeting hearings, and then professional, non-political editors abbreviated those down to one hour or one hour and a half. And they are presented every evening throughout the educational television system of Georgia. That greatly improved the quality of work in the legislature. It cut down on irresponsible and idle speechmaking. The legislators were on their best behavior. The committee sessions were much better attended. And the people of the state knew much more accurately what was going on in the legislature."", ""I think coverage of the Congress would probably not be feasible live, except on special occasions. But a recording of the deliberations, and a rebroadcast at a regular time, would probably be the best approach. But that's a decision for the Congress to make."", 'Q. A related question, Governor. After the conventions this year,\' some people were saying that it\'s time to stop gavel-to-gavel coverage of the political conventions. Do you think gavel-to-gavel coverage is useful and should be continued?""', ""Governor Carter. I think so. I know that the three major networks disagree on that type of coverage and I'm not familiar with the viewer ratings, hour by hour."", 'Q. They were very low, compared with entertainment programing.', ""Governor Carter. Sometimes, though, even a low rating ought to be accommodated because of the ultimate impact on the American people's understanding of the political process. And I don't think that the ratings ought to be the only criterion used to measure whether a programing decision should be continued. I hope that, at least, one or two of the networks might give full coverage in the future. It might be that in a 3 day convention ABC could give gavel-to-gavel coverage one day, NBC the next and CBS the next. And let them either draw lots or rotate it from 1 year to another. But I would hope that on one network, at least, viewers throughout the country might be able to watch gavel-to-gavel convention deliberations if they choose."", ""Q. Governor, television news people think that the Fairness Doctrine prevents them frequently from covering matters of public importance because they will have to give comparable time to all other voices of dissent. Do you think that television deserves the same kind of First Amendment rights as print journalists? And is the Fairness Doctrine, as it's currently constituted, adequate to the needs?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there's a difference, as you well know, between television and the print media. There are no exclusive rights for a newspaper to provide news in a certain area. There's a much greater degree of exclusivity among television stations that have a license to a certain channel to broadcast their news. I think that I would like to see some alleviation of the constraints on television, but don't think that you could have it unlimited. Unless the television medium was willing to give up the degree of exclusive rights which it presently enjoys."", 'Q. Could you tell us something about how you prepare for your own appearances on television?', ""Governor Carter. I haven't had much time to prepare when I have been on the major interview shows—Issues and Answers, Meet the Press and Fact the Nation, for instance. I don't go into seclusion and have my staff cross-examine me on issues. I study all the time. 1 stay in constant contact with the public with press conferences and a question and answer format which is just a part of my life. I read a great deal and I try to get a few hours' rest before a television appearance, so that I might be fresh in mind, and looks as well. I'm going to take a couple of days off before we have the debate between myself and Mr. Ford each time. I'll spend those two days reading and studying and resting, and I think that's an adequate preparation."", 'Q. The President told us the other day that he did in fact videotape his acceptance speech ahead of time and played it back to improve his performance. But you did not use videotape machines in that way?', 'Governor Carter. For my acceptance speech I used a Teleprompter and read my speech once, because I was not familiar with the Teleprompter system. But as for putting my speech on TV and playing it back to myself and so forth, no, I do not do that.', 'Q. Governor, as the parent of a small child, you have, I assume, been able to observe the workings of the Family Viewing Time rule. How well do you think it is working?', ""Governor Carter. Amy spent the last three weeks looking forward with great anticipation to the change in the cartoon shows that took place last Saturday morning. And all of her classmates and friends were all so very excited about the previews of those. She reads more than she watches television. But she's a typical 8 year old child. She loves television. She learns a great deal from it. She watches Electric Company and Sesame Street and knows all the characters. And I think that's a major part of her education. She knows more now about the outside world and about biology and nature and science and space exploration—even politics—than I did when I was a high school student. And I give a great deal of the credit to television."", 'I also see that in families that are poor, where the parents might be even illiterate, that television—even the strictly entertainment type programs— is a tremendous learning process for a child. And I am very grateful that Amy and other children of her age have this chance.']"
96,Jimmy Carter ,"October 10, 1976","[""First of all, I want to say how proud I am to be at Notre Dame, and particularly for what this university has always been, what its meant to the consciousness of our country, its constant probing for a better means to tap the innate goodness of America, and especially as it's been personified in the last 25 years by the great leadership of Father Ted Hesburgh. He's a man who has been an inspiration to many of us. Those of us who lived in the South during the civil rights struggle days—the early part of the civil rights struggle days, it's still going on—have a great admiration for him. I know about his concern for the less fortunate, the weaker, those who are the underdogs, and I hope that you'll carry this same concern into the Notre Dame-Georgia Tech football game which is going to take place next week.\n"", ""Our country has come a long way in the last 200 years. We're still a young country. And a lot of us look back on the history of our nation with a great deal of appreciation for the wisdom and the deep commitment of our founding fathers. We tend to think that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams were all perfect; that the concept we had of our country then was one that was without blemish, a deep commitment and perhaps for the first time a real concern about human rights, liberty, freedom on the one hand, and equality of opportunity on the other. Down through the ages those two have quite often been incompatible. When you had complete liberty, the strong overpowered the weak. When you had complete equality, the government had to take away the freedom that accrues to a competitive society.\n"", ""We laid the groundwork for that, but our country was not perfect It was founded on the concept of slavery for black people. And it was one hundred years before we cast off that millstone around our neck. Women didn't have a right to vote; young people didn't have a right to vote. The people didn't have a chance to choose their own United States Senators directly, and down through the years we've tried to change to make this a better society for ourselves. We've had times erf success, times of failure, times of legitimate pride, and times of legitimate embarrassment and shame. In the last few years, we've suffered as a country. And I think all of us realize that the question of supporting human rights throughout the world is a very difficult one. It requires a balancing of tough realism on the one hand, and idealism on the other. Of our understanding of the world as it is, and the world as it ought to be. The question I think is whether in recent years we haven't been too pragmatic, too cynical. And as a consequence have ignored those moral values that have always distinguished the United States of America from other countries.\n"", ""Over the years, our greatest source of strength has come from our basic priceless values which are embodied in our Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, our Bill of Rights, involving our belief in freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, movement, and an unchanging commitment to basic human dignity. Although we've recently not lived up to ideals, I know of no great nation in history that has more often conducted itself in a moral, unselfish generous manner abroad, and provided more freedom and opportunity to its own citizens at home. Still, in recent years, we've had reason to be troubled. We've stumbled into the quagmires of Vietnam, and Cambodia, and Chile, and Cyprus, and we've responded inadequately to human suffering that we've recognized in places like Bangladesh, Burundi, and the Sahel area of Northern Africa. In other undeveloped and struggling and sometimes starving nations we've allowed virtually unlimited sales of American weapons overseas. As I said in the debate the other night, we've become the arms merchant of the world. This is a policy that's both cynical and dangerous. That we've in effect condoned the efforts of some Arab countries to circumvent the commitment of our Bill of Rights and boycott American businesses who trade with Israel or who have Jewish owners or managers within the businesses themselves. This is an unprecedented thing that we've accepted. We've failed to oppose the denial of human freedom in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union.\n"", ""Now I don't say these things are simple issues. But there are practical and effective ways in which our own power can be used to alleviate human suffering around the world. We should begin by letting it be known that any nation, whatever its political system, if it deprives its people of basic human rights, that that fact will help to shape our own people's attitudes toward that country. If other nations want our friendship and support, they must understand that we want to see basic human rights respected. We must at the same time be realistic. As John Kennedy said, and I quote, we must keep the world safe for diversity, we should not insist on identical governments or all nations of the world to accept our standards exactly. But we cannot look away when a government tortures its own people, or jails them for their beliefs, or denies minorities fair treatment, or the right to immigrate. Or the right to worship.\n"", 'Father Hesburgh served, as you know, on the Commission on Civil Rights at a time when the South was struggling to grant equality of opportunity, the right to hold jobs, the right to buy homes, to black people. As I said recently in Salt Lake City, as I said many times in Alabama, and Mississippi, and Louisiana, and the Carolinas and Tennessee and Georgia and Florida, the best thing that ever happened to the South in my lifetime was the passage of the civil rights acts, and the granting to black people the chance for equality. We still have a long way to go in our own country. But we\'re making progress. But now I think it is time for us to reassert those basic commitments at home, and also let them be an undeviating guiding light for us abroad. The world looks for leadership. And when there is a vacuum of leadership, it is going to be filled somehow. I\'m a nuclear engineer and a physicist and also a politician, and I know that when a vacuum is there, it\'s an abhorrent thing in politics and the vacuum is going to be filled. It\'s going to be filled either with freedom or slavery, with hopes or with despair, with democracy and liberty, or with dictatorships. And I would like to see the world leadership vacuum filled without domination but with inspiration from our own country. We must reassess our own foreign aid program. To make sure that when money does leave our nation it goes to those who need it most. As Richard Gardner, one of the great analysts of the United Nations said, ""I\'m not in favor of taxing the poor people in our rich country and continuing to send the money to the rich people in the poor country."" But there are many needs that can be met with sound management and with an undeviating commitment to alleviating suffering. Not only food, but the quality of our environment, and the health of people around the world, can be aided to a substantial degree by leadership and the direct aid from our own country. We now spend .3 percent of our gross national product on foreign aid. Other countries spend much more: .5 or .7 percent The Soviet Union, only .1 percent. So all the nations in a multinational commitment, if provided proper leadership, could be successful in alleviating a great deal of the suffering and deprivation that exists. We ought to speak out forcefully whenever there\'s human torture in the world.\n', ""And I believe that if we restore not only the faith of our own people in our own government, but also help to alleviate that torture, even in the most totalitarian of all, we should insist on the concept of majority rule. In Africa we've come in late. For a long time we were committed, under National Security Memorandum No. 39 to supporting minority white governments. Only [in] this election year has our nation moved any degree to support the long standing effort to guarantee majority rule in Africa. And there are many other places of deprivation in the world which haven't yet experienced the concept of majority rule. Cyprus is one that we need to address in a humanitarian way, and with a well balanced commitment to the preservation of peace. We should help to stamp out religious prosecution. Many people understand this, [for example] the Jews who want to leave the Soviet Union. There are 5 million Baptists in the Soviet Union who felt the pressure because of their religious commitments. We ought to stand staunchly against the deliberate violation of law. In the last few years we've seen the disgraceful spectacle of our own government condoning, sometimes even encouraging, multinational corporations engaging in bribery of foreign officials. This is a disgrace to our country. It ought not to be permitted to continue. The United Nations put out the Genocide Convention 25 years ago. We've still not ratified it. And also a basic convention on the protection of human rights, civil rights. We've still not ratified that convention. And we ought to move as best we can to stamp out international terrorism as well. There are many things that we can do. And I believe that this center here that shifts its goals from strictly domestic civil rights, which is still very important, to a broader concept erf all human rights, and I hope this will be done expeditiously, and I'll help if I'm elected President, can be a beacon to our own country and to the world for a constant reassessment of what can be done in a world that we acknowledge to be imperfect.\n"", ""There is one other area that I would like to mention this morning, wherein we can tap the great resources of our country. In the defense of human rights, yes, but that's only one aspect of an area where volunteerism can come in. I'd just like to take a few minutes to talk to you about that subject It's a subject that I think has always been of particular interest to young people whose idealism has not been dampened by the long years of frustration. If Pm elected President, I hope to bring a new spirit of optimism, patriotism and self-sacrifice to America. That happened in 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt became President. It happened again in 1961 under John Kennedy. And I believe it can happen again under a Carter Administration if we can succeed in restoring public trust in our own government. I hope that one manifestation of this renewed national spirit will be a new era of volunteerism, with Americans working to help others on an unprecedented scale. We saw an example of this when John Kennedy began the Peace Corps. We all remember the excitement of that era. My mother, at the age of 68, joined the Peace Corps and went to India to serve for two years, coming back after she was 70 years old. I know what it meant to our community and our family, to her life, just to know that she was doing something worthwhile, even at that advanced age.\n"", ""I'd like to see this concept revitalized along whatever grounds are most pertinent and appropriate in today's international realities. But even more importantly, I would like to see an outpouring of volunteer effort in our own country. We know there are needs, very deep needs. I worshipped this morning at the retardation center at the edge of your campus. I know that many students from Notre Dame participate in that volunteer effort to take care of retarded children who are severely afflicted. And that's an outpouring that needs to be made too in schools, particularly our poorer schools, in hospitals of all kinds, in day care centers, in mental institutions and prisons and law enforcement agencies, in probation efforts, on Indian reservations, in local, state and federal government agencies. In many other places, the potential volunteers are there too. People of all ages—students, housewives, business people, retired people and many others. What's been lacking in the past is motivation. It's not enough for a President to call for volunteerism, he must create a climate in which our people want to help others, and are proud to help their country in the process. We don't need a new federal bureaucracy to do this. We must use the structure of existing agencies. And we will also stress the support of existing private volunteer programs. What's needed is Presidential leadership that will encourage and honor volunteer service. I think that retired people and young people in particular are a vast untapped resource. We now spend countless hours in idleness, and on personal diversions of many kinds. I'd like to see us divert some of our time and some of our energy to helping others. And I believe that Americans will do this gladly if volunteer work is given proper respect and proper recognition. There is much that needs to be done in our society. More than government itself can ever hope to accomplish. But there is little that cannot be done if the American people roll up our sleeves and set out to do these things. If I become President, I will make every effort to channel the idealism, the compassion and the energies of our people, and the good works of which we can all be proud.\n"", ""Americans pride ourselves on self-reliance. We pride ourselves on adherence to unchanging principles. We pride ourselves on the ability to achieve unity within the concept of diversity. America is not a melting pot. We don't come here and lose our identity as we live among one another. It's more like a beautiful mosaic, where every person is an individual and where we can harness our common effort when we have the inspiration and the mechanism by which our lives can be more meaningful. We've got to tap this tremendous strength, in the two areas that I've covered briefly with you today: One, a renewed commitment to civil rights, human rights, domestic and around the world, to let our country once again, as Father Hesburgh said at lunchtime, be a beacon light of hope for all human kind.\n"", ""And secondly, we must tap the tremendous resources of the 215 million Americans who don't serve in government, who may not even get paid, but who want to make our own lives more meaningful in the service of others. That's a tremendous resource of strength that's waiting to be used.\n"", ""Again, I want to thank you for letting me come to Notre Dame. This campaign has been a very good educational process for me. It's been going on now for 21 months. And I've gotten an excellent education. I've made mistakes and I've learned how to correct them. But the constant inspiration to me has been the quiet strength of American people who don't want anything selfish out of government, who just want to be treated fairly, who want to be legitimately proud once again of the greatest nation on earth, and who want to be a part of the process of making the world a better place in which we live. Particularly for those who have been deprived, who've been cheated, who've been forgotten, and who've been deeply hurt. A sense of brotherhood, a sense of sisterhood is there in the hearts and minds of the American people. I want to make sure that our government itself, and our nation as a whole, taps that sense that exists in the minds and hearts of so many American people.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
97,Jimmy Carter ,"October 10, 1976","['Thank you so much. All I want you to do for me in the Third District is to give me half the margin of victory that you gave John Brademas. And to help Vance Hartke and all the other Democrats who are running to represent you as best we can.\n', ""One of the good things about this campaign, among many others, is that I don't have to raise any money for myself. Our campaign is being financed by 44 million Americans who over the last 4 years have contributed $1 per person per year when you filed your income tax returns. And that's the way I like it. It's very good for me. But I see very clearly that this doesn't help the candidates for Congress or U.S. Senate or governor, attorney general, lieutenant governor. They need your help. And quite often people have backed off and have not been as eager to contribute simply because they can't contribute directly to the Presidential campaigns. And I hope that we'll all remember that we as Democrats have a great responsibility to one another.\n"", ""There are only two basic things that we need in government. One is competence. Can the government be managed properly? Can it be efficient, economical, purposeful? Can it be open so that people can understand and control it, so it can represent what we are? Can this be possible in our own country? I think so. I'm a farmer and a businessman; I'm a nuclear engineer and a physicist; I've served in local government and I've been able to manage my own affairs and the affairs of Georgia's government in a tough, businesslike way, with personnel management, electronic data processing, tight organization, and I believe this is the only way that people can have access to government.\n"", ""In our own state now, you can make one telephone call, at state expense, and get the answer to any question about government. If you, for instance, didn't get your Social Security check on time, you can call that WATS line, with a federal problem, and when the person who answers it finds what district you're in, the phone is automatically transferred to Washington to your congressional office, and you say, I didn't get my Social Security check, and it will be taken care of in Washington, with one telephone call. Or if you go to a local grocery store, and you buy chicken and they charge you for three pounds, and you get home and find you've got two and a half pounds, or you can go and dial the same number at no expense to you and say I got cheated at the local grocery store. And while you hold the phone, they can transfer you to the person in charge of weights and measure for grocery stores and you can register your complaint. This is the kind of check, and it will be taken care of in Washington with one telephone call. So competence is one aspect.\n"", ""And the other component part I think would be compassion. The need for government to understand those who don't make decisions for themselves in politics. Everyone in this group I would guess, suffers very little if we have an inefficient welfare system, or if the employment security agency doesn't function well, or if the criminal justice system is not fair. We are the kinds of people who have been blessed by God with superior opportunities. We are leaders, economically, socially, politically. And quite often when we make mistakes in government we don't, suffer from those mistakes. Our families are not the ones who stand in line, when the unemployment rate goes up, to look for a job. And ours are not the ones who suffer when the welfare system is inequitable. And our families are not the ones who are deprived of adequate health care or dental care, if the public health system breaks down. And our families are not the ones who ordinarily would see our children go to prison if they are caught with a little too much marijuana, or if they engage in a hit and run accident. We can probably talk our way out of it or say, judge, this is a good boy, I'm a local attorney or local businessman, engineer, or teacher, and I'll be responsible for my son. You just let him go, in my custody. But many families in this country don't have that right And that child, if they're caught with a small amount of marijuana, or engaged in a hit and run accident, they're going to prison.\n"", ""So the thing that we ought to remember is that in addition to the competence of government, it ought to be compassionate. It ought to be concerned about those who don't ordinarily find themselves involved in the decision making process.\n"", ""And we ought to remove that distinction that separates the different levels in our society. We don't do it deliberately. We don't deliberately create an unfair criminal justice system. We don't deliberately create an inequitable tax program. We don't deliberately create an ineffective delivery of welfare services or health services. But it happens.\n"", ""And I think the political structure, the humbling campaign requirement, is one of the characteristics of the Democratic Party that's kept us strong. We ought not to forget those two things.\n"", ""Competence and compassion are not incompatible. As you well know, someone who is strong and sure and powerful is in a much better frame of mind to reach a helping hand to someone who is weaker. But if you are insecure and not quite so powerful as you would like to be, your inclination is to struggle and to step on others. So compassion is not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.\n"", ""I just made a speech over at Notre Dame about international human rights, and the use of many more volunteers in the future among our own private citizens to help alleviate the problems of our own country. But I'm grateful that you've been loyal to the Democratic Party. And I think you've seen a surge upward in this state in respect of what our party is and what it stands for. And I want to make sure that we correct our mistakes and answer those difficult questions, and bind ourselves back together in a spirit of unity of purpose in the future. And to forget about the devastating blows that have hit on our consciousness in the last eight years, with Vietnam, Cambodia, and Chile and Pakistan and Angola and Watergate, CIA and FBI and Medicaid scandals. Those things have hurt us very badly. But they are not characteristic of our country. And if we can just unify our own capabilities, in a spirit of freedom, and common concern, we can correct those mistakes and we can once again prove to the rest of the world. That's very important, but more importantly, [we can] prove to our own people, in this country, that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.\n"", 'Thank you very much for letting me come.']"

I'd like to add one comment to what the Bishop said. This is a local affair. But national and international affairs spring from individual human beings who make up families, who make up neighborhoods, who make up communities, who make up nations. And there's no difference because once a government represents what people are, then the government can be great.\n"", ""I'm very glad that I had a chance to come here to meet with you tonight. My wife and my daughter, Amy, who is nine years old, have already been introduced. I also have a relative here, a sister-in-law, and a brother-inlaw, my sister-in-law is from Estonia, and she and her husband are there and I'd like you to meet Anna, who bom in Estonia [applause].\n"", ""I'm not going to make a political speech tonight. I'm sure you'll be relieved to hear that. [applause] I've made enough in the last few days.\n"", ""I've come here to join with you in discussing some matters that are important to me. And I think important to you as well. To join in honoring Bernard Pulaski, who worked his way up through the ranks of the iron workers to become a leader of many working people. To join in honoring Judge Thaddeus Adesko, who served in the Illinois State Senate and for the last ten years has been a justice of the Illinois Appellate Court. And to join in honoring also Judge Eugene Wachowski, the presiding judge of the first municipal district of Cook County. They represent a heritage that would make me proud, and a heritage that makes you proud, of achievements by Poles and Polish Americans, typical of what has been the case throughout our nation's history, in government, literature, science, business, and the arts.\n"", 'Your own Congressman, Daniel Rostenkowski, is a man to whom I will look if elected to help me understand the special problems of Americans who seek adequate health care.\n', ""Not long ago, I was talking to the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee about health and about other means of delivering services to people who are destitute and who are in need. He told me, if you want an expert on the subject, who understands government but also understands people, when you get to Chicago talk to Dan. And he's already begun to [applause] submit to me advice and counsel which I hope I can use.\n"", 'We also, of course, think of great scientists like Marie Curie, great musicians like Paderewski, great writers like Joseph Conrad, great military leaders like Pulaski and Kosciuszko, and great athletes like Carl Yastrzemski and Stan Musial. Two of the people that I have relied on in this whole campaign to help me with the two key issues, just coincidentally, happen to be from Polish families. For foreign affairs, the only man who came to San Francisco to brief me before the last debate was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who [applause] is an expert on that subject and he helped me a great deal. And before the first debate, the only man who came to Plains, Georgia, to brief me on economic affairs was Jerry Jasinowski. Just a coincidence, but I think it shows an increasing acceptance in government, in politics, of the wisdom and the justice and the understanding and comprehension of people in this country, and a chance to terminate the subtle discrimination that quite often has been an obstacle to the full involvement of great leaders who have come from families who originated m Poland.\n', ""Tonight I'd like to talk about two or three things to you that affect all of us. One is the breakdown in the relationship between government and people. We now have 7/a million Americans unemployed. Your own heritage, like mine, even your own religious beliefs, like mine, are predicated on the hope that people who are able to work ought to have a chance to work. In the last two years, alone, since President Nixon left office, we've had 2% million Americans added to the unemployment roles. In the last three months, 500,000 Americans became unemployed. This is bad enough just as a horrible statistic. Of all the developed nations of the world, we have the highest unemployment rate; greater than that of England; greater than that of Germany; greater than that of France; twice as great even as Italy; almost four times as great as the unemployment rate in Japan. And that hurts individual people who believe in self-reliance and who believe in human pride and who believe in a chance to take whatever talent or ability God gives us and to use it in a worthy way. We know that the first ones to lose their jobs are those who felt the burden of discrimination. And the last ones who are hired back when unemployment drops are those who felt the burden of discrimination.\n"", ""And it hurts a man or a woman who might have been employed for 15 or 20 years for the first time to be drawing unemployment checks and then in a few months to stand in their first welfare line. And to start financing the family's affairs through a welfare check. For an able bodied person that is a very devastating thing. And this translates into the breakdown of the family structure.\n"", ""I've made several speeches lately about American families. And I know that when a family becomes weak, when it's tom about because of a lack of respect for the parents, or a lack of opportunities for children to leave the home with pride, to earn their own living, then the structure of a home or a community, or a state or a nation is damaged. Government intrudes when families are not strong. When families can't provide for food, clothing, housing, health care, education on their own, then the government must come in and take over the responsibility that ought to properly be that of the mother and father. And once the families begin to deteriorate the communities and the neighborhoods go next.\n"", ""So the strength of the families which has always been an integral part of your lives is crucial to our nation. Unemployment is bad; inflation comes in quietly and robs us all. Sometimes we don't even know it. Last month, in September, we experienced another double digit inflation period, increasing our annual rate of about 11 percent. And for someone who is retired and seeking security alone, and human dignity, to have one's life savings only worth 89 percent at the end of the year, or a five percent savings account experience a loss, not a gain, of 6 percent, is a devastating blow.\n"", 'We now have only a third of the families in our country who are able to own their own homes. Eight years ago, 50 percent could own their own homes. This, again, tears apart the stability of a family opportunity. It took us a long time to reach a point where families in this country mostly could own their homes. But the price of a home has increased $16,000 in the last eight years alone. And the interest rates have increased 50 percent.\n', ""I think all of you know, too, the problem with transportation, energy supplies; but the thing that we've lost recently has been the spirit of America. I'd like to talk to you just a few minutes about foreign policy.\n"", ""We're not the only people who want to stand for something in the world. Freedom in Eastern Europe was bom in Poland, with the Constitution in 1791. Since that time, Poland has endured many rulers, but its people have never lost their intense desire to be free. And this is experienced not only in the history of the country, but also in the music of your country, which has been an inspiration to all human beings of this world who sought liberty and freedom. The desire for freedom brought your parents and grandparents, perhaps, to this country. In my own state, one of the original 13 states, has always revered the name of Kosciuszko. My own daughter, Caron, comes from Pulaski County, Georgia, Hawkinsville; and I hope [applause] you'll visit it some day to see what it means to us.\n"", ""That commitment for freedom brought Kosciuszko and Pulaski to this country. To America, to fight and to die young in our war for independence and for freedom. That spirit led three Polish soldiers to Monte Cassino, where they were the first allied regiment to plant their colors during one of the fiercest battles of World War II. And their graves there, in those remote mountain areas, there's a plaque which bears this inscription. These Polish soldiers for our freedom and for yours, gave their bodies to Italy, their hearts to Poland, and their souls to God. And that spirit lives on, it lives among you and among the people that you are bound to by ties of history and affection who still live in Poland.\n"", ""I think it's time that we had a President who understands the facts about Eastern Europe and about the whole world. It's time we had leaders who will speak up for freedom in Eastern Europe, and also in the rest of the world.\n"", 'When I was here in Chicago to make a major foreign affairs speech last March, I said Eastern Europe must never, and can never be a stable region until the Eastern European countries regain their independence. I said then that the Soviet Union must understand that any United States-Soviet détente depends upon recognizing the legitimate aspirations of the people—of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, and the rest of Eastern Europe. [applause]\n', ""That was a statement that I made last March. And I still believe that. We don't want a cold war. We want to cooperate with the Soviet Union in order to avoid the horrors of nuclear conflict. But if I'm elected President, I will take four or five or six steps to show that we do care about freedom in Eastern Europe.\n"", ""First, we will insist that the Soviet Union comply with the guarantees of human rights contained in the Helsinki Agreement. There should be freedom of movement in Eastern Europe. There should be freedom of expression, freedom of families to reunite with their relatives overseas, and access to them with gifts that are not changed into rubles and do not have to be taxed 30 percent We've had a deterioration and not an improvement since the Helsinki agreement was signed. That agreement must be enforced [applause]. There has to be access to those who live in Poland from the free world.\n"", 'And we must insist, secondly, that the Soviet Union, as agreed to in the Helsinki Agreement, cease jamming Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.\n', 'Third, we should work for an expanded network of human and commercial ties between the countries of the East and the countries of the West, ties that will keep the alternative of freedom always open in the Eastern Europan countries. They must recognize that no matter how destitute they may be of freedom at this moment, the legitimate hope through access beyond the Iron Curtain, is always open to them.\n', ""We must be sure at home that we never yield the principles expressed in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. Recently, we've seen an example of that when the Arab countries tell American businesses, you can't trade with us if you do business with Israel. You can't trade with us if you have American Jews who own stock in your company or help to manage its affairs. This is a deprivation of liberty. It's a circumvention of our Bill of Rights. It's been condoned by our own government leaders.\n"", ""This time it's Jews. Later it may be others, who could be suffering because of their religious beliefs, or their ethnic background. We must never again permit this to be done. Our country also must be constantly concerned about the preservation of human rights throughout the world. Not just in our own country, not just in Eastern Europe. But in Cyprus, also in South America and Chile and any other nation where human beings are tortured, the American voice must be there, not to let the world forget.\n"", ""And last, I'd like to make sure, as President, that I do nothing by deed or word to give the slightest indication that we will ever accept permanent Soviet domination over countries that want to be free. And you can depend upon that [applause].\n"", 'Today, I made a speech at Notre Dame, at noon. And I had a quiet talk with Father Hesburgh, who\'s been the President of that University for 25 years. He pointed out to me that many centuries ago a question was asked a wise man, ""How do you prepare to be the leader of a country, what are the qualifications to be a Prime Minister, or President?"" And the answer came back from the wise man, just two words. ""Be human."" Be human.\n', ""The strength of leaders can only come from their ability to tap the experience, the judgment, the common sense, the intelligence, the idealism, the hope, the sense of brotherhood and compassion and love, patriotism toward one's country, that exists in the minds and hearts of free men and women everywhere.

But that is an enjoyable experience for me.\n', ""My campaign has never been an ordeal, it's never been a sacrifice. It's been a challenging and an exhilirating experience, and it has inspired me to reach for a standard of excellence and greatness that can only be derived from those that I hope to represent.

It's more a beautiful mosaic where different kinds of people with different customs and different dreams and different memories, fit together and share our strength toward a high and a common goal. Therein lies the uniqueness of America. And we derive our unique spirit, too, from the common bond that brought us here, a search for human freedom. We ought never to forget those facts.

And after a few months, for the first time, stands in a welfare line. It tears apart the fabric of a family, and it destroys its self-confidence that is so crucial.\n', ""In our government, local, state and federal, quite often we forget that those of us assembled in this room with influence, with financial security, with social prominence, are quite often the ones who make decisions. And our families very seldom suffer when we make a mistake. When the unemployment rate goes up, rarely do the members of our family stand in a line looking for a job. And when the welfare program is confused, our families are very seldom touched by a welfare check or the absence of it. And when a crime is committed, we can pretty well rest assured that our children won't go to jail, if they are caught with a small quantity of marijuana, or involved in a hit and run accident.\n"", ""But there are many Americans who don't have that sense of security. Even as it relates to their own government. That needs to be changed. So I believe in compassion too. I believe that the 10 percent of the people on welfare who are able-bodied ought to be trained, given literacy instructions, matched with a job, offered a job, and put to work. And the other 90 percent who can't work should be treated with understanding and respect.\n"", 'I believe we can and should do more for those who are mentally and physically handicapped. And I believe we can do more for the elderly. And I believe we should eliminate the double standard of justice. In all our polling around the country, one of the most sharply cutting edges of dissatisfaction is the belief among American people that there is indeed a double standard of justice. One for the poor, a completely different standard for the rich.\n', ""When I was Governor of Georgia I visited almost every prison in the state to learn about those who were there. To talk to them, to try to do something about rehabilitation. There were black people and white people, there were well educated people and there were illiterate people. 35 percent of all the inmates in our prisons are mentally retarded. There were young people and old people, and there were poor people. But never any rich people. We don't do this deliberately. But it's done. And it's not right. And it's not fair. And the American people see this very clearly. [applause]\n"", ""I believe we can do more to end ignorance and illiteracy in our country. If nations like Sweden and Israel can stamp out illiteracy all together, I see no reason why we should not set that as a practical goal for us to achieve. I was in Utah the other day. The average educational level of all adults is well above the high school level. And that's not matched anywhere else in our country. We probably spend more per child on education than any other nation on earth. But we still have a very low record of stamping out illiteracy. I believe that investments in human being are the ones that always pay the highest dividends. [applause]\n"", ""And I believe that the only way we're going to accomplish these hopes is to have a government that at the same time is both competent, for a change, and compassionate for a change. In the last 22 months, I've gone before a lot of conservative audiences in this country and I've confessed to some liberal traits. And tonight before this liberal audience, let me confess to some certain beliefs that may be classified as conservative.\n"", 'I believe in hard work and frugality. And I believe in balanced budgets when our people are at work. And I intend as one of my major accomplishments as President to see our government once again have a balanced budget before the end of my first term as President. Now this is not incompatible with the meeting of our needs and the putting of our people back to work. And the control of inflation.\n', ""Historically, in our party, the Democratic Party, and those that you've supported as well, we've seen this happen. Harry Truman was in office 7 years, didn't have a deficit, he had an average surplus of 2 billion dollars. But along with that was an unemployment rate when he went out of office of less than 3 percent. An inflation rate of less than 1 percent.\n"", ""And interest on a home loan from FHA was 4 percent, and under John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, when Lyndon Johnson went out of office the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent. The inflation rate averaged about 2 percent. And when he went out of office he turned over a balanced budget to Richard Nixon. But we'll never have a balanced budget, and we'll never have an end to the inflationary spiral and we'll never have an actual meeting of the needs of our people through social and other programs, as long as we've got 7J4 or 8 million people out of work who are actively looking for jobs. So we must put our people back to work. [applause]\n"", 'I believe that when there is a choice between government taking on a responsibility and the private sector of our economy taking on a responsibility, the choice is even, the private sector ought to have that choice.\n', 'I believe that when there is a choice between national, state and local governments to perform a function, that the choice should be that government closest to individual citizen.\n', 'I believe that government ought to do everything it can to strengthen the American family, because weak families mean more government. And many of the things that we see in our government now tends to destroy a family. Inadequate education, inadequate housing, a lack of jobs, rising inflation, hurts those families quite often that are tied together most loosely.\n', ""My own family is not poor now. But I live among poor people. And I know what it means for them to have a boy or girl reach the age of eighteen. They don't qualify for welfare payments. And they don't qualify for Social Security payments, and they don't qualify for unemployment compensation. And there's a general pushing of that young person out of the family environment. And I don't care if it's the best young person on earth, when they stand on the street, or walk the streets for a week, two weeks, three weeks, without being able to find a job, there's a tremendous pressure on them to start shoplifting, or breaking into cars, or selling drugs, or starting to gamble, or becoming a prostitute.\n"", ""Unemployment is not an excuse for crime, but it's a terrible cause of crime. And to the extent that the family can be held together, to that extent our country can be strong. And government doesn't have to come in and take the place of a father or mother. And respect in a mutual way among the family members can be restored. I think every decision the government makes ought to be carefully assessed to be sure that it strengthens the American family. And from strong families can come strong neighborhoods, and from strong neighborhoods can come strong communities. And that's how our societal structure should be repaired.\n"", 'Government has done very little in recent years to accomplish this end. But beginning next January that will be one of the highest priorities of my administration. [applause]\n', ""I believe in a minimum of government secrecy and a maximum of personal privacy. In the last eight years this basic concept of our country has been reversed. We've seen too much government secrecy, and not enough personal privacy. And I hope that our people will rise up, not only to vote on November the 2nd to make a change, but to insist at all times that we have sunshine laws in Washington, as strong as have been established in many states around our country. This will help to reveal errors early. It will prevent the devastating blows that have befallen our country in recent years.\n"", ""I believe that every major mistake we've made in the last eight or ten years has been caused, to a substantial degree, by the exclusion of the American people from the process of making those decisions. In Vietnam and Cambodia, and Watergate and CIA and FBI scandals, our attitude in Bangladesh, our attitude in Chile, Angola—if the American people had been deeply involved in making those decisions, we could have avoided some serious mistakes. So maximum privacy for citizens, minimum secrecy for government, is another hope that I'll carry into the White House.\n"", ""These are some of the things that I believe. I don't really know if they are liberal or conservative. But I think they're right. I think they measure accurately the purpose of our government. We've lost a lot in this country in the last eight years. We've lost some precious things that we've believed in in the past, and that we took for granted. We've lost trust in our government\n"", ""But I don't think it has to be that way. I think that what happened in the last eight years has been a temporary aberration. I think we were tricked and misled in many instances. Now we are a wiser and a more skeptical nation, and I welcome that skepticism. I welcome the scrutiny of our people. I'm not going to hide in a Rose Garden. I'm going to be out campaigning every minute that I can from now until election. [applause]\n"", ""Because the campaign itself is a tremendous educational opportunity. To travel around this nation, to meet American people, to talk a little, to listen a lot, to receive questions and suggestions and expressions of the hopes and dreams of 215 million of us is sobering, sometimes it's humbling, most of the time inspirational, always educational.\n"", ""I ask your help. I appreciate the confidence that you've expressed in me. I don't claim to know all the answers. I'm just a person like you are, that's become interested in politics, who came from nowhere almost to win the nomination.\n"", ""When I started campaigning 21 months ago, I didn't hold public office, I didn't have much money—I think I had $43,000. I didn't have a built-in campaign organization. Not many people knew who I was. I doubt if one in a thousand of you had ever heard my name. I come from a small town, not quite as big as New York, has 683 people in it.\n"", ""But my wife, and my children, and a few volunteers began to travel around the country. We'd go into a neighborhood and invite all the folks to come into a living room and meet with us. Maybe three or four people would come. And we'd go into a labor hall that would hold several hundred folks, and maybe twelve people would show up. So we began to walk the streets, we went in barber shops and beauty parlors, restaurants, and stores. And we would stand in front of the revolving doors at shopping centers and in factory shift lines early in the morning and late at night. And we'd go into farmers' markets and livestock sales barns and county courthouses and city halls.

Richard Nixon didn't hurt it. Watergate didn't hurt it. The CIA revelations, the wars in Vietnam and Cambodia didn't hurt our system of government. It's still clean and decent. It's a basis on which we can predicate answers to complicated questions, and bind ourselves together and correct our mistakes, and approach the future with confidence in one another. But the greatest resource of all is the 215 million Americans who have within us the same strength and character and idealism and patriotism and confidence and eagerness to work for the good of one another that's always made our country strong.\n"", ""But our nation has been in trouble the last eight years.

100,Jimmy Carter ,"October 15, 1976","['To Charlie and Mildred, and Clifford and Vivian, and Senator Eagleton and my good friend Warren Hearnes, Joe Teasdale, others who are here this evening who are interested in politics and in government, are interested in hopes and dreams, who are interested in friendship and frankness.\n', ""It's a great honor to me to participate and particularly to be compared to Jerry Litton.\n"", 'I was across the river this afternoon, in Kansas City, Kansas, and I told them that there were some great political figures in this country. But that at this particular time I would rather have the votes that Whitey Herzog could get, than anybody that I know of in this region. And I know that all of you are proud of the kind of spirit that has been demonstrated by the Kansas City Royals.\n', ""It's a spirit of competition, and a spirit of success, and a spirit of appreciation, and a sense of bringing people together.\n"", 'More than a year ago, when I was beginning my own campaign for the nomination for President of the United States, I came here at the invitation of Congressman Jerry Litton, to participate one Sunday in what was one of the most remarkable experiences of my life—Dialogues with Litton. I never dreamed what it would be. But I was looking for exposure and I was looking for experience—learning about politics. And I came. I could not believe that a thousand people would pay a fee to come together on a Sunday afternoon to ask questions of a Congressman.\n', 'It was an unbelievable interrelationship between him and the people who sat around a tremendous ballroom and asked question after question after question. To him and to me. And to have it recorded on tape and later played back to viewers who had grown up in several states who had perhaps their first opportunity to really see tough cross-examination given to those who actually represent them in government. There was an intimacy about it that was startling.\n', 'I thought a lot about that meeting when I went back home to Plains, Georgia. How distant we often draw away from people who have trust in us once we get in office. But Jerry Litton had, with a great sensitivity, figured out a unique way, unprecedented in the history of this country, to stay close to folks back home. And he let them feel, not that he was reaching down to them or telling them about distant happenings in Washington, but that they were part of it, and they were helping him make the decisions. It was a very great experience.\n', 'And when I got back home I told my wife, Rosalynn, ""I have just met a young man who shocked me and who startled me and who inspired me. And I believe that someday he has a good chance to be President of the United States. Because there is something about him that is unique."" I never had known him before. I had heard about him.\n', ""As soon as I made my official announcement as a candidate for President, Jerry Litton endorsed me. Now, I don't criticize the rest of the Missouri delegation when I say that he was the first one who did. And we had only had a brief encounter, relatively speaking, but there was a kind of mutuality about it, of friendship and trust. And it's a compliment to me that the spirit was built up between us.\n"", ""Jerry Litton was blessed by his family, as you well know. His mother and father, and his wife and children, they were a kind of a team. And I can see the benefit in it. Because a lot of times in politics, as you well know, it's kind of a lonely thing. Particularly when you are just getting started—running for Congress or running for governor or running for President.\n"", 'Most of the time, in those early stages, when you say, ""I want to be Congressman of the Sixth District,"" and then you walk away, you know there are a lot of jokes, and kind of a smirking and you feel very humble. To walk in front of a service station and talk to five people and say, ""Would you vote for me for Congress?"" And quite often you feel that you are not quite worthy in their eyes. You think more of yourself, but you\'re kind of sure that they don\'t think you\'re qualified to go to Washington.\n', ""But the family that's there—your wife and others who have confidence in you—always provide a base, a kind of a solid base that's unshakable. And you can take the ups and downs, endorsements and endorsements of your opponents, favorable newspaper editorials and those that are very critical, success in a speech and a speech that fumbles. And with the bad editorials, and the endorsements for your opponent, and the speeches that fail, it's always great to come home to a wife who, like Jerry Litton's constituents, was an equal partner in the process.\n"", ""I've talked this afternoon about families. And how important it is for every decision of government—international affairs, transportation, taxation, housing, education, welfare, health, crime control—to be designed to keep families together. Because when the family is strong, the community is strong, the nation is strong. And you can minimize the responsibility placed on government. Because many times, when the family fails, is exactly when the government has to come in, in a fumbling way, to substitute for what the family provides.\n"", ""Jerry Litton and his family—three generations at least—provided an inspiration to us, and an inspiration to him. He was born, like I was, on an isolated farm—before the Roosevelt-Truman era—without electricity, without indoor plumbing. But it didn't hurt us. And he became, at a very early age, a young man who made the best of his opportunities. There was not a handicap or an obstacle that caused him to be discouraged or to withdraw from the competition of an increasingly adult world. He went to high school, he was a president of a National Honor Society. He joined the FFA like I did as a high school boy. And he not only succeeded at his own high school— I was secretary of the Plains High School FFA—but he went on beyond that and became president of all the Future Farmers of Missouri. And he wasn't satisfied with that. He went on and became a national officer.\n"", ""Not too long ago, I came to Kansas City to speak to 18,000 Future Farmers who represent the hundreds of thousands all over the country, and to think about the intense commitment to the principles of agriculture and its future that's required to be a national officer. Almost overwhelming.\n"", 'But it was a common thing for that sort of success in the life of Jerry Litton. He began to make speeches when he was young. Because he was so timid, and he saw that as a potential obstacle as he grew up. And he kind of took lessons within the Future Farmers just to learn how to speak. And by the time he was 19 years old he was being paid to speak. He would go and make speeches at graduation exercises, and travel around the country and by the time he got to college he had accumulated $15,000 to help his family pay his way through school with his speaking ability. His common subject was farmers and agriculture and rural life and the commonality of purpose and challenge and opportunity between those who live in the great cities of our country and those who live in the great farmlands of our country.\n', ""When he got to college he studied, at the University of Missouri, as you know, agriculture and journalism. Because he had in the meantime become a professional radio announcer—his speaking qualities were so good. He joined a fraternity. And he was elected president of his fraternity, which is not a remarkable experience, but he was elected president of his fraternity when he was a freshman. I've never heard of that before. And those of you who are members of fraternities—I went to the Naval Academy where they didn't have fraternities—but those of you who are members of fraternities know that that's an almost unheard of thing. For a freshman to be the president of a fraternity. And those young men must have recognized something in him at the University of Missouri that was extraordinary.\n"", 'His father had a great deal of bad luck, being injured as a truck driver, and having been laid up, almost completely physically incapacitated for seven years, and later hurt again, so when Jerry came home from college he had a partnership that existed throughout the rest of his life.\n', 'And he didn\'t set as a goal for himself having a mediocre or an average ranch operation. He knew about a new breed of cattle, the French Charolais, and he told his father, ""Let\'s buy the best."" And they bought the best they could afford. But he still wasn\'t satisfied. And in those embryonic days, with the use of computers, they analyzed the qualities of every calf, and every brood cow and every bull, and they slowly improved upon a superlative breed of cattle. Until, in just a few years, starting from practically nothing, with a $20,000 loan, he and his father, working together with the rest of their family, built up a cattle herd that was known throughout the world.\n', 'And then Jerry decided he wanted to go to Congress. In fact, he decided when he was about 19 years old that he wanted to go to Congress when he was 35. So guess what happened. When he was 35 years old, he was elected to Congress. And because he wanted to avoid any conflict of interest he decided to sell his interest in the ranch—it was worth a little more than $20,000—in fact a little more than $3/2 million. But he severed his conflict in the business world and gave his life to the people that he represented in government.\n', 'He went to Congress as a freshman. He started the kind of career that he had spelled out an early date, when as an FFA officer he visited my favorite President, Harry Truman. He went there with a fifteen minute appointment and he stayed two hours. And they talked about the greatness of this country and the need for unity and the obstacles that could be overcome.\n', 'And Jerry Litton told Harry Truman about his future desire to be in government. And Harry Truman said, ""Well, you can go one of two ways. You can go through the courthouse, start at the lower level, work your way up, become part of the political establishment. Or you can go into business and launch your career based on a direct non-political interrelationship with voters."" So Jerry Litton got to Congress. He had taken Truman\'s second piece of advice, and he had i direct, unrestrained interrelationship with the voters who sent him there.\n', 'In his first election, he won a tough battle against several opponents— five or six—with an overwhelming victory. In 1974 he ran for reelection and won with 79 percent of the vote. In the whole history of the district, the highest that anyone has ever gotten before was 64 percent.\n', 'Jerry Litton got to the Congress and he made it very clear to everyone as first that he would not take orders from anyone in the congressional structure. Tip O\'Neil, who is very likely to be the next Speaker of the House, commented on Jerry Litton while he was still a freshman. He said, ""I\'ve been in the Congress 22 years and I have never yet met a freshman member of Congress that could equal Jerry Litton.""\n', ""Well, I think you see very clearly that Jerry Litton's successes were not accidents. He owed his success to his friends who had confidence in him. And he never betrayed that confidence. And the early success and commitment to principles that never changed. And he owed his success to a great exuberance. He didn't trudge through life, plodding one step at a time. He ran through life with a great happiness and a joy. He never let a potential obstacle deter him. In fact, sometimes I think he welcomed it. The tough battles, the uphill fights, challenged him and let him draw on the strength that came from the support of his family and friends.\n"", ""That is the kind of politics that ought to exist more often in our country. Tonight we come to pay tribute to him. I'm saddened by it. I called his parents as soon as I heard about the tragedy. But tonight is not a time for sorrow. We've been through that sorrowful period. God's blessed us by having had a chance to know Jerry Litton. Or to know about him. And I hope that the few remarks that I've made tonight will impress on each one of us, including myself, some of those unchanging characteristics of human potential that should inspire us all to be a little better. To set a slightly higher standard in our own lives. Not to be satisfied with mediocrity, but excellence. Not to be concerned about the problems of our country, but to recognize its present and potential greatness.\n"", 'He was deeply concerned about one aspect of politics which prevails now perhaps. He got there, as you know, in the midst of Watergate. And his first major test as a freshman was when President Nixon ordered the Secretary of Agriculture to reveal the income tax returns of three million farmers to examine them without their permission. And Jerry Litton thought that was wrong to let the Secretary of Agriculture look at those income tax returns. So he started an uphill fight and he joined with a Republican senator from Connecticut and eventually they put so much pressure on the President of the United States—a freshman congressman from Missouri—that the President backed down. And one of the last remaining comments that Jerry Litton made was that the most devastating result of Watergate was the disillusionment of the American people, particularly young people, about our own government.\n', ""Well, Jerry Litton knows, I know, you know, that the American government is still clean and decent. It hadn't been damaged, the system hasn't. The problem has not been that the American people don't trust our leaders. The problem has been that some of our leaders haven't trusted the American people. But there has to be a mutuality of trust in order for us to derive the greatest strength in our own lives, individually, and in our own lives collectively—named the United States of America. Because we, collectively, are what our nation is.\n"", 'And Jerry Litton saw that, I believe, as a farm boy at Chillicothe High School and at the University of Missouri and on the ranch, and in the Congress. And he decided to run for the Senate as you know. And the night the tragedy occurred he was the nominee of the Democratic Party for the United States Senate.\n', ""Well, we don't ever know what causes tragedies, or what God's purpose is on earth. But we do know that our own life here is transient. All of us. But what we leave behind is important. And although Jerry Litton may not have his family here to carry on in generations to come, he has us and other people who knew him. Who can maybe extract something, large or small, from him and let it be part of our own lives to pass on from one year to another.\n"", 'It\'s hard for me to pick out some written phrase that might be appropriate. I have to admit that I had several suggestions from people who said, ""Read this, this is what Jerry Litton meant to me."" But one of the people who worked with Jerry Litton thought that Shakespeare would be the best source, and you\'ve heard this repeated before. I\'m going to take some poetic license and express it in the plural and let it apply to Jerry Litton and his whole family. This is from Shakespeare:\n', '""When they shall dieTake them and cut them up in little starsAnd they shall make the heavens so fineThat all the world will be in love with night.""']"

It has done little to assist our overcrowded courts, which are the bottleneck in our system of criminal justice.', 'Instead, it has often spent its money on wasteful, unnecessary equipment A test program costing $1.5 million concluded that lightweight vests would not stop bullets. The LEAA bought 3,000 of the vests for policemen to use. The LEAA has developed experimental police cars, costing $49,000 each, which police find impractical to use.

102,Jimmy Carter ,"October 16, 1976","['Chairman Steve Kovacik, and my good friend, Marvin Warner and Chairman Paul Tipps, Howard Metzenbaum and other distinguished candidates for public office in Ohio, I listened with great attention and a sense of brotherhood or commonality to your fine candidates for the Supreme Court. The major word in both their brief but very pointed addresses was the word ""apathy""—the concern about our people not taking an interest in government. It\'s my major concern.\n', 'Shortly before John Glenn went on his historic trip to China, the only senator invited by the Majority Leader to go, I had a chance to spend the night with him and Annie, and we had a long talk about what our nation is and what it ought to be and how important to our country is the active, dedicated, even sacrificial investment in the electoral process of leaders like ourselves in this crucial year. Others look to us for inspiration and others look to us for guidance and others look to us for an example of whether or not we care enough about our country to make a sacrifice as we approach the time to decide on the future of our own lives, our own families, our own communities, our own great country.\n', ""John Glenn is a good man, and I know that next year he's going to be joined in Washington by Howard Metzenbaum, and you're going to have two senators with a heart. As John Glenn often points out when I'm present, he's come down to Plains to visit me, and I've been to Columbus to visit him. He was the most famous person who ever showed up in Plains when I was deciding about my running mate, and he held the world's record until Robert Redford came a little later and then the turnout at the airport—I'll have to say—was a little bit higher for Robert Redford.\n"", ""But I've had a good chance the last 21 months to learn about this country. One place that I have always felt was close to me was Ohio. I've been here many times, as you know, and so has my wife Rosalynn, and so has my son Jack and so has his wife Judy and so has my son Chip and his wife Caron and so has my son Jeffrey and his wife Annette and so has my Aunt Sissy and my sister Ruth.\n"", 'Tonight we have a group of Georgians who are here—we call them the Peanut Brigade. They\'ve been campaigning for me at their own expense ever since the early stages of the New Hampshire primary last winter. They are working people. They take their annual vacation. They pay their own expenses. They charter a bus or buy a ticket on an airplane—tourist class— and they go to a state like your own, and they drive around the state, stand in factory shift lines and go to private homes and go to churches or county fairs or go to socials or anything else where people might be, and they tell Ohioans and others, ""We know Jimmy Carter, and we have confidence in him."" There\'s a group of the Peanut Brigade here tonight, and they have already traveled over 3,000 miles in Ohio. They have found the same thing I did when I first came here—a state with a mind of its own—a state with a great historical background—a state that\'s been the birthplace of many great ideas for our country—of Presidents, astronauts and many others—a state that quite often is a presidential battleground because nobody can take you for granted—a state with perhaps, at least this afternoon, the greatest baseball team in the world. And I\'m very proud to be here with you again.\n', ""When the primary season was over, Ohio was my 30th this year. I was in every primary if we could win a single delegate, and it was not an easy thing to run a campaign at that time. No one's ever done it before in the history of our country, and the outcome was in doubt, but when the last primary day closed, Ohio was in my column. I had 1,200 delegates the day before, and people saw the results in Ohio and then began to call me on the phone— Governor Wallace, Mayor Daley, Senator Jackson and many others—and they said you did so well in Ohio, you have our support. And it was just a short time later that I had 1,700 delegates pledged to me, and I thank Ohio for your confidence in me. You gave me a nomination, and at the convention, I was sitting in my hotel room again, strangely enough lonely with my grandson, 1 year old, on my lap and Amy trying to join him there, and the rollcall of states was being held, and I was hoping—and my hopes were finally realized—when I did go over the top, it was Ohio again. I'll never forget it.\n"", ""But I'm not through with you yet. We have another test coming on November 2, and I'm looking for Ohio to put me over the top and make me President.\n"", 'Tonight, I\'m going to speak very briefly about a concept—I haven\'t made this speech before exactly. There\'s a Bible verse that says, ""For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, then who shall prepare himself for the battle."" In Biblical times and also now, if there is no leadership, a nation or people drift. Our country is drifting. We have no clear purpose. We have no clear vision of what our nation will be in the future. We have no clear and consistent analysis of the cause of our past and present problems. We have no concept of excellence or greatness that inspires us as individuals to join that hope to make our own lives greater or more significant. It\'s not a complicated thing—leadership. It\'s based on two basic principles.\n', ""The first one is innate competence. The American people are competent. We believe in the work ethic. We believe in individuality. We believe in self-reliance. We believe in proper management. We still have the pioneer spirit. We have a clear concept of what our lives ought to be, but our government in Washington doesn't mirror those characteristics of the American people.\n"", ""In the last 8 years, there's been kind of a wall built around Washington—the center of our government, and we feel that we can't quite penetrate that wall. There's a horrible, bloated bureaucratic mess where our government ought to be. This is not consonant with what Americans are. It's not compatible with what our government ought to be. We need a tough—we need a well organized government—not disorganized. We need a clear assignment of responsibility and purpose. This can be done.\n"", ""If I'm successful in November, and I don't intend to lose, next January, we're going to have an efficient, economical, well-organized, purposeful, manageable government, and you can depend on it.\n"", ""There are those who say it's impossible, but it isn't. I'm a farmer; I'm a businessman; I'm a nuclear engineer; I'm a planner. That is one basis for hope of success, but the major basis is that the American people are ready, and the Congress is ready, and I'm ready to make those changes.\n"", 'We need to have tough budget analysis.\n', ""In Georgia my first year in office, I put into effect zero-based budgeting, which means that every year, you strip down the government to zero and you start from scratch, and every program which spends the taxpayers' money has to rejustify itself annually. You have an automatic weeding out of the old and obsolete programs. You have an automatic detection of overlapping and duplication and waste, and you have an automatic assignment of priorities so that in the next budget cycle, you spend your money not on what was necessary 50 years ago, but what's going to be necessary next year. That's going to be instituted as soon as I'm in the White House.\n"", ""Another thing that we don't have in this country is plans for the future. President Ford and the Republican Administration have no plans, no concepts in the field of energy. We're the only developed nation in the world that doesn't have a comprehensive energy program. We have no concept of what we hope to achieve in the field of transportation or agriculture or education or welfare or health or taxation. This is a devastating obstacle which prevents cooperation between the federal, state and local levels of government and between government at all levels and the business and professional and labor and agricultural and educational and scientific communities. We've got to have clear plans to show us a goal so that we can reach them at the end of 2 years or 4 years or 5 years or 10 years or even more. We did this in Georgia. It worked very well. It works in many other states, and it can and it will work in Washington.\n"", 'There\'s no reason that we should fall down on the concept of management and competence. We can have a government that\'s efficient and economical. I\'d like to remind you tonight that nowhere in the Declaration of Independence or the Bill of Rights or the Constitution of the United States or the Old Testament or the New Testament do you find the words ""economy"" or ""efficiency."" You find a lot of other words that are even more important. Words like ""truth"" and ""fairness"" and ""justice."" Words like ""hope"" and ""idealism"" and ""commitment"" and ""brotherhood."" Words like ""compassion"" and words like ""love"" and words like ""human rights."" Those words have been forgotten lately, but they\'re important, and they\'re crucial, and they go hand in hand with proper management. It\'s not right for the strongest economic nation on earth to have the highest unemployment rate. Our unemployment rate is higher than that of Great Britain. It\'s higher than that of Germany. It\'s twice as high as that in Italy—three or four times higher than that in Japan, and this tears people apart and it destroys the concept of the family structure.\n', ""In the last 2 years alone since Gerald Ford has been in office, we've had 2/2 million Americans join the unemployment rolls. In the last year 500,000 Americans have become unemployed. That removes the dignity of a man or a woman who's able to work, who wants to work, but can't find a job.\n"", ""The Republicans for historical periods have felt that the best way to control inflation is to keep people out of work. We know better, but they haven't controlled inflation even with high unemployment. We now have an inflation rate, as judged by last month's wholesale price index figures, at the double-digit level—11 percent. We in this room are blessed by God with a superior stature in the community. Almost all of us—perhaps all—have financial security. We're socially prominent. We have political influence. But there are many others who don't, and a retired person living on a fixed income or a wage earner who can't negotiate a new contract every year is constantly robbed, and that means a lower quality of food or maybe abandoning a lifetime home. It means buying cheaper clothes, or if it's a grandmother, it means giving a cheaper Christmas present to her grandchildren. This again destroys the dignity of mankind. It is not necessary if we care.\n"", ""We know as business people the importance of a balanced budget. I've worked all my life. My people have lived in Georgia 210 years. We've all been farmers, and we are tight with our own money, and in our business, we balance the budget. I was governor 4 years. The budget was balanced, and we had a good surplus. Last year we had a $65 billion deficit—the highest deficit in the history of our country—a greater deficit than all 8 years put together under Kennedy and Johnson. In fact, in the last 8 years under Nixon and Ford, we've accumulated a greater national debt than all the other 192 years put together. This is not part of the American consciousness, character or commitment. And I can tell you that at the end of the next 4 years, the budget of the United States is going to be balanced.\n"", 'There are those who say that this is a heartless statement.\n', ""It's not. Historically, we've been able to have this kind of budget management if our people are at work. Harry Truman was in office 7 years. He didn't have an average deficit—he had an average surplus of $2 billion a year. When he went out of office, the inflation rate was less than 1 percent, the unemployment rate was less than 3 percent, the interest on an FHA home loan, 4 percent. Kennedy and Johnson [were] in office 8 years together, the average inflation rate about 2 percent. When Lyndon Johnson went out of office and Nixon went in, the unemployment rate was 3.3 percent, and Nixon inherited from Johnson a balanced budget.\n"", ""But the point is we'll never have a balanced budget—we'll never have an end to this inflationary spiral as long as we have 7 1/2 or 8 million people out of work who are looking for jobs. That must be changed, and it will be changed next year. The American people are not selfish, but they want to feel that they are treated fairly. They don't want a special favor, but there are a lot of ways that this government under the Republican Administrations has not been fair.\n"", ""Our tax structure—it's not fair. The surest income to be taxed is the income earned from manual labor. On an average, a family that makes over a million dollars a year pays a lower percentage of their income in taxes than does a family that makes less than $10,000 a year. In the last reporting period, there were 3,200 people in this country that made over $50,000 a year and paid no taxes. Over 800 made more than $100,000 and paid no taxes. About 250 made over $200,000 and paid not a nickel in income taxes. And when they don't pay their taxes, the ones who pay them are the ones who can find no hidden loopholes in the laws.\n"", ""So we need tax reform to make it fair. And if I'm elected in November, and I intend to be, next January we're going to have comprehensive tax reform to make it fair for a change, and you can depend on that, too.\n"", ""The last point I want to make is this. I was in Detroit the day before yesterday, and I made a speech about crime. The high crime rates are a symptom of a sick society. And our crime rates are very high. In the last 8 years, they've gone up more than 55 percent. In the last 2 years alone, the serious crime rates have gone up 27 percent. There are a lot of reasons—I won't make a whole speech on that—but we have lost respect for the government aspect of enforcing the law. The highest law enforcement in this country is the Attorney General. Under this Nixon-Ford Administration, we've had two Attorneys General who were indicted and convicted of serious crimes, and we've seen brought on our government a continual series of disgraces. The average person feels that they're not treated fairly under our present system of justice. If an average working family had a young man caught with some marijuana or involved in a hit and run accident, that young man would likely go to prison. If a powerful or rich person had the same thing happen to one of his children, the chances are that child would never see the inside of a prison. The rich, the powerful, the constant criminal quite often can escape. When I became Governor of Georgia, there was a drug pusher in Atlanta who had been indicted 52 times. He had been convicted over half those times. He had never spent a day in prison, and only after a young white boy died in a home with an overdose of heroin, did that criminal finally go to spend the first day in prison.\n"", ""I'm not a lawyer, but I know the reason and the need for better respect for the law, better administration in our courts, clearer, briefer but surer sentences, quicker trials and a commitment to backing our police officers and also a commitment on the part of society at all levels to support enforcement of the law.\n"", 'Not too long ago, Mr. Ford went down to Miami to make a speech to the police chiefs of our country and to a great deal of applause, he said, ""If I am elected President, beginning next year, I\'m going to have a 100 day program of crusade against crime."" Mr. Ford has been in office 800 days; he\'s got another hundred days between now and next January. He\'s going to make full use of it because he\'ll be through, but he ought to do something about crime now instead of waiting until next year.\n', ""I want to say just one thing about foreign affairs. We've lost our commitment as a government not as a nation to basic human rights. I never thought I would see the President of our country refuse to see a man who epitomizes the search for human freedom. But Mr. Ford, under the pressure of his Secretary of State and the Soviet Union, refused to welcome to the White House Alexander Solzhenitsyn. I intend to win in November, and when I am elected and go to the White House next January, I'm going to invite Alexander Solzhenitsyn to come by and see me.\n"", ""In the debate last week on foreign affairs, Mr. Ford said unequivocally on two occasions, and he reconfirmed it with his Press Secretary the following morning and again 2 days later, that Eastern Europe was not under the domination of the Soviet Union—that Poland and other countries were autonomous and free. Now after 5 or 6 days, he said he misspoke. I happen to know that as long as 15 or 20 years ago, Mr. Ford had this same belief—that Eastern Europe was free of Soviet domination. I think our country is a kind of beacon light that ought to provide a concept of what freedom is. We know that Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, East Germany are not free, and those who have been there, and I'm one of them, have seen the Berlin Wall, not only in Berlin but all down the separation between East and West Germany. It's a horrible sight, particularly out in the open fields where swaths have been cut through the forests and a high steel fence with guardposts are there and concrete barricades so that no truck or pickup truck or automobile can possibly crash through the fence. This separates the free world from the other world, and it's a devastating blow to those who have suffered from a lack of freedom not to know that the President of the United States recognizes their plight and at least serves as a place where they can trade, as a place where Radio Free Europe can talk to them, and Radio Liberty, and where an enforcement of the Helsinki Agreement can be assured. We've not had that kind of leadership in recent days, in recent weeks, in recent months, but it must be restored, and if I am elected in November, and I intend to be, next January, we will once again be a beacon light for human rights throughout the world, and you can depend on that.\n"", 'We\'ve seen the first demonstration in our nation\'s history of permitting foreign countries to circumvent our Constitution and our Bill of Rights with the Arab boycott. A lot of people think the Arab boycott concerns oil. It\'s not an embargo of oil. The Arab boycott means that Arab countries tell American businesses, ""You can\'t trade with us unless you sign a paper saying that you have not and will not trade with Israel, that you have not and will not trade with us if American Jews either own your company or help to manage it and that you have not and will not buy any spare parts from a company which may have traded with Israel."" The President of the United States and his top officers in the government have fought legislation that would eliminate that disgraceful and disgusting practice. American businesses have been forced to yield. Now I intend to win in November, and when I go to the White House next January, the Arab boycott will stop, and you can depend on it.\n', ""The last thing I want to say to you is this: Did any of you watch the debate last night? Our polls that I have heard from today showed that Senator Mondale was an overwhelming winner. He makes me jealous. He did so well it makes me jealous, and I'd like to point out to you that he epitomizes to me a concept of the Democratic Party. The first responsibility I had was to choose a Vice Presidential running mate. The first responsibility Mr. Ford had after the nomination was to choose a Vice Presidential running mate, and I believe that any American watching the debate last night could assess the difference in the quality of those two men. I would trust Walter Mondale to be President in a minute, and I'm very, very proud of him, and I told him last night I was. This is a country that cries out for competence; it cries out for compassion; it cries out for restoration of our principles and our beliefs and our commitments to a standard of excellence and greatness that will make us all proud again.\n"", ""I see no reason why the President and the Congress can't cooperate, mutually respecting the constitutional delineation of authority. I see no reason why the federal, state and local levels of government can't recognize once again that the officials there represent exactly the same constituents. I see no reason why we can't bind together once again our nation's wounds and pull the different kinds of Americans together in a spirit of unity and strength because we still have a country that's built up on diversity. That's not a sign of weakness. The United States is not a melting pot because, when people come here, they don't give up their individuality or their ethnic history or commitment to backgrounds and all become the same. The United States is much more like a mosaic of different colors put together in a pattern that makes a source of inspiration. It doesn't matter when we came here— 2 years ago, 20 years ago, 200 years ago—that doesn't matter. What matters is why we came here and what we do after we come. But I can tell you we can lose all these things I've described to you—competence, compassion, fair taxes, system of justice, management, health care—if we don't shape the outcome of the election November 2.\n"", ""Now, you are not running for President, and I'm glad you're not, but it's just as much your country as it is mine, and if you care about your country, if we've made mistakes that you never want to see made again, if there are difficult questions that you want to see answered, if you don't want to be ashamed of our government, if there are hopes or dreams or aspirations in your own lives or lives of your children that you'd like to see realized, I hope this next 2 1/2 weeks that you as leaders will make a sacrificial effort to turn out the people in your state to vote, to work, to shape the future of your own lives and your own families and your own country. Because I want to see us in this 2OOth birthday of our country prove to the rest of the world, that's very important, but more importantly, prove to our own people who live here that we still live in the greatest nation on earth.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
103,Jimmy Carter ,"October 16, 1976","[""Governor Carter. Yesterday afternoon, I sent President Gerald Ford a telegram and I'd like to read it to you and then answer questions."", 'To President Gerald Ford:\n', 'You have made erroneous statements about my positions on several issues. First, I do not advocate increasing income taxes on low or middle income families. Second, I do not advocate eliminating the existing homeowner income tax benefits. Third, I do not advocate new spending programs which would cost anything near $100 billion. My pledge is to have a balanced budget by 1980, fiscal year 1981, and to phase in new programs only as funds become available through an expanding economy and improved government management. Fourth, I do not advocate a $15 billion reduction in the defense budget. My projected savings from efficiency and elimination of waste is from $5 billion to $7 billion. Knowing your belief in integrity I am sure that after these corrections you will refrain from making these misleading and erroneous statements to the American people.', 'Signed, Jimmy Carter.', ""I'd be glad to answer any questions you might have on this or any other issue."", ""Q. [Question on President Ford's press conference statements.]"", 'Carter. Because I noticed that in the press conference that Mr. Ford called, and for which he got full news media coverage, that he made these false statements as part of his apparently prepared effort, and I think it was highly misleading for him to say that without my having an adequate chance to respond. And this is the first opportunity to prepare . . . and I want him to get the telegram before I announce it to the press. So I think this is the earliest time that I had a chance.', 'Q. [Question on people who work for a living, taxes, low moderate income people.]', ""Carter. Let me answer it this way. One kind of reform, in fact the only one that comes to my mind right now, is the person who uses tax shelters, where the income is actually excluded from taxation by a legal, legally authorized trick. If someone earns $100,000 from salary, and reports all their income on the income tax forms, doesn't use a tax shelter, then I would guess that their tax rate would be substantially reduced in a tax reform effort."", 'Q. [Question on mortgage interest and property tax deductions.]', ""Carter. No. The mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction would be maintained. It's now about $12 billion total. About half of it goes to property tax credits, about half of it goes for interest payment credits. That amount would be retained. If any change was made it would be to shift the credit toward the low and middle income families who are buying their first homes. The amount, though, I think is adequate. I wouldn't reduce it. I promised not to do that. For those who are buying a second or third home, that benefit may be decreased because I think it's best to have the major incentive for building homes go to those who are buying their first home, and who need the money most. Now this has been a matter of confusion since the first League of Women Voters debate way back before the New Hampshire primary. I clarified that statement completely, I think, in the second League of Women Voters debate in Miami. And I'm glad to get it clear."", 'Q. [Question on tax shelter exceptions.]', ""Carter. The only exception I can think of now is the tax shelter provision. I would not, for instance, remove the right to make charitable contributions. I think that ought to be continued. My major thrust will be to eliminate the loopholes that permit people to get an unwarranted advantage. And as I said several times, perhaps it was a confusing statement, but the fact that those who do work for a living, whether it's on a salary or by the hour, and who have reported all their tax for income—all their income for tax purposes—would not have an increase."", 'Q. . . . Are you calling for dramatic tax reform? How can you pick and choose and have a total tax reform . . . tax rate?', ""Carter. I've just described it as best I can. I won't write for you this morning a complete income tax code. But if you would clarify your question I would try to answer it"", 'Q. Would you suggest a basic lowering of the tax rate?', ""Carter. I would guess the tax rates would be lowered throughout the entire gamut of income. One aspect which I have not adopted completely was based on my long discussions with several tax people, and it was that at the top level the income tax rate would be reduced from 70 percent to 50 percent, at the lower level it would be reduced from about 14 percent to 10 percent. That reduction in rates would come from the elimination of existing loopholes that I've described."", 'Q. How about the middle income rates?', ""Carter. Well, it would be reduced commensurately. I believe if you would get a pencil and paper and compute that you'd see that there was about a 40 percent reduction at the lower level and approximately the same, about a 30 percent, at the upper level. So I would guess the middle range—$15,000 to $20,000—would have a commensurate reduction of about 35 percent in the rate of taxation."", 'Q. [Question on television time.]', ""Carter. There is no provision in the law about equal time when you are running against an incumbent President. But I will reserve the right, under the fairness doctrine, to ask for full coverage at a later date, if I have an announcement to make, similar in importance to Mr. Ford's repetition of Mr. . . . not investigating his income tax problems. And if I think that I ought to be cross-examined about my statement. But the equal time does not apply. But I reserve the right to appeal for time under the fairness doctrine at a later time."", 'Q. [Question on $15 billion defense savings.]', ""Carter. I don't recall ever making that statement. Ken Rich, who is a very careful reporter, said once when I was being interviewed by the L.A. Times editorial board that I used it. Is that correct, Ken? In San Diego in a casual exchange. I don't recall that I can't deny that I ever said that. I think that Congressman Udall and others were using a $15 billion figure during the New Hampshire primary'. About a year and a half ago, I went to Washington to meet with a group of my own Defense Department advisors. And we went down a list of advisable savings and the amount of reduction in defense expenditures that would result from efficiency and elimination of waste, and duplication, was $5 to $7 million. In my memory of the whole campaign, at least going back to the year and a half, I've used the 5 percent or $5 to $7 billion figure, but I can't say unequivocally that I have never mentioned the $15 billion figure. I don't remember it; but I can't dispute the word of Ken Rich, prior to the time when I actually did an analysis of it."", ""Q. [Question on Carter's showing in recent polls.]"", ""Carter. Well, we're campaigning more since then in the western states. That's a kind of an old poll thing. I think the latest CBS and New York Times polls show a different result And it's hard for me to say. The poll returns have been sometimes in conflict. I would say volatile is the best word for them. Our own polls show that we have strengthened our support in some of the western states, like in California, where the last poll we ran showed 7 to 8 percent advantage. Our poll showed that we picked up substantially in this region of the country, including Illinois. I think a recent Chicago Sun Times poll shows I had approximately a 10 percent advantage in Illinois, which is a great improvement over what we had projected. But I don't know how to answer your question about why do we slip in a certain part of the country and why do we gain in another. Ever since the Republican Convention, I think our lead has been approximately 8, 9, 10, 11 percent. And I think almost all the polls that I have seen—all the ones I have seen—show that my own strength has been going more solid. But the only poll that really counts is November 2, and I can't really answer your question."", 'Q. President Ford accused you of using different accents before different audiences. What type of accent do you plan to use during the next 2 or 3 days?', ""Carter. I didn't know I had more than one accent. As a matter of fact I can't detect any accent at all. I'm too deeply involved in my own voice mannerisms to detect any accent."", 'Q. He said you sounded like Ralph Nader at one point . . .', ""Carter. Well, that's a little bit more than accent. You know most of this group here follows me everywhere, and they've never been reluctant to point out discrepancies when I do make them."", 'Q. [Question on removal of atomic weapons from . . . countries such as South Korea...]', ""Carter. No. I prefer not to name other countries. South Korea is as far as I want to go. We have in Europe now 6,000 to 7,000 atomic weapons. Some of them are obsolete. They're widely disbursed throughout the NATO countries. They ought to be maintained in adequate strength expressed in atomic weapons in the NATO area. In South Korea, I think we ought to withdraw all of our atomic weapons. We now have in excess of 600 there. They're quite vulnerable, if there was a drastic military operation in South Korea. I don't foresee the possibility that we would use them in a localized war that might erupt in South Korea. I certainly hope it won't and don't expect it to. I talked about this to several people who are, perhaps, certainly more knowledgeable than I, including former Secretary James Schlesinger. He agrees with that position. I don't believe that the withdrawal of atomic weapons from South Korea would encourage Japan to become a nuclear power. And I think that the Japanese people are absolutely committed against that and the Japanese Government has not yet signed the nonproliferation treaty. But I think they could be induced to do so if we took actions that I described in my nonproliferation talk I also favor the withdrawal of our ground troops from South Korea. I might add without speaking for him that Mr. Schlesinger agrees with this position as well and so does the President of South Korea, Mr. Park. This would be done over a period of 4 or 5 years. And it would be after consultation with the Japanese and South Koreans. I would like, during that interim period, to strengthen at least, the armored forces of South Korea. Their ground forces now—infantry—are superior to North Korea's, in our opinion. And I would continue to maintain after that period of time adequate tactical air cover to help South Korea if they were attacked by North Korea. There are many places around the world where we have atomic weapons. I don't want to comment on which specific countries I think they should not be located in."", 'Q. [Question on withdrawal of U.S. forces.]', ""Carter. My understanding is that your statement is not correct. But I can't vouch for that But I would certainly, through normal diplomatic channels, confer with them or at least they obviously would know about it because it would be a very careful, methodical, and not a secret withdrawal. Did I answer your question, sir?"", ""Q. Governor Carter, in your talk about the People's Republic of China, and particularly Formosa..."", ""Carter. Well, we are bound by a treaty to guarantee the freedom of Formosa, Taiwan, the Republic of China. I would like to improve our relationships—diplomatic relationships with the People's Republic of China, and mainland China, hopefully leading to normalization of diplomatic relations sometime in the future. But I wouldn't go back on the commitment that we've had to assure that Taiwan is protected from military takeover. I hope that we could have the same sort of general arrangement that has been worked out with other countries; they vary to some degree. Canada, Japan, Australia, and others have tried to work this out. That's a difficult question for me to answer because I don't think anyone knows the answer. The People's Republic of China is adamant in saying that there is only one China. The Republic of China on Taiwan is adamant in saying that there's only one China. We have ratified that concept by saying that we adopt the proposition that there is only one China. Of course both those Chinas claim that they are the one. But I would like to see us obtain from the People's Republic a pledge that there would be no military reaction against Taiwan. I don't know if that will be possible or not. It's impossible for me to project that far into the future."", 'Q. Do you accept the principles of the Shanghai [Agreement]?', ""Carter. Yes, I do. But I want to point out to you, unnecessarily, I'm sure, that there's a deliberate avoidance there of which is the true China. And I don't want to try to decide that myself since the parties to this Shanghai Agreement couldn't decide."", 'Q. Second debate ... President Ford.. .do you think Gerald Ford is smart enough to be President?', ""Carter. Well, he is President, and I think that's the proof that he's smart enough to be President. I personally have never thought that that was a blunder; I thought it was a mistake for him to say it, but I think that was not a slip of the tongue. I think that Mr. Ford actually believed that Eastern Europe was not under the domination of the Soviet Union. And as you know, it took him almost a week before he would change his position. I'm sure, because of the pressure from public opinion, and the pressure from his own staff. But I have never thought that that was a slip of the tongue or that he misspoke himself. I think he stated what he actually thought. And I think that what he thought was in error."", 'Q. [Question on Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.]', 'Carter. I would never recognize that the Soviet Union had a right to continue their domination of Eastern Europe. I would recognize that it exists, but it ought not to exist. I would demand in a reassessment of the Helsinki Agreement that the Soviet Union live up to their so-called Basket Three agreements which permitted freer expression within the Eastern European area, freer movement of people who want to leave, the right of families to reunite, the right of access to the outside world. I would demand that the Soviet Union cease jamming Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, and I would make available at every opportunity trade opportunities— tourist exchange, student exchange, cultural exchanges—with Eastern European countries. I would cease to treat them as a uniform block which has been the attitude of this administration. I would renounce immediately the so-called Sonnenfeldt Doctrine that says that there is an organic link between these individual countries and the Soviet Union. Those are some of the things that I think could be done with effectiveness.', 'Q. [Question on U.S. military involvement in internal affairs of another country.]', 'Carter. I have said many times that I would never become militarily involved in the internal affairs of another country unless I thought our own security was at stake. And I would not consider our own security at stake if a military action was initiated by Hungary or Poland or East Germany or Czechoslovakia against the Soviet Union.', 'Q. [Inaudible.]', ""Carter. No, that's not the case. That's a reduction in the tax rate."", 'Q. [Inaudible.]', 'Carter. That computation, which was done by men and women in Brookings Institution, takes as a supposition that the total federal income from income taxes would not change.', 'Q. You do not think the American people will be paying less [inaudible]?', ""Carter. American citizens who work for a living and who report all their income for tax purposes would pay less. Those who now enjoy the option of not paying any income taxes, like Ford Motor Company, would certainly pay more. But the computation that was done by Mr. Pechman, and I'm sure he'll be glad for you to give him a call, I don't stand behind all his figures because I haven't talked to him, is that if you eliminated the unwarranted special tax exemptions and privileges, sometimes known as loopholes, that that would save enough to reduce the tax rate by the amount that he specified, which was about 35 or 40 percent across the board. I'm not pledging myself to that exact reduction. That's an estimate that has been computed by the Brookings Institution."", 'Q. You have in effect said that President Ford misrepresented your views on, for example, taxes . . . change your mind after last week?', ""Carter. No. I've never advocated that we eliminate the mortgage credits."", 'Q. In response to a question at the [Presidential] forum to which you referred...', 'Carter. I think if you read a transcript of the question and the answer, the question is very confusing. It was a long question of, I guess, 150 to 200 words, and that was—my response was—that was the kind of thing that I would consider changing. But immediately when the question was raised, I think the following day, I spelled out, after getting the information about it, that answer that I gave you this morning.', 'Q. Vice Presidential debates... more exciting...', ""Carter. I've never watched the Presidential debates so I can't respond. More exciting? I hadn't heard that comment, but it was very interesting and exciting to me."", ""Q. [Inaudible.] You don't believe Gerald Ford misspoke, you believe he does not think that Eastern Europe is under domination . . .?"", ""Carter. I don't particularly, but I'll defer to your judgment as far as your own opinion is concerned."", 'Q. Do you think that Gerald Ford had anything to do with the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine...?', ""Carter. I can't answer that question. As you know, Mr. Sonnenfeldt has been a top adviser for Mr. Kissinger. And the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine was never repudiated, as far as I know, by Mr. Kissinger. I don't know what Mr. Ford's position is on the Sonnenfeldt Doctrine."", 'Q. What will be your attitude toward Cuba, particularly in light . . .', ""Carter. I don't see any immediate prospect for the normalization of relationships with Cuba. And I don't advocate that as a goal for our country in the foreseeable future. Mr. Castro has never requested or suggested the advisability of normal relationships with our country. He's made several pledges which he has violated. One is to be a peaceful nation; and obviously he's sent troops to Angola, among other countries in Africa. He's promised not to interfere with the internal affairs of Western Hemispheric countries, but he's been in the forefront of demanding independence, for instance, for Puerto Rico. I think he also still has an aggressive attitude in some other countries throughout South America. So for all those reasons including this latest unpredictable occurrence which you described, I don't see any prospect of us normalizing relationships with him. I think you probably know that the OAS took down some of the barriers for the 23 nations in that organization, to trade with Cuba on an individual basis. Each country can do as it chooses. We've decided not to trade with Cuba directly, but I think we do permit some American corporations to trade with Cuba through other countries. And I don't see any prospect of changing that basic approach now."", 'Q. Soviet Union ... domination in Europe .. .is one of the countries now dominated by the Soviet Union. What expressly would you support military intervention in order to insure liberty...?', ""Carter. I think publicly I've already given a list of things that I think would be appropriate in case of an uprising which I think would be highly unlikely—a military uprising. I can't describe to you exactly what we would do. It would depend on the nature of the uprising, the country involved, the degree to which they had achieved, over a long period of time, any of their own independence. I have said already in speeches that it would be a deplorable situation, for instance, for Russia to make any move into Yugoslavia which is relatively independent of the Soviet Union. Following Tito's ... is no longer independent of the Soviet Union as well. Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, are highly dominated by the Soviet Union. I wouldn't want to make a statement about what I would do 2 or 3 or 4 or 8 years in the future if that should occur. I don't know what I would do at the time. But I would not send American troops in, I can't imagine us becoming involved in a war if the Polish or East German people decided they wanted to be free."", 'Q. Supposing the Soviet Union moved into Yugoslavia. What would you do in that case?', ""Carter. I can't answer that question. I cannot answer that question. I would not go to war in Yugoslavia."", 'Q. [Inaudible.]', 'Carter. Yes.', 'Thank you very much.']"
104,Jimmy Carter ,"October 18, 1976","['Q. What level of research and development funding would your administration recommend? How would it be divided among defense, space, and civilian sectors? Should national R. & D. funding be linked to some percentage of gross national product? And what is an appropriate balance of federal funding for basic research, applied research, and development?\n', 'Governor Carter. The federal budget for research and development should not be reduced, but is unlikely to be expanded dramatically because of resource constraints. Nevertheless, there is a great opportunity to rebalance expenditures in such a way as to stabilize the long-term commitment to the basic research foundations on which all technology rests, to increase the priority given to research in fields likely to be of long-term economic importance, and to give proper attention to environmental, health, and other civil concerns, including applied research important in global problems. This can be done at the expense of some development and demonstration programs and other direct federal operations that should better be carried out with private funds.\n', ""The level of national research and development effort, public and private, should be growing with the economy. In recent years it has in fact been falling, as economic growth has sagged and the federal government's research and development strategy has fallen into disarray. This trend must be reversed. But it is wrong to tie research and development expenditures to a fixed fraction of any macroeconomic indicator, for research and development is a microeconomic activity. It is a means to an end, and the level of investment follows the ability of organizations to use it effectively. Thus, at the national level attention must be given to creating the conditions that encourage high-risk, high-payoff industrial.activity, and that motivate both public and private sector institutions to do the research that will best protect the long-term future of the country.\n"", 'Q. What specific areas of research and development would your administration emphasize? Deemphasize? And how would you rank in priority research and development efforts needed to solve national problems such as energy, environment, and health?\n', 'Governor Carter. As indicated above, research and development emphasis is of two kinds: policies and incentives for private research and development and direct investment by the federal government. The federal government should use both approaches to providing a stronger economy and national capability to manage risks, protect the environment, and accomplish the other needed goals. In some areas of federal research and development investment the problem is not inadequate funds, but poorly managed programs. Internal priority shifts are necessary.\n', 'There are a number of areas in which specific research and development efforts need strengthening. Examples include earthquake prediction, arms control research, and research to provide a more quantitative basis for determining risk to human health and well-being from substances and environments (such as noise) of many types. In many areas of federal regulatory activity, there are lacking the kind of hard quantitative data on the basis of which to make sound regulatory policy.\n', ""A few areas of science and technology need a new commitment of national attention. One example is the scientific basis for the enhancement and improvement of nutritional quality of food supplies for all the world's people. Here the primary need is to share what we know. In defense and space research and development we must insure that our efforts are of very high quality and sustain the levels of technical leadership that are essential.\n"", ""Q. What programs or policies would your administration recommend to insure continuity of funding for science and technology to prevent peaks and valleys in technical training and employment as well as a sustained real growth in the nation's science and technology effort? Should such programs be different for the industrial and academic communities?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Rapid fluctuations in demand for research and development are particularly difficult to accommodate. Such fluctuations are wasteful of a priceless national human resource. On the industrial side the essential requirement is a stable economy with low unemployment. Research and development is a risk investment, and is made when companies have confidence in the future. Incentives for private investment in research and development should emphasize the power of research and development to permit innovation. When a business downturn occurs, countercyclical encouragement to innovation can help provide the basis for long-term strength in the economy.\n', 'In academic research, fluctuations in support result from the impact of economic cycles on government revenues, and thus on resources for public investment, and changes in the program content of federal agencies funding research. Since the federal government has direct or indirect responsibilities in both areas, federal leadership is needed to stabilize the research base in universities. The director of OSTP [Office of Science and Technology Policy] must work with OMB [Office of Management and Budget] to insure that the aggregate impact of all federal research and development programs is well managed.\n', 'Q. Should the US. have a coherent overall science and technology policy? Should there be a Cabinet-level Department of Science and Technology, in addition to the new White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to provide centralized funding and management of the federal end of the national research and development effort? Or is the existing federal science apparatus adequate?\n', 'Governor Carter. Certainly, the U.S. Government should have a coherent overall science and technology policy. The lack of a mechanism for generating such a policy in the past 4 years has sown waste and confusion across the national scientific scene.\n', 'The question is, ""How much pulling together of technical agency activities is desirable?"" The mission-oriented agencies should certainly continue to operate laboratories and fund or cost-share research and development outside government as the prudent, efficient, and responsible way to carry out their missions. Such technical programs should not be separated from their end purposes and drawn together.\n', 'It also may be desirable to give more central authority and resources to agencies concerned with the health and vigor of the national scientific and technological enterprise. Finally, there are some glaring weaknesses in the present structure, for example in the ability of the federal agencies to contribute to the civil economy, or to carry out commitments that derive from foreign policy.\n', 'Q. In what ways do you see the federal government able to play a role in technological innovation? Further, what role, in terms of tax incentives, patent policy, and the like, should the federal government play in relation to research and development in private industry?\n', 'Governor Carter. First, the federal government should set a good example, by using its own purchasing power to encourage innovative products and services that can increase the efficiency of government. The small program on Experimental Technology Incentives (ETIP) in the National Bureau of Standards has demonstrated the power of this approach.\n', 'Next, attention must be given to the special circumstance surrounding the most fertile ground for innovation, the small technologically oriented firm financed with venture capital. It has been over a decade since the ""Charpie Report"" looked into this question, and still many of its recommendations lie unimplemented. The area should be looked at again to see what must be done in the present business and technology climate.\n', 'Another area requiring attention is federal patent policy which all too often either reduces the incentive of private investors to attempt to exploit the results of federal research and development commercial markets, or simply prevents the firms with the most technical capability from wishing to participate in federal programs. Finally, tax, trade, and antitrust policy must be managed so they encourage research and development and innovation.\n', 'Q. Should a sort of science court be set up to adjudicate scientific and technological issues? Further, what should (should not) be the role of the federal government in the setting up and perpetuation of such an apparatus?\n', 'Governor Carter. If by science court we mean competent institutions that make objective evaluations of scientific evidence, uncertainty and risk, undertaken in the open for public view, I would support the idea.\n', 'There is a clear need for better and more public policy determinations and the development of institutions for making the basis of such determinations clear.\n', 'Q. Should individual chemical companies or other corporate entities be permitted under the antitrust statutes to cooperate and coordinate their research and development programs in the solving of national problems such as energy or environment?\n', 'Governor Carter. This would have to be considered on a case-by-case basis. In nonproprietary research, if cooperation is necessary and would have a beneficial effect on competition, I would consider it However, in no case would I approve of this approach if it had the effect of eliminating or decreasing competition in the private sector.\n', 'Q. What role do you see US. research and development playing in solutions to US. balance-of-trade problems? Should there be close government control over export and licensing of US. science and technology, in general, and in sensitive areas such as nuclear equipment and technology, in particular?\n', 'Governor Carter. U.S. foreign trade performance is, above all, a measure of the internal strength of the U.S. economy in comparison with the economies of our main trading partners. In this comparison the figures since 1968 are serious cause for concern. U.S. improvements in productivity lag behind the rates in Japan and many European countries. The percentage of the work force engaged in research and development continues to rise in those countries; it has been declining in the United States since 1969.\n', 'More and more frequently we have seen major inroads by foreign competitors in areas of traditional strength in the United States. (But the right policy for the United States is not to copy the policies of foreign governments, but is to take steps to strengthen the competitiveness of the domestic U.S. economy.) This strength is greatest in the areas of most rapid technical progress. Agriculture, civil aviation, and computers are all examples.\n', 'There are circumstances, especially in technology of military significance and in critical materials areas, in which a government policy concerning exports and imports is justified. Our government should react with appropriate firmness to other governments that intervene to our disadvantage. What we should do is adopt those domestic policies—in education, science, economic policy—that are most likely to keep U.S. industry ahead, and give careful attention to the dislocation of the labor force that accompanies rapid technological change.\n', 'Q. There is a growing feeling that some of the current legislation and regulations to implement enacted legislation aimed at curbing pollution, safeguarding the environment, and so forth, is either too heavy-handed or cast in such broad terms as to be either meaningless or too subject to arbitrary interpretation. What is your view?\n', 'Governor Carter. There is no doubt that a few federal regulatory programs produce few real benefits to the public while exacting a cost to the economy. However, properly managed and structured, regulation not only should meet its purpose of protecting the public interests but also provide incentives to innovation.\n', 'Too often the rules are hard to interpret, government policy is too unpredictable and unstable, compliance is indifferently enforced. The most serious shortcoming of regulation is that it often fails to relate the social and economic costs of the goals to objective measures of benefit. Indeed, often the reduction of risk in one area is achieved at the expense of enhanced risk in another. Improvements in the regulatory process would come from reorganization. Above all, more objective scientific fact determination is needed, so policies can be soundly based.\n', 'Q. What views do you have on reform of the US. patent system, particularly as it affects individual inventors or wider licensing of US. technology? Are existing federal programs to transfer technology developed at government expense to private industry or other sectors of the economy adequate? What further efforts in this area might you propose? And how would your administration view exclusive licensing to industry of federally owned patents? Should there be some form of compensation to the government and should government-employed inventors of such licensed technology receive some form of compensation?\n', 'Governor Carter. I realize that the present U.S. patent system has some severe difficulties in regard to inventors, users, and recipients of technology. I have not yet made a detailed study of the system, but I plan to do so in the near future. Until that time, I would like to withhold any judgment on this matter.\n', 'Your suggestion on private licensing of government-owned patents is provocative. If it can be determined that such a system would encourage and increase competition in the private sector, I would be willing to consider it. I would have to study the matter of consideration for government-employed inventors from a personnel management perspective.\n', 'Q. How do you view the current level of effort in the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety & Health Administration to regulate toxic chemicals? Should the effort be increased and, if so, in what fashion?\n', ""Governor Carter. We must do more to guarantee each and every American the right to a safe and healthy place of work. More than 600 toxic chemicals are introduced into our workplace annually. There are currently more than 13,000 already listed. Nearly 100,000 working people die each year from occupational illnesses and accidents. More than 17,000 disabling injuries have occurred in our nation's mines. This terrible toll cannot be tolerated.\n"", 'I believe the basic concept behind OSHA is excellent. We should continue to clarify and expand the state role in the implementation of health and safety. OSHA must be strengthened to ensure that those who earn their living by personal labor can work in safe and healthy environments.\n', ""The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 should cover all employees and be enforced as intended when the law was enacted. However, early and periodic review of the Act's provisions should be made to ensure that they are reasonable and workable. I would look favorably on developing means to provide technical assistance and information to employers to encourage compliance with the Act.\n"", 'The control of occupational hazards can save many workers each year who die prematurely because they are exposed to toxic chemicals, dust, pesticides, unsafe machinery, and other dangerous conditions. Nationwide efforts in this area should continue until our working citizens are safe in their jobs.']"

How many of you believe it is worthwhile to change the President and to have a good country once again? [cheers and applause]\n"", 'I want you to think back for a few minutes about two dates. One of them is 1960 when John Fitzgerald Kennedy ran against Richard Nixon for President. The margin of victory for Kennedy over Nixon was very narrow. Had just a few people not voted for John Kennedy, we would never have had the Civil Rights Act, we would never have had the Voting Rights Act, our country would have been different, and none of you would have had the freedom that you now have. So that election was very important.\n', ""And the next election that was important was 1968, when the election went the wrong way. And I think you all know [cheers] that in 1969, in January, Lyndon Johnson left the White House; Richard Nixon moved in. The laws didn't change. The Congress didn't change. But the country changed. Right? [cheers] It changed because the President changed.\n"", ""Now it's time to have another change in January to get Gerald Ford out and to get a Democrat back in the White House. [cheers]\n"", ""In the last 2 years, since President Ford has been in the White House, we've had 2 1/2 million Americans become unemployed. In the last 4 months, we've had 500,000 Americans who've become unemployed. In the last 8 months now, the inflation rate has doubled. The growth of our country has been cut in half. We have an unemployment rate of 8 percent among all Americans, 15 to 20 percent among black Americans, 60 percent among young Americans who speak Spanish or are black. We've got to change that and put our people back to work.\n"", ""As I drove into Harlem from the airport, I saw a lot of houses empty, I saw a lot of buildings that have been tom down to build houses. While Richard Nixon was President, he stopped the housing program. We've now got 136,000 residents of New York City who have made applications for a home and can't get a home. In the last 8 years, the price of the average American home has doubled and people who want to rent houses now can't get them. We need to put our housing industry back to work, our people building houses back to work, and American families back in their own homes, and we cannot do that with a Republican in the White House. I need you to help me change that. Okay? [cheers and applause]\n"", ""Now there is a very important thing to remember. Making these changes is not going to be easy. I don't want to mislead you about it. We can't change them overnight. But we can make a start. And all of you know that it wasn't easy when Martin Luther King, Jr., Adam Clayton Powell and many others started seeking the right of black people to have a chance to vote. And nowadays, you have a legal right to vote. In your area you registered 400,000 new voters. But the one thing that we still haven't got yet is the people's commitment to go out on November 2 and cast their vote to change this country. As I say, it's not going to be easy. I want to form a partnership with you. You help me on November 2, I'll help you next January to get some jobs, to get some housing that you need. [cheers]\n"", ""As all of you know, in the communities of our country all over the nation where the unemployment rate is highest, that's where the education system is the worst. And that's where the housing is the worst. That's where health care does not exist. And that's where the crime rate is the highest. Most of the crimes are committed against poor people. And unfortunately by poor people. Now one of the main reasons for the increase in the crime rate is our young people don't have jobs. And obviously the best way to control crime is to put our young people back to work and that will be one of my major objectives next year. [cheers]\n"", ""This is a country that believes in obeying the law. But we've got to have strong families. In the last 8 years we've seen a breakdown in the family structure. When government had to come in is when the mother and the father and the children don't have a tight knit, family organization within their own apartment or within their own home. And when a young person is forced out on the street, 18 or 19 years old, because they don't qualify for welfare, they don't qualify for unemployment compensation, they don't qualify for Social Security. Even if that's the best young person in the world, they are led, quite often, to a life of crime [cheers]. Now unemployment is not an excuse for crime, but it's a reason for crime. And I believe that you know in Harlem, that one of the worst things we have that affects our young people is the drug problem [cheers]. Ninety percent of all the heroin in our country comes in from Mexico. In the last few years, we've not had a good relationship with South and Central America. We've not had a good relationship with the President of Mexico, Mr. Luis Echeverria Alvarez, because President Nixon and President Ford didn't care about South America, didn't care about Central America, and the friendship that we used to have has been lost. We have a new President coming into office in Mexico. He's going to be sworn in in December. His name is Mr. Jose Lopez Portillo.

She has about 20 black classmates; she's got about 10 white classmates. She's getting a good eduction. But in many ways, particularly in our urban areas, President Ford and President Nixon have cut down on the federal contribution to the education system. Eight years ago, the federal government paid 10 percent of the cost of education. These days, only 7 percent. That's a 30 percent reduction in education help from income taxes in the last 8 years.

We've also seen the Watergate disgrace, we've seen the CIA plotting assassinations, we've lost the respect of many of the developing nations of the world. And we've seen a lot of our people put out of work, the inflation robbing them, old people not cared for, inadequate health care, not enough housing, not enough transportation, not enough police protection, and these can be changed if we work together. It's not going to be easy. But I need you to help me these last 2 weeks. It's your country, just like it is mine.

It was a large crowd of people, the street, the sidewalks, the windows, the porches were covered with people. But there was kind of a spirit about it. A spirit of concern and hope at the same time. And a spirit of despair in ways, but anticipation in another. They told me that I was the first Democratic nominee who's been to campaign in Harlem since 1968.\n"", ""I thought about it a lot. But then I remembered that I'm the first Democratic nominee who ever campaigned in the State of Alabama, or in the State of Mississippi.

I began the twentieth day of January, 1975, so I'm finishing my twenty-second month tonight.\n"", ""In the last almost two years I've learned a lot about this country. And I've been places where candidates have never been before. And as many of you know having observed my campaign, when I began it I didn't have much money; I believe I had $43,000. And I didn't have a built-in campaign organization, and I didn't hold public office, and not many people knew who I was. I doubt if one of a hundred of you had ever heard my name. And I, my wife, and a few volunteers and my children began to go around the country. And we talked a little and we listened a lot.\n"", ""And we had to go where people already were because they wouldn't come when we invited them. We would invite a whole neighborhood to come to a living room, and maybe four people would show up. And we'd go to a labor hall that held 200, 300 people and only ten people would come. I remember once we had a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, a tremendous ballroom, about this large, and 3 people came. So we'd walk the streets, and barber shops and beauty parlors, and restaurants and stood in factory shift lines and went to farmers' markets, and livestock sale barns, and county courthouses and city halls, just to learn about our country and let them get to know us.\n"", ""We now have two weeks to go. And there's a great decision to be made. Tonight I want to talk to you a few minutes about the word federalism— it's one that I learned in grammar school about the proper interrelationship between the federal, state and local levels of government, and the people themselves; a businesslike, practical, mature commitment to the proposition that there needn't be a division between people and their government And there needn't be a division between local, state and federal levels of government, because those of us who are elected—mayors, governors, Congress, President—we all represent the same people. In recent years we've seen that concept partially destroyed, but it need not be.\n"", ""We face a clear cut choice this year between the past and the future. Between more of the same and a new beginning. The Republicans have no new ideas; they don't even pretend to. All they can say is, in effect, it can't be any better, so why worry about the election. Why worry about the government. And they imply that somehow or another we ought to fear progress. Or fear the future. But Americans have never feared progress and we've never feared the future. The American dream is based on a belief, and with hard work and good government we can build better lives and build a better nation for ourselves and for our children. More of the same economic problems that we've experienced means more unemployment. In the last four months we've had 500,000 more Americans become unemployed. In the last few years, since Richard Nixon left the White House, 2 1/2 million American families have gone on the unemployed rolls. It means more inflation; since the beginning of the year the inflation rate has doubled.\n"", ""This also means additional recession or additional human suffering. People like us don't suffer nearly as much as the ones to whom I talked in Harlem this afternoon. And in Winston-Salem this afternoon. And in Miami this morning, on the beach. And last night in Tampa. They come, having suffered when the unemployment rolls increase, because their families stand in line looking for a job. And they come having suffered when the unemployment rate rises, because they have to cut into their own personal expenses—food, clothing, housing. Most of us don't. And they come having suffered with a loss of a commitment to a nation and ideals and principles that have been damaged very seriously in the last eight years.\n"", ""The Republicans have had eight years to solve the problems of this nation, but they failed. I don't doubt that they tried. They've employed economic policies in which they believe. Their methods just didn't work. They didn't work under Herbert Hoover, they didn't work under Richard Nixon, and they're not working under Gerald Ford. [applause]\n"", ""By every measure of growth and stability and progress and the quality of life, our society is now worse than it was when Lyndon Johnson left the White House and Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford moved in. Yet all they offer us is more of the same. Their intentions may be good; I don't doubt that. But we can't settle for good intentions while the people of our country are out of work and inflation continues to climb, and our nation's economy grinds to a halt. We got the results today of an analysis of the gross national product. It's dropped more than half since January. We just can't stand four more years of stagnation. Our nation is crying out for leadership, and our nation is crying out for a concept of greatness.\n"", ""A great nation just can't stand still. If we're not moving forward, we're moving backward.

I was too young to participate but my first cousins did. And many of our neighbors did. I think about the REA when it turned on the electric lights in my house when I was fourteen years old. I think about the Marshall Plan under Truman, and aid to Turkey and Greece, and the United Nations, and the formation of the nation of Israel. I think about the Peace Corps in which my mother served when she was about 70 years old.

The problem isn't just economic, it's a matter of the spirit. We as a nation have been disillusioned, we've suffered too much, and [in] too short a time, the assassination of great political leaders—John Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr.—a tragic war, hidden deceitfully from the American people in the case of Cambodia, a national scandal, the resignation and disgrace of a President of the United States, and the Vice President of the United States.\n"", ""All of these things and others made millions of American people lose faith and trust in our own government.

107,Jimmy Carter ,"October 19, 1976","[""I was raised by a nurse. My mother this year is 78 years old. She has devoted her life to caring for other people. Nothing would please her better than to be here with you today; however, it happens to be Amy's birthday, and this takes precedence, I'm afraid, even over professional enjoyment.\n"", ""I'm thankful to come and make a statement, as the prospective President of our country, about a subject that is so important to me and to you and to two hundred and fifteen million other Americans.\n"", ""There is a great deal of concern and confusion in our country about what ought to be done about health care. Sometimes when you have the best intentions and really want to fulfill commitments and ideas and ideals, there's a great deal of confusion about what needs to be done. And that's the case in our nation right now as we, the greatest nation on earth, struggle with the problem of how to let our own country provide healthy bodies and minds for our people.\n"", ""Let me say at the outset that I share the deep concern that all of you feel about the state of our nation's health. And after January 20,1 intend to provide the aggressive leadership that is needed to give our people a nationwide, comprehensive, effective health program, and you can depend on that.\n"", ""This year, we will spend over $130 billion on health care. That's an average of $600 for every man, woman, and child in our country. So for a family with a wife and a husband and two children, $2,400 of their income will be spent on health care. And we know that the cost of health care is projected to double in the next five years. And still there are 14 other nations that have lower infant mortality rates. We lead the developed nations in the incidence of heart disease and cancer. And we still have especially severe health care problems among the poor, and particularly among members of minority groups who also happen to be poor.\n"", ""We have excellent medical care for the very few who can afford it and who are educated enough to get doctors' advice in advance. But we have an inadequate health care program for those who are not well educated and for those who cannot afford expensive care. In short, there is a tragic gap between what our national health should be and could be, and what it now is.\n"", ""Our technology in many instances has outstripped our basic humanity. Sophisticated and costly medical technology has improved our health, but its duplication and misutilization has wasted our nation's wealth. And the scarcity of financial and human resources then restrains the budget for other health and social needs. It's time for us to get back to the basics, and the basic need of any health care system is to care about people and to prevent disease and injury before they happen.\n"", ""Prevention is both cheaper and simpler than cure. But we have stressed the latter—cure—and we have ignored, to an increasing degree, the former— prevention. Our traditional self-reliance, our emphasis on family and community health, our concern about the prevention of disease, regular checkups, early diagnosis, and early treatment has almost been forgotten by many in the onrush of technology and increasing specialization. In recent years, we've spent 40 cents out of every health dollar on hospitalization. In effect, we've made the hospital the first line of defense, instead of the last. By contrast, we only spend three cents on disease prevention and control, less than half a cent on health education, and a quarter of a cent on environmental health.\n"", ""I grew up in an isolated community in Georgia. We didn't have electricity, we didn't have running water. But I had adequate access to public and private health care—not just from my mother. But the major interrelationships I had with doctors and nurses was to prevent disease. And those of you in the audience who are as old as I am remember the threat of almost sure death from many of those horrible diseases, like diphtheria, cholera, polio, mumps, measles, whooping cough, typhus, and typhoid. But the emphasis on health care in my life was not to wait until after I got sick, but to prevent my getting sick. That emphasis in the last 40 years has been lost.\n"", ""It needs to be restored. Look at our record in recent years on immunizations. In 1974, 37 percent of all our children of age one to four had not been immunized against polio, 44 percent had not been immunized against rubella, and 40 percent had not been immunized against measles. This year, as you may know, we have already had reported over 35,000 cases of measles. And that's a national disgrace.\n"", 'This year also, as you probably know, President Ford proposed a cut in federal spending on vaccine for immunizations against preventable diseases by 50 percent. This of course is no surprise. For almost the last eight years, the Nixon and Ford Administrations have slashed one essential health program after another in the fields of maternal and child health, mental treatment centers, health manpower, health maintenance organizations, occupational and environmental research, biomedical research and many other fields. That kind of negativism about preventive health care is going to stop next January 20.\n', ""I want to give you one more tragic example of the failure of preventive care. The Pap test was devised in 1943. But as late as 1974, the last reported period, fully 25 percent of our nation's women had never had a Pap test. Thousands of women continue to die unnecessarily of cervical cancer each year. That's a failure of leadership. It's a tragedy that strikes unequally and unfairly at those who are most ignorant, poorer, and who very seldom have any interrelationship with a doctor until after they get seriously ill.\n"", 'We conducted an analysis in Georgia, as those of you from Georgia know, to determine the ten most severe crippiers and killers of our people—heart disease, stroke, cancer and others. One of the shocking discoveries we made was that among black women in rural counties, there was more than 20 times as much cervical cancer as among white women in urban counties, the only difference being access to early diagnosis, regular physical examinations, and preventive health care. We need to stress the right of all people in this country to prevent the crippiers and the killers that can affect their lives.\n', ""As you know better than any others, a vast amount of our ill health is caused by the way we live, by the environment we've created, and by the lifestyles we've adopted. It is not the role of government to dictate lifestyles. But it is the proper role of government to educate our citizens and to aggressively stress the promotion of good health.\n"", ""The biggest killer of our young people is not a disease, but accidents— mainly automobile accidents. It should not be beyond the capacity of a concerned society to reduce those needless deaths and maimings. And with the breakup of the family structure, we've now seen a pattern evolve among young men, 15 to 20 years old, that the second most frequent cause of death is suicide. This is a shocking thing in a society that's always depended on die family, the community, stability, care and love.\n"", 'The major killer of middle age men is heart disease, often brought on by overeating and smoking and a lack of exercise and a lack of knowledge. It should not be beyond the capacity of a concerned society to reduce those unnecessary deaths. The fact is, if we were to improve our national eating and drinking and smoking and exercise habits, we could be healthier, be happier, live longer, and save ourselves billions of dollars in the process.\n', 'I think Presidential leadership and the tapping of the tremendous resources assembled in this ballroom could lead us toward a reduction in these unnecessary deaths.\n', 'We must be concerned too about environmental and occupational health threats. Environmental factors such as smoking, synthetic compounds in our food and water, exposure to industrial and commercial chemicals and air pollution now cause an estimated 70 to 90 percent of all cancer. We\'ve discovered cancer ""hot spots"" where industrial pollution causes dramatically high cancer rates. Yet for eight years this Republican Administration has failed to enforce legislation and has opposed new legislation that would reduce the pollution that is killing our people. That\'s a failure of leadership again, and it must be stopped.\n', ""We also have an opportunity to cut down on the incidence of stroke. As you know, the Communicable Disease Center happens to be in Atlanta, and we worked very closely with them while I was governor to determine how best to control or minimize the impact of stroke. We have about 600,000 people in Georgia alone who are potential stroke victims, and we've found that with a simple blood test, cholesterol analysis, and a blood pressure test, we can identify those who might have a stroke. The total cost? Three dollars. And we could tell the person, go to your family physician, you might have a stroke, take simple medication to prevent this debilitating affliction. It costs thousands of dollars, as you well know, for an indigent person to be cared for by the taxpayers once a stroke occurs.\n"", 'Let me outline for you some of the goals of the next administration in the area of health.\n', 'First, we must return to the basic focus on the prevention of illness and disease, including a strong neighborhood and community orientation.\n', 'Second, we must have a comprehensive program of national health insurance. You know as well as any group the complexities of such a program. But certain basic principles are clear:\n', '• The coverage must be universal and mandatory. We must lower the present barriers, in insurance coverage and otherwise, to preventive and primary care—and thus reduce the need for hospitalization. We must have strong cost and quality controls, and the rates for institutional care and physician services should be set in advance, prospectively.\n', '• We should maintain the personal interrelationships between patients and their physicians, and we should give freedom of choice in the selection of physicians and the treatment centers to the patient to be cared for.\n', '• Along with catastrophic insurance coverage, we must make the provision of prenatal and infant care benefits one of our highest priorities.\n', '• We must phase in the program as rapidly as revenues permit, helping first, those who most need help, and achieving a comprehensive program well defined in the end. Now many questions remain to be answered on national health insurance, as any Member of the Congress knows, and as professional health care specialists, like yourselves, know. And I ask for your advice and your help in obtaining the best possible program as quickly and as early as possible.\n', ""The third thing we must stress is health and nutrition education. Our public schools could do more to teach our young people the dangers of drinking, smoking, using drugs, overeating, and eating the wrong kinds of food. We need to make sure that young people form a habit of taking advantage of the public and private health facilities we offer. Many times, there is never that closeness of feeling toward health care specialists engendered in the young person's mind that I was fortunate enough to have because my mother was a registered nurse.\n"", 'Fourth, we must mount a renewed attack on cancer and other diseases caused by toxic chemicals in the environment, including strict enforcement of the new Toxic Substances Control Act, which has just been passed.\n', 'Fifth, we must continue and expand biomedical research and be sure that it serves the health needs of all our people.\n', 'We must have—and I intend to provide—government reorganization that will end the bureaucratic fragmentation that now frustrates any hope for a rational and effective national health policy. This is crucial—it must be done.\n', ""It would be almost impossible for any of you to name a single major federal agency that doesn't have part of the responsibility for health care. We've got 302 different federal health programs. They are scattered throughout the federal government. There is no coordination, there is no cooperation, there is no careful planning, there is no end of duplication and overlapping and waste. Medicaid is in one agency, Medicare is in a different agency. Neither one of those agencies is responsible for health care. The certification of the quality of care is in a third and different agency altogether. So we need to consolidate and reorganize the federal government to make sure that there is a clear delineation of responsibility and a clear understanding of authority, so that our professionals who work for the government at all levels can spend their professional careers in the most fruitful way for a change. That must come and it's going to come next year.\n"", ""We must encourage, and you can certainly help with this, alternative delivery systems such as health maintenance organizations and rural group practices. We must also remember that it's both more cost-efficient and more health-effective to use less expensive treatment methods where possible; to improve outpatient service instead of overbuilding and overusing hospitals. In one recent analysis, in New York City, the average length of patient stay was [13] days. For the same disease or affliction in hospitals in California, the average stay was between 3 and 4 days. There was twice as great a chance of being operated on in New York as there was to be operated on in Michigan for the same reason for entering the hospitals. I'm not saying this to criticize any particular community, but just to point out to you that the standardization of treatment facilities, a heavier and heavier emphasis on outpatient treatment, and a basic minimum of health care, comparable with the disease or problem, is something we have a long way to go in this country to realize. But I think that the cooperation of insurance companies, hospitals, nursing homes, doctors, nurses, and patients' families to hold down the cost of what care there is, and to give adequate health care without wasting our scarce resources, is a great opportunity for the future.\n"", 'Eighth, we must clean up the disgraceful Medicaid scandals. That is important, that must be done, and it will be done.\n', 'We must encourage nursing home standards of safety, sanitation, and care, and we must encourage programs that will serve elderly people in their own homes whenever possible.\n', 'Finally, we must, by scholarships, by loans, and by other means, provide medical education to more students from minority and low income families and also to more women, and we must encourage young health professionals to train and practice in rural and inner city areas.\n', ""In some countries, there has been a dramatic recent shift toward more women becoming medical doctors. This really ought to be done in our own country. And I'll do all I can to help with that.\n"", ""As I said in a recent speech to a women's group, I want Amy to grow up feeling that she can be a lawyer, not just a legal secretary; that she can be a medical doctor as well as a licensed practical nurse; that she can be a President instead of just a President's daughter. And I think this is an attitude we should maintain.\n"", ""We must remember, too, that a nation's physical and mental health cannot be isolated from its economic health. And we must, therefore, end the present Republican economic policies that have brought us at the same time both inflation and unemployment, and in the process have made it impossible for millions of Americans to afford decent health care.\n"", ""Now these are some of the goals in the health field that I will work toward if I'm elected President. I don't claim to know all the answers. The answers are not easy. Our nation has struggled unsuccessfully for many generations, and we have failed where other nations have succeeded. It is not required that the government run the entire health care program in our country—I would not favor that. But there needs to be a close cooperation between public and private health care delivery, an emphasis on prevention of the crippiers and the killers of our people, adequate financing of health care, a shift toward non-hospital treatment whenever possible, and a realization in our country that there is a great saving to be derived economically if we can address this problem consistently and with forethought and with a deep national commitment.\n"", 'These things must come. I do know that good health ought to be a right and not just a luxury, and that good government has no more responsibility and solemn and deep concern than to make possible good health for all its people. I think that our people are ready for giant steps forward toward a comprehensive and adequate national health policy. I think we stand on the threshhold of an exciting new era in American health. We have the technology, we have the financial means, we are already spending the money, and we have the deep concern that shows in every poll we run. When you ask the American people, ""What in your lives is important enough even to raise taxes, if necessary?"" The people\'s response is always health care. It\'s a great concern to those who need it most. And it\'s time for us to do it in this country. I ask your support. I ask your advice. I ask your cooperation.\n', ""I'm one of the non-professionals in the health field, who has had a chance to learn, within my own family, as a chairman of a school board in a rural community, as one who has worked closely and lived closely among poor people. As one whose mother has devoted her life to health care. As one who's been governor of a state struggling to overcome the health problems of our people. And as one who's seen the brightness in a person's life when, for the first time in their existence, they can overcome a physical or mental defect which could have been and should have been detected and eliminated in their early years. And as one who hopes to be President of the greatest nation on earth. I pledge myself to combine my efforts with yours.\n"", ""Although I don't know the answers, people like you know the answers. And I look forward to forming a partnership with you to give our people a long overdue opportunity for simple and basic preventive care. This can finally be realized if we cooperate, if we tap the resources of our country, if we realize the difficulties and face them frankly and courageously, if we don't yield to discouragement, and if we can commit ourselves to this most worthy of all social efforts to let our people take full advantage of that which God gave them in our great country.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"

I noticed a sign over here on my right that says ""Miss Lillian for First Grandmother"" and how many of you think you\'d like to have Rosalynn for First Lady of our country? [applause and cheers]\n', ""When we first went home to Plains from the Navy, we had three sons. The oldest one was in first grade. He was born in Virginia, when we were at Norfolk. We lived in the government housing project. The rent was $31 a month. And the first year we were home, 1954, we didn't make enough total income to pay our house rent. But we formed kind of a family partnership, as Rosalynn has described, and it's lasted ever since. And now we have campaigning all over the country not only Rosalynn and myself, but my oldest son and his wife and my second son and his wife and my third son and his wife, my sister Ruth, my Aunt Sissie. Momma campaigns every now and then, she's going to Massachusetts very shortly, she just came back from Florida. Amy campaigns some [laughter]; she goes over to the Grand Old Opry in Nashville and performs—she's a clog dancer. And we get a lot of benefit from our family.\n"", 'In the last 22 months our campaign organization has grown. Today, we have about 500 Georgians, who are working people like many of you, who at their own expense have gone all over the country to talk to Americans about me, about my record in Georgia, and about their and my and your vision of what our country ought to be.\n', ""Our nation's been deeply hurt in the last eight years. With the terrible war in Vietnam, the secret bombing of Cambodia, the insensitivity in Bangladesh, and the attempted war in Angola and our involvement in Chile. And the disgrace of Watergate, the resignation of the President of the United States, and also the resignation of the Vice President of the United States, both in disgrace.\n"", ""These kinds of things have never happened to our country before. And the American people have been deeply wounded by the loss of something precious. A sense that our government was clean and decent and open. A sense that our nation was well-represented. A sense that we had access to the decision making process. That here was a minimum of secrecy and a maximum of personal privacy. That the CIA and the FBI set an example of professionalism and close attention to the law. We've lost those things.\n"", ""But I think there is also a resurgence in our country of a desire to restore the greatness and the standard of excellence and high ideals and moral character that still exists in the minds and hearts of American people in our own government. It would be a serious mistake if the 50 percent or so of those who say they are not going to vote a week from Tuesday didn't go to the polls and vote, just because they have been disappointed with some of the things that have happened in recent years. Our country is still strong.\n"", ""Economically, we're the strongest nation on earth. God's blessed us with wide open fields and great land and mineral deposits and access to the oceans, and pure streams, and good harbors, and pure air. And God's blessed us too with the finest system of government on earth.\n"", ""It hasn't been damaged by Richard Nixon or by Watergate. Nor even by Vietnam and Cambodia.\n"", ""Our system of government is still clean and decent. It's the basis on which we can predicate answers to complicated questions and bind ourselves back together and correct our mistakes, and in a spirit of unity tap the tremendous resource that exists above all else among the 215 million Americans who still believe in hard work, and self-sacrifice and who are basically unselfish, and who have a desire for a sense of unity, and who are still patriotic and still idealistic, and still compassionate and still looking for a way to set an example of hope and freedom and individuality and equality of purpose for the whole world to emulate. Those inclinations still exist among American people. And as we've traveled and campaigned in the last 22 months around this country, I've seen expressed to me in thousands of different ways from tens of thousands of different people, that they hope and you hope and I hope that we can be proud once again.\n"", ""Now, I don't claim to know all the answers. I'm just an average person like you who went as a farm boy and got a good education at public expense. And then went home and started a little business at a farm, then got involved in public affairs like many of you have become involved. I did it not to make money but to serve my country. And also because I enjoyed it. It's never been an ordeal or a sacrifice to me. Its always been kind of an inspiration.\n"", ""And although we've worked very hard the last 22 months, I've never felt that I was sacrificing. I've been inspired. We began our campaign, as Rosalynn said I did, on the 20th of January, 1975. Not many people knew who I was. I doubt if one out of a thousand of you had ever heard my name. And we didn't have a built in campaign organization. And we didn't have much money. I come from a small town—683 people. And I didn't hold public office. But we began campaigning for President just like you would if you wanted to run for public office. We went to rooms, living rooms, of friends in a neighborhood, and we'd invite everybody to come in, and maybe three or four people would show up. We'd go to a labor hall that would hold 200 to 300 people; maybe ten people would be there. So we walked the streets. Went into barber shops and beauty parlors and restaurants. Went into factory shift lines, shopping centers, county courthouses and city halls, livestock sales barns and farmers' markets, to talk a little and to listen a lot. And then we formed kind of a partnership with American people, and our family kind of expanded in a way, you might say.\n"", 'And then when the returns started coming in from the primaries, many people were surprised. Because I came in first in Iowa, and came in first in New Hampshire, and first in Florida, and North Carolina and Illinois, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. And it was because we formed a close relationship with people.\n', ""I've never had the opportunity, never had to depend upon, powerful bigshot special interest groups, to put me in office. This is something that has let me be a free agent to search out as best I could the needs of the people of our country that were not influential, that were not rich, not powerful. Because those of us who make decisions in government quite often don't feel the pain of a mistake. Our families are not the ones who stand in an unemployment line looking for a job. And ours are not the ones that depend on a welfare check, and find sometimes it's not enough, or gets there late.\n"", ""And we have a dual system of justice and taxation. When the tax laws are not fair, quite often we benefit. We don't suffer. And when the court system decides between the powerful and the poor, our kids don't go to prison. If my three boys were caught with marijuana in their possession, or involved in a hit and run accident, you can rest assured that they would not go to prison. But if my next door neighbor in Plains, Georgia, who happens to be black, if their sons did the same thing, they'd be gone to prison. It's time to do away with the dual system of justice in our country and treat everybody fairly for a change. [applause]\n"", ""We've got ten days left. I think it is good for us to reassess what's occurred. In the last two years alone, we've had 2 1/2 million Americans become unemployed. In the last four months, five hundred thousand American families have become unemployed. The inflation rates that have been extraordinary in the last eight years rob all of us. Under Kennedy and Johnson the average inflation rate was about 2 percent. Lately, they've averaged 6 percent. The wholesale price index for February showed 11 percent That means that a family can't plan for the future. And families need security. Eight years ago over half the American families could afford to buy a home. Now less than l/3 of the American families can afford to buy a home. You know why? Because the average home now costs 100 percent more than it did eight years ago. The interest rate is up 50 percent. If you have a savings account at 5 percent interest, you lose money. The dollar goes down more than the interest brings in. And that's a quiet thing, but it's felt by people who go to the grocery market, or who go out for the first time to buy a home, and property taxes skyrocket. It's not because of local officials, because most times local services have had to be cut down. It's because of inflation.\n"", ""Now, I believe in balanced budgets. My family budget has never been unbalanced. Rosalynn keeps the books. She sees to that. [laughter] My business has never been unbalanced. I was Governor of Georgia for four years; we always had a balanced budget. We left a surplus in the treasury every year, a cumulative total of $496 million in surplus. But we met the services of our people because they were at work. We'll never have a balanced budget in this country, which I would like to see, or an end to the inflationary spiral, as long as we have 7 or 8 million people out of work, who are looking for jobs.\n"", 'So we\'ve got priorities established for us. But I want to say this. Our country is strong. And I hope that nobody gives up on it because we\'ve failed in the past. I hope those 50 percent of the people who in the past have said ""We\'re not going to vote,"" will change their minds.\n', ""I'm running for President; I don't intend to lose; but it's just as much your country as it is mine.\n"", ""I hope next January 20th that I'll be a neighbor of yours, and I hope that those of you who work for the government will understand that we're going to form a close partnership. We'll be in it together. We'll be dedicating our lives or a major portion of our lives to serving other Americans who look to us to take whatever talent or ability we have, and to exert it to the utmost of our capabilities to make our country great, to deal with the sensitivities and the needs of those who are not powerful, to treat the people fairly, to have a tax structure in which we can have confidence, to have a foreign policy that will make us proud once again, to insist on human rights, to deal with people at home and abroad as we would like to be dealt with ourselves, and to restore those concepts of government that have been so great in the past.\n"", ""As you know, I'm a Democrat.

I think the spirit of our country is one to meet challenge head on, not to be cowardly. To be tough and resilient. Self-reliant.

I know that you're going to eat supper after I leave. I'd like to make my own remarks fairly brief tonight. And I'd like to speak to you in a fairly serious tone.\n"", 'Many people in the last eight years have come to the conclusion that our nation has been irreparably damaged in the aftermath of the bombing of Cambodia and the Watergate scandal and the CIA revelations, and the problems in the FBI, the high unemployment rate, the resignation in disgrace of a President of the United States and a Vice President.\n', ""A lot of people feel that what we started here in Pennsylvania 200 years ago has somehow slipped out of our grasp. But that's not true at all.\n"", ""And I've learned a lot in the last two years that I didn't know before. I'm a farmer. My people have farmed in Georgia for more than 210 years. But I've learned a lot about agriculture as I traveled through the Imperial Valley of California, and seen the cheese manufacturers in Wisconsin, the syrup manufacturers in New Hampshire, and the broad cotton and com fields of the Middle West, and I've learned a lot.\n"", ""I've learned a lot about our government—the system of federalism. The proper interrelationship that ought to exist between the federal, state and local levels of government. I've learned a lot about history. And in the preparation for the three 90 minute debates, I learned more facts, more figures, more names, more places, than you could ever dream of, in hundreds of hours on my part and thousands of hours on the part of my staff. If they'd asked me a question about the Kurds, I could have answered it. If they'd asked me a question about Eutrians, I could have answered it. I know history now much better than I ever have before.\n"", ""And in the process, I've come to realize that we have a strength in this nation that is waiting to be tapped.

And there's a general feeling we cannot trust the political system, we cannot trust political leaders any more. We've been betrayed too much.\n"", ""But the one thing that we in this room remember is that in the last 24 years, we've had Republicans in the White House 16 years. But there's been a difference in attitude and tone and commitment and achievement and spirit when Democrats were in the White House.\n"", 'The first time I voted was in 1948.

When our country made a mistake, Harry Truman said ""I\'m the President."" When our country had a difficult decision to be made, recognition of Israel, formation of the United Nations, aid to Turkey and Greece, the Marshall Plan, NATO, Harry Truman said, ""I\'m the President."" He had strong leaders with him— Dean Acheson, George Marshall—but the President represented our country and there was a sense of trust, although he was not always popular, but there was a sense of trust. He had a sign on his desk. It said ""The Buck Stops Here."" Nowadays, the buck can run all over Washington looking for a place to stop. Nobody is in charge, the country is drifting. The sign\'s going back on next January 20th.\n', ""But there's a great difference between Democrats and Republicans. Truman felt, Roosevelt felt, Johnson felt, Kennedy felt, an affinity with common, ordinary, unselfish, hard-working Americans, and that makes a difference. Truman was in office seven years. He didn't have an average deficit, he had an average surplus of $2 billion a year. Tough times—Korean War came along. When he went out of office the unemployment rate was under 3 percent, inflation rate was less than 1 percent. The interest on an FHA loan 4 percent. And then came Eisenhower. When he left office the unemployment rate had jumped up to 6.7 percent. And in four years, without a war by the way, Kennedy brought it down to 4 percent. When Johnson went out of office, we had a lot of new social programs. Maybe some of them weren't advisable. The country was dynamic and moving and aggressive. But Nixon inherited a balanced budget. And the inflation rate was not 6 or 7 percent under Johnson and Kennedy—it was 2 percent.\n"", ""This is the kind of management that can come, but it's dependent on American people being at work.

And what you do—those of you who are in this room—will decide how Pennsylvania goes to a major degree. It's going to be close. But I've never looked for a sure thing. I've been willing to fight and I know that you feel the same way. President Ford and I have had one major decision to make so far. The choice of a running mate.\n"", ""When I knew that I had the nomination, I had one criterion in my mind. One, who in this nation, available to serve with me, would be the best President if I should not serve out my term? And I chose Walter Mondale and I'm proud of it.\n"", 'And President Ford chose Bob Dole.\n', ""But this difference—it's a difference of trust and vision and idealism and commitment and competence and compassion. And it's part of the character of the Democratic Party. If I'm elected, and I don't intend to lose, I intend to run the government like a business. I've worked all my life, I started my own business, I didn't have any employees except myself. My budget was balanced. When I was Governor of Georgia—four years—the budget was balanced. I had a cumulative surplus of $496 million and we had good services. We reorganized the structure of government, put in zero-based budgeting. Put clear goals for ourselves for the future. I'll do the same thing as President, with your help.\n"", ""But we've made some normal projections. In the four years a balanced budget, yes. A normal growth rate 5 to 6 percent—which was there when Kennedy and Johnson were in office before the Vietnamese War. To get the unemployment rate down to 4 percent. And to phase in the increased revenues—estimated to be about $60 billion at the end of the four year period— partially with substantial tax reductions. I would think otherwise to phase in very methodically, very carefully, new programs that our people want. That's the kind of management that we can have. That's the kind of management that we want to have.\n"", ""In closing, the point I want to make to you is that there is no incompatibility between competence and tough management and meeting our people's needs and putting our people back to work, and sensitivity and trust. [applause] Those things can go together.\n"", 'Now, I want to talk to you in closing tonight about some of my thoughts as I come to the end of a long political campaign.\n', ""The campaign began for me as you know some 22 months ago. I didn't have a campaign organization. I didn't have much money. Not many people knew who I was. I didn't hold public office. But I and my family campaigned for President just like you would if you wanted to be elected to the highest office in our country. In factory shift lines, barber shops, beauty parlors, livestock sales barns, farmers' markets, county courthouses, in the streets, shopping centers. Talking a little, listening a lot. And we learned about this country. There wasn't much media representation in those days. I was lonely. And when I saw somebody with a scratch pad and a pencil or a microphone, I moved over their way and hoped they'd ask me a question. Most of the time they didn't.\n"", ""But I learned. I learned about this country. And I understand the diversity of our nation much better than I did before. Our country is made up of pluralism or diversity. A lot of different kinds of people. But that's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. Some people have said that our nation is a melting pot. It's not. Whether we came to this country 2 years, 20 years, 200 years ago, it doesn't matter. The point is why we came to this country. But when we come here we haven't given up our individuality, our pride in our past history or background or commitments or habits. We become not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic. Different people, different beliefs, different yearnings, different hopes, different dreams.\n"", ""But all put together to make a beautiful picture of a common people. We came here because we wanted to. And we came here because we believed in this country. And we came here because we felt we could get along with one another even if sometimes we disagreed. And we haven't really been disappointed. I've learned that this country faces great problems. I've met many college graduates who cannot find a job. I've met many women who have worked all their lives and then suddenly for reasons that they don't understand and which they cannot control were forced out of jobs and for the first time into the unemployment line. And later, to draw their first welfare check. And that hurts a family when a man or woman, able to work, wanting to work, starts depending upon welfare. I've felt their anguish and I've experienced their embarrassment and I've talked to them quietly. And I've felt their shame when they lost their economic independence and their ability to care for their own families, and a sense of trust in looking up to the bread winner.\n"", 'And then they became somebody\'s statistic. In the last two years since Mr. Nixon left office we\'ve had two and a half million American families become unemployed. In the last two months alone, 500,000 Americans have become unemployed. And that hurts. I\'ve met people who have been lucky enough to keep their jobs. But have been driven to the brink of deprivation by runaway inflation. And saw a growing realization that those who were still lucky enough to work, that they were paying the bills, the welfare, unemployment compensation and lost revenues. In the last two years we\'ve had $23 billion added to our federal deficit, because of unemployment compensation and welfare costs. And the ones who pay the bill are the ones who still have jobs. I\'ve met mothers and fathers who always felt sure in the past that they could plan for the future and that their children could go to college or they could buy a home. Nowadays, one of the most prevalent comments in our public opinion polls is ""We can\'t plan anymore."" Our savings account that used to bring in a net profit now loses money, because the interest paid on the deposit doesn\'t equal the losses to inflation. Over half the people in this country were able to own their own homes when Lyndon Johnson left the White House. Since then, the cost of the average home has doubled. Interest rates increased 50 percent. And now less than one-third of American families are financially able to own their own home. Property taxes are skyrocketed. Not because Pete Flaherty and other local leaders have increased costs, but because of what happens in Washington. As the welfare programs expand, as inflation hits all of us, property taxes go up. The home is worth more in the books, it\'s not worth any more to the family who lives there.\n', 'This has hurt our nation. I\'ve seen these problems and I\'ve felt the frustration of people who sense that their problems are being caused not by themselves but by some remote bureaucrat in Washington, and who feel and express to me quite often that, ""There\'s been a wall built around Washington we can\'t quite penetrate. Governor, we don\'t know how to make our expression of complaint or suggestion heard anymore."" There\'s been too much secrecy. And too little attention given to personal privacy. They\'ve felt that the decisions had affected their lives and they didn\'t have any part in the decision making process.\n', 'I saw the disillusion of American people and so did you. With the assassinations of John Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., the shooting of George Wallace. And this hurt. And there was a sense that somehow or other our societal structure was coining apart. And the scandals that hit our own government destroyed our core of stability and trust and in some ways had even substituted for the families that are so seldom cohesive now in a fast changing, fast moving, technological society.\n', ""We've had a feeling that somehow the government that used to be our servant has become our master.\n"", ""These are some of the impressions that I've got campaigning throughout the country in 30 primaries and since then in all 50 states, either I or my family. But that's not all I saw.\n"", ""I saw the underlying, unconquerable spirit of our people. I've seen the American people's courage and I've seen the American people's hope. And I've seen our determination not to surrender to setbacks and adversity, and I've seen our determination to get off of welfare and back to work.\n"", ""And I've seen in the midst of political scandal and corruption our determination to regain control of our governmental process and to restore to it competence, integrity, compassion and unity.

117,Jimmy Carter ,"November 01, 1976","[""Q. We'd like to know something about your hunting and fishing background.\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, I was born and raised here around Plains, and grew up on a farm until I was about 17 or 18 years old. After college I came back here and lived mostly on the farm. I've hunted and fished all my life. My wife and I go fishing now and then. We've got a nice, isolated pond the news people don't know about. We spend a couple of hours there and catch maybe 25 or 30 bluegills, or shellcrackers, most any afternoon or early morning.\n"", ""When I was a boy, I did a lot of all kinds of hunting—squirrels, rabbits, coons, possums, and fox, and of course, doves and quail. When I say bird hunting, I'm talking about quail hunting. [For me] that's always been the most enjoyable. I've killed a couple of turkeys in my life, and though I don't have any objection to other people hunting deer, I'm not a deer hunter.\n"", 'Q. Do you recognize hunting as tool in modern game management?\n', ""Governor Carter. I do recognize the fact that hunters and fishermen and outdoorsmen are the ones I think are the most significant protectors of endangered species and endangered areas. I think there's too much criticism of people who enjoy hunting, because they are the ones who finance programs to increase duck and goose populations and to protect wildlife that has been almost depleted. The first 17 years of my life I saw only two deer that I remember, and I spent almost all of my time in the swamps and fields and isolated wooded areas. But we now have plenty of deer in most areas of Georgia. This has come about because of proper game management. When I was a boy I saw a lot of turkeys, but then they almost disappeared. During my administration as governor, I tried to rebuild the turkey population, and the financing of this came from hunting and fishing licenses and from voluntary contributions from sportsmen. Hunters and outdoorsmen are the ones who can protect wildlife. That's a fact that ought to be better understood by the citizens of our country who don't like to hunt.\n"", 'Q. Do you favor federal hunting licenses for people who hunt on federal lands, such as national forests and Bureau of Land Management lands?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't have any objection to this. I think we need to increase the allocation of money for the preservation of wild areas, for the increase in population of depleted species, and for better facilities for those who enjoy the outdoors. I've never found a hunter or fisherman who objected to a reasonable fee, if they felt the money was earmarked to improve the quality of the out-of-doors. I'm not too familiar with your particular question so I don't know what political ramifications there would be, but I've given you my present feeling.\n"", 'Q. The worst problem facing game today is loss of habitat. Do you favor habitat-restoration programs at government expense?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes, I do. I tried as Governor of Georgia to protect endangered areas, even when the political consequences were quite severe.\n', 'Q. Should western ranchers, with grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management lands, be allowed to fence and close these lands to hunting?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I think you could fence the land and have some restraints on hunting. That ought to be worked out ahead of time on an individual contract basis. But I couldn't make a blanket statement now because of the diversity of those lands and the changing circumstances that apply.\n"", ""Q. Considering the crucial importance of open spaces, natural beauty, and recreation to the nation's health, how do you feel about wilderness preservation and the apparent need for setting up more wilderness areas?\n"", 'Governor Carter. I strongly support both. I think we have been too little inclined to inventory wilderness areas. When I became governor, I was very concerned about the depletion of wilderness, and other areas that were significant archeologically, geologically, and historically. So we set up a Georgia Heritage Trust. We had a fairly good allotment of funds. When I could exert some political muscle, we finally appropriated about $17 million for the purpose. We analyzed about 2,000 or more tracts of land, arranged them in an order of priority, and tried to acquire those that were most significant I think we ought to do the same on a national basis. And a lot of those areas that are already controlled by the federal government—the ones that are wilderness areas—ought to be preserved in a wilderness state.\n', 'Q. What is your opinion of the present multiple-use policy in the national forests? Do you support the idea that fish and wildlife are as important as sawlogs, grazing leases, and mineral development?\n', ""Governor Carter. Yes, I do. There are some species of trees and some types of forest that are almost sterile so far as game production or wildlife production are concerned. I don't see anything wrong with clear-cutting procedures in these particular forest lands. But in most forest lands I think the multiple-use concept is preferable.\n"", 'We\'ve got a superb project going on here in the Piedmont area of Georgia, where a very good balance has been achieved between the goal of forest and timber production and the desire to increase habitat quality for wildlife I\'ve studied that project carefully. Even before prices went up, the lumber people were deriving about $10 or more an acre every year from timber sales, [while] the populations of deer, turkeys, quail, and other wildlife were growing. So, my answer is—""Yes."" I support multiple-use concepts. The) are very important.\n', ""Q. I’d like your opinion of the Soil Conservation Service's channelization program, which seems to be converting every beautiful stream in the nation into a straight, muddy ditch. How far should this program be allowed to go?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Though I got my start in game preservation when I was about 12 years old while working with the Soil and Water Conservation Service. I'm opposed to some of their projects like the channelization of streams, and the draining of wetlands. I think we ought to be very careful about that The political pressure put on the conservation service people sometimes influences them to do things they know might be wrong. I would play a leadership role in that respect.\n"", 'Q. What is your position on federal as against state control and management of wildlife resources?\n', ""Governor Carter. I favor state management (on federal lands) where it can be done in a uniform way that's compatible with overall federal policy. I think this could be done through contractual commitments. The federal government can lay down the perimeters within which wildlife and land management can be completed. If states are willing to comply with those strict federal regulations, I see no objection to states having that responsibility. I also see no objection to the federal government monitoring states' performances.\n"", ""Georgia, for example, has a very good relationship with the federal government in the production of turkeys and other game. Blackbeard Island is controlled by the government; Sapelo Island by the state. This kind of cooperation is advantageous because it lets the state play a role in management, and also forms a close relationship and understanding between the two levels of government. In other areas where the state and federal governments sharply divide responsibilities, there's often competition and an absence of communication and cooperation. Even animosities develop that I think in the long run hurt our country and the status of wildlife.\n"", 'Q. Do you believe that our water problems can be better solved with nonstructural measures such as flood plain zoning, rather than dams and stream channelization?\n', ""Governor Carter. I've had a running battle with the Corps of Engineers that, in my opinion, has been much too inclined to flood areas that ought to be kept as they are, and dam up free-flowing rivers that ought to be kept free-flowing. [They do this] just in order to carry out some boondoggle, porkbarrel project that might have been approved 15, 20, or even 30 years ago. I feel very strongly about this.\n"", 'Q. Do you see any way in which hunting and anti-hunting sentiments can coexist in the years ahead, or do you believe that one faction will eventually triumph?\n', 'Governor Carter. I believe they can coexist. As I said earlier, if the American people could be made to understand that the sportsman is the major protector of land and wildlife, and that the sportsman has an enduring interest in reestablishing endangered species and enhancing the populations of wildlife, then hunting and nonhunting can continue to exist compatibly. I think this is one role the President can play. He can acquaint the American people in a very strong voice with this fact.\n', ""Many people don't understand that hunting and fishing license fees, duck stamps, and other charges—paid voluntarily and eagerly by sportsmen— have been the mainstay in financing programs that have preserved our wildlife areas and our wildlife populations.\n"", 'Q. Do you foresee tougher enforcement of federal water and air quality standards?\n', ""Governor Carter. If I'm elected President, the answer is yes.\n"", 'Q. Do you advocate the abolition or registration of hunting rifles and shotguns?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. All handguns?\n', 'Governor Carter. No.\n', 'Q. Saturday Night Specials?\n', 'Governor Carter. Yes.\n', 'Q. Do you know of any cases where gun controls have reduced the crime level?\n', ""Governor Carter. I can't answer that. I don't know the statistics. I think that in some parts of the world where gun control is very strict the use of firearms and the murder rate are low. Whether this derives from a national attitude, such as in England or Japan, or whether it derives from an absence of guns or weapons, I can't say.\n"", 'Q. Morris Dees has announced a strong anti-gun stand. How closely will he figure in your administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. I don't have any idea what role—if any—he would play in my administration. I don't agree with him, by the way, on his strong anti-gun stand.\n"", 'Q. Lewis Regenstein is the most outspoken advocate of stopping all hunting in the United States. A member of your staff has advised that he is serving as your environmental adviser. How close will he be to your administration?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, I am not in favor of stopping hunting in any degree. I have literally hundreds of advisers, and I don't even know Mr. Regenstein personally. I may have met him, but I don't remember him. But the fact that I have someone advising me who might have a strange or unique attitude isn't significant at all. I like to get different viewpoints expressed to me from all people, and then I make up my own mind. I think this is a good thing for a potential President to do rather than just get advice from those with whom he agrees.""]"
118,Jimmy Carter ,"November 01, 1976","[""Governor Carter. First of all, I'm sorry that the last press conference I have after 22 months is not concerned with the campaign directly but a problem in my own community, my own church. But I think in many ways this is indicative of what's going on around the country. There's a search for a way in people's hearts and minds to eliminate discrimination and hatred against anyone because of their status in life or their race or their background.\n"", 'Ten years ago, during the civil rights demonstrations, my family and I in our own church worked and tried to seek openness so that our church would receive anyone as a worshipper and a member without regard to race.\n', ""In the interim period, our church has opened its doors to anyone who's come there to worship. Recently, I think because of my presence in the church, as a Democratic nominee of our party, there's been a deliberate effort made to force the issue by someone who doesn't live in the community; who's a Republican; who's not a Baptist. And this has caused, unfortunately, a very serious problem to arise.\n"", ""The people in my home community, our pastor, our deacons, our church members, are trying to hold down the altercation so it wouldn't hurt my campaign—to be frank about it, and so it wouldn't divide our little church.\n"", ""Some of you have been to Plains, and you know that it is a tiny church and it has tried to absorb the tremendous influx of tourists and newspaper, radio, television people, who've come in there. And they've accommodated this change as best they could. I feel very sad that this has happened. And I don't want to criticize anyone because of it. I first found out about it last Thursday morning. I called the pastor to talk to him, and he was not home. I talked to his wife. [She] informed me that the deacons had voted over his opposition not to have the church service yesterday in order to hold down any dissension or division or discord in the church. And because of events with which you are familiar, the church service was cancelled over the opposition of the pastor, and the problem has arisen, which I regret.\n"", ""My position now, and then, as a member of the church, I intend to go home next Sunday and in subsequent worship services do what I can to ensure that there is not any discrimination in our church against anyone because they happen to be black or of any other race. I could not be there this week; perhaps if I had been there—I'm not a deacon anymore in our church—I could have had something to do with minimizing the problem. But this is something that I've had to face at a distance—none of my family are in Plains this week. As you know, we are campaigning all over the country. And I'm deeply concerned about this and its impact on our little church and on possibly the campaign. But more because it shows that still within our country there is a remnant, sometimes a large remnant, of discrimination.\n"", 'I think it would be best for me to answer your questions on this subject first, and then if you have questions about any other subject I would be glad to answer them.\n', 'Q. [You] experienced being a white man in the South during the period of the civil rights movement. And there were a number of things that you wished that you had done that you did not do. Do you feel that you did enough this past week to avert what happened in Plains?\n', ""Governor Carter. Well, there may have been things that I could have done. I could have possibly left the campaign and gone home to my church. The only thing that I knew that was going to happen when I talked to the pastor's wife, was that the church service itself would be cancelled on Sunday. And the pastor who believes very strongly that the church ought to accept anyone who comes as a member, had asked the Republican, non-Baptist not to come in order to keep the church from being disturbed. I didn't know what was going to happen then. But I can't say that I did everything I could to hold down that incident. No. But it was a choice I had to make whether to continue my campaign or to go home and deal with the church service in Plains on Sunday.\n"", ""Q. Governor, why don't you withdraw your own membership in that church, in opposition or as a protest to policies not acceptable to you?\n"", 'Governor Carter. Well, the church, so far as I know, has never voted not to accept blacks into membership. In a Baptist Church, the ultimate authority, the only authority, is the church membership. About ten years ago, the church did vote, over my opposition and the opposition of my family, not to admit blacks and agitators. I think it was ""colored"" and agitators. Since then though, when I was Governor of Georgia and since I\'ve been a candidate for President, I have quite often gone to the church with black people and they have been welcomed into the church, as you observed. I can\'t resign from the human race because there\'s discrimination; I can\'t resign as an American citizen because there\'s still discrimination. And I don\'t intend to resign from my own church because there\'s discrimination.\n', ""I think my best approach is to stay within the church and to try to change the attitudes which I abhor. Now if it was a country club, I would have quit. In fact, I have no membership in country clubs or any other private clubs that discriminate on account of race. But this is not my church, it's God's church. And I can't quit my lifetime worship habit and commitment because of a remnant of discrimination which has been alleviated a great deal in the last ten years. I hope it will be eliminated completely in the next few weeks. I can't speak for the church membership. But I'll do all I can within the church to eliminate that last vestige of racial discrimination.\n"", 'Q. Governor, do you think, understanding your own attitude, this particular example being put forward at this time before the election, can hurt you very badly in some of the big cities of this country where you need the vote?\n', ""Governor Carter. I think it's a possibility. I think the motivation for the attempt was politically inspired. But I have talked to a number of the people around the country who represent minority groups as leaders, and the unanimous expression from them is of support to me. In 1976, it's not a matter of courage or danger or alienation to be for an end to discrimination. It wasn't quite that easy ten years ago. But I think that Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta King, and Andy Young and Jesse Jackson and others around the nation who know about my past background are now speaking up for me on the subject, and I think that in the long run it may not be very damaging politically. I can't say for sure. But I've expressed my position and I'll do all I can as a member of my church, as an American citizen, and as someone who's going to be the next President of this country to eliminate the last vestiges of racial discrimination in this country to the limit of my ability.\n"", ""Q. Governor, do you know whether King was politically motivated or was there someone else who's inspiring him? What is the political motivation behind this?\n"", ""Governor Carter. I don't have any way to know that, and I don't want to criticize the man. Mr. King is a pastor himself of a non-denominational church. He's not a Baptist; he's never come to worship with us when the doors were open to any worshipper. He doesn't live anywhere near our community. He works for a newspaper that has endorsed my opponent, that happens to be owned by a man who ran against me for governor in 1966. Those are just factors which may or may not have been a part of the motivations of Mr. Clement King. I don't really know how to answer that question. But the fact that it was the Sunday before the election and that there was a great deal of publicity deliberately aroused on the subject, I think is indicative that it was partially at least inspired by politics. I can't say that for sure.\n"", ""Q. ...closing it's doors and canceling services? [First part inaudible.]\n"", 'Governor Carter. No. No, I think that it would have been better for the church to keep its doors open. And I did disagree with the fact that the church doors were closed.\n', ""Q. Governor, you said that the church was God's church. You also said that it was an institution run by men. At the time that the Kennedy Administration came in, and the blacks were denied membership in the Metropolitan Club in Washington, it was a much different thing but people did resign. Why did you resist the idea of resigning when you called on President Ford to show leadership with General Brown?\n"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there's a difference I think between resigning from a country club and resigning from the church of one's life. My allegiance is to God. It's an ability to worship, and I see a sharp distinction between resigning from a country club and resigning from one's church. And I think a resignation on my part and my family might very well perpetuate the very attitude within the church which is abhorrent to me. I think, to be frank about it, and not to be bragging on myself, the last number of years the church doors have been open to black worshippers, partially because of my presence. I can't say that for sure, but I hope that within the future my presence in the church would also help to continue to open the door and as I said many times, any sort of discrimination in a religious service, or in a country dub or in government affairs, private affairs against someone because of their race, is an abhorrent thing to me. And I'll do the best I can within the church of God to make sure that the discrimination is terminated.\n"", 'Thank you very much.']"
119,Jimmy Carter ,"November 01, 1976","[""[Editor's note: In July of this year, Field & Stream contacted Governor Jimmy Carter, requesting an interview that would deal with his thoughts on hunting, conservation, and related subjects. The exclusive interview took place at Carter's home in Plains, Georgia, mid-August. Field & Stream also contacted the White House in November 1975 and again in July 1976 requesting a similar interview with President Ford and received replies from Press Secretary Ron Nessen in January and July of this year, expressing hope that an interview could take place, but stating that no opportunity existed at the time. We wish to point out that what follows in no way constitutes an endorsement of Governor Carter by this magazine. However, we believe it is important that our readers have a chance to hear the candidates' views on subjects of importance to outdoor people. We regret that we did not have the opportunity to present a similar discussion with President Ford, but we assure you that Field & Stream did make an attempt to do so.]"", 'We arrived in Plains, Georgia, the afternoon before our interview with Jimmy Carter. One of his informal softball games with the press was underway. Except for the inevitable scattering of Secret Service agents, the audience was ""just folks""—mostly people from Florida, Alabama, or towns elsewhere in Georgia who had driven over for the day ""to see Jimmy play."" And play he did, with a fine delivery as pitcher and a strong arm at bat. His second time up he clobbered a triple to right field. Carter may play for publicity, for it is obvious he enjoys the spectators and inevitable autograph sessions with the kids. However, it is also obvious he plays for fun—and to win.', ""Next morning, Field & Stream asked him what his favorite form of recreation was. He didn't say softball."", ""Governor Carter. Canoeing on wild rivers. I had a kayak when I was governor and had access to the north Georgia streams. But I swapped it for a canoe when I came back to south Georgia. There's not much white water down here."", 'Q. Can you actually""Eskimo roll"" a kayak?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I have been able to. [He laughs.] If I went out this morning, I'm not sure I could."", 'Q. What else does Jimmy Carter do to recharge his spirit in the outdoors?', ""Governor Carter. Starting right here, we have a 160 acre farm adjoining my house. After the harvest season and during the winter, I spend a lot of time in the fields looking for arrowheads. I have a collection of several thousand arrowheads I've found over the years. This simple activity gives me a chance to be alone."", ""In addition, the farm has good open woodlands and swamps where I like to wander. These are places I've visited ever since I was born. This land has been in our family since my daddy was a child, and one of our farms has been in the family since 1833 when the Indians left. Ever since I was a boy, the dirt roads and springs, fields and woods and creeks, have been an essential part of my life. We used to hunt almost everything—possum, coon, fox, rabbits, squirrel, dove, and quail. All this made a very important psychological contribution to my life. By the way, Field & Stream was always one of my favorite magazines and did much to shape my philosophy toward the outdoors and conservation. In campaigning all over the country, you can lose touch with reality. Coming back here and walking the land again gets my feet on the ground, literally and figuratively. I see things more clearly."", ""Lately though, when I leave the house, all three TV networks and 30 or 40 reporters follow me to the farm. That's why Rosalynn and I have a pond nearby we don't let newspeople visit. We go there every couple of weeks and can usually catch between 25 and 30 bluegill in a couple of hours' fishing."", 'Then all the time I was governor—and I hope this can continue—I liked to get out quail hunting. This is probably the most enjoyable form of hunting or fishing experience I have.', 'Q. Many of our readers are concerned about the rise of anti-hunting sentiment in America. What are your thoughts on this?', ""Governor Carter. I believe this is a matter of education. If the average person in America could understand that proper management and harvesting techniques are actually good for both the quality and populations of wildlife we'd have no anti-hunting movement."", ""Furthermore, if the people in this country realized that the protection of endangered species and the improved condition of many other species of wildlife were paid for by those who do enjoy hunting, we'd have no ' problem."", 'When I was a boy, we had very few deer in Georgia. All the time I was growing up on the farm, I spent a great deal of time in the swamps and isolated fields, and over a period of 18 years, I saw only two deer. Nowadays, we have a great supply of deer, and even in the small counties of the state, we harvest as many as 3,000 per year. This is a result of enlightened game management.', 'Another species that has been helped is the wild turkey. When I was governor, we initiated a major program to replenish turkey stocks in the state; and in recent years, I have killed two.', 'There is really an inadequate education of the public about how much people who hunt, love wildlife, protect it, work for increased populations through improved habitat, and are by and large very meticulous about obeying game and fish laws.', 'Even before I was Governor of Georgia, I wanted to see produced a simple book on quail culture. There had been some good scientific books written on the subject, but I wanted something that was not too technical for the average farmer, something he could purchase at a reasonable price to see how to increase quail populations. I also wanted the book to include sections on hunting techniques and ethics as well as bird dogs and their training. As you know, our Department of Natural Resources filled the order perfectly. Prince of Game Birds: the Bobwhite Quail, by Charles Elliott.', ""Another book I sponsored as governor is Wildflowers of the Southeastern United States by Wilbur H. Duncan and Leonard E. Foote. I even provided money for it out of my emergency fund. There's such a crying need for public education in subjects like this."", ""Overall, I see a good future for sportsmen and for the enjoyment of hunting, fishing, and all other forms of outdoor recreation. Yet it is increasingly important for sportsmen to be aggressive in demanding that the government protect the outdoors and preserve unspoiled areas. They are precious possessions for us now, but they'll be even more precious in the future."", 'Q. Yotfve had more than your share of run-ins with the Soil Conservation Service and the Corps of Engineers.', ""Governor Carter. The Soil and Water Conservation Service has been an important part of my life. When I was 12, I joined in a Soil and Water Conservation project to assess and increase wildlife populations on my daddy's farm. Since then, however, I've been in opposition to some of their programs I for draining freshwater swamps and channelizing streams. We can have an I adequate amount of flood and erosion control without destroying the natural habitat of our wildlife. As for the Corps, I feel they have an excessive yearning to build dams that are not needed, and they pay inadequate attention to the habitat needs of wildlife."", 'Q. As Governor of Georgia, you took an odd assortment of natural resource, environmental protection, recreation, and land trust agencies and combined them into one, more streamlined Department of Natural Resources. Any thought of doing the same thing with the various federal resource and environmental agencies?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, that would be one of the things I'd be sure to consider. We had 36 different agencies in the Georgia government—24 of them were separately budgeted—which were combined into one. There's a close interrelationship between fish and game management, protection of environmental quality, recreation in state parks, and a host of other activities relating to natural resources. Combining these concerns into one agency not only cuts down on duplication of effort, it provides a central clearinghouse for people who want to ask questions, register a complaint, or volunteer work. I believe the combined agency has greatly enhanced the concern of all Georgians for protecting the outdoors."", 'I thought that my veto of the Spewrell Bluff Dam on the Flint River would be heavily opposed by the majority of Georgians, and I made my decision figuring that it would be a severe political sacrifice on my part. But the aftermath was overwhelmingly favorable. Even the people who lived in the region involved responded favorably 10 to 1. On a nationwide basis, the reaction ran about 35 to 1, and thousands of letters came in praising my decision. This indicates to me that the majority of people who seldom write a letter or join a delegation to see the governor are much more interested in the protection of what we have than any temporary economic advantages in building a dam or other major projects that are not needed.', 'Q. The conventional wisdom still holds that the public favors most any kind of development. Yet from an editorial point of view, we see a great and growing disgust with the handiwork of independent minded public agencies.', 'Governor Carter. Yes, the dam I vetoed had been in the process of design for 15 or 20 years. The people involved were full time, very dedicated civil servants who had never worked on any other project in their professional lives. To see it all suddenly terminate was a severe blow to them. However, I resented deeply their falsification of data. The Corps exaggerated the benefits and underestimated the costs. When I, as an engineer, got my slide rule and tried to confirm their figures, there was no way to confirm them because they were not accurate. Subsequent to my analysis, the Government Accounting Office confirmed that I was right, and the Corps was wrong.', 'But this was just one experience. Throughout the country there are projects that have been approved for 25 or 30 years which are still in the process of being designed. Some might be necessary, but many are not Quite often, Corps projects are a pork-barrel deal where some very powerful Member of Congress, in order to get attention at home and to get votes, will say, ""I got $250 million allocated to build a dam on such and such a river,"" when that dam would best not be built. Such construction not only destroys wildlife areas, it\'s a tremendous waste of taxpayers\' money as well. I would like to see all such projects closely scrutinized, and the only ones that should be approved are those with a natural cost-benefit ratio that is both obvious and substantial. There are many useful projects the Corps can participate in. But I\'m going to see this policy of compulsive dam building changed if I\'m elected.', ""In our total national budget, less than 1 percent is spent on the protection and enhancement of the outdoors. Even city dwellers who rarely visit the woods react adversely when a natural area is destroyed. In one way or another, we're all tied to the land. Outdoor recreation is a precious part of our lives, whether we're conscious of that fact or not. We all want access to wild areas, and we want that access protected for our children."", 'When I was governor, the Georgia Heritage Trust spent about $17 million to acquire, at greatly reduced cost, areas of our state that were in danger of being destroyed forever. They were archeologically, geologically, historically, or naturally, important areas. When our first settlers came into Georgia, they chose the most advantageous locations. Now builders want to take these historic sites, commercialize them, and make a lot of money. Through families that had control of ancestral lands, we were able to make the state a good repository either through gifts or by providing a modest payment. The first year, we surveyed approximately 2,000 different sites throughout the state—some larger, some only a few acres—and out of those we identified about 35 that were the most in danger and the most valuable and acquired those. This ought to be done nationwide, and the cost is so very slight.', ""Q. Every 10 years, we take a human census in the United States, Yet we've never made a similar county-by-county inventory of our fish and wildlife resources. States say they don't have the money; the feds say they don't have the personnel. What is the chance that President Jimmy Carter would convene a White House Conference on wildlife conservation to initiate such a plan?"", ""Governor Carter. The project appeals to me. This is one area where volunteers could play a major role. In bird census efforts, volunteers do almost all the work. This is coordinated through scientific agencies to make sure the identification and tabulation procedures are standardized to insure accuracy. A similar census for all fish and wildlife resources would involve a small expenditure of state and federal moneys, yet return such rich dividends. It would also give sportsmen's organizations an opportunity to participate in a worthwhile volunteer project. The census might become an annual event just as is done in the field of ornithology."", 'Q. The next administration will be the first charged with implementing the 200 mile fisheries limit. Would you anticipate any problems in this area?', 'Governor Carter. Yes. There are going to be some very sensitive international negotiations on catch regulations and on mechanisms by which those catches can be confirmed. In addition, I imagine there will be a great deal of argument with our domestic fishermen about seasons and limits for different species. The Coast Guard and other sea-interested agencies will be enlarged, and this will at first create administrative difficulties. Thus, the increased patrol responsibilities and possible international and national conflicts will make this new law a difficult one to enforce. However, I am determined to see that it is properly enforced.', ""Q. Do you feel we're moving too fast on offshore oil leasing?"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, I do. I don't see any reason to lease oil areas either on the outer continental shelf or in the interior except to supply anticipated oil needs. Under the Nixon-Ford Administration, there has been an effort to lease 10 times more area than was necessary. This creates an absence of competition, because when you have too many leases being sold at one time, the oil companies, in effect, divide the territory amongst themselves. I favor legislation that has made a good bit of progress in the Congress to separate exploratory lease rights from production lease rights so that we'll have a better assessment of our potential oil supply before it is exploited. This would also make the leasing process more orderly, permit smaller companies to participate, and increase actual income."", 'Q. Do you think, if and when whale stocks are restored to safe levels, the United States should resume whaling?', ""Governor Carter. That's a long way in the future and would probably not occur in my own administration. However, I would presume that once we restore whale stocks, as with any wild species under thoughtful management, good and orderly harvest procedures could be reinstituted."", 'Q. There is a growing controversy over who has the responsibility for managing wildlife on federal lands: the states or the feds. Any thoughts on this?', 'Governor Carter. My philosophical inclination is to let state and local governments do as much as they are capable of. The federal government can cooperate by establishing minimum standards and a degree of supervision to insure uniformity. However, so long as the states comply with those standards, I would prefer to see the states do what they can.', 'Q. Do you favor restrictions on the use of pesticides?', 'Governor Carter. Yes. This is a subject I face from both viewpoints: first, as a farmer trying to get a maximum return from every acre of land that I manage; next, as someone who is concerned about the long-range consequences of using dangerous chemicals. We need to face the entire question of toxic materials, hazards versus benefits. One of the causes I advocate is that all test data on new toxic materials be made public, while at the same time permitting the manufacturer to protect his patent rights.', 'Q. Do you think a national land use law is possible in the next 4 years?', ""Governor Carter. Yes, it's possible. However, it has to be designed from the beginning by those most directly affected. I think if our farmers, ranchers, and other landowners could understand it is for their protection; if they were involved in the initial stages of legislation; if we could remove the false concept that the federal government was going to let everybody use our land; if all these criteria can be met, land use legislation can be passed."", 'Q. One last personal question: If you were limited to one dog—a covey dog or a singles dog—which would you choose?', 'Governor Carter. [Carter broke into his famous grin.] ""Oh, I think a man could get by with a good singles dog.""']"
120,Jimmy Carter ,"November 01, 1976","['The biographical details are all too familiar by now and, indeed, may seem a little pointless this month. If Jimmy Carter is elected President of the United States a few weeks from now, the facts about where he spent his youth, how he was educated and the way he came out of nowhere to capture the Democratic nomination will soon enough be available in history books and on cereal boxes.', 'What will be less available and less familiar is what kind of person Carter is. To many Americans, the old charge that he was ""fuzzy"" on the issues may be less accurate than the persistent feeling that he is fuzzy as a personality. Even this late in the campaign, Carter remains for many an unknown quantity.', 'When Carter agreed to do a ""Playboy Interview,"" we decided we\'d try our best not to add to all the hype that always gushes forth during a Presidential campaign. We wanted to pit him against an interviewer who would prod him and challenge him and not be afraid to ask irreverent questions. Our choice of interviewer was natural: Robert Scheer, the Bronx-born, Berkeley-based journalist who in the past year has done interviews with California Governor Jerry Brown for Playboy (which was widely regarded as the earliest and most thorough exposure of Brown\'s curious politics and beliefs) and both William and Emily Harris for New Times (which provided crucial evidence in the trial of Patty Hearst).', ""For three months, Scheer dogged the footsteps of the peanut farmer who would be President, scrambling aboard press planes, sleeping in motels, hanging out with the pack of journalists that grew in size as the campaign gathered momentum. With the support of Carter's young aides—notably, press secretary Jody Powell and campaign manager Hamilton Jordan— Scheer and Playboy managed to log more hours of recorded conversations with the candidate than any other publication or news medium—a fact Carter joked about at the final session. After writing the accompanying article about his experiences and about Carter, a very exhausted Scheer filed this report:"", '""It was the day after the Democratic Convention in New York City. Jody Powell was harried.', '""\'Listen, Scheer, I\'m not going to kid you. Now that he\'s the nominee, I\'ve got over 700 requests from all over the world for interviews. He\'s told me to cut back, but I\'ve got a prior commitment to you guys and I\'m going to honor it. So hop a plane down to his place in Plains. We\'ll just cut out an appointment with some future Secretary of State.\'', '""Jody keeps his sense of humor even when he\'s harried. I had already logged hours of tape with Carter under conditions that were never less than chaotic. Our conversations had started when his chances were shakier and his time slightly more available. But, as Jody had said, once he became the nominee, it was going to be even tougher.', '""Some of our sessions were as short as half an hour on board the campaign plane, with the roar of engines and the pilot\'s announcements adding to the frenzy. Playboy and I both hung in there through the months, taking (and paying for) flights halfway across the country on the tentative promise of yet one more harried chat. After all the baggage searches by the Secret Service and the many times I\'d had to lurch up an airplane aisle, fumbling with my tape recorder, I was looking forward to a leisurely conversation with Carter at his home after the nomination.', '""Earlier this year, when I was working on the interview with Governor Jerry Brown, my Playboy editor, Barry Golson, had joined me for the final sessions at the Governor\'s office in Sacramento. It had produced interesting results—I, the aggressive Berkeley radical, Golson, the Eastern diplomatic Yalie. We felt the Mutt and Jeff technique would be valuable with Carter as well, so Golson and I traveled to Plains for the final session.', '""Down in Plains, everything was normal. Brother Billy Carter was in his blue overalls, leaning against a storefront, drawling about this and that to one of the locals who hadn\'t been up to New York City for the big show. We drove past the Secret Service barricades, past daughter Amy\'s lemonade stand, and parked in front of the Carter home. As we entered the front door, the candidate, dressed in rumpled work clothes and dusty clodhoppers, was ushering out an impeccably dressed six-man contingent from Reader\'s Digest.', '""As we said hello and sat down in his living room to adjust our tape recorders, I remarked to Carter that he must be in a puckish mood, talking to both the Digest and Playboy on the same afternoon. Carter flashed us every one of his teeth: \'Yeah, but you guys must have some kind of blackmail leverage on Jody. I\'ve spent more time with you than with Time, Newsweek and all the others combined.\'', '""It was a flattering opening shot, but probably more canny and less casual than it sounded. A week earlier, during the Democratic Convention, Golson had bumped into Jordan at a party in New York. Neither of them was entirely sober, and they discussed the interview. Golson said something about all the time Carter had spent with me. Jordan replied, \'We wouldn\'t do it if it weren\'t in our interest It\'s your readers who are probably predisposed toward Jimmy—but they may not vote at all if they feel uneasy about him.\'', '""For me, the purpose of the questioning was not to get people to vote for or against the man but to push Carter on some of the vagueness he\'s wrapped himself in. We tried to get beyond the campaigner to some of the personal doubts and confusions—as well as the strengths—of the man himself. Throughout my months on the campaign trail, I found Carter impatient with social chitchat and eager for challenging questions. He is thin-skinned, as others have reported, and he\'ll glare at you if he doesn\'t like something you\'ve asked. But he can take it as well as dish it out and, unlike many other politicians I\'ve interviewed, he\'ll eventually respond directly to a question if you press him hard enough. The best evidence of this is contained in the final portion of the interview, an open and revealing monolog that occurred because we happened to ask him one last question on a topic about which he\'d become impatient and frustrated.', 'Oh, just incidentally, there\'s one bit of folklore about Jimmy Carter whose authenticity I can vouch for. When I\'ve had a rough day, I\'ve been known to toss down a drink or four, and I wondered what Carter did when he needed replenishment. I got my answer during one short session as I slipped into the plane seat next to him after he\'d had a miserable day on the hustings. Between answers, he would gobble down handfuls of peanuts at about the same rate at which I drink. Different strokes, I thought.""', '[Following is the Playboy interview:]', ""Playboy. After nearly two years on the campaign trail, don't you feel a little numbed by the routine—for instance, having to give the same speech over and over?"", ""Governor Carter. Sometimes. Once, when I was campaigning in the Florida primary, I made 12 speeches in one day. It was the worst day I ever had. But I generally have tried to change the order of the speech and emphasize different things. Sometimes I abbreviate and sometimes I elaborate. Of 20 different parts in a speech, I might take seven or eight and change them around. It depends on the audience—black people, Jewish people, chicanos—and that gives me the ability to make speeches that aren't boring to myself."", ""Q. Every politician probably emphasizes different things to different audiences, but in your case, there's been a common criticism that you seem to have several faces that you try to be all things to all people. How do you respond to that?"", ""Governor Carter. I can't make myself believe these are contrivances and subterfuges I've adopted to get votes. It may be, and I can't get myself to admit it, but what I want to do is to let people know how I stand on the issues as honestly as I can."", 'Q. If you feel you\'ve been fully honest, why has the charge persisted that you\'re ""fuzzy"" on the issues?', 'Governor Carter. It started during the primaries, when most of my opponents were Members of Congress. When any question on an issue came up, they would say, ""I\'m for the Kennedy-Corman bill on health care, period, no matter what\'s in it."" If the question was on employment, they would say, ""I\'m for the Humphrey-Hawkins bill, no matter what\'s in it."" But those bills were constantly being amended!', ""I'm just not able to do that. I have to understand what I'm talking about, and simplistic answers identifying my position with such-and-such a House bill are something I can't put forward. That's one reason I've been seen as fuzzy."", ""Another is that I'm not an ideolog and my positions are not predictable. Without any criticism of McGovern, if the question had ever come up on abortion, you could pretty well anticipate what he was going to say. If it were amnesty, you could predict what McGovern was going to say about that But I've tried to analyze each question individually; I've taken positions that to me are fair and rational, and sometimes my answers are complicated."", ""The third reason is that I wasn't a very vulnerable opponent for those who ran against me. Fuzziness was the only issue Congressman Udall, Senator Church—and others that are hard to remember now—could adopt in their campaigns against me. I think the drumming of that factor into the consciousness of the American voter obviously had some impact."", ""Q. Still, not everybody's sure whether you're a conservative in liberal clothing or vice versa. F.D.R., for instance, turned out to be something of a surprise to people who'd voted for him, because he hadn't seemed as progressive before he was elected as he turned out to be. Could you be a surprise that way?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't believe that's going to be the case. If you analyze the Democratic Party platform, you'll see that it's a very progressive, very liberal, very socially motivated platform. What sometimes surprises people is that I carry out my promises. People ask how a peanut farmer from the South who believes in balanced budgets and tough management of government can possibly give the country tax and welfare reform, or a national health program, or insist on equal rights for blacks and women. Well, I'm going to do those things. I've promised them during the campaign, so I don't think there will be many people disappointed—or surprised—when I carry out those commitments as President."", ""Q. But isn't it true that you turned out to be more liberal as Governor of Georgia than people who voted for you had any reason to suspect?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't really think so. No. The Atlanta Constitution, which was the source of all information about me, categorized me during the gubernatorial campaign as an ignorant, racist, backward, ultraconservative, rednecked South Georgia peanut farmer. Its candidate, Carl Sanders the former governor, was characterized as an enlightened, progressive, well-educated, urbane, forceful, competent public official. I never agreed with the categorization that was made of me during the campaign. I was the same person before and after I became governor. I remember keeping a check list and every time I made a promise during the campaign I wrote it down in a notebook. I believe I carried out every promise I made. I told several people during the campaign that one of the phrases I was going to use in my inaugural speech was that the time for racial discrimination was over. I wrote and made that speech."", 'The ultraconservatives in Georgia—who aren\'t supporting me now, by the way—voted for me because of their animosity toward Carl Sanders. I was the alternative to him. They never asked me, ""Are you a racist or have you been a member of the Ku Klux Klan?"" because they knew I wasn\'t and hadn\'t been. And yet, despite predictions early this year by The Atlanta Constitution that I couldn\'t get a majority of the primary vote in Georgia against Wallace, I received about 85 percent of the votes. So I don\'t think the Georgia people have the feeling I betrayed them.', ""Q. Considering what you've just said about The Atlanta Constitution, how do you feel about the media in general and about the job they do in covering election issues?"", ""Governor Carter. There's still a tendency on the part of some members of the press to treat the South, you know, as a suspect nation. There are a few who think that since I am a southern governor, I must be a secret racist or there's something in a closet somewhere that's going to be revealed to show my true colors. There's been a constant probing back ten, twelve years in my background, even as early as the first primaries. Nobody probed like that into the background of Udall or Bayh or other people. But I don't object to it particularly, I just recognize it."", '[The answer was broken off and, at a later session, Carter returned to the question of the press and its coverage of issues. This time he was tired, his head sunk far back into his airplane seat. The exchange occurred during one of the late primaries.]', ""Issues? The local media are interested, all right, but the national news media have absolutely no interest in issues at all. Sometimes we freeze out the national media so we can open up press conferences to local people. At least we get questions from them—on timber management, cm health care, on education. But the traveling press have zero interest in any issue unless it's a matter of making a mistake. What they're looking for is a 47-second argument between me and another candidate or something like that. There's nobody in the back of this plane who would ask an issue question unless he thought he could trick me into some crazy statement."", ""Q. One crazy statement you were supposed to have made was reported by Robert Shrum after he quit as your speechwriter earlier this year. He said he'd been in conversation with you when you made some slighting references to Jewish voters. What's your version of what happened?"", ""Governor Carter. Shrum dreamed up eight or ten conversations that never took place and nobody in the press ever asked me if they had occurred. The press just assumed that they had. I never talked to Shrum in private except for maybe a couple of minutes. If he had told the truth, if I had said all the things he claimed I had said, I wouldn't vote for myself."", 'When a poll came out early in the primaries that said I had a small proportion of the Jewish vote, I said, ""Well, this is really a disappointment to me—we\'ve worked so hard with the Jewish voters. But my pro-Israel stand won\'t change, even if I don\'t get a single vote; I guess we\'ll have to depend on non-Jews to put me in office."" But Shrum treated it as if it were some kind of racist disavowal of Jews. Well, that\'s a kind of sleazy twisting of a conversation.', ""Q. While we're on the subject of the press, how do you feel about an issue that concerns the press itself—the right of journalists to keep their sources secret?"", 'Governor Carter. I would do everything I could do to protect the secrecy of sources for the news media.', 'Q. Both the press and the public seem to have made an issue out of your Baptist beliefs. Why do you think this has happened?', ""Governor Carter. I'm not unique. There are a lot of people in this country who have the same religious faith. It's not a mysterious or mystical or magical thing. But for those who don't know the feeling of someone who believes in Christ, who is aware of the presence of God, there is, I presume, a quizzical attitude toward it. But it's always been something I've discussed very frankly throughout my adult life."", ""Q. We've heard that you pray 25 times a day. Is that true?"", ""Governor Carter. I've never counted. I've forgotten who asked me that, but I'd say that on an eventful day, you know, it's something like that."", 'Q. When you say an eventful day, do you mean you pray as a kind of pause, to control your blood pressure and relax?', ""Governor Carter. Well, yes. If something happens to me that is a little disconcerting, if I feel a trepidation, if a thought comes into my head of animosity or hatred toward someone, then I just kind of say a brief silent prayer. I don't ask for myself but just to let me understand what another's feelings might be. Going through a crowd, quite often people bring me a problem, and I pray that their needs might be met. A lot of times, I'll be in the back seat of a car and not know what kind of audience I'm going to face. I don't mean I'm terror-stricken, just that I don't know what to expect next I'll pray then, but it's not something that's conscious or formal. It's just a part of my life."", 'Q. One reason some people might be quizzical is that you have a sister, Ruth, who is a faith healer. The association of politics with faith healing is an idea many find disconcerting.', ""Governor Carter. I don't even know what political ideas Ruth has had, and for people to suggest I'm under the hold of a sister—or any other person—is a complete distortion of fact. I don't have any idea whether Ruth has supported Democrats or not, whereas the political views of my other sister, Gloria, are remarkably harmonious with mine."", ""Q. So you're closer to Gloria, who has described herself as a McGovern Democrat and rides motorcycles as a hobby?"", ""Governor Carter. I like them both. But in the past 20 or 25 years, I've been much closer to Gloria, because she lives next door to me and Ruth lives in North Carolina. We hardly saw Ruth more than once a year at family get-togethers. What political attitudes Ruth has had, I have not the slightest idea. But my mother and Gloria and I have been very compatible. We supported Lyndon Johnson openly during the 1964 campaign and my mother worked at the Johnson county headquarters, which was courageous, not an easy thing to do politically. She would come out of the Johnson headquarters and find her car smeared with soap and the antenna tied in a knot and ugly messages left on the front seat. When my young boys went to school, they were beaten. So mother and Gloria and I, along with my Rosalynn, have had the same attitudes even when we were in a minority in Plains. But Ruth lives in a different world in North Carolina."", ""Q. Granting that you're not as close to your religious sister as is assumed, we will wonder how your religious beliefs would translate into political action. For instance, would you appoint judges who would be harsh or lenient toward victimless crimes—offenses such as drug use, adultery, sodomy and homosexuality?"", 'Governor Carter. Committing adultery, according to the Bible—which I believe in— is a sin. For us to hate one another, for us to have sexual intercourse outside marriage, for us to engage in homosexual activities, for us to steal, for us to lie—all these are sins. But Jesus teaches us not to judge other people. We don\'t assume the role of judge and say to another human being, ""You\'re condemned because you commit sins."" All Christians, all of us, acknowledge that we are sinful and the judgment comes from God, not from another human being.', ""As Governor of Georgia, I tried to shift the emphasis of law enforcement away from victimless crimes. We lessened the penalties on the use of marijuana. We removed alcoholism as a crime, and so forth. Victimless crimes, in my opinion, should have a very low priority in terms of enforcing the laws on the books. But as to appointing judges, that would not be the basis on which I'd appoint them. I would choose people who were competent, whose judgment and integrity were sound. I think it would be inappropriate to ask them how they were going to rule on a particular question before I appointed them."", 'Q. What about those laws on the books that govern personal behavior? Should they be enforced?', ""Governor Carter. Almost every state in the Union has laws against adultery and many of them have laws against homosexuality and sodomy. But they're often considered by police officers as not worthy of enforcing to the extent of disturbing consenting adults or breaking into a person's private home."", 'Q. But, of course, that gives the police a lot of leeway to enforce them selectively. Do you think such laws should be on the books at all?', ""Governor Carter. That's a judgment for the individual states to make. I think the laws are on the books quite often because of their relationship to the Bible. Early in the nation's development, the Judeo-Christian moral standards were accepted as a basis for civil law. But I don't think it hurts to have this kind of standard maintained as a goal. I also think it's an area that's been interpreted by the Supreme Court as one that can rightfully be retained by the individual states."", 'Q. Do you think liberalization of the laws over the past decade by factors as diverse as the pill and Playboy—an effect some people would term permissiveness—has been a harmful development?', ""Governor Carter. Liberalization of some of the laws has been good. You can't legislate morality. We tried to outlaw consumption of alcoholic beverages. We found that violation of the law led to bigger crimes and bred disrespect for the law."", ""Q. We're confused. You say morality can't be legislated, yet you support certain laws because they preserve old moral standards. How do you reconcile the two positions?"", ""Governor Carter. I believe people should honor civil laws. If there's a conflict between God's law and civil law, we should honor God's law. But we should be willing to accept civil punishment. Most of Christ's original followers were killed because of their belief in Christ; they violated the civil law in following God's law. Reinhold Niebuhr, a theologian who has dealt with this problem at length, says that the framework of law is a balancing of forces in a society; the law itself tends to alleviate tensions brought about by these forces. But the laws on the books are not a measure of this balance nearly as much as the degree to which the laws are enforced. So when a law is anachronistic and is carried over from a previous age, it's just not observed."", ""Q. What we're getting at is how much you'd tolerate behavior that your religion considers wrong. For instance, in San Francisco, you said you considered homosexuality a sin. What does that mean in political terms?"", ""Governor Carter. The issue of homosexuality always makes me nervous. It's obviously one of the major issues in San Francisco. I don't have any, you know, personal knowledge about homosexuality and I guess being a Baptist, that would contribute to a sense of being uneasy."", 'Q. Does it make you uneasy to discuss it simply as a political question?', ""Governor Carter. No, it's more complicated than that. It's political, it's moral and it's strange territory for me. At home in Plains, we've had homosexuals in our community, our church. There's never been any sort of discrimination—some embarrassment but no animosity, no harassment. But to inject it into a public discussion on politics and how it conflicts with morality is a new experience for me. I've thought about it a lot, but I don't see how to handle it differently from the way I look on other sexual acts outside marriage."", 'Q. We\'d like to ask you a blunt question: Isn\'t it just these views about what\'s ""sinful"" and what\'s ""immoral"" that contribute to the feeling that you might get a call from God, or get inspired and push the wrong button? More realistically, wouldn\'t we expect a puritanical tone to be set in the White House if you were elected?', ""Governor Carter. Harry Truman was a Baptist. Some people get very abusive about the Baptist faith. If people want to know about it, they can read the New Testament. The main thing is that we don't think we're better than anyone else. We are taught not to judge other people. But as to some of the behavior you've mentioned, I can't change the teachings of Christ. I can't change the teachings of Christ! I believe in them, and a lot of people in this country do as well. Jews believe in the Bible. They have the same commandments."", 'Q. Then you as President, in appointing Supreme Court Justices------', ""Governor Carter. I think we've pursued this conversation long enough—if you have another question. . . . Look, I'll try to express my views. It's not a matter of condemnation, it's not a matter of persecution. I've been a governor for four years. Anybody can come and look at my record. I didn't run around breaking down people's doors to see if they were fornicating. This is something that's ridiculous."", ""Q. We know you didn't, but we're being so persistent because of this matter of self-righteousness, because of the moral certainty of so many of your statements. People wonder if Jimmy Carter ever is unsure. Has he ever been wrong, has he ever had a failure of moral nerve?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, there are a lot of things I could have done differently had I known during my early life what I now know. I would certainly have spoken out more clearly and loudly on the civil rights issue. I would have demanded that our nation never get involved initially in the Vietnam War. I would have told the country in 1972 that Watergate was a much more horrible crime than we thought at the time. It's easy to say in hindsight what you would have done if you had had information you now have."", ""Q. We were asking not so much about hindsight as about being fallible. Aren't there any examples of things you did that weren't absolutely right?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't mind repeating myself. There are a lot of those in my life. Not speaking out for the cessation of the war in Vietnam. The fact that I didn't crusade at a very early stage for civil rights in the South, for the one- man, one-vote ruling. It might be that now I should drop my campaign for President and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia. It might be that later on, we'll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn't take advantage of them."", 'The fact that in 1954 I sat back and required the Warren Court to make this ruling without having crusaded myself—that was obviously a mistake on my part. But these are things you have to judge under the circumstances that prevailed when the decisions were being made. Back then, the Congress, the President, the newspaper editors, the civil libertarians all said that separate-but-equal facilities were adequate. These are opportunities overlooked, or maybe they could be characterized as absence of courage.', ""Q. Since you still seem to be saying you'd have done the right thing if you'd known what you know now, is it realistic to conclude that a person running for the highest office in the land can't admit many mistakes or moments of self-doubt?"", ""Governor Carter. I think that's a human circumstance. But if there are issues I'm avoiding because of a lack of courage, either I don't recognize them or I can't make myself recognize them."", 'Q. You mentioned Vietnam. Do you feel you spoke out at an early enough stage against the war?', 'Governor Carter. No, I did not. I never spoke out publicly about withdrawing completely from Vietnam until March of 1971.', 'Q. Why?', ""Governor Carter. It was the first time anybody had asked me about it. I was a farmer before then and wasn't asked about the war until I took office. There was a general feeling in this country that we ought not to be in Vietnam to start with. The American people were tremendously misled about the immediate prospects for victory, about the level of our involvement, about the relative cost in American lives. If I had known in the Sixties what I knew in the early Seventies, I think I would have spoken out more strongly. I was not in public office. When I took office as governor in 1970, I began to speak out about complete withdrawal. It was late compared with what many others had done, but I think it's accurate to say that the Congress and the people—with the exception of very small numbers of people—shared the belief that we were protecting our democratic allies."", 'Q. Even without holding office, you must have had some feelings about the war. When do you recall first feeling it was wrong?', 'Governor Carter. There was an accepted feeling by me and everybody else that we ought not to be there, that we should never have gotten involved, we ought to get out.', 'Q. You felt that way all through the Sixties?', ""Governor Carter. Yeah, that's right, and I might hasten to say that it was the same feeling expressed by Senators Russell and Talmadge—very conservative southern political figures. They thought it was a serious mistake to be in Vietnam."", 'Q. Your son Jack fought in that war. Did you have any qualms about it at the time?', ""Governor Carter. Well, yes, I had problems about my son fighting in the war, period. But I never make my sons' decisions for them. Jack went to war feeling it was foolish, a waste of time, much more deeply than I did. He also felt it would have been grossly unfair for him not to go when other, poorer kids had to."", ""Q. You were in favor of allocating funds for the South Vietnamese in 1975 as the war was coming to a close, weren't you?"", 'Governor Carter. That was when we were getting ready to evacuate our troops. The purpose of the money was to get our people out and maintain harmony between us and our Vietnamese allies, who had fought with us for 25 years. And I said yes, I would do that. But it was not a permanent thing, not to continue the war but to let us get our troops out in an orderly fashion.', 'Q. How do you respond to the argument that it was the Democrats, not the Republicans, who got us into the Vietnam war?', ""Governor Carter. I think it started originally, maybe, with Eisenhower, then Kennedy, Johnson and then Nixon. It's not a partisan matter. I think Eisenhower probably first got us in there thinking that since France had failed, our country might slip in there and succeed. Kennedy thought he could escalate involvement by going beyond the mere advisory role. I guess if there was one President who made the most determined effort, conceivably, to end the war by massive force, it was certainly Johnson. And Nixon went into Cambodia and bombed it, and so forth."", ""It's not partisan—it's just a matter that evolved as a habit over several administrations. There was a governmental consciousness to deal in secrecy, to exclude the American people, to mislead them with false statements and sometimes outright lies. Had the American people been told the facts from the beginning by Eisenhower, Kennedy, McNamara, Johnson, Kissinger and Nixon, I think there would have been different decisions made in our government."", 'Q. At the Democratic Convention, you praised Johnson as a President who had vastly extended human rights? Were you simply omitting any mention of Vietnam?', ""Governor Carter. It was obviously the factor that destroyed his political career and damaged his whole life. But as far as what I said at the convention, there hasn't been another President in our history—with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln—who did so much to advance the cause of human rights."", 'Q. Except for the human rights of the Vietnamese and the Americans who fought there.', ""Governor Carter. Well, I really believe that Johnson's motives were good. I think he tried to end the war even while the fighting was going on, and he was speaking about massive rehabilitation efforts, financed by our government, to help people. I don't think he ever had any desire for permanent entrenchment of our forces in Vietnam. I think he had a mistaken notion that he was defending democracy and that what he was doing was compatible with the desires of the South Vietnamese."", ""Q. Then what about the administration that ended the war? Don't you have to give credit to Kissinger, the Secretary of State of a Republican President, for ending a war that a Democratic President escalated?"", ""Governor Carter. I think the statistics show that more bombs were dropped in Vietnam and Cambodia under Nixon and Kissinger than under Johnson. Both administrations were at fault, but I don't think the end came about as a result of Kissinger's superior diplomacy. It was the result of several factors that built up in an inexorable way: the demonstrated strength of the Viet Cong; the tremendous pressure to withdraw that came from the American people; and an aroused Congress. I think Nixon and Kissinger did the proper thing in starting a phased withdrawal, but I don't consider that to be a notable diplomatic achievement by Kissinger. As we're now learned, he promised the Vietnamese things that cannot be delivered—reparations, payments, economic advantages, and so forth. Getting out of Vietnam was very good, but whether Kissinger deserved substantial diplomatic credit for it is something I doubt."", ""Q. You've said you'll pardon men who refused military service because of the Vietnam War but not necessarily those who deserted while they were in the Armed Forces. Is that right?"", ""Governor Carter. That's right. I would not include them. Deserters ought to be handled 6n a separate case basis. There's a difference to me. I was in the Navy for a long time. Somebody who goes into the military joins a kind of mutual partnership arrangement, you know what I mean? Your life depends on other people, their lives depend on you. So I don't intend to pardon the deserters. As far as the other categories of war resisters go, to me the ones who stayed in this country and let their opposition to the war be known publicly are more heroic than those who went and hid in Sweden. But I'm not capable of judging motives, so I'm just going to declare a blanket pardon."", 'Q. When?', ""Governor Carter. The first week I'm in office."", ""Q. You've avoided the word amnesty and chosen to use the word pardon, but there doesn't seem to be much difference between the two in the dictionary. Could it be because amnesty is more emotionally charged and pardon a word more people will accept?"", ""Governor Carter. You know I can't deny that. But my reason for distinguishing between the two is that I think that all of those poor, and often black, young men who went to Vietnam are more worthy of recognition than those who defected, and the word pardon includes those who simply avoided the war completely. But I just want to bring the defectors back to this country without punishment and, in doing so, I would like to have the support of the American people. I haven't been able to devise for private or public presentation a better way to do it."", ""Q. Earlier this year, there was a report that as Governor of Georgia, you had issued a resolution that seemed to support William Calley after his trial for the My Lai massacre and that you'd referred to him as a scapegoat. Was that a misreading of your position?"", ""Governor Carter. Yes. There was no reason for me to mislead anybody on the Calley thing. I thought when I first read about him that Calley was a murderer. He was tried in Georgia and found to be a murderer. I said two things: One, that Calley was not typical of our American servicemen; and, two, that he was a scapegoat because his superiors should have been tried too. The resolution I made as governor didn't have anything to do with Calley. The purpose of it, calling for solidarity with our boys in Vietnam, was to distinguish American servicemen fighting an unpopular war. They weren't murderers, but they were equated, unfortunately, with a murderer in people's minds."", 'Q. In preparing for this interview, we spoke with your mother, your son Chip and your sister Gloria. We asked them what single action would most disappoint them in a Carter Presidency. They all replied that it would be if you ever sent troops to intervene in a foreign war. In fact, Miss Lillian said she would picket the White House.', 'Governor Carter. They share my views completely.', 'Q. What about more limited military action? Would you have handled the Mayaguez incident the same way President Ford did?', ""Governor Carter. Let me assess that in retrospect. It's obvious we didn't have adequate intelligence; we attacked an island when the Mayaguez crew was no longer there. There was a desire, I think, on the part of President Ford to extract maximum publicity from our effort, so that about 23 minutes after our crew was released, we went ahead and bombed the island airport. I hope I would have been capable of getting adequate intelligence, surrounded the island more quickly and isolated the crew so we wouldn't have had to attack the airport after the crew was released. These are some of the differences in the way I would have done it."", ""Q. So it's a matter of degree; you would have intervened militarily, too."", 'Governor Carter. I would have done everything necessary to keep the crew from being taken to the mainland, yes.', 'Q. Then would you summarize your position on foreign intervention?', ""Governor Carter. I would never intervene for the purpose of overthrowing a government. If enough were at stake for our national interest, I would use prestige, legitimate diplomatic leverage, trade mechanisms. But it would be the sort of effort that would not be embarrassing to this nation if revealed completely. I don't ever want to do anything as President that would be a contravention of the moral and ethical standards that I would exemplify in my own life as an individual or that would violate the principles or character of the American people."", ""Q. Do you feel it's a fair criticism that you seem to be going back to some familiar faces—such as Paul Warnke and Cyrus Vance—for foreign policy advice? Isn't there a danger of history's repeating itself when you seek out those who were involved in our Vietnam decisions?"", ""Governor Carter. I haven't heard that criticism. If you're raising it, then I respond to the new critic. These people contribute to foreign affairs journals, they individually explore different concepts of foreign policy. I have 15 or 20 people who work with me very closely on foreign affairs. Their views are quite divergent. The fact that they may or may not have been involved in foreign policy decisions in the past is certainly no detriment to their ability to help me now."", ""Q. In some respects, your foreign policy seems similar to that established by Kissinger, Nixon and Ford, In fact, Kissinger stated that he didn't think your differences were substantial. How, precisely, does your view differ from theirs?"", ""Governor Carter. As I've said in my speeches, I feel the policy of detente has given up too much to the Russians and gotten too little in return. I also feel Kissinger has equated his own popularity with the so-called advantages of detente. As I've traveled and spoken with world leaders—Helmut Schmidt of West Germany, Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, various leaders in Japan—I've discerned a deep concern on their part that the United States has abandoned a long standing principle: to consult mutually, to share responsibility for problems. This has been a damaging thing. In addition, I believe we should have stronger bilateral relations with developing nations."", ""Q. What do you mean when you say we've given up too much to the Russians?"", ""Governor Carter. One example I've mentioned often is the Helsinki agreement. I never saw any reason we should be involved in the Helsinki meetings at all. We added the stature of our presence and signature to an agreement that, in effect, ratified the take-over of eastern Europe by the Soviet Union. We got very little, if anything, in return. The Russians promised they would honor democratic principles and permit the free movement of their citizens, including those who want to emigrate. The Soviet Union has not lived up to those promises and Mr. Brezhnev was able to celebrate the major achievement of his diplomatic life."", 'Q. Are you charging that Kissinger was too soft on the Russians?', 'Governor Carter. Kissinger has been in the position of being almost uniquely a spokesman for our nation. I think that is a legitimate role and a proper responsibility of the President himself. Kissinger has had a kind of Lone Ranger, secret foreign policy attitude, which almost ensures that there cannot be adequate consultation with our allies; there cannot be a long- range commitment to unchanging principles; there cannot be a coherent evolution on foreign policy; there cannot be a bipartisan approach with support and advice from Congress. This is what I would avoid as President and is one of the major defects in the Nixon-Ford foreign policy as expressed by Kissinger.', ""Q. Say, do you always do your own sewing? [This portion of the interview also took place aboard a plane. As he answered the interviewer's questions, Carter had been sewing a rip in his jacket with a needle and thread he carried with him]"", 'Governor Carter. Uh-huh. (He bit off the thread with his teeth.)', ""Q. Anyway, you said earlier that your foreign policy would exemplify your moral and ethical standards. Isn't there as much danger in an overly moralistic policy as in the kind that is too pragmatic?"", ""Governor Carter. I've said I don't think we should intervene militarily, but I see no reason not to express our approval, at least verbally, with those nations that develop democratically. When Kissinger says, as he did recently in a speech, that Brazil is the sort of government that is most compatible with ours—well, that's the kind of thing we want to change. Brazil is not a democratic government ; it's a military dictatorship. In many instances, it's highly repressive to political prisoners. Our government should justify the character and moral principles of the American people, and our foreign policy should not short-circuit that for temporary advantage. I think in every instance we've done that it's been counterproductive. When the CIA undertakes covert activities that might be justified if they were peaceful, we always suffer when they're revealed—it always seems as if we're trying to tell other people how to act. When Kissinger and Ford warned Italy she would be excluded from NATO if the Communists assumed power, that was the best way to make sure Communists were elected. The Italian voters resent it. A proper posture for our country in this sort of situation is to show, through demonstration, that our own government works properly, that democracy is advantageous, and let the Italian people make their own decisions."", 'Q. And what if the Communists in Italy had been elected in greater numbers than they were? What if they had actually become a key part of the Italian Government?', 'Governor Carter. I think it would be a mechanism for subversion of the strength of NATO and the cohesiveness that ought to bind European countries together. The proper posture was the one taken by Helmut Schmidt, who said that German aid to Italy would be endangered.', ""Q. Don't you think that constitutes a form of intervention in the democratic process of another nation?"", ""Governor Carter. No, I don't. I think that when the democratic nations of the world express themselves frankly and forcefully and openly, that's a proper exertion of influence. We did the same thing in Portugal. Instead of going in through surreptitious means and trying to overthrow the government when it looked like the minority Communist Party was going to assume power, the NATO countries as a group made it clear to Portugal what it would lose in the way of friendship, trade opportunities, and so forth. And the Portuguese people, recognizing that possibility, decided that the Communists should not lead their government. Well, that was legitimate exertion of influence, in my opinion. It was done openly and it was a mere statement of fact."", ""Q. You used the word subversion referring to communism. Hasn't the word changed since we used to throw words like that around? Aren't the west European Communist parties more independent of Moscow and more willing to respect democracy?"", ""Governor Carter. Yes, the world's changed. In my speeches, I've made it clear that as far as Communist leaders in such countries as Italy, France and Portugal are concerned, I would not want to close the doors of communication, consultation and friendship to them. That would be an almost automatic forcing of the Communist leaders into the Soviet sphere of influence. I also think we should keep open our opportunities for the East European nations— even those that are completely Communist—to trade with us, understand us, have tourist exchange and give them an. option from complete domination by the Soviet Union."", ""But again, I don't think you could expect West Germany to lend Poland two billion dollars—which was the figure in the case of Italy—when Poland is part of the Soviet government's satellite and supportive-nation group. So I think the best way to minimize totalitarian influence within the governments of Europe is to make sure the democratic forces perform properly. The major shift toward the Communists in Italy was in the local elections, when the Christian Democrats destroyed their reputation by graft and corruption. If we can make our own government work, if we can avoid future Watergates and avoid the activities of the CIA that have been revealed, if we can minimize joblessness and inflation, this will be a good way to lessen the inclination of people in other countries to turn away from our form of government."", 'Q. What about Chile? Would you agree that that was a case of the United States, through the CIA, intervening improperly?', ""Governor Carter. Yes. There's no doubt about it. Sure."", 'Q. And you would stop that sort of thing?', 'Governor Carter. Absolutely. Yes, sir.', 'Q. What about economic sanctions? Do you feel we should have punished the Allende government the way we did?', ""Governor Carter. That's a complicated question, because we don't know what caused the fall of the Allende government, the murder of perhaps thousands of people, the incarceration of many others. I don't have any facts as to how deeply involved we were, but my impression is that we were involved quite deeply. As I said, I wouldn't have done that if I were President. But as to whether or not we ought to have an option on the terms of our loans, repayment schedules, interest charges, the kinds of materials we sell to them— those are options I would retain depending upon the compatibility of a foreign government with our own."", 'Q. To what do you attribute all those deceptions and secret maneuvering through the years? Why were they allowed to happen?', ""Governor Carter. It was a matter of people's just saying, well, that's politics; w don't have a right to know what our government is doing; secrecy is OK; accepting gifts is OK; excluding the American people is OK. These are the kinds of things I want to change."", ""Q. It sounds as if you're saying Americans accepted indecency and lies in their government all too easily. Doesn't that make your constant campaign theme, invoking the decency and honesty of the American people, somewhat naive and ingenuous?"", ""Governor Carter. I say that the American people are basically decent and honest and want a truthful government. Obviously, I know there are people in this country, out of 214,000,000, who are murderers. There are people, maybe, who don't want a decent government Maybe there are people who prefer lies to truth. But I don't think it's simplistic to say that our government hasn't measured up to the ethical and moral standards of the people of this country. We've had better governments in the past and I think our people, as I've said many times, are just as strong, courageous and intelligent as they were 200 years ago. I think we still have the same inner strength they had then."", 'Q. Even though a lot of people support that feeling, many others think it makes you sound like an evangelist. And that makes it all the more confusing when they read about your hanging out with people so different from you in lifestyle and beliefs. Your publicized friendship with journalist Hunter Thompson, who makes no secret of his affinity for drugs and other craziness, is a good example.', 'Governor Carter. Well, in the first place, I\'m a human being. I\'m not a packaged article that you can put in a little box and say, ""Here\'s a Southern Baptist, an ignorant Georgia peanut farmer who doesn\'t have the right to enjoy music, who has no flexibility in his mind, who can\'t understand the sensitivities of an interpersonal relationship. He\'s gotta be predictable. He\'s gotta be for Calley and for the war. He\'s gotta be a liar. He\'s gotta be a racist.""', ""You know, that's the sort of stereotype people tend to assume, and I hope it doesn't apply to me. And I don't see any mystery about having a friendship with Hunter Thompson. I guess it's something that's part of my character and it becomes a curiosity for those who see some mystery about someone of my background being elected President I'm just a human being like everybody else. I have different interests, different understandings of the world around me, different relationships with different kinds of people. I have a broad range of friends: sometimes very serious, sometimes very formal, sometimes lighthearted, sometimes intense, sometimes casual."", 'Q. So when you find yourself at a rock concert or in some other situation that seems at odds with your rural, religious background, you never feel a sense of estrangement?', ""Governor Carter. None. No. I feel at home with 'em."", 'Q. How did you get to feel this way without going through culture shock?', ""Governor Carter. I have three sons who now range from 23 to 29, and the oldest of them were very influenced by Bob Dylan in their attitudes toward civil rights, criminal justice and the Vietnam War. This was about the period of time I was entering politics. I've been fairly close to my sons and their taste in music influenced my taste, and I was able to see the impact of Bob Dylan's attitudes on young people. And I was both gratified by and involved emotionally in those changes of attitudes."", 'Later, when I became governor, I was acquainted with some of the people at Capricorn Records in Macon—Otis Redding and others. It was they who began to meld the white and black music industries, and that was quite a sociological change for our region. So as I began to travel around Georgia, I made contact a few days every month or two with Capricorn Records, just to stay in touch with people in the state, .and got to know all the Allman Brothers, Dicky Betts and others. Later on, I met Charlie Daniels and the Marshall Tucker Band.', ""Then I decided to run for President I didn't have any money and didn't have any political base, so I had to depend substantially on the friends I already had. One of my potential sources for fund raising and for recruiting young volunteers was the group of recording stars I already knew. So we began to have concerts and I got to know them even better."", ""Of course, I've also been close to the country-music folks in Georgia, as well as the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. The first large contribution I got— $1000—was from Robert Shaw, the music director of the orchestra. We've been over at the Grand Ole Opry a few times and gotten to know people like Chubby Jackson and Tom T. Hall."", ""Q. There's been a lot of publicity about your relationship with Dylan, whom you quoted in your acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention. How did that come about?"", 'Governor Carter. A number of years ago, my second son, Chip, who was working full-time in our farming business, took a week off during Christmas. He and a couple of his friends drove all the way to New York—just to see Bob Dylan. There had been a heavy snowstorm and the boys had to park several miles from Dylan\'s home. It was after Dylan was injured, when he was in seclusion. Apparently, Dylan came to the door with two of his kids and shook hands with Chip. By the time Chip got to the nearest phone, a couple of miles away, and called us at home, he was nearly incoherent. Rosalynn couldn\'t understand what Chip was talking about, so she screamed, ""Jimmy, come here quick! Something\'s happened to Chip!""', ""We finally deciphered that he had shaken Dylan's hand and was just, you know, very carried away with it So when I read that Dylan was going on tour again, I wrote him a little personal note and asked him to come visit me at the governor's mansion. I think he checked with Phil Walden of Capricorn Records and Bill Graham to find out what kind of guy is this, and he was assured I didn't want to use him, I was just interested in his music."", ""The night he came, we had a chance to talk about his music and about changing times and pent-up emotions in young people. He said he didn't have any inclination to change the world, that he wasn't crusading and that his personal feelings were apparently compatible with the yearnings of an entire generation. We also discussed Israel, which he had a strong interest in. But that's my only contact with Bob Dylan, that night."", 'Q. That brings us back to the reason so many people find it hard to get a handle on you: On the one hand, your association with youth culture, civil rights and other liberal movements; on the other, your apparent conservatism on many issues. Would you care to put it in a nutshell for us?', ""Governor Carter. I'll try. On human rights, civil rights, environmental quality, I consider myself to be very liberal. On the management of government, on openness of government, on strengthening individual liberties and local levels of government, I consider myself a conservative. And I don't see that the two attitudes are incompatible."", ""Q. Then let's explore a few more issues. Not everyone is sure, for instance, what you mean by your call for tax reform. Does it mean that the burden will shift to corporations and upper income groups and away from the middle and low income groups, or are you talking merely about a simplified tax code?"", ""Governor Carter. It would involve both. One change I'm calling for is simplification, and the other involves shifting the income-tax burden away from the lower income families. But what I'm really talking about is total, comprehensive tax reform for the first time since the income tax was approved back in 1913,1 think it was."", ""It's not possible to give you a definitive statement on tax reform any time soon. It's going to take at least a year before we can come up with a new tax structure. But there are some general provisions that would be instituted that aren't there now. The income tax code, .which now comprises.40,000 pages, will be greatly simplified. Income should be taxed only once. We should have a true progressive income tax, so that the higher the income, the higher the percentage of taxation. I see no reason why capital gains should be taxed at half the rate of income from manual labor. I would be committed to a great reduction in tax incentives, loopholes or whatever you want to call them, which are used as mechanisms to solve transient economic problems; they ought to be on a basis of annual appropriation or a time limit, rather than be built into the tax structure."", 'In any case, these are five or six things that would be dramatic departures from what we presently have and they should tell you what side of the issue I stand on.', 'Q. Would one of those be increasing taxes for corporations especially the overseas and domestic profits of multinational corporations?', ""Governor Carter. No, I don't think so. Obviously, there have been provisions written into the law that favor certain corporations, including those that have overseas investments; I would remove those incentives. Tax laws also benefit those who have the best lobbying efforts, those who have the most influence in Washington, and the larger the corporations are, on the average, the smaller proportion they pay in taxes. Small businesses quite often pay the flat maximum rate, 48 percent, while some larger corporations pay as little as five or six percent. That ought to be changed."", ""But as far as increasing overall corporate taxes above the 50 percent level, I wouldn't favor that. We also have the circumstance of multinational corporations' depending on bribery as a mechanism for determining the outcome of a sale. I think bribery in international affairs ought to be considered a crime and punishable by imprisonment"", 'Q. Would you sympathize with the anticorporate attitude that many voters feel?', ""Governor Carter. Well, I'm not particularly anticorporate, but I'd say I'm more oriented to consumer protection. One of the things I've established throughout the campaign is the need to break up the sweetheart arrangement between regulatory agencies and the industries they regulate. Another is the need for rigid and enthusiastic enforcement of the antitrust laws."", ""Q. To take another issue, you favor a comprehensive federal health-care system. Why don't you just support the Kennedy-Corman bill, which provides for precisely that?"", ""Governor Carter. As a general philosophy, wherever the private sector can perform a function as effectively and efficiently as the government, I would prefer to keep it within the private sector. So I would like the insurance aspect of the health program to be carried out by employer/employee contribution. There would be contributions from the general fund for those who are indigent I would also have a very heavy emphasis on preventive health care, since I believe most of the major afflictions that beset people can be prevented or minimized. And I favor the use to a greater degree of nonphysicians, such as nurses, physicians' assistants, and so forth. Some of these things are in conflict with the provisions of the Kennedy-Corman bill."", 'Q. Let us ask you about one last stand: abortion.', ""Governor Carter. I think abortion is wrong and I will do everything I can as President to minimize the need for abortions—within the framework of the decision of the Supreme Court, which I can't change. Georgia had a more conservative approach to abortion, which I personally favored, but the Supreme Court ruling suits me all right. I signed a Georgia law as governor that was compatible with the Supreme Court decision."", ""Q. You think it's wrong, but the ruling suits you? What would we tell a woman who said her vote would depend on how you stood on abortion?"", ""Governor Carter. If a woman's major purpose in life is to have unrestricted abortions, then she ought not to vote for me. But she wouldn't have anyone to vote for."", 'Q. There seem to have been relatively few women in important staff positions in your campaign. Is that accurate?', 'Governor Carter. Women have been in charge of our entire campaign effort in Georgia and in New York State outside New York City. Also in Nebraska, Kansas, a third of the State of Florida and other areas.', 'Q. But whenever we hear about a meeting of top staff members, they almost always seem to be white males. Is that a failing in your organization?', ""Governor Carter. I don't know about a failing. The three people with whom I consult regularly—in addition to my wife—are white males: Hamilton Jordan, Jody Powell and Charles Kirbo. But we do have a lot of women involved in the campaign. We are now setting up a policy committee to run a nationwide effort to coordinate Democratic races and 50 percent of the members of this committee will be women. But Jody has been my press secretary since 1970, and Hamilton and Kirbo were my major advisors in 1966. It's such an extremely stable staff that there's been no turnover at all in the past five or six years. But we've made a lot of progress, I think, in including women, and I think you'll see more. '"", ""Q. You mention very frequently how much you count on your wife's advice. Isn't there a strain during the campaign, with the two of you separated so much of the time?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, when I was in the Navy, I was at sea most of the time and Fd see her maybe one or two nights a week. Now, when I'm home in Plains, I see her almost every night. And if I'm elected President, I'll sec her every night. So there is obviously a time to be together and a time to be separated. If you're apart three or four days and then meet again, it's almost—for me, it's a very exciting reunion. I'll have been away from Rosalynn for a few days and if I see her across an airport lobby, or across a street, I get just as excited as I did when I was, you know, 30 years younger."", ""We have a very close, very intimate sharing of our lives and we've had a tremendous magnification of our life's purposes in politics. Before 1966, she and I were both very shy. It was almost a painful thing to approach a stranger or make a speech. It's been a mutual change we've gone through, because we both felt it was worth while; so no matter what the outcome of the election, the relationship between Rosalynn and me will be very precious."", 'Q. Did you both have the usual share of troubles adjusting to marriage?', ""Governor Carter. We did at first. We've come to understand each other much better. I was by far the dominant person in the marriage at the beginning, but not anymore. She's just as strong, if not stronger than I am. She's fully equal to me in every way in our relationship, in making business decisions, and she makes most of the decisions about family affairs. And I think it was a struggle for her to achieve this degree of independence and equality in our personal relationship. So, to summarize, years ago we had a lot of quarrels—none serious, particularly—but now we don't."", 'Q. A lot of marriages are foundering these days. Why is yours so successful?', 'Governor Carter. Well, I really love Rosalynn more now than I did when I married her. And I have loved no other women except her. I had gone out with all kinds of girls, sometimes fairly steadily, but I just never cared about them. Rosalynn had been a friend of my sister\'s and was three years younger than I, which is a tremendous chasm in the high school years. She was just one of those insignificant little girls around the house. Then, when I was 21 and home from the Navy on leave, I took her out to a movie. Nothing extraordinary happened, but the next morning I told my mother, ""That\'s the girl I want to marry."" It\'s the best thing that ever happened to me.', ""We also share a religious faith, and the two or three times in our married life when we've had a serious crisis, I think that's what sustained our marriage and helped us overcome our difficulty. Our children, too, have been a factor binding Rosalynn and me together. After the boys, Amy came along late and it's been especially delightful for me, maybe because she's a little girl. ,"", ""Q. This is a tough question to ask, but because it's been such a factor in American political life, we wonder if you've ever discussed with Rosalynn the possibility of being assassinated. And, assuming you have, how do you deal with it in your own mind?"", ""Governor Carter. Well, in the first place, I'm not afraid of death. In the second place, it's the same commitment I made when I volunteered to go into the submarine force. I accepted a certain degree of danger when I made the original decision, then I didn't worry about it anymore. It wasn't something that preyed on my mind; it wasn't something I had to reassess every five minutes. There is a certain element of danger in running for President, borne out by statistics on the number of Presidents who have been attacked, but I have to say frankly that it's something I never worry about."", ""Q. Your first answer was that you don't fear death. Why not?"", ""Governor Carter. It's part of my religious belief. I just look at death as not a threat. It's inevitable, and I have an assurance of eternal life. There is no feeling on my part that I have to be President, or that I have to live, or that I'm immune to danger. It's just that the termination of my physical life is relatively insignificant in my concept of overall existence. I don't say that in a mysterious way; I recognize the possibility of assassination. But I guess everybody recognizes the possibility of other forms of death—automobile accidents, airplane accidents, cancer. I just don't worry."", ""Q. There's been some evidence that Johnson and Nixon both seemed to have gone a bit crazy while they were in the White House. Do you ever wonder if the pressures of the office might make anyone mentally unstable?"", ""Governor Carter. I really don't have the feeling that being in the White House is what caused Nixon's or Johnson's problems. Other Presidents have served without developing mental problems—Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, for instance. As far as I've been able to discern, President Ford approaches—or avoids—the duties of the White House with equanimity and self-assurance."", ""I think the ability to accept oneself and to feel secure and confident, to avoid any degree of paranoia, to face reality, these factors are fairly independent of whether or not one is President. The same factors would be important if someone were chief of police, or a schoolteacher, or a magazine editor. The pressure is greater on a President, obviously, than some of the jobs I've described, but I think the ability to accommodate pressure is a personal thing."", ""Q. We noticed your crack about President Ford's avoiding the duties of the White House. Do you agree with Senator Mondale's assessment, when he said shortly after the nomination that Ford isn't intelligent enough to be a good President?"", 'Governor Carter. Well, if you leave Mondale out of it, I personally think that President Ford is adequately intelligent to be President.', ""Q. And what about your presidency, if you're elected—will you have a dramatic first 1,000 days?"", ""Governor Carter. I would hope that my administration wouldn't be terminated at the end of 1000 days, as was the case with one administration. I'm beginning to meet with key leaders of Congress to evolve specific legislation to implement the Democratic Platform commitment. If I'm elected, there will be no delay in moving aggressively on a broad front to carry out the promises I've made to the American people. I intend to stick to everything I've promised."", ""Q. Thanks for all the time you've given us. Incidentally, do you have any problems with appearing in Playboy? Do you think you'll be criticized?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't object to that at all. I don't believe I'll be criticized."", ""[At the final session, which took place in the living room of Carter's home in Plains, the allotted time was up. A press aide indicated that there were other appointments for which Carter was already late, and the aide opened the front door while amenities were exchanged. As the interviewer and the Playboy editor stood at the door, recording equipment in their arms, a final seemingly casual question was tossed off. Carter then delivered a long, softly spoken monolog that grew in intensity as he made his final points. One of the journalists signaled to Carter that they were still taping, to which Carter nodded his assent.]"", ""Q. Do you feel you've reassured people with this interview, people who are uneasy about your religious beliefs, who wonder if you're going to make a rigid) unbending President?"", ""Governor Carter. I don't know if you've been to Sunday school here yet; some of the press has attended. I teach there about every three or four weeks. It's getting to be a real problem because we don't have room to put everybody now when I teach. I don't know if we're going to have to issue passes or what. It almost destroys the worship aspect of it. But we had a good class last Sunday. It's a good way to learn what I believe and what the Baptists believe."", ""One thing the Baptists believe in is complete autonomy. I don't accept any domination of my life by the Baptist Church, none. Every Baptist church is individual and autonomous. We don't accept domination of our church from the Southern Baptist Convention. The reason the Baptist Church was formed in this country was because of our belief in absolute and total separation of church and state. These basic tenets make us almost unique. We don't believe in any hierarchy in church. We don't have bishops. Any officers chosen by the church are defined as servants, not bosses. They're supposed to do the dirty work, make sure the church is clean and painted and that sort of thing. So it's a very good, democratic structure."", 'When my sons were small, we went to church and they went, too. But when they got old enough to make their own decisions, they decided when to go and they varied in their devoutness. Amy really looks forward to going to church, because she gets to see all her cousins at Sunday school. I never knew anything except going to church. My wife and I were born and raised in innocent times. The normal thing to do was to go to church.', 'What Christ taught about most was pride, that one person should never think he was any better than anybody else. One of the most vivid stories Christ told in one of his parables was about two people who went into a church. One was an official of the church, a Pharisee, and he said, ""Lord, I thank you that I\'m not like all those other people. I keep all your commandments, I give a tenth of everything I own. I\'m here to give thanks for making me more acceptable in your sight."" The other guy was despised by the nation, and he went in, prostrated himself on the floor and said, ""Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner. I\'m not worthy to lift my eyes to heaven."" Christ asked the disciples which of the two had justified his life. The answer was obviously the one who was humble.', ""The thing that's drummed into us all the time is not to be proud, not to be better than anyone else, not to look down on people but to make ourselves acceptable in God's eyes through our own actions and recognize the simple truth that we're saved by grace. It's just a free gift through faith in Christ This gives us a mechanism by which we can relate permanently to God. I'm not speaking for other people, but it gives me a sense of peace and equanimity and assurance."", 'I try not to commit a deliberate sin. I recognize that I\'m going to do it anyhow, because I\'m human and I\'m tempted. And Christ set some almost impossible standards for us. Christ said, ""I tell you that anyone who looks on a woman with lust has in his heart already committed adultery.""', ""I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times. This is something that God recognizes I will do—and I have done it—and God forgives me for it. But that doesn't mean that I condemn someone who not only looks on a woman with lust but who leaves his wife and shacks up with somebody out of wedlock."", ""Christ says, Don't consider yourself better than someone else because one guy screws a whole bunch of women while the other guy is loyal to his wife. The guy who's loyal to his wife ought not to be condescending or proud because of the relative degree of sinfulness. One thing that Paul Tillich said was that religion is a search for the truth about man's existence and his relationship with God and his fellow man; and that once you stop searching and think you've got it made—at that point, you lose your religion. Constant reassessment, searching in one's heart—it gives me a feeling of confidence."", ""I don't inject these beliefs in my answers to your secular questions."", '[Carter clenched his fist and gestured sharply.]', ""But I don't think I would ever take on the same frame of mind that Nixon or Johnson did—lying, cheating and distorting the truth. Not taking into consideration my hope for my strength of character, I think that my religious beliefs alone would prevent that from happening to me. I have that confidence. I hope it's justified.""]"

This is the last day of a long effort on my part and on your part which has been very exciting to me.\n"", ""We haven't had any serious disappointments. I think, win or lose tonight— and I think we have a good chance to win—we've made political history.

We've put ourselves on the same plane, on the same level, with the same understanding as other hundreds of millions of Americans around this country.

By letting others know that we have warm and open hearts, a sense of hope in times when many of us have been discouraged, and a sense that this country, in spite of serious disappointments in recent years, still has within its heart an inclination toward, and a capability for, excellence and greatness.\n"", ""We know that our financial or political or economic or social status doesn't amount to much. What matters is what we are within ourselves, how well we can exemplify those virtues of unselfishness and dedication, patriotism, hope, a sense of brotherhood or sisterhood with our fellow human beings. And a vision of how we can make our lives better as free people in the greatest country on earth.\n"", ""As we've been down through the long primary season, beginning the 19th of January with the caucuses in Iowa, and we surprised a lot of people, and in New Hampshire, the first primary, when we surprised a lot of people. Sometimes the same ones. And then quite often the same ones were surprised in Florida and the same ones were surprised in North Carolina and the same ones were surprised in Illinois and again in Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and many other states.\n"", ""But I think the thing that has been the cause for the surprise has been the intense dedication and hard work of so many different people. Quite often the eyes of the television camera and the attention of the newswriters were on me. But the campaign was being won by my family and by you. And this was kind of a secret weapon that we've had to bring us victories when quite often defeat was predicted for us.\n"", ""I don't know what the voters will do today. This is the only poll that counts. I feel good about it, as you know.

And you've corrected me when I've made a mistake. But you've never lost faith in me.
